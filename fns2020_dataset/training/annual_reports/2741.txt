EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WHOSE ACTIVITIES 
ARE FOCUSED ON SOUTH ASIA
Our interest in South Asia has been active for more than a decade where we are the 
biggest overseas exploration and production company currently operating in India. 
Our assets include three processing plants, 12 platforms, 250 kilometres of pipelines and 
several active drilling programmes. We have made more than 25 oil and gas discoveries 
and are now sitting on more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place in Rajasthan including 
the world class Mangala field, the biggest oil discovery in India for 22 years. To date we 
have made 17 discoveries in Rajasthan. 
Since establishing this new hydrocarbons basin we are wholly focused on strengthening our 
relationship with the Government of India, the State Government of Rajasthan, and ONGC 
to bring these resources into production as soon as possible, helping secure the energy 
needs of the third fastest growing economy in the world.
We believe our success has been made possible through strong external relationships and 
partnerships along with creative thinking, depth of knowledge and the experience of the 
employees, management and Board of the Company. We also believe our ability to work 
with and alongside the people of South Asia has strengthened our position immeasurably. 
Cairn’s entrepreneurial spirit, pioneering discoveries, conservative approach and long term 
production plans are helping answer the region’s energy security needs for the future.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 
Cairn consistently seeks to create value for its shareholders. 
It has achieved this by establishing a strong strategic position 
in South Asia, where it has made more than 25 oil and gas 
discoveries. In particular, the Company is ideally placed 
through its world class discoveries in Rajasthan to continue 
to play a part in the economic growth of the region.
Overview
For more than a decade Cairn has established a record in 
South Asia for first, finding hydrocarbons, and then 
developing these fields through to production on a fast track 
basis. Throughout this time the Company and its joint venture 
partners have invested more than $2 billion in a variety of 
exploration and production (E&P) projects that are helping to 
provide energy for the rapidly expanding economies of India 
and Bangladesh.
During 2005, Cairn grew apace to meet the task of developing 
the Mangala field against a backdrop of India emerging as an 
area of world focus for future industry activity and investment. 
Corporate
Following our recent successes in India and the consequential 
changing nature of the business we now believe the time is 
right to examine methods of increasing the local autonomy of 
our Indian business.
Various options available for realising shareholder value and 
for positioning the Company for new growth have been 
considered by the Cairn Board. Consistent with the long 
stated objective of adding and realising value for shareholders 
a review of the business has concluded that it is now an 
appropriate juncture to examine a partial initial public offering 
(IPO) of the Indian E&P business on the Bombay Stock 
Exchange, prior to first oil from Mangala and subject to 
market conditions. 
It is our view that a partial IPO of Cairn’s Indian business will 
reinforce the Company’s competitive business edge and 
established track record in India, at a time of tremendous 
future cash flow generation and so position it more effectively 
to maximise new investment opportunities in the rapidly 
expanding Indian market. Cairn will also examine methods of 
returning the substantial part of any cash proceeds to 
shareholders. Post any partial IPO, the rest of the business 
will continue to follow a strategy of adding shareholder value 
through material exploration.
 
Cairn will keep the market informed of any developments on 
the partial IPO. 
Stakeholders
Communication and interaction with stakeholders is given a 
high priority within Cairn. In November 2005 we hosted a visit 
to India for investors and analysts in order that they could see 
for themselves some of our producing assets and the ongoing 
operations in Rajasthan. The visit also allowed attendees to 
meet key people not only inside but also outside of the 
organisation, enabling them to witness first-hand the 
importance of the relationships Cairn has built up in South 
Asia and the positive approach the Government of India (GoI) 
takes to foreign investment. In the coming year the Board also 
plans to hold two of its regular meetings in India.
We have a number of community programmes in all of our 
operational areas across South Asia. The impact of our 
discoveries for Rajasthan is highly significant, not just in terms 
of revenues, but in terms of job creation and investment in and 
around the Barmer area. It was heartening for the Board to see 
the number of children going to school increasing in one 
location near the Mangala discovery because of the 
improvements Cairn has made to this school, including 
installation of solar panels on the school roof to generate 
electricity. Supporting numerous educational initiatives in 
Rajasthan has been a key focus as we start to build on the 
discoveries in the area.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Staff
The size of the recent Rajasthan discoveries has meant a 
significant step up in scale for the whole Cairn organisation. 
The pace of growth has meant integrating new staff and 
practices into the Company and this has been successfully 
achieved.
Cairn has opened a new Indian headquarters at Gurgaon on 
the outskirts of Delhi to provide improved support for the 
Rajasthan project team and to manage the Company’s 
business interests in India. Our people are our key asset and 
the vast majority of the Cairn workforce is indigenous to 
South Asia. 
The new staff development and performance review process 
implemented during 2005 provides an important framework 
for ensuring that all staff contribute to the success of the 
Company and continue to develop key competencies as 
we grow.
I would also like to record the Company’s congratulations to 
Sir Bill Gammell, Cairn’s Chief Executive, on the award of a 
Knighthood for services to industry in Scotland.
Outlook 
The Group’s focus on Rajasthan will continue as Cairn 
progresses the main fields from discovery to production. 
The challenge in the coming years is to build on the strong 
strategic position that Cairn has established in South Asia 
whilst capitalising on the opportunity to turn world class 
discoveries in Rajasthan into large scale developments, 
generating significant cash flow. 
The Group is well positioned to meet this challenge.

THE BOARD OF CAIRN IN INDIA In a little over two years, since discovering the world class 
Mangala ﬁ eld, we have explored the basin extensively and 
now believe there are more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in 
place within our Rajasthan acreage and this resource base 
can still grow. At current oil prices the Rajasthan ﬁ elds are 
capable of generating many billions of dollars of revenue 
over the project life for Cairn, the State of Rajasthan and the 
Government of India (GoI), whilst also helping to meet India’s 
growing import requirements.
Overview
Cairn is making good progress in Rajasthan, with various key 
milestones being achieved over the last few months. The Field 
Development Plans (FDPs) for the Mangala, Aishwariya, 
Saraswati and Raageshwari fields have been agreed by the 
joint venture Operating Committee (OC) and are awaiting 
final approval. These approvals are a precursor to formal 
sanctioning of the project by the Cairn Board which is 
anticipated during Q2 2006. The initial development 
investment for Mangala and Raageshwari gas by the joint 
venture to first oil is estimated to be in the region of $800 
million and we are on track to have financing in place to fund 
our share of the project. 
Our estimate of the Rajasthan reserve base for the three main 
northern fields (Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya) has grown 
significantly. We believe these reserves can be further 
increased by applying enhanced oil recovery (EOR) 
techniques to reach our current estimated gross resource 
base of 795 million barrels of oil (mmbbls). The combined 
southern fields estimated gross reserve base is 102 mmboe 
of which 42 mmboe is attributed to Raageshwari gas. This 
results in a combined resource base of 897 mmboe with 
further potential upside in fields with low permeability 
reservoirs. The evaluation of many of these fields continues 
and only for those fields under active development planning 
have initial reserves been currently booked.
Only 18 months ago we said the key fields in Rajasthan 
(Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya) could produce between 
60,000 and 100,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd). Today we 
believe that these discoveries have the potential to produce 
at a peak of 150,000 bopd.
Primarily as a result of the growth in the reserve base and the 
requirement to tie in additional discoveries but also as a result 
of global factors such as delays in availability of equipment 
and services, and shortages of skilled labour, Cairn currently 
considers the most likely start up date for Mangala is now 
in 2008.
Cairn has clear alignment with the GoI to bring the nationally 
important Rajasthan fields on stream as soon as possible in 
order to help meet the country’s energy needs. With the GoI 
projecting an economic and gross domestic product growth 
for India of up to 10% per annum, current estimates for crude 
oil imports, according to the GoI, will rise from 70% to 85% by 
2020. The GoI is highly supportive of both international and 
domestic oil companies increasing E&P efforts to augment 
current production.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Sir Bill Gammell
Chief Executive
It is our vision to establish commercial reserves from 
strategic positions in high potential exploration plays 
resulting in the creation and delivery of shareholder wealth. 
We focus on material opportunities that are capable of 
providing real growth to the Cairn Group. Our focus on 
South Asia has already resulted in a number of oil and gas 
discoveries and still offers the prospect of signiﬁ cant further 
value creation.
Our edge is the ability to combine our commercial and 
technical expertise and experience to leverage value from 
material opportunities. Every part of the Cairn Group is 
concentrated on supporting that expertise to ensure that 
we are creating and realising value from the successful 
implementation of our strategy. We encourage innovation 
and teamwork as key values in the process.
OUR VISION, FOCUS AND EDGE
4
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 
  Growing the value of the Company 
OUR FOCUS IS... Results
Cairn has implemented IFRS in 2005 and has also adopted a 
successful efforts based accounting policy in preparing its 
2005 Annual Report & Accounts. Comparative figures have 
been restated to reflect these revised accounting policies. 
Cairn is also reporting its financial results in US dollars for the 
first time as this aligns the presentational currency of the 
Group’s financial statements with the principal underlying 
functional currency of the business. 
Average daily entitlement production for 2005 was 28,240 
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2004: 22,789 boepd).
The 2005 results include the first full year of production from 
the 37 .5% interest in Sangu acquired from Shell (transaction 
completion date 30 June 2004). Field deliverability from both 
Sangu and Lakshmi has been enhanced following successful 
infill drilling campaigns in the latter part of 2004. Due to the 
Group’s current entitlement production being heavily gas 
biased and the existence of contractual caps on the price 
received for this gas, the average price realised for 2005 was 
$25.44 per boe (2004: $24.06 per boe).  Revenue for the year 
was $262.6m (2004 restated: $172.9m). 
Operating profit (pre exceptional items) and operating cash 
flows were $55.6m and $139.6m respectively (2004: $12.8m 
loss and $138.5m). The exceptional gain on sale of $15.3m 
arising in 2005 was in relation to the ONGC transaction that 
completed in March 2005, realising $135m gross proceeds. 
The Group made a profit for the year of $79.1m (2004 
restated: loss $15.7m). 
Initial Rajasthan reserves for Mangala, Saraswati and 
Raageshwari oil have been booked at the year end. As the 
depletion and decommissioning charge is calculated on a 
field basis no charges arise in the Income Statement until 
production commences. Exploration / appraisal costs 
associated with the booked reserves have been transferred 
to development / producing assets.
At the year end the Group had net funds of $95.5m 
(2004: net funds $138.3m). The Group currently has $240m 
of unutilised unsecured revolving credit facilities. Following 
Cairn’s discoveries in Rajasthan, the Group is currently 
progressing the refinancing of its debt facilities required to 
fund the associated developments. 
Outlook
With a substantial increase in the reserve base for the 
northern fields in Rajasthan and a growing resource base we 
believe now is the time to examine the potential to create two 
world class businesses, one based in the United Kingdom and 
one in India.
 
In the coming year an evaluation of the potential for a partial 
IPO of the Group’s Indian operations will be a key activity.
 
The future offers us challenges and opportunities and we 
always work in a spirit of partnership and co-operation with 
Governments and our joint venture partners. Cairn has a clear 
and consistent strategy and, with the growing industry and 
investment interest in South Asia, has an optimal opportunity 
to capitalise on its competitive edge. 
Sir Bill Gammell

RAJASTHAN BLOCK (RJ-ON-90/1) 
IN GREATER DETAIL
“ Based on its peak potential Mangala has 
the ability to be one of the top 100 oil 
producing fields in the world.“
Sir Bill Gammell, Chief Executive
Cairn ﬁ rst came into Rajasthan in 1997 but despite some 
early technical success, it was only in mid 2003 when we had 
acquired the full 100% of the equity that we were able to 
control the pace and extent of our exploration effort. From 
the beginning we believed that the key ingredients for 
commercial success were present but it took perseverance 
and more than a dozen wells to zero in on the oil fairway 
which enabled us, more than two years ago, to discover ﬁ rst 
the Mangala ﬁ eld, and then the Aishwariya and Bhagyam 
ﬁ elds which collectively will underpin a project that could 
produce 150,000 bopd. We now believe there is in excess 
of 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place on our acreage, with the 
potential for further discoveries. 
In 1997 Cairn acquired a 10% interest in a large block in 
Rajasthan, as part of a wider transaction including interests 
in Bangladesh. Cairn increased its stake to 27.5% prior to 
the drilling of the ﬁ rst exploration well in 1998. Cairn’s 
partner was discouraged by the result, but Cairn saw 
additional potential and increased its stake to 50% and 
drilled a second well which proved to be a discovery. 
This discovery was approximately 200 miles away from 
any previously known oil, a classic high risk, wildcat well. 
Between 1999 and 2001 Cairn sought unsuccessfully to 
persuade its partners to drill additional wells although one 
additional well which was a discovery was drilled in 2001.
In 2003 Cairn successfully acquired the remaining 50% 
equity interest in Rajasthan for $7.25m. During 2003 
Cairn drilled 14 wells of which 10 successfully encountered 
hydrocarbons although none were of signiﬁ cant commercial 
value. 
It was with the 16th well drilled in this basin, after a total 
expenditure on the licence of approximately $100m, that 
Cairn discovered Mangala; the biggest discovery in India 
for more than 20 years.
The total of oil and gas discoveries on the block have now 
reached 17 with more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place.
Mangala, Bhagyam and Ashwariya in the northern section of 
the block will form the focus of the future development with 
the other discoveries feeding into the development system 
that will be put in place in the coming years.
Cairn’s efforts over the past two years have demonstrated 
the world class potential of its Rajasthan acreage. The large 
discoveries in Rajasthan are continuing to get bigger and 
now have the potential to produce 150,000 bopd. 
Production from Mangala is the ﬁ rst step in the process and 
Cairn’s development team are focused on realising this 
potential in due course.

Cairn’s gross operated production across South Asia during 
2005 was 105,800 boepd (net entitlement 28,240 boepd).
The majority of Cairn’s operational activity in the last three 
years has been focused on the exploration and appraisal of 
its Rajasthan block in North West India. This effort has 
resulted in the discovery of 17 ﬁ elds including the world class 
Mangala and Bhagyam oilﬁ elds in the northern part of the 
block. To date, more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place 
have been discovered on the acreage, and the FDPs for 
four ﬁ elds namely Mangala, Aishwariya, Saraswati and 
Raageshwari are awaiting ﬁ nal approval from the GoI. The 
present focus is to bring Mangala on stream at the earliest 
opportunity and based on the Cairn Board sanctioning the 
project in Q2 2006, the target date for ﬁ rst commercial 
production has been revised to 2008. 
It is intended to start production from the southern Rajasthan 
ﬁ elds, Saraswati and Raageshwari, in Q2 and Q3 this year 
respectively, subject to obtaining all the required regulatory 
consents.
RAJASTHAN BASIN – NORTH WEST INDIA
Overview
Cairn operates Block RJ-ON-90/1 under a Production Sharing 
Contract (PSC) signed on 15 May 1995. The original seven 
year exploration period of the PSC, which had been extended 
for a further three year period, expired in May 2005. Currently 
the Contract Area is divided into four areas, namely: 
   The Development Area (1,858 km
2
), which includes 
Mangala, Aishawariya, Saraswati and Raageshwari. This 
area is secured under a long term production contract, 
which currently runs to May 2020. However, the PSC 
envisages extensions to the production term by mutual 
consent between the Contractor and the GoI. The FDPs 
have been submitted on the basis of an extension of the 
term to at least 2041.
   The Extended Development Area (1,228 km
2
), which 
includes the Bhagyam, N-I, Shakti and N-E fields. 
Operating Committee (OC) approval was given in February 
2006 for this area and GoI approval is pending.
    A northern Appraisal Area (2,884 km
2
). An 18 month 
extension for these areas was granted to 14 November 
2006.
   A southern Exploration Area (1,935 km
2
). An application 
for an 18 month extension has been submitted.
The combined gross proved plus probable (2P) oil in place 
estimate for the three northern fields of Mangala, Bhagyam 
and Aishwariya as submitted in documents to the GoI during 
2005, was 1,614 mmbbls with associated 2P reserves of 502 
mmbbls. These figures were slightly revised at the 2005 
Interims to 1,661 mmbbls and 514 mmbbls respectively on 
account of a revision to Bhagyam. However, continued 
evaluation, further appraisal drilling, re-interpretation of three 
dimensional (3D) seismic and evaluation of new core data have 
led to a more significant upwards revision of all three fields. 
The current combined gross 2P oil in place estimate is 1,859 
mmbbls with an associated gross 2P reserve estimate of 606 
mmbbls. In addition, there is also an estimated gross 
contingent resource of 189 mmbbls obtainable from these 
three fields as a result of applying standard EOR or tertiary 
recovery techniques. This results in a total combined gross 
2P reserves plus EOR resource estimate of 795 mmbbls for 
the three fields.
A further nine fields: Shakti, Saraswati, Raageshwari oil, 
Raageshwari gas, N-I, N-E, Guda, Kameshwari and GS-V are 
at various stages of appraisal but are currently estimated to 
contain combined gross 2P oil in place of 724 mmboe with an 
associated gross 2P reserve estimate of 102 mmboe, of which 
42 mmboe is attributed to Raageshwari gas.
In summary, this results in a current total 2P reserve plus EOR 
resource estimate for the majority of the Rajasthan fields 
discovered to date of 897 mmboe.

In addition the fields Vijaya, Vandana, N-R, Mangala Barmer 
Hill and Aishwariya Barmer Hill are estimated to contain 
significantly more than 1 billion barrels of oil in place. The 
evaluation of these fields is ongoing but recoveries are 
anticipated to be less than 10%.
Development Area – Northern Fields 
(Cairn 70 % (Operator); ONGC 30%)
In October 2004, Cairn was granted a single Development 
Area of 1,858 km
2
 covering 12 of the discoveries made to date. 
In January 2005, the GoI exercised its right under the PSC to 
back-in for 30% of the Development Area and appointed 
ONGC as its equity nominee. 
The Mangala oil in place volumes and reserves continue to 
grow. The Mangala-7 and Mangala-7ST appraisal wells 
established the precise position of the western boundary 
fault and more importantly detailed core analysis has 
demonstrated a significant increase in oil saturations over 
previous log based estimates. Both these factors have led to 
an increase in volume estimates. 
   The current gross 2P oil in place estimates and 2P reserves 
for Mangala are 1,202 mmbbls and 428 mmbbls 
respectively, which are 12.2% and 16.3% above the FDP 
estimates. 
    The current gross 2P oil in place estimates and 2P reserves 
for Aishwariya are 249 mmbbls and 56 mmbbls respectively, 
which are 16.9% and 16.7% above the FDP estimates.
    A further gross 120 mmbbls and 20 mmbbls are estimated 
to be recoverable through EOR techniques on Mangala and 
Aishwariya respectively. This gives a current estimated 
resource base for Mangala of 548 mmbbls and 76 mmbbls 
for Aishwariya.
   DeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M), the independent auditor 
of reserves, estimates gross 2P oil in place for Mangala of 
1,206 mmbbls and 2P reserves (to 2025) of 337 mmbbls; 
and gross 2P oil in place for Aishwariya of 281 mmbbls and 
2P reserves (to 2025) of 61.7 mmbbls. D&M estimate a 
further contingent resource associated with EOR of 120 
mmbbls for Mangala and 20 mmbbls for Aishwariya.
Cairn continues to make progress on preparatory work for 
the development of the Mangala field and subject to GoI 
approval of the FDP anticipates giving project sanction in 
Q2 2006. As a result of the growth in the reserve base and the 
requirement to tie in additional discoveries along with global 
increases in costs and availability of equipment and services 
the development schedule has changed. Currently it is 
considered that the most likely start up date for Mangala 
is during 2008. 
Initially, it was planned to develop Aishwariya concurrently 
with Mangala, but the discovery of the Bhagyam and N-I fields 
has necessitated a review of the optimal development 
schedule. The development of the other fields is aimed at 
establishing the optimal sequence for attaining the target 
production rate of 150,000 bopd and is still under review. 
Subject to obtaining the relevant approvals it is currently 
intended that Bhagyam will be the second northern field to 
be developed.
The overall development concept involves the construction 
of a central processing facility (CPF) at Mangala supplied by 
group gathering stations, with oil production and water 
injection wells being drilled from a number of well pads. 
The CPF and associated Mangala facilities will initially be 
sized to handle up to 120,000 bopd with near term expansion 
to handle approximately 150,000 bopd for all of the main 
northern fields (Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya). The 
produced hydrocarbons will be treated at this facility, with 
any treated produced water being re-injected. 
The detailed design and engineering contract for the Mangala 
production and treatment facilities was awarded to Mustang 
Engineering in Houston, a subsidiary of Wood Group, in 
Q4 2005. 
In January 2006, the Rajasthan State Government gave 
permission for Cairn to extract local saline groundwater as 
part of the field developments. This saline groundwater will 
be injected into the oil producing reservoirs for pressure 
maintenance and reservoir management purposes. Other 
pre-sanction critical path activities, including environmental 
clearance and land acquisition, are also well advanced. 
Development Area – Southern Fields 
(Cairn 70% (Operator); ONGC 30%)
Discoveries in the central and southern part of the 
Development Area include the Saraswati, Raageshwari and 
Guda fields. Development plans for the first two fields were 
approved by the joint venture OC in December 2005 and 
we await final approval from the GoI. The FDP for Guda is 
expected to be submitted in mid 2006. The oil in these 
southern fields is in a variety of different reservoirs which 
are of lesser quality than those in the northern fields. 
Nevertheless, wells such as Raageshwari-6, which flowed 
at 550 bopd of 38 degree API oil on a natural flow test, 
show the producing potential of these reservoirs.
“ In just over two years we have established 
in excess of 900 mmboe of oil and gas 
resources in Rajasthan.”
Dr Mike Watts, Exploration Director
“ Cairn’s Rajasthan discoveries have 
increased its reserves to production ratio 
to among one of the highest in the 
industry.”
Phil Tracy, Engineering & Operations Director 12
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 
The first commercial production from the Saraswati and 
Raageshwari fields subject to GoI approval of the FDPs is 
expected in Q2 and Q3 2006 respectively. The initial 
combined target plateau rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 
bopd will be constrained by having to export the produced oil 
via road tanker. The actual production rates achieved will 
depend on how well the logistics of a road tanker export 
scheme can be optimised. However, once the Mangala export 
infrastructure is installed, it is planned that the Saraswati and 
Raageshwari fields as well as other southern discoveries will 
be tied in to the export system. 
Detailed mapping and core analysis work continues on the 
Vijaya, Vandana and N-R-4 discoveries, integrating the results 
from the latest wells into the interpretation. The Vijaya and 
Vandana core data confirms the poor quality and 
heterogeneous nature of the reservoirs encountered in these 
discoveries to date. 
Extended Development Area (Cairn currently 100%)
The Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) for the Bhagyam and 
Shakti fields was approved by the OC on 1 February 2006 and 
submitted to the Management Committee (MC) for review 
and approval. This is the first step in the development 
approval process under the PSC. The DoC contains a 
proposed Development Area extension of 1,228 km
2
 to cover 
the Bhagyam, N-I, Shakti and N-E fields. Once the MC has 
approved the DoC, work will begin on the Bhagyam and 
Shakti FDP , which is expected to be submitted mid 2006.
The estimates of the Bhagyam in place volumes and reserves 
continue to grow as the evaluation progresses. The 
Bhagyam-5, 6 and 7 appraisal wells encountered the reservoir 
structurally higher than anticipated and the ongoing core 
evaluation work also indicates that the initial estimates of oil 
saturations were too conservative. Both of these factors 
increase the estimates of hydrocarbons in place.

   The current gross 2P oil in place estimates and 2P reserves 
for Bhagyam are 408 mmbbls and 122 mmbbls respectively, 
which are 23.6% and 41.9% above the DoC estimates of 330

upgraded at the interim results from the DOC figures to 
377 mmbbls and 98 mmbbls.
    A further gross 49 mmbbls is estimated to be recoverable 
through EOR techniques on Bhagyam. This gives a current 
estimated resource base for Bhagyam of 171 mmbbls.
   D&M estimate gross 2P oil in place for Bhagyam of 557 
mmbbls and 2P reserves (to 2025) of 156 mmbbls. D&M 
estimate a further contingent resource associated with EOR 
of 56 mmbbls for Bhagyam.
The Bhagyam-5 well tested gas from the Barmer Hill 
formation, confirming the existence of a small gas cap

Northern Appraisal Area (Cairn 100%)
In June 2005, Cairn was granted an 18 month extension to 
complete its appraisal activities in three areas covering 
2,884 km
2
, to the north and west of the Development Area. 
An extensive 3D seismic programme is planned in the 
southern part of this appraisal area, south of the Barmer 
airbase. Seismic acquisition will commence in April 2006, 
followed by early drilling, given the November 2006 deadline 
for completion of activities. In addition, an exploration well on 
the northern end of the large airbase structure is planned for 
Q2 2006, pending environmental clearances.

The world class oil discovery at Mangala in early 2004 
has not only transformed the fortunes of Cairn but, more 
importantly, it will also lead to investment in Rajasthan 
bringing oil and gas revenues both to the State and to 
the Central Government. Cairn recognises that energy 
security is one of the top three goals of the Indian 
Government. 
India has an annual oil import bill of over $20 billion.

Reservoir Stimulation Programme
A programme of hydraulic fracture stimulation has recently 
commenced on the Raageshwari deep gas accumulation. 
Preliminary post fracture well results are expected to be 
available in April 2006, although full evaluation of these well 
stimulation treatments is expected to take several months. 
Gas from these wells will be utilised as fuel for the Mangala 
development and subsequent northern area developments.
The stimulation programme will continue with fracture 
stimulation of the Barmer Hill formation in two wells at 
Mangala and Aishwariya, with the objective of investigating 
and unlocking the additional resource potential of this 
formation.
The Vijaya, Vandana and N-R fields are also potential 
candidates for fracture stimulation.
Oil Sales and Export
Under the terms of the PSC, Cairn is obligated to sell the 
crude to the GoI until India is self sufficient and the GoI has 
the right to appoint a nominee to take delivery of the oil. 
In September 2005, MRPL (a subsidiary of ONGC) was 
nominated by the GoI to purchase the entire crude produced 
from the block, in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
the PSC.
The construction of the export system is the responsibility of 
the GoI through its nominated buyer. One of the options is to 
take the produced oil via an insulated pipeline to the coast, 
where it will be dispatched to selected Indian refineries. Cairn 
has conducted a risk assessment of the likely construction 
schedule and has incorporated this into its own risk 
assessment of the date of the Mangala field start-up.
MRPL has indicated that it may subsequently consider the 
establishment of an in-situ refinery.

Right from the beginning at Cairn we have actively 
encouraged all our people to put their thoughts on 
the table. 
Consider for a second that in the early 1990s major oil 
companies had drilled over 8,000 wells in South East Asia, 
but only 12 exploration wells had been drilled in India. 
Dr Mike Watts, our Exploration Director, identified this key 
fact which was a huge factor in our decision to invest in 
India’s massive untapped potential. Thus, India met our 
’vision’ criteria with more than 20 unexplored basins to 
offer our bright, skilful and creative explorationists 
unlimited opportunities to apply their ideas.

(Cairn 40% (Operator))
Development & Production
The second phase of Lakshmi development drilling and the 
installation of onshore booster compression were completed 
in the first half of 2005. The programme successfully restored 
gas deliverability to meet the maximum daily quantities 
specified under the gas sales contracts. 
At both Lakshmi and Gauri there are oil-bearing reservoirs 
beneath the producing gas and condensate reservoirs. These 
oil reservoirs are not thought to be well connected and the 
current plan therefore envisages each accumulation being 
developed independently. The first of these accumulations is 
being developed via the GA-3 Gauri oil well, which was 
commissioned in November 2005. The future performance of 
this well will be important in determining the oil reserves in 
Gauri and it will also help in the assessment of the potential of 
the more extensive oil reservoirs at Lakshmi, where oil 
production has been targeted within the next 12 months.

The Gauri oil is transported concurrently with the gas and 
condensate to the Suvali gas processing plant where it is 
separated out. Average liquids production was 2,100 bopd in 
December 2005 and 2,800 bopd in January 2006. The 
facilities have been tested to a peak production of 4,800 bopd 
for a short period and demonstrated that the modifications 
made to the gas processing facilities at Suvali have been 
successful in handling these oil production rates. The GA-3 oil 
production rate is currently constrained by the limitations of 
exporting the oil and produced condensate (associated with 
the gas production) by road tanker. Studies are under way to 
review alternative ways of exporting the produced oil from the 
oil storage facilities on a long term basis and to examine 
increasing the oil handling facilities at the plant to 7 ,500 bopd.
The onshore CB-X gas discovery (made in January 2005) has 
been declared commercial and a single well development 
plan has been submitted for approval. Field activities to lay a 
short pipeline from the Suvali plant to connect the CB-X-1 well 
are planned to commence in the first half of 2006 and first gas 
at rates between 4 and 5 million standard cubic feet of gas per 
day (mmscfd) is expected in the second half of 2006. 
The Ambe gas field, to the west of Lakshmi and Gauri, was 
discovered in January 2001, declared commercial by the OC 
in January 2006 and submitted for MC approval. Various 
development options for Ambe are currently being evaluated. 
As with Lakshmi and Gauri, the Ambe gas field lies above 
oil-bearing reservoirs.

Cairn goes from discovery to production.
We have believed from the beginning that the key 
ingredients for commercial success were present in 
Rajasthan. It took perseverance and more than a dozen 
wells to zero in on the oil fairway. This enabled us to 
discover first the Mangala field, and then the Aishwariya 
and Bhagyam fields, which collectively could underpin a 
150,000 bopd production project with significant 
potential to further develop the area. 
We now believe there is in excess of 3.5 billion barrels of 
oil in place on our acreage. Taking into account the full 
value chain from wellhead to refinery, the total investment 
in all elements of this project is anticipated to be several 
billions of dollars with Cairn playing an important catalytic 
role in the investment.

well programme to extend the plateau rate was planned for 
Q4 2005. There was a delay in obtaining the required drilling 
approvals and combined with the reduced availability of 
offshore drilling rigs has resulted in the rescheduling of the 
infill drilling campaign to June 2006. Subject to the availability 
of a drilling rig and the associated services further drilling is 
expected to take place later in the year.

BENGAL BASIN – BANGLADESH
Overview
The Block 16 PSC was signed in 1994 and the Sangu gas field 
was discovered offshore in the Bay of Bengal in 1996. This 
field was subsequently developed and delivered the first gas 
into Chittagong in 1998. Today Sangu delivers approximately 
75% of the gas demand of Chittagong and the surrounding 
area whilst continuing to achieve world class performance in 
operational safety and field uptime. 
Sangu (Cairn 75% (Operator)) 
Development & Production
Sangu gas production is processed at the Chillimpur 
processing plant, which recently achieved six million man-
hours without incurring any lost time injuries or environmental 
incidents since 1998. This, together with the ISO 14001 
certification, is a significant health and safety achievement. 
In 2004 / 2005, the Sangu joint venture partners invested $50 
million in a second phase of development of the field, drilling 
an additional three producing gas wells to sustain and extend 
gas production.  
The Sangu infill drilling programme was successful in 
increasing the field deliverability but also indicated that the 
field is structurally more complex than previously thought 
(Sangu is not covered by a 3D seismic survey) and requires the 
drilling of further wells to maintain plateau production. Cairn 
has received approval from its joint venture partners and 
PetroBangla to begin an offshore drilling programme at the 
end of 2006. A contract for a drilling rig has been signed and 
it is currently planned to drill a further Sangu infill well and a 
South Sangu appraisal well in the more favourable weather 
period of late 2006 / early 2007 in the Bay of Bengal. 
The decision to develop South Sangu will depend on the 
appraisal well results.

An exploration well on the Hatia prospect is planned as part of 
the winter 2006 / 2007 infill and exploration drilling campaign 
in the Bay of Bengal.

Exploration
Cairn continues to evaluate the exploration potential of its 
acreage in southern Bangladesh and of particular interest is 
the large Char Jabbar prospect in Block 10.
Block 7 
Cairn is awaiting formal approval from the Government of 
Bangladesh for the assignment of a 45% interest in Block 7 
from Chevron the Operator. Chevron is currently acquiring 
a two dimensional (2D) seismic survey over Block 7 .
GROUP PRODUCTION
The Group’s entitlement production for 2005 was 28,240 
boepd net to Cairn compared to 22,789 boepd in 2004. 
Current production is in line with the Company’s 
expectations. 
 
Due to Cairn’s current gas biased production mix and the 
existence of contractual caps on the price received, the 
average price realised for 2005 was $25.44 per boe 
(2004: $24.06).
GROUP RESERVES
The FDPs for Mangala, Aishwariya, Saraswati and Raageshwari 
fields in Rajasthan were approved by the OC in December 
2005 and are currently awaiting GoI approval. The associated 
net entitlement 2P reserves until May 2020 for Mangala, 
Saraswati and Raageshwari have now been booked based on 
the expectation that the Cairn Board approval for project 
sanction will be granted in Q2 2006. Aishwariya reserves will 
be booked at a later date once the development schedule is 
finalised. No resources attributable to EOR have been booked 
as they are still at the screening stage. Similarly, the 
Raageshwari deep gas reserves are also not booked since this 
gas will be used as fuel for the development of Mangala and 
the other northern fields.

The Development Area production term in each FDP assumes 
production until 2041 as permissible under the PSC. Once the 
FDPs are approved Cairn will be seeking separate and specific 
Government confirmation of the production term running to 
at least 2041 before transferring these additional resources to 
booked reserves.
 
At this point no reserves associated with Bhagyam have been 
booked. The DoC for Bhagyam and Shakti was approved by 
the OC in February 2006 and is awaiting MC approval. The 
Bhagyam FDP is expected to be submitted to the GoI later in 
2006.
 
The analysis of the Sangu field performance in 2005 has led to 
a reduction in the current main field Sangu 2P gas reserves of 
67 billion standard cubic feet of gas (bscf). 
In addition, the decision to further appraise the South Sangu 
discovery prior to sanctioning the development, results in a 
further de-booking of 155 bscf from Sangu reserves. 
 
The estimated remaining gross 2P reserves for Sangu at the 
end of 2005 are 378 bscf (2004: 654 bscf) and the net 
remaining entitlement reserves are estimated at 177 bscf 
(2004: 308 bscf) which, after allowing for 2005 production, 
represents a 36% reduction in remaining reserves.
Separately, Cairn has engaged D&M to provide independent 
estimates of reserves. D&M has now concluded recent reviews 
(within the last 12 months) of all the Company’s producing 
properties and major assets. The D&M estimates for Rajasthan 
reserves (to 2025 as provided in the PSC by mutual agreement 
with the GoI) are tabulated above.

Corporate Responsibility – what does it mean to Cairn?
We aim to make a positive difference wherever we work and 
Cairn has a vision of its Corporate Responsibility (CR) which is 
encapsulated in the ’3 Rs’ – Respect, Relationships and 
Responsibility.
Respect – People are Cairn's key asset and the attitude of the 
Cairn team is critical to our business culture. In our India and 
Bangladesh assets we complement local knowledge and 
expertise with the additional wider perspective that Cairn can 
bring from a team of people who have worked in most of the 
oil and gas provinces in the world. 
Relationships – Relationships are the key to developing any 
business and Cairn’s success in South Asia would not be 
possible without the consistent support we have enjoyed. 
Relationships are all important, whether with people living 
next to a drill site in Rajasthan in India or officials and 
politicians making decisions in Bangladesh. 
Responsibility – We have a responsibility to manage the 
expectations of the people who are affected by Cairn’s 
operations. Operating in any country is only possible when 
values are shared. We believe that our core values of integrity, 
social and environmental responsibility, teamwork and 
nurturing of individuals, creativity, risk management and 
alliances with key partners are all ingredients that are central 
to our success. Cairn is operating in areas that are 
economically, socially and environmentally sensitive and as 
such the Company needs to take due recognition of these 
challenges when developing plans.
Our Approach to CR
As a company grows it becomes more visible and accountable 
to numerous interested parties ranging from governments 
and shareholders, to staff and to those who live in the vicinity 
of our operations. Cairn recognises that it is essential for our 
long term success that CR is part of the way we do business. 
While ultimate responsibility for CR performance lies with the 
Board, management responsibility and accountability has 
been delegated to specific executive directors,  who are 
supported by group functional managers with expertise in 
each of the areas covered by CR. A Group CSR Committee, 
comprising both executive directors and group functional 
managers, has also been in place since 2003 to inform the 
Board and management on strategic direction and setting of 
policies on CR matters within the Group. 
The Board are provided with regular updates on CR matters 
and performance. This includes presentations on CR matters 
by external specialists. For example, a human rights specialist 
provided an overview of the ‘rights-aware approach’ to 
addressing human rights issues at the January 2006 Board 
meeting.
CR risks, along with other business risks, are managed through 
implementation of our risk management strategy, through 
which we regularly and systematically identify, analyse, assess, 
treat and monitor CR risks faced at the asset, country and 
Group levels.
Group Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), Security and 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policies have been in 
place since 2002 and in 2004 we also established Group HSE, 
Security and CSR Guiding Principles that describe our 
fundamental values and approach to managing CR in 
accordance with these policies, and identify the international 
standards to which we aspire in our business activities. 
In 2005 we agreed that in addition to complying with our 
policies, we would also strive to conduct our activities in 
accordance with the International Finance Corporation’s 
policies and in cognisance with IFC’s best practice guidance 
and new performance standards, which are expected to 
come into effect in the first half of 2006. Our Guiding 
Principles will be amended to reflect these additional 
requirements during 2006.

2005 Performance and Plans for 2006
During 2005 we made good progress in both developing and 
implementing our approach to managing the many CR 
challenges facing our business. At a Group level, specific 
attention has been placed on emerging CR issues such as 
assessing and managing biodiversity risks, security and 
human rights, and the potential impact of climate change 
on our business. 
At an operating level the main CR challenges addressed 
include the maintenance of health and safety of our staff 
and contractors through to the specific challenges in 
Rajasthan of managing the risks associated with road 
transportation, water resource use, land acquisition and 
minimising community impacts.
Our CR progress in 2005 in addressing these challenges and 
our plans for further improvements in 2006 are presented in 
more detail in our 2005 Corporate Responsibility Report, 
which is distributed with the 2005 Annual Report & Accounts.
At an operating level there were a number of notable 
achievements during 2005. Our Sangu operations in 
Bangladesh have recorded six million man-hours (seven years) 
without a lost time injury (LTI) and our Suvali and Ravva 
operations have also achieved over one million and four 
million man-hours without an LTI respectively. Greenhouse 
gas emissions from our producing fields have been reduced 
(per tonne of hydrocarbon) during 2005 and our total 
investment on local community and social projects was up 
75% to just over £600,000.
As in 2004, we have sought independent external assurance 
on our 2005 Corporate Responsibility Report from 
Environmental Resource Management (ERM) and their 
assurance statement can be found on page 34 of that report. 
Implementation of our CR policies and Guiding Principles has 
also been assessed by IFC as part of the ‘due diligence’ 
process associated with the negotiations for additional 
funding arrangements. IFC’s findings are presented in their 
Environmental Review Summary (ERS) which can be accessed 
via the IFC website at www.ifc.org. 
We also benchmark our approach and performance with 
other UK and international companies. In their 2005 Energy, 
Environment and Social Index, Goldman Sachs ranked 
Cairn in the second quartile, positioned 11th out of the 31 
companies in the Index. 
In Rajasthan

IRON IN PLACE... 
THREE SITES IN PRODUCTION
Cairn has a substantial existing business across South Asia 
which has been established for more than a decade taking 
discoveries to production. 
Cairn’s strategy is the ability to identify areas of unrealised 
potential and translate it into material value having regard to 
the current size and market capitalisation of the Group. The 
Company seeks to utilise strategic alliances and joint venture 
arrangements, where appropriate, in the best interests of 
value enhancement, in all operations in South Asia.
In total, more than 100,000 boepd are produced in 
Bangladesh and India from Cairn operated ventures.
The Company has 12 offshore platforms, has built more than 
250 km of pipelines and has constructed 3 significant 
hydrocarbon processing facilities, Ravva in Eastern India; 
Suvali in Western India – the industrial heartland of Gujarat; 
and Chillimpur outside the southern Bangladesh port of 
Chittagong.
The offshore Ravva oil and gas field currently provides 
approximately 7.5% of India’s indigenous oil production. 
Ravva was initially thought to be a 70 million barrel oilfield 
but further appraisal and exploration has established 300 
million barrels in place.  In Gujarat, Cairn operates the Lakshmi and Gauri gas fields 
and has recently started production of oil from Gauri. The 
hydrocarbons are processed at the Suvali plant located 
close to Shell’s Indian Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) facility.
Cairn has been in Bangladesh for more than 10 years and, 
along with its joint venture partners, has invested $575 
million to date. 
The Sangu gas field continues to meet three quarters of 
the gas demand of Bangladesh’s second city, Chittagong, 
and the surrounding area, whilst achieving world class 
performance in operational safety and field uptime. 
The Sangu production plant at Chillimpur recently achieved 
six million man-hours (seven years) without incurring any lost 
time injuries. This is a significant health and safety milestone 
alongside the ISO 14001 certification. This certification is an 
international standard for environmental management 
which has been awarded to all of the Cairn processing 
facilities in South Asia.
The Company’s established track record of taking 
discoveries to production is of vital importance in 
realising the value of our assets in Rajasthan. 26
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES & DEVELOPMENTS
Adoption of IFRS and Successful Efforts Based 
Accounting Policy
In accordance with European legislation, Cairn has adopted 
IFRS in preparing its Financial Statements from 1 January 
2005. This has also required adjusting prior periods to arrive 
at the opening balances and comparative figures. Following 
the publication of IFRIC guidance in November 2005, which 
noted the limited scope of IFRS 6 ’Exploration for and 
Evaluation of Mineral Resources’, Cairn reviewed its 
accounting policies and has decided to adopt a successful 
efforts based accounting policy for its financial statements. 
As a consequence, Cairn updated and reissued its prior 
period restatement document on 28 February 2006 to reflect 
the changes arising from the implementation of this revised 
methodology.
The key implications from an oil and gas accounting 
perspective on adopting this policy and IFRS are as follows:
   Costs of unsuccessful wells initially capitalised within 
exploration assets are expensed in the Income Statement 
in the period they are determined unsuccessful
   Depletion of development / producing assets is now 
performed on a field by field basis although fields within 
development areas can be combined where appropriate
   Pre-exploration expenditure previously capitalised is now 
expensed
   Impairment testing for development / producing assets is 
now performed on each individual cash-generating unit 
(normally development area).
Other key changes arising from IFRS implementation, including 
accounting for share based payments, are outlined in more 
detail in the prior period restatement document. The prior 
year comparatives contained in the restatement document 
have been subsequently revised to reflect an updated 
interpretation of IAS 21 in respect of foreign currencies 
and its implications for the Group.
Presentational Currency
Cairn is reporting its financial results in US dollars for the first 
time. This aligns the presentational currency of the Group’s 
financial statements with the predominant currency of the 
business, as although headquartered in the UK, the majority 
of the Group’s income and expenditure is transacted in 
US dollars. 
PROFIT AND LOSS 
Revenue
Average production on a working interest basis was 40,100 
boepd compared to 34,300 boepd in 2004. On an entitlement 
interest basis, production for the year increased by 24% to 
28,240 boepd (2004: 22,789 boepd).
The 2005 results include the first full year of production from 
the 37 .5% interest in Sangu acquired from Shell (transaction 
completion date 30 June 2004). Following completion of the 
ONGC transaction in March 2005, Cairn’s working interest in 
CB/OS-2 production has reduced from 50% to 40%. However, 
field deliverability from both Lakshmi and Sangu have been 
enhanced following successful infill drilling campaigns in the 
latter part of 2004. 
The Group’s production mix remains heavily gas biased (circa 
80%). This, combined with the contractual gas price caps, 
results in an average price realised by the Group for the year 
of $25.44 per boe (2004: $24.06 per boe). Cairn’s exposure to 
world oil prices will increase significantly when production 
commences from Rajasthan.
Revenue for the year was $262.6m (2004 restated: $172.9m). 
Gross Profit
Cost of sales for the year was $168.8m (2004 restated: 
$159.2m). Cost of sales in 2005 includes the write off of 
unsuccessful exploration costs of $26.9m (2004 restated: 
$36.3m) arising from the Group’s adoption of revised 
accounting policies. 
Production costs for the year were $50.2m (2004 restated: 
$50.8m). Increased entitlement production in 2005 
contributed to the improvement in production costs per 
barrel from $6.09 in 2004 to $4.87 in 2005. Production 
costs include pre-exploration costs now expensed under 
IFRS 6 and stock adjustments.
The average Group rate for depletion and decommissioning 
has increased by 3.0% to $8.90 per boe in comparison to 
$8.64 per boe in 2004. This arises from changes in field 
mix and individual rates year on year as depletion is now 
calculated on a field basis. Lakshmi and Gauri field depletion 
has decreased due to the effect of the ONGC farm-out. 
Sangu field depletion, however, has increased as a 
consequence of the reserves revision outlined in the 
Operating & Exploration Review.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Kevin Hart
Finance Director 27
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Certain reserves relating to Rajasthan have been booked at 
the year end and these are summarised in the Operating & 
Exploration Review. As the depletion and decommissioning 
charge is calculated on a field basis no charge arises in the 
Income Statement until production commences. Exploration / 
appraisal costs associated with the booked reserves have 
been transferred to development / producing assets.
The Group generated a gross profit of $93.7m 
(2004 restated: $13.7m).
Profit for the Year
Administrative expenses for the year were $38.1m 
(2004 restated: $26.5m). This includes a charge of $10.0m 
(2004 restated: $4.6m) for share based payments and 
associated National Insurance Contributions in accordance 
with IFRS 2. Administrative expenses have also increased as 
a result of the growth in the business following the discoveries 
in Rajasthan.
Net finance income was $30.3m (2004 restated: net finance 
costs $17 .6m), including a foreign currency exchange gain of 
$27 .1m (2004 restated: loss $15.6m). Realised exchange rate 
movements arose due to the strengthening of the US dollar 
against sterling in the period and were also impacted by the 
recognition of exchange differences on intra-group funding 
under IFRS.
The majority of the $22.1m tax charge (2004 restated: credit 
$14.7m) arises on profits in India. The credit in 2004 is a result 
of the change to a successful efforts based policy under IFRS 
which substantially reduces the deferred tax provisions 
required. 
Exceptional items
The exceptional gain on sale of $15.3m arising in 2005 was the 
result of the farm-out of a 90% interest in KG-DWN-98/2 and 
of a 10% interest in the CB/OS-2 development area to ONGC 
detailed under ’Transactions’.
The Group made a profit for the year of $79.1m 
(2004 restated: loss $15.7m). 
BALANCE SHEET
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure additions during 2005 were $241.8m 
(2004 restated: $232.0m), comprising $193.1m on 
exploration / appraisal activities, $41.0m on development 
activities and $7 .7m on other fixed assets. The exploration / 
appraisal expenditure during the year was incurred largely on 
the continuing drilling programme in Rajasthan. The majority 
of the development expenditure was for completion of the 
infill campaigns on both the Lakshmi and Sangu gas fields 
and pre-development expenditure on Rajasthan.
CASH FLOW
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash generated from Group operations was $139.6m 
(2004 restated: $138.5m). Operating cash flows for the year 
have been reduced by cash payments of $35.3m made in 
settlement of amounts due following the previously 
announced Ravva arbitration proceedings. These amounts 
were fully provided for in the 2004 accounts. Tax payments 
during 2005 were $6.6m (2004 restated: $8.6m).

KEY STATISTICS
“ Cairn enters 2006 in a net funds 
position, with strong operating cash 
ﬂ ows and with signiﬁ cant progress 
made on ﬁ nancing arrangements 
to fund its share of Rajasthan 
development expenditure.”
Kevin Hart, Finance Director 28
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash outflow from capital expenditure during 2005 was 
$290.9m, made up of $218.3m exploration / appraisal 
expenditure, $64.9m development expenditure and $7 .7m 
other expenditure (2004: $173.7m – $140.2m exploration / 
appraisal, $29.6m development and $3.9m other). The 
difference arising between capitalisation of expenditure and 
cash flow is principally due to costs of the Sangu and Lakshmi 
infill drilling campaigns and the Rajasthan drilling programme 
that were incurred in 2004 but paid for in 2005.
In addition, there was an inflow on completion of the ONGC 
transaction of $127 .5m after adjusting for working capital 
adjustments and other costs (gross proceeds $135m)
(2004: outflow arising on Bangladesh acquisition $42.5m 
and an inflow on completion of the Gryphon disposal 
of $12.9m). 
Net Assets / Net Funds 
Net assets at 31 December 2005 were $757 .6m 
(2004 restated: $711.2m). 
At the year end the Group had net funds of $95.5m 
(2004: net funds $138.3m). The Group currently has $240m 
of unutilised unsecured revolving credit facilities. Following 
Cairn’s discoveries in Rajasthan, the Group is progressing the 
refinancing of its debt facilities required to fund the 
associated developments. These new facilities will provide 
Cairn with the financial flexibility to take its Rajasthan 
discoveries through development to production.
Transactions 
The previously announced ONGC transaction for the 
farm-out of 90% of KG-DWN-98/2 exploration assets, 10% 
of the CB/OS-2 development area (including the Lakshmi and 
Gauri fields) and 15% of the CB/OS-2 exploration area, and 
the farm-in to two blocks in Northern India, was completed 
in March 2005. $127 .5m net proceeds were received on

completion. A gain on sale of $15.3m has therefore been 
recognised in the Income Statement. The operating profits 
from the farmed-out interests in the CB/OS-2 producing 
interests have been recognised in the Income Statement up 
to the date of completion.
On a personal note, I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincere thanks to the Cairn finance team for all 
their hard work in the preparation of the 2005 IFRS financial 
statements and restatement documents. This has been an 
especially challenging year given the initial implementation 
of IFRS, the subsequent change to a successful efforts based 
accounting policy and USD reporting. I’m proud that the team 
has met these challenges full on with a healthy mix of common 
sense, attitude and judgement.
Kevin Hart
Finance Director
14 March 2006
Our vision, our people and our belief in the importance of 
building and developing strong relationships is based on 
mutual respect.
Cairn believes relationships are the key to developing any 
business and, in South Asia, Cairn’s success would not have 
been possible without the support we have enjoyed. 
The early partnership with Shell, the vision of the Central 
Government and the Dictorate General of Hydrocarbons 
(DGH), the strong support of the Rajasthan State 
Government and, of course, the consistent long term joint 
venture relationship that Cairn has developed with ONGC 
have all played their part. Equally the relationships with the 
District Administration and people living in the vicinity of 
our operations in Barmer in Rajasthan are vital to making 
things work.
The example set by Ravva:
The success of the Ravva project in Eastern India enabled 
Cairn to become a major investor in India; Cairn’s share of 
production has provided vital cash flow with which to 
reinvest. Cairn holds a 22.5% operated interest in the 
Ravva field and has produced more than 188 million boepd 
from 1996 to date. Ravva, meaning ’diamond’ in Telugu, is 
a dazzling reflection of the benefits which can be returned 
to all stakeholders.
OUR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS IN SOUTH ASIA
Partnerships in Rajasthan
Cairn believes success in Rajasthan is developed 
through aligning our interests with those of:
   the people of the Thar desert who live in the 
vicinity of our operations;
   the State Government of Rajasthan, in Jaipur;
   the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of the 
Government of India, in New Delhi;
    the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, 
in New Delhi;
   our joint venture partner, ONGC; and
   the many other stakeholders in India. 30

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Cairn is committed to achieving compliance with the principles and provisions set out in the Combined Code appended to 
the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (the ‘Listing Rules’) and to ensuring that high standards of corporate 
governance are maintained. The Board considers that the Company is compliant with the Combined Code, other than in the 
areas detailed on page 42. The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman met with Research Recommendations and Electronic 
Voting (‘RREV’) to discuss current corporate governance issues, their report on the Company’s annual report and accounts for 
the previous financial year and, in particular, the steps that had been taken by the Company during 2005 to strengthen further 
the procedures that had been put in place to ensure the continuing independence of the Deputy Chairman. Set out below is a 
statement of how the Company applied the principles of the Combined Code for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The Board
Cairn’s business is international in scope and carries political, commercial and technical risks. Accordingly, particular attention 
is paid to the composition and balance of the Board to ensure that it has wide experience of the sector and regulatory 
environment in which Cairn operates and appropriate financial and risk management skills. In each Board appointment, whether 
executive or non-executive, the Board considers that objectivity and integrity, as well as skills, experience and ability which will 
assist the Board in its key functions, are pre-requisites for appointment.
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, four other executive directors and five independent non-
executive directors. Hamish Grossart, Deputy Chairman, is Cairn’s senior independent non-executive director. The directors’ 
biographies are on page 31.
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board and to re-election 
by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, any non-executive director who has served on the Board for more 
than nine years is subject to annual re-election.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These reserved matters include determination 
of the overall strategy of the Group and approval of the annual report and accounts and any other financial statements, the 
Group’s annual budget and amendments to that budget over a particular amount, borrowing and security, acquisitions and 
disposals, capital expenditure over a specified amount, amendments to the organisational structure of the Group and Board, 
approval of significant changes to accounting policies and approval of management incentive schemes and Group policy on 
pensions. The Board delegates operational management of the Group on a day-to-day basis to the Group Management Board 
(the ‘GMB’), which comprises the executive directors and Simon Thomson (Group Commercial Manager), Richard Heaton (Head 
of Exploration – India) and Jann Brown (Group Financial Controller).
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to perform its duties. In addition, each director has 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary. There is also a procedure agreed 
by the Board for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, up to a pre-determined limit.
During 2005 eight scheduled meetings of the Board were held. Seven of those meetings were held in Edinburgh; the other 
Board meeting was held in Rajasthan, India. Details of attendance at each of those meetings, and at meetings of Board 
committees, is set out on page 38.
Prior to and after the Board meeting held in India, the Board visited the Company’s operations and the Company’s co-venturers 
in Rajasthan, met with Government officials and observed a number of the Group’s corporate and social responsibility initiatives 
in India, details of which are set out in the accompanying Corporate Responsibility Report. During the year, additional meetings 
to deal with specific matters were held at short notice when required. When a specific matter requires consideration at short 
notice, there is a procedure setting out when those matters must be considered at a short notice Board meeting and when 
they may be dealt with by a committee of the Board (comprising at least two non-executive directors (one of whom must be the 
Chairman or Deputy Chairman) and two executive directors). All directors unable physically to attend Board and committee 
meetings are given the opportunity to be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting by telephone or in writing. Video 
conferencing facilities are also used when directors are not able to attend meetings in person.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 34
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
The Board (continued)
The formal agenda, which regularly includes presentations from senior operational management, for each scheduled Board 
meeting is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. Formal minutes of all 
Board and committee meetings are circulated to all directors prior to the next Board meeting and are considered for approval 
at that Board meeting. In addition, the Board is in frequent contact between meetings to progress the Group’s business. The 
non-executive directors also meet informally, without any executives present, on a regular basis to discuss matters in respect 
of the business.
New directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the Board. This involves meetings with other Board members, 
members of the GMB and certain of the Company’s principal advisers. In addition, a new director is provided with an induction 
pack which contains background materials and general information on the Company, the Company’s policies and procedures, 
financial information, an operational review and a briefing on directors’ legal and regulatory responsibilities. No new directors 
were appointed during 2005.
The Company provides the necessary resources for developing and updating its directors’ knowledge and capabilities. 
In particular, the Company is committed to the provision of continuing professional development training to its directors and 
in 2005 held a number of seminars for Board members on subjects appropriate to the Company’s business, such as changes to 
legislation, regulation and market practice. These seminars, which are regularly presented by the Company’s external advisers, 
were held at the end of Board meetings and were attended by all directors present at the meeting. This process is continuing 
in 2006. Any director may request that a particular subject is covered in a seminar. In addition, all press cuttings relating to the 
Company and all brokers’ and analysts’ reports on the Company are distributed to all directors. At least once a year, the Board 
visits an operational site and in November 2005 all of the directors visited the Company’s operations in Rajasthan.
The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place.
Performance Evaluation
The Board has a formal annual process of rigorous performance evaluation for the Board, audit, nomination and remuneration 
committees and individual directors. The Board reviews on an annual basis whether such performance evaluation should be 
conducted using an external resource. The Board has decided, however, that there is value in conducting the process internally 
to develop an appropriately tailored approach and benefit first hand from direct input from individual directors.
The performance evaluation of the Board and the Board committees was primarily based upon answers to a detailed 
questionnaire which had been updated since the previous year’s evaluation and which was prepared internally following a 
review of external papers on the subject. The questionnaire was distributed to all Board members and the Company Secretary. 
The areas covered in the questionnaire included the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees, performance against 
objectives, preparation for and performance at meetings and corporate governance matters. The questionnaire addressed all 
of the issues raised by Derek Higgs in his review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors published in January 
2003.
The review process carried out pursuant to the questionnaires can be summarised as follows:
Evaluators Chairman Executive directors Non-executive directors
Evaluating
Board ✓ ✓ ✓
Chairman  ✓ ✓
Board committees ✓ ✓ ✓
Executive directors ✓  ✓
Non-executive directors ✓ ✓
Self assessment ✓ ✓ ✓
Once a questionnaire had been completed by each member of the Board and the Company Secretary, the Chairman held a 
meeting with each director and the Company Secretary individually to discuss their responses. The Chairman then reported the 
results of the process to the Board at a Board meeting, which discussed the comments and implemented the conclusions. The 
Board and Board committees are satisfied that they are operating effectively.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 35
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
The Deputy Chairman, who is also the Company’s senior independent non-executive director, sought the views of the executive 
directors and met with each of the other non-executive directors, in the absence of the Chairman, to discuss and assess the 
Chairman’s performance. The Board (not including the Chairman) is satisfied that the Chairman’s performance is effective and 
that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role.
The executive directors have their performance individually reviewed by the remuneration committee against objectives which 
are set annually. The bonus payable to the executive directors under the Company’s cash bonus scheme (described further on 
page 50) is linked directly to the results of these reviews.
The evaluation indicated areas for improvement, but no significant problems were identified. A performance evaluation of the 
Board, the Board committees and individual directors will continue to be conducted annually and the process for such review 
will continue to be reviewed by the Board in order to optimise the process.
Independence of Non-executive Directors
The Board evaluation and review process also covered the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into 
account their integrity, objectivity and contribution to the Board and its committees. In particular, the process considered the 
independence of Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall.
Hamish Grossart
Since Mr Grossart has served on the Board for more than ten years, in terms of the Combined Code he can be counted as 
independent only if the Board deems him to be so. The Board concluded, after rigorous review and without Mr Grossart being 
present, that Mr Grossart remains independent in character and judgement and that his performance continues to be effective 
and he demonstrates continued commitment to the role. In particular, the Board noted that Mr Grossart does not participate in 
the Company’s cash bonus scheme, share option plans, long term incentive plan or pension scheme and is not dependent upon 
the fees received from the Company as his primary source of income.
Mr Grossart is also a non-executive director of Artemis Investment Management Limited, which has a shareholding in the 
Company (although this shareholding is not large enough to be classed as a notifiable interest under the Companies Act 1985). 
The Head of Compliance at Artemis has confirmed in writing to the Company that Mr Grossart does not participate in any 
investment management decisions at Artemis. The Company seeks such confirmation on an annual basis.
Mr Grossart has indicated that he is willing to stand for re-election as a director of the Company on an annual basis and a 
resolution will be proposed at the AGM to be held on 20 April 2006 to this effect. The Board believes that it is in shareholders’ 
interests for Mr Grossart to be re-elected as an independent non-executive director of the Company. The Board believes 
Mr Grossart continues to challenge rigorously the executive directors, the Board and the committees on which he sits in both 
a constructive and appropriate manner and brings considerable expertise to his position as Deputy Chairman and senior 
independent director. As indicated on page 33, the Chairman and Mr Grossart met with RREV during 2005 to discuss the steps 
taken by the Company to ensure further the ongoing independence of Mr Grossart.
Mark Tyndall
Mark Tyndall is the chief executive of Artemis Investment Management Limited, which has a shareholding in the Company. 
As stated above, however, this shareholding is not large enough to be classed as a notifiable interest under the Companies 
Act 1985. Furthermore, the Company seeks confirmations from Artemis on an annual basis in respect of the ‘chinese wall’ 
arrangements that are in place and that Mr Tyndall does not participate in any investment management decisions at Artemis in 
respect of Cairn. The Board concluded, after rigorous review and without Mr Tyndall being present, that he is independent in 
character and judgement and that his performance is effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role.
Following the evaluation and review process, the Board believes that, in addition to Mr Grossart and Mr Tyndall, all of the other 
non-executive directors are independent in character and judgement.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 36
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Board Committees
The Board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has 
formal terms of reference approved by the Board. The terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the requirements 
of the Combined Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are 
available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 20 April 2006.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the remuneration and nomination committees and the Deputy Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the audit committee. The minutes of all committee meetings are circulated to all directors.
Set out below are reports from each of the audit committee, remuneration committee and nomination committee.
1. Audit Committee Report
The audit committee comprises three non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Currently, its members are Andrew Shilston (chairman), Hamish Grossart and Ed Story. The Board is satisfied that two members 
of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience. Mr Shilston was the Finance Director of Enterprise Oil plc from 
1993 to 2002 and is currently the Finance Director of Rolls-Royce plc. Mr Grossart serves on audit committees of other listed 
companies and trained as an investment banker.
Norman Murray stood down as a member and chairman of the audit committee following the conclusion of the AGM on 3 June 
2005. Since then, Mr Murray has attended a number of meetings of the committee as an observer, on being invited to do so by 
the committee. Andrew Shilston became chairman of the audit committee with effect from 3 June 2005.
The audit committee met seven times in 2005. At the request of the audit committee, the Finance Director and senior members 
of the Finance Department attended six and seven meetings respectively during the year. In addition, five of these meetings 
were attended by the external auditors and four meetings were attended by the internal auditors. For part of each of the 
meetings attended by the external auditors, the committee can meet with the auditors without any executives being present. 
The external auditors receive copies of all audit committee papers (including papers to be considered at meetings when they 
are not in attendance) and minutes of all committee meetings. In addition, the chairman of the committee regularly meets with 
the external audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the Company.
The role of the committee includes:
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them;
• reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial reports;
• reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function;
•  overseeing the Company’s relationship with the external auditors, including making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment or reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement, and monitoring the external 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and effectiveness; and
•  reviewing the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow up action.
The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the supply of non-audit services by the external auditors and 
other third parties. The Company will engage an external adviser to provide non-audit services on the basis of the skills and 
experience required for the work, whether benefit will be derived as a result of the third party’s knowledge of the Company, 
and cost. These advisers may include the Company’s external auditors for a restricted list of non-audit services, although, 
before the engagement commences, the audit committee must be satisfied that the auditors’ objectivity and independence 
would not be compromised in any way as a result of being instructed to carry out those services. If the cumulative fees to be 
paid to an external adviser for the provision of non-audit services are below a certain level, the adviser may be engaged in 
accordance with the Company’s financial delegations of authority after a quotation has been received. If the fees payable are 
expected to exceed that level on a cumulative basis, the engagement must be approved by the audit committee in advance 
after following a tender process.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 37
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
KPMG LLP has been appointed by the audit committee to supervise and co-ordinate the Company’s internal audit function, 
using a combination of the Company’s own internal resources and external third party resources. The audit committee receives 
updates on the internal audit workplan on an ongoing basis.
The Company undertook an audit tender process in 2003, as a result of which Ernst & Young LLP were re-engaged as the 
Company’s auditors. The Company monitors its auditor’s performance on an ongoing basis, including an annual assessment 
carried out by the audit committee with input from the Finance Director and other key members of the finance team. Following 
such assessment, the audit committee meets to discuss what actions, if any, require to be taken.
2. Remuneration Committee Report
The remuneration committee comprises four non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be 
independent. Currently, its members are Hamish Grossart (chairman), Ed Story, Mark Tyndall and Todd Hunt.
The Chief Executive, at the request of the committee, attends its meetings. In addition, he is consulted by the committee on its 
proposals, but does not participate in any meetings or any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Norman Murray stood down as a member of the remuneration committee and was replaced by Todd Hunt, an independent 
non-executive director, following the conclusion of the AGM on 3 June 2005. Since then, Mr Murray has attended a number of 
meetings of the committee as an observer, on being invited to do so by the committee.
The role of the committee includes:
•  determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for all the executive directors, the Chairman and the 
members of the GMB;
•  within the terms of the agreed policy, determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director;
•  determining the level of awards made under the Company’s share option plans and long term incentive plan and the 
performance conditions which are to apply;
• determining bonuses payable under the Company’s cash bonus scheme;
• determining the vesting of awards under the Company’s long term incentive plan and exercise of share options; and
•  determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for executive directors.
The remuneration committee met seven times in 2005.
Details of the Company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 54.
3. Nomination Committee Report
The nomination committee comprises Norman Murray (chairman), two independent non-executive directors, (Hamish Grossart 
and Ed Story) and, to ensure input from the executive, one executive director, Sir Bill Gammell (Chief Executive).
The Code requires there to be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which should 
be meritocratic and made against objective criteria. For this purpose, the Board has established the nomination committee, 
whose role includes considering the composition, balance and skills of the Board and making recommendations to the Board on 
these matters, on the appointment of new directors and on the re-appointment and orderly succession of existing directors.
No new appointments to the Board were made during 2005.
The nomination committee met three times in 2005.
Organisational Planning
During 2005 the Company completed its work with Ashridge Consulting Limited on an organisational development project. 
This initiative established a set of core competencies which reflect the values and behaviours important to the Company. These 
competencies are now used in many of the Company’s human resources processes, including staff appraisal and identification 
of training requirements. These behavioural competencies will also be used in the recruitment processes and succession 
planning in 2006. The Company is now in the process of developing a set of technical competencies which will further 
complement the work already done on behavioural competencies.

Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority by the Board. Cairn sends both its annual report and accounts and 
interim report and accounts to all shareholders. In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders there is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the 
announcement of the year end and interim results. The Chairman attends a number of these meetings. At the Board meeting 
immediately following these meetings, a detailed report is given to all directors who were not in attendance at those meetings. 
In addition, the Company maintains an external relations database which details all meetings attended by the directors with 
third party stakeholders. All analysts’ and brokers’ reports on the Company are also distributed to all directors. Cairn responds 
to all correspondence from shareholders and also has a website which contains a range of information, including a dedicated 
investor relations section.
Mr Grossart, the senior independent non-executive director, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact 
through the normal channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
Each of the non-executive directors is available to attend meetings with major shareholders (without the executive directors 
present), if requested by such major shareholders.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 39
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. It is our 
policy for all directors to attend the AGM if at all possible. Whilst this may not always be possible for business or personal 
reasons, in normal circumstances this means that the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will 
attend the AGM and be available to answer questions.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully in the affairs of the Company and to give them the opportunity at the AGM 
to ask questions about the Company’s activities and prospects.
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM on 20 April 2006 can be found in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on 
pages 100 to 102 and on the Company’s website.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the results will be 
made available at the meeting after the shareholders have voted on each resolution on a show of hands.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
These are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS (as adopted by the EU) and 
have also elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Group and Company Financial Statements are required by law and IFRS (as adopted by the EU) to present fairly the 
financial position and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
•  For the Group and Company Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
(as adopted by the EU).
•  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement on going concern. They have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have therefore used the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal Control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
As an oil and gas exploration and production company with current operations concentrated in South Asia, Cairn is, by virtue 
of the nature of its business and the countries in which it operates, subject to a variety of business risks. However, the directors 
believe that Cairn derives its competitive edge by focusing activities in this core area.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 40
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Internal Control (continued)
Operations in any country are only possible when values are shared, and the directors believe that Cairn’s values of integrity, 
social and environmental responsibility, teamwork and nurturing of individuals, creativity, risk management and alliancing with 
key partners are ingredients that are central to Cairn’s success. The ability to recognise the value of working as a partnership 
with host governments, both nationally and regionally, has also been a critical ingredient in Cairn’s approach and success.
The Group’s system of internal control plays a critical role in managing the risks towards the achievement of Cairn’s corporate 
vision and objectives, and is also central to safeguarding Cairn’s shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets.
An ongoing process has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group and 
is in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control. The process has been in place in respect of 
the Group for the 2005 accounting period and up to the date of approval of the report and accounts.
During 2005, steps have been taken to continue to strengthen Cairn’s system of internal control, which have included:
•  strengthening the business risk management strategy, organisation and processes so that they are more performance focused 
and embedded within the Group’s operations; and
•  establishing a more robust assurance framework which recognises the Group’s operational growth and external 
developments which impact upon it.
The Board has carried out regular reviews of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls during 2005, and will 
ensure that such reviews are performed on a regular basis in 2006. The Board is satisfied that effective control is in place and 
that risks have been mitigated to an acceptable level.
The key elements of the internal control system and the processes used by the Board to review the effectiveness of the system 
include the following:
1. Strategic Direction
The Cairn business model is conventional in that Group strategy is set by the directors and approved by the Board, and its 
implementation is delegated to the GMB. 
2. Operating Management
Cairn operates several business units in three different countries and with various partners. Work programmes and budgets are 
prepared annually to meet the Group strategy, starting at the asset level before being consolidated at both country and Group 
levels. After an iterative process, the country budgets are presented as part of the Group budget to the GMB and the Board for 
approval. 
Each country then prepares a detailed business plan to meet the agreed annual work programme and budget. This sets 
out detailed objectives and key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) for each asset and supporting functional department, and is 
consolidated into the country business plan. The country business plans are firstly approved by the in-country management 
teams and are then submitted to the GMB and the Board for approval. 
The in-country management teams then have the required authority to implement the business plans and to deliver the agreed 
work programme within the approved budget and delegation of authorities, and in accordance with the internal control 
framework. 
The remit of the GMB is to oversee the delivery of the Group strategy through the annual work programmes, budgets and the 
country business plans. The directors have also appointed Group Functional Heads whose role includes providing input and 
‘challenge’ to the work programmes, budgets and business plans, and supplying the relevant director with full and accurate 
information and to make statements on the adequacy of internal control.
In view of the significance of the Rajasthan northern fields development, the GMB has established a Project Board and project 
governance process (‘Cairn Gated Process’) to ensure these fields are developed efficiently and in accordance with the project 
boundary conditions agreed by the GMB and Board.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 41
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
3. Risk Management 
The Risk Management Committee (‘RMC’), established by the Board in 1999, continues to be responsible for the development 
of risk management strategy and processes within the Group and for overseeing the implementation of the requirements of this 
strategy. It does this by ensuring the Group’s framework for the identification, assessment, mitigation and reporting on all areas 
of risk is ‘fit for purpose’ and that appropriate assurance arrangements are in place in relation to these risks.
 
The RMC is chaired by the Finance Director and comprises executive directors, senior country and Group functional 
management. In order to improve transparency of key business risks, the committee meetings were also attended by 
non-executive directors during 2005, including Norman Murray, Andrew Shilston and Mark Tyndall. The Board intends to 
periodically change the chairman and RMC membership in order to maintain a robust and challenging approach to risk 
management. 
An updated version of the Business Risk Management Guidelines (‘BRMG’), that define the processes through which Cairn 
seeks to systematically identify, analyse, assess, treat and monitor the business risks faced by the Group, was distributed in 
April 2005. The BRMG also identifies the risk management organisational structure through which business risks are managed 
and regularly reviewed at operating, asset and country levels. Country level Risk Management Committees have also been 
established in India and Bangladesh. Business risks, together with the identified mitigating measures and responsibilities are 
recorded in Asset and Country Risk Registers, which following endorsement by the in-country Risk Management Committees 
are reported through to the Group Risk Register.
These Country and Group Risk Registers are regularly reviewed by the RMC to ensure that the business understands the 
key risks it faces and that there is an embedded risk management approach in place. At each Group RMC meeting a specific 
risk item has been reviewed in more detail, through presentations by and questioning of the responsible manager. During 
2005 these more detailed reviews have included business continuity, security risk management and the business processes 
employed by the exploration and commercial departments.
Since KPMG’s appointment to manage the internal audit process in August 2004, steps have been taken to ensure internal 
audit’s integration with the risk management process, including attendance at RMC meetings. 
The RMC reports on the Group’s risk profile to both the audit committee and the Board. Additionally, the Board receives 
internal reviews of the effectiveness of internal control relative to the key risks on a regular basis. The conclusion of the Board 
following these reviews during 2005 is that the internal controls in respect of key risks are appropriate.
4. Assurance
The integrated assurance framework adopted by the Board provides for three levels of assurance against the risks facing the 
Group: firstly at the operational level; secondly through overview by Group functional management and the RMC; and thirdly 
through internal, external or joint venture audits. 
During 2005 the directors regularly reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, 
including operational and compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high level internal control arrangements. 
The directors derive assurance from the following internal and external controls:
• a regularly updated schedule of matters specifically reserved for a decision by the Board;
• policies and procedures for key business activities;
• an appropriate organisational structure;
• control over non-operated joint venture activities through delegated Cairn representatives;
• specific delegations of authority for all financial and other transactions;
• segregation of duties where appropriate and cost effective;
• business and financial reporting, including KPIs;
• functional management reviews;
•  annual ‘letters of assurance’ process, through which country managers confirm the adequacy of internal financial and non-
financial controls, their compliance with Group policies and report any control weaknesses identified in the past year;
•  internal audits to assess compliance – the internal auditor implements a number of audits during the year in line with the 
annual internal audit plan approved by the audit committee and Board;
• reports from the audit committee and RMC;
• reports from the external auditor on matters identified during its statutory audit;
• reports from audits by governments and co-venturers; and
• independent third party reviews commissioned by Cairn.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 42
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Compliance With Combined Code
Throughout 2005 the Company complied with the provisions of the new Combined Code, except in the following areas:
Provision of the Combined Code
A.4.1 – a majority of the members 
of the nomination committee 
should be independent non-
executive directors.
B.2.1 – the Board should establish 
a remuneration committee of at 
least three members who should 
all be independent non-executive 
directors.
C.3.1 – the Board should establish 
an audit committee of at least 
three members, who should all 
be independent non-executive 
directors.
D.2.4 – the Company should 
arrange for the Notice of AGM 
and related papers to be sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the AGM.
Company Position
Throughout 2005 the nomination 
committee comprised two 
independent non-executive 
directors, the Chairman and one 
executive director.
The Company complied with 
this provision from 3 June 2005 
onwards.
The Company complied with 
this provision from 3 June 2005 
onwards. 
The Notice of AGM and related 
papers are being sent to 
shareholders 16 working days 
(26 clear days including weekends 
and bank holidays) prior to the 
AGM this year. This complies 
with the statutory minimum 
notice period contained in the 
Companies Act 1985. 
Explanation
The Board believes that the membership of the 
committee is appropriate and effective.
At the start of 2005, the remuneration committee 
comprised three independent non-executive directors 
and the Chairman. Following the conclusion of the 
AGM in 2005, the Chairman stood down as a member 
of the remuneration committee and Todd Hunt, an 
independent non-executive director, was appointed 
as a member of the remuneration committee. 
The remuneration committee now comprises four 
independent non-executive directors.
At the start of 2005, the audit committee comprised 
three independent non-executive directors and the 
Chairman. Following the conclusion of the AGM in 
2005, the Chairman stood down as a member of the 
audit committee. The audit committee now comprises 
three independent non-executive directors.
The Company is committed to ensuring that the 
AGM is used constructively. Due to the unavailability 
of certain key members of the Board in late April and 
early May, a decision was taken to hold the AGM on 
20 April 2006 which, although providing shareholders 
with less than the 20 working days notice, will enable 
all directors to attend and therefore provide investors 
with the opportunity to ask questions of such 
directors.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 43

Company during the year.
Financial Instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company are detailed in Note 25 of the Notes to the Accounts.
Election / Re-election of Directors
Todd Hunt, Dr Mike Watts and Phil Tracy retire by rotation at the AGM to be held on 20 April 2006 in accordance with the 
Company’s articles of association and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election as directors. Hamish Grossart has served 
on the Board for more than nine years and in accordance with the Combined Code therefore requires to be re-elected as a 
director on an annual basis. The Board has carried out a formal performance evaluation and confirms that, after rigorous review, 
it has determined that the performance of each of the directors who are subject to re-election continues to be effective and 
that each demonstrates commitment to the role. An explanation of the performance evaluation procedure carried out by the 
Company is contained in the Corporate Governance Statement. The directors’ biographies are on page 31.
Share Capital Authorities
Resolution 8 in the Notice of AGM seeks to give the directors authority to allot up to 53,276,634 unissued ordinary shares, 
being up to an aggregate nominal amount of £5,327 ,663.40. This maximum amount represents one third of the nominal value 
of the Company’s total issued share capital as at 14 March 2006. As at 14 March 2006 the Company holds no shares in treasury, 
representing 0% of the total ordinary share capital (calculated exclusive of treasury shares). The authority conferred by this 
resolution will expire on 19 April 2011. The directors consider that the authority proposed to be given pursuant to resolution 8 is 
desirable to allow the Company to retain flexibility, although they have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Resolution 9 in the Notice of AGM seeks to give the directors power to allot unissued ordinary share capital and to sell ordinary 
shares held in treasury for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of £799,149.51 in aggregate without first being required to 
offer such shares to existing shareholders but this authority is limited to:
(i)  the allotment of ordinary shares and sale of treasury shares avoiding legal or practical problems should there be an offer of 
shares or other securities to shareholders pro rata in the future; and
(ii)  the allotment and sale of up to 7 ,991,495 ordinary shares and treasury shares for cash (for any purpose) representing 5% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 14 March 2006. 
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on 19 April 2011. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 45
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Purchase of Own Shares
Resolution 10 in the Notice of AGM will be proposed to authorise the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary 
shares. Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to such authority may be cancelled or held in treasury and then either 
sold (in whole or in part) for cash or cancelled (in whole or in part).
The directors intend to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by this resolution as they deem appropriate. No dividends will 
be paid on treasury shares and no voting rights attach to them.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be purchased pursuant to the authority shall be 14.99% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 20 April 2006. The maximum price which may be paid for an ordinary 
share pursuant to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) shall be an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market 
quotations for the Company’s ordinary shares for the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase. The 
minimum price which may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) shall be ten pence.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company will not repurchase shares in the period of two months immediately 
preceding the preliminary announcement of its annual or interim results or, if shorter, the period from the end of the financial 
period concerned up to and including the time of a relevant announcement or except in accordance with the Listing Rules, at 
any other time when, in terms of the Company’s Dealing Rules, the directors would be prohibited from dealing in shares.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
This authority will expire on the earlier of 19 October 2007 or the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2007 
(unless previously revoked, varied or renewed by the Company in general meeting).
As at 14 March 2006, options to subscribe for shares were outstanding over an aggregate of 1,628,518 ordinary shares 
(representing 1.02% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 14 March 2006). If the outstanding amount of the existing 
buy-back authority granted at the 2005 AGM is utilised in full prior to the 2006 AGM and the new authority is granted at the 
AGM to be held on 20 April 2006 and is then utilised in full, the options outstanding at 14 March 2006 would represent 1.41% of 
the issued share capital of the Company.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as auditors and their re-appointment at the AGM to be held on 
20 April 2006 will be proposed in accordance with section 385 of the Act.
AGM 2006
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be held on 20 April 2006 are set out in the Notice of AGM.
Please note that this Annual Report and Accounts (which includes the Notice of AGM) is an important document and 
requires your immediate attention. If you are in any doubt as to what action you should take, you should consult your 
stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other professional adviser immediately.

shareholders as a whole and recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of them.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 46
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Remuneration Committee and Advisers
Reference is made to page 37 of the Corporate Governance Statement, where there is a summary of the role of the 
remuneration committee.
Cairn’s remuneration committee operates within terms of reference set by the Board. These are reviewed periodically to ensure 
that the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business 
environment in which it operates. 
The deliberations and decisions of the remuneration committee are governed by the provisions in the Listing Rules and the 
Combined Code (appended to the Listing Rules) and the remuneration committee has followed these provisions and those of 
the Act, as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, in preparing this report.
As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from the Company’s 
legal advisers, Shepherd+ Wedderburn, and auditors, Ernst & Young LLP in respect of the Company’s share option schemes 
and LTIP . Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of the Company’s 
performance against performance criteria applicable to the Company’s share option schemes and LTIP . 
In respect of comparative remuneration, advice has also been obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants, who last 
conducted a comprehensive review of the directors’ remuneration packages in 2004. In line with the remuneration committee’s 
policy of carrying out a comprehensive review of the directors’ remuneration packages at least every two years, the committee 
intends to instruct the next review to be carried out at the end of 2006.
The current members of the remuneration committee are Hamish Grossart (chairman), Ed Story, Mark Tyndall and Todd Hunt. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive are not members of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation 
and are consulted in respect of certain of its proposals (although they are not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect 
of their own remuneration). 
The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors, 
the Chairman and the members of the GMB. The remuneration committee also determines, within the terms of the agreed 
policy and having consulted with the Chairman and the Chief Executive about their proposals, specific remuneration packages 
for each of the executive directors, including pension rights and any compensation payments to be paid on termination.
Remuneration Policy
Cairn’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall 
remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality individuals capable of 
achieving the Group’s objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The package is generally weighted more towards 
variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long term performance.
Each executive director’s remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance related 
bonuses, a long term incentive plan, defined contribution pension (if appropriate) and life assurance of four times basic annual 
salary.
 
The package is designed to support the Group’s business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise 
individual and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive. Details of the individual 
components of the package and of contracts are given below. 
 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are agreed by the executive members 
of the Board and the Chairman, having taken independent advice on appropriate levels, within an overall limit determined 
by shareholders. The fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the responsibilities of the role. The 
fees stated are in respect of all responsibilities undertaken by the non-executive directors, including membership of Board 
committees.
Basic Salary and Beneﬁ ts
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year. 
The salary increases awarded to directors for the year 2005 retained basic salary levels at below the median level identified in 
the review carried out by New Bridge Street Consultants in 2004.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 47
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
For the year 2006, the basic salaries of the executive directors have increased from 2005 levels to £480,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 
£350,000 for Dr Mike Watts and £300,000 for each of Kevin Hart, Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy. The non-executive directors’ 
fees were increased from 2005 levels to £140,000 for Norman Murray, £90,000 for Hamish Grossart and £50,000 for each of 
Ed Story, Todd Hunt, Mark Tyndall and Andrew Shilston. Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, 
permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit.
Share Options 
The Group currently operates three share option plans, as follows:
1. 1996 Second Share Option Scheme (‘1996 Scheme’)
2. 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2002 Plan’)
3. 2003 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2003 Plan’)
The 1996 Scheme was adopted in 1996. The approval of the Inland Revenue was not sought for the 1996 Scheme. The date of 
grant of the first award of options under the 1996 Scheme was 29 May 1996. 
The 1996 Scheme has now been superseded by two new share option plans – the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan. As such, no 
further awards of options will be made under the 1996 Scheme. The date of grant of the last award of options under the 1996 
Scheme was 1 October 2002.
The principal difference between the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan is that the approval of the Inland Revenue was not sought for 
the 2002 Plan. The 2003 Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and subsequently by the Inland Revenue. The 
date of grant of the first award of options under the 2002 Plan was 18 March 2003. The date of grant of the first award of options 
under the 2003 Plan was 30 June 2003.
Options granted under the 1996 Scheme, 2002 Plan and 2003 Plan are exercisable three to ten years following the date of 
grant and are subject to performance conditions on exercise. At present, the option holder may only exercise options if Cairn’s 
share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant of options up to the date they are 
exercised. In addition, the percentage increase in Cairn’s share price over the period must be at least equal to or greater than 
the percentage movement in the FTSE Oil & Gas Index. 
Share options are awarded in order to provide employees with a long term performance incentive and to align their interests 
with those of shareholders. As such, the remuneration committee is satisfied that the current share price related performance 
conditions are appropriate. Confirmation of whether the applicable performance conditions have been met is subject to 
independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP . Ernst & Young LLP is also Cairn’s external auditor.
Up to 5% of Cairn’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time may be placed under option under the 1996 Scheme and 
the 2002 Plan in any rolling ten year period. Up to 10% of Cairn’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time may be placed 
under option under the 1996 Scheme, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan in any rolling ten year period.
None of the directors holds any options under any of the Company’s share option plans. Since 1999, the long term incentives for 
executive directors and certain senior executives have been made through the Company’s LTIP and therefore no options have 
been granted to these individuals under the share option plans since that time. 
LTIP
Details of directors’ awards pursuant to the LTIP are given on pages 53 and 54.
The purpose of the LTIP is to align the interests of executive directors and senior executives with the interests of shareholders 
by providing a share based incentive. The LTIP is designed to reward participants based on company performance and benefits 
are only delivered if challenging conditions are met. Participants are required to hold 50% of any shares awarded pursuant to 
vesting for a minimum of one year and are not entitled to receive additional grants of options under any of the Company’s share 
option plans.
The executive directors and senior executives eligible to receive awards are determined by the remuneration committee 
each year. Participants may be granted Tier One and Tier Two awards under the LTIP . Performance conditions for each are 
determined by the remuneration committee and the calculation of shares vesting based on these conditions is subject to 
independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP . 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) 48
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Performance Conditions – Tier One
A Tier One award is an award of Cairn shares with the vesting and release of all / part of those shares being dependent upon 
the executive remaining an employee and achievement of performance conditions over a performance period of three years. 
In any one year, the market value of Cairn shares comprised in a Tier One award at the date of grant will not exceed one and a 
half times a participant’s annual gross remuneration.
Vesting of the Tier One award is currently subject to a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) target which is calculated in two steps, 
each of which must be satisfied. 
Step One
First, the TSR of a Cairn share during the performance period is compared to the average TSR performance of the companies 
comprising the relevant FTSE index (‘the Index’) at the beginning and at the end of the performance period (details of the FTSE 
Indices used are set out on page 49). If Cairn’s TSR performance exceeds the average TSR performance of the Index, then the 
step one test has been passed. The step two test will then be used to calculate how many (if any) Cairn shares the subject of the 
award will vest.
Step Two
Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares will be compared to the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group 
comprising exploration, production and integrated oil companies over the performance period (details of the relevant 
comparator groups are set out on pages 49 to 50). Each company will then be ranked in order of TSR performance. Cairn’s 
position in the comparator group list will determine how many (if any) Cairn shares the subject of the award will vest, as follows:
•  all the Cairn shares comprised in the award will vest if Cairn’s position in the comparator group is at the upper quartile or 
above;
• 20% of the Cairn shares comprised in the award will vest if Cairn reaches the median in the comparator group;
• between the median and upper quartile the number of Cairn shares vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis; and
•  no shares comprised in the award will vest if the TSR of Cairn shares does not place it at the median or above in the 
comparator group.
In addition, no Tier One award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and 
sustained improvement in Cairn’s underlying financial position and performance over the performance period. 
Performance Conditions – Tier Two
A Tier Two award is a TSR appreciation right over a number of notional Cairn shares. The maximum potential benefit a 
participant may receive under a Tier Two award is calculated by comparing the percentage change in Cairn’s TSR over the 
performance period with the percentage change in the average TSR of the comparator group over the same period. The 
relative performance in Cairn’s TSR (if any) over the performance period, is multiplied by the number of notional shares the 
subject of the award. This gives rise to a monetary figure which is then converted into an actual number of Cairn shares using 
the market value as at the date of vesting. Where there has been a fall in Cairn’s TSR, no Tier Two award will vest.
Vesting of the Tier Two award is then subject to a further TSR target which is calculated in two steps, each of which must be satisfied. 
Step One
This step is the same as step one of the performance conditions in respect of Tier One.
Step Two
Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares will be compared to the TSR of a share in each company comprised in the comparator 
group over the performance period. As with Tier One awards, each company will then be ranked in order of TSR performance. 
Cairn’s position in the comparator group list will determine how many (if any) shares the subject of the award will vest, as follows:
• all of the benefit will vest if Cairn achieves position number one in the comparator group;
• 40% of the benefit will vest if Cairn reaches the upper quartile in the comparator group;
•  between the upper quartile and number one position, the level of benefit vesting will be calculated on a straight line 
basis; and
•  no benefit will vest under this target if the TSR of Cairn shares does not place it at the upper quartile or above in the 
comparator group.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) 49
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
In addition, no Tier Two award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and 
sustained improvement in Cairn’s underlying financial position and performance over the performance period. At the end of 
the performance period, 50% of vested shares under both Tier One and Tier Two awards will be transferred to participants 
immediately, and the remaining shares will be transferred at the end of one year. 
Vesting of the award will be dependent upon the executive remaining an employee, and upon the achievement of performance 
conditions over the performance period. In any three year period, the market value of the notional shares comprised in all 
outstanding Tier Two awards at the date of grant will not exceed four times a participant’s annual gross remuneration.
The LTIP is designed to provide the executive directors and other senior executives with a long term incentive based on 
company performance. As such, the performance conditions described above are deemed appropriate by the remuneration 
committee.
The remuneration committee reviews performance conditions on a regular basis. For the first step of the TSR target described 
on page 48, for 2004 and 2005 awards, the Company’s performance is measured against the FTSE 250 Index. The remuneration 
committee reviewed this performance condition in March 2006 and has decided to measure awards made in 2006 against 
the FTSE 350 Index. For awards prior to 2004, the Company’s performance was measured against the FTSE Small Cap Index 
(excluding investment trusts). 
Comparator Groups
The comparator group applicable to awards made on 11 March 2002 and which vested on 19 April 2005 (details of which are 
on page 54) was:
BP Amoco PLC
Chevron Texaco Corporation
Dana Petroleum plc
Exxon Mobil Corporation
Fortune Oil PLC
Melrose Resources PLC
Occidental Petroleum Corporation
Paladin Resources plc
Premier Oil plc
Ramco Energy plc
Royal Dutch Petroleum Company
Shell Transport and Trading Company
SOCO International plc
Tullow Oil plc
The comparator group of companies used in the second step of the TSR target is reviewed by the remuneration committee 
on an annual basis and from time to time companies are removed or added to ensure that the comparator group remains 
appropriate. The table on the following page shows the comparator groups applicable to:
• awards made in 2003 and 2004;
• awards made in 2005; and
• awards to be made in 2006.

Annual Cash Bonus Scheme
Cairn’s annual cash bonus scheme has been in place since 1999 and applies to all employees and executive directors. 
Bonuses under the scheme are based on individual and Company performance measures. Individual performance is measured 
through the Company’s performance management system. Company performance measures are based on annually defined 
key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). The KPIs for 2005 encompassed various budgetary, portfolio growth and procedural 
compliance targets, the substantial majority of which were met. For employees other than executive directors, only the 
individual and Company performance measures determine the overall bonus award. 
As was the case in 2004, the 2005 bonus award to the executive directors was subject to two additional performance measures, 
being performance against annually defined corporate objectives and reserve replacement performance. This resulted in one 
quarter of the award being determined by individual performance, one quarter by company performance, one quarter by 
performance against corporate objectives and one quarter by reserve replacement performance. The corporate objectives for 
2005 are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2006 corporate objectives.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors for 2005 was 66.6% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% 
of salary for the other executive directors. The bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance in 2005 are 
shown in the table on page 53. The maximum level of bonus award for other senior executives for 2005 was 40% of salary. The 
maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors for 2006 will be increased to 100%.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus 
scheme in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors. 
Pension Scheme
The Company is the principal employer for a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK: the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement 
Benefits Scheme. This scheme is non-contributory and all UK employees aged 18 and over are eligible to participate in the 
scheme. The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary (15% in respect of senior executives) to the pension scheme on 
behalf of all qualifying employees.
Sir Bill Gammell, Dr Mike Watts and Kevin Hart are members of the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme and are 
entitled to a contribution to the scheme equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries. Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy 
each have a personal pension plan and receive a contribution from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic 
salaries. Pursuant to new pension scheme regulations which will come into force on 6 April 2006 Phil Tracy has requested and 
the Company has agreed that no further contributions be made into his personal pension plan after 31 March 2006. Instead, 
with effect from 1 April 2006, the Company will pay an amount equivalent to the contributions to him as an additional salary. 
Further details of the contribution made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out on page 53. 
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme. Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this 
scheme. The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell.

Service Contracts
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the director 
concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. On a change of control of the Company resulting in the 
termination of a director’s employment, each of the directors is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to their annual basic 
salary as at the date of termination of employment. 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three year period, 
subject to the Company’s articles of association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years. The 
letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect 
by either the director concerned or the Company. The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits 
sufficient time to fulfil his duties as a director of the Company. None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest 
which has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. 
The terms and conditions for the appointment of the non-executive directors of the Company are available for inspection on 
request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 20 April 2006.
Details of the service contracts and letters of appointment of the current directors of the Company are given in the table below.

permitted to retain the fees relating to those positions. Details of the positions held and the fees receivable are set out in the 
table below.
Executive Director Position Held Fees (2005)

Malcolm Thoms Non-executive director, Revus Energy AS £28,775 (payable partly in cash and partly in shares)
Phil Tracy Non-executive director, Vienco Oil & Gas Limited £18,000 
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of executive directors accepting positions as non-executive directors of other 
companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments 
are not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any executive director to a non-executive position with another company must be approved by the Board. 
In the case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two 
companies do not compete in the same geographical area.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) 55
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements (the ‘ﬁ nancial statements’) of Cairn Energy PLC for 
the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, Group and Parent Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, Group and Parent Company Balance 
Sheets, Group and Parent Company Statement of Cash Flows 
and the related notes 1 to 32. These ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out 
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been 
audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union as set out in the 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement included in the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁ nancial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report 
is not consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements, if the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other transactions are not 
disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reﬂ ects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the 2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review 
by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all 
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements. The other information comprises the Highlights 
of 2005, Chairman’ s Statement, Chief Executive’ s Review, 
Geographical Assets, Operating and Exploration Review, 
Corporate Responsibility , Financial Review, Corporate Governance 
Statement, Directors’ Report and the unaudited part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the ﬁ nancial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

For the purposes of this table, 6 mscf of gas has been converted to 1boe.
In India and Bangladesh absolute title to any hydrocarbon reserves is vested in the host government. However, under the terms 
of the PSC’s, Cairn is entitled to receive a share of the hydrocarbon production and associated revenues. 
Group reserves have therefore been presented both on a direct entitlement basis and a direct working interest basis. The direct 
entitlement basis takes into account projections of government share of production calculated in accordance with certain price 
and expenditure assumptions. Entitlement interest reserves are utilised for unit of production basis calculations in the ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Direct working interest basis is Cairn’s share of production calculated by reference to our joint venture participating interest as 
shown in the Principal Licence Interests on page 56.
Reserves at 31 December 2004 were entirely attributable to the South Asia region. For details of the booking of new reserves 
and the revision to existing reserves during the year, see the Operational and Engineering Review on page 10.
Group reserves on an entitlement interest basis are calculated on the Group’s long term oil price assumption of $20/bbl. If the 
Group’s long term oil price assumption was $40/bbl, the addition of reserves in place in the year would be 152,694 mbbls and 
the Group’s total entitlement reserves at 31 December 2005 would be 201,926 mboe.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
For the year ended 31 December 2005 62
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Basis of preparation
Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis. Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this 
fact is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy.
b) Accounting standards
Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
EU. These are the ﬁ rst ﬁ nancial statements of Cairn to have been prepared under IFRS and the disclosures required by IFRS 1 
‘First time adoption of IFRS’ concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 32. 
Relevant new IFRS issued and adopted by the EU but not yet effective and not applied in these ﬁ nancial statements are as 
follows:
Title Change to accounting policy Date of adoption by Cairn Impact on initial application
Effective date from 1 January 2006
Effective date from 1 January 2007
IFRIC 4 ‘Determining 
whether an 
arrangement contains 
a lease’
No changes to 
current accounting 
policy
1 January 2006 IFRIC 4 provides guidance on determining 
whether arrangements that do not take the 
legal form of a lease should, nonetheless, 
be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 
‘Leases’. It speciﬁ es that an arrangement 
contains a lease if it depends on the use of a 
speciﬁ c asset and conveys a right to control the 
use of that asset.
A review of any such arrangements will be 
undertaken and, if appropriate, accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 17. No signiﬁ cant impact is 
expected.
IFRIC 5 ‘Rights to 
interests arising from 
decommissioning, 
restoration and 
environmental 
rehabilitation funds’
No changes to 
current accounting 
policy
1 January 2006 IFRIC 5 provides additional guidance on how 
to account for expected reimbursements 
from funds set up to meet the costs of 
decommissioning plant or equipment or in 
undertaking environmental restoration and 
rehabilitation.
Cairn is not a participant in any such funds at 
the present time. Consequently, no impact is 
expected to arise.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: 
Disclosures’ and 
amendment to IAS 32 
‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosure and 
presentation’
No changes to 
current accounting 
policy
1 January 2007 Additional disclosures regarding ﬁ nancial

entity’s capital
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 December 2005 63
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED)
No other IFRS issued and adopted but not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
During the year, Cairn early adopted IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources’ which did not become effective 
until 1 January 2006.
During the year, Cairn adopted IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: 
recognition and measurement’. Also during the year, Cairn adopted IFRS 5 ‘Non current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’ which became effective on 1 January 2005.
c) Presentational currency
The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling. These accounts have been 
presented in $, the functional currency of most companies within the Group. This is a change from prior years when the accounts 
were presented in the functional currency of the parent. It is deemed to be more appropriate to present the ﬁ nancial statements 
in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group. The Group’s policy on foreign currencies is detailed in note 1(p).
d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. Any 
goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and subject to annual review for impairment.
Business combinations arising prior to the Group’s transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004) have not been revisited under the 
exemption provided by IFRS 1. Deferred tax liabilities have, however, now been recognised on fair value adjustments that arose 
from past business combinations in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s230(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non disclosure of the 
Income Statement of the parent company. The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 was 
$11,214,000 (2004 restated: loss $22,450,000).
e) Joint ventures
Cairn participates in several joint ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas exploration 
and producing activities. Cairn accounts for its share of the assets and liabilities of joint ventures in which the Group holds a 
participating interest, classiﬁ ed in the appropriate Balance Sheet heading.
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue from operating activities
Revenue represents Cairn’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis and tariff 
income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income
Income received as operator from joint ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with joint venture agreements 
and is included as a deduction from administrative expenses. Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis and is 
recognised within ‘Finance income’ in the Income Statement.
Other income is not included within ‘Revenue’ disclosed on the face of the Income Statement but is disclosed in total income as 
per note 2.
g) Oil and gas intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment - development/producing assets
Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets. 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence by licence basis. Costs are 
held, undepleted, within exploration until such a time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial 
reserves have been discovered.  64
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED)
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
g) Oil and gas intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment - development/producing assets 
(continued)
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration/
appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities. Exploration/appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on 
a well by well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration/
appraisal effort is judged on a well by well basis. Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate 
that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. 
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration/appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
development/producing assets after testing for impairment (see below). Where results of exploration drilling indicate the 
presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the 
Income Statement. 
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are 
capitalised within development/producing assets on a field by field basis. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where 
it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/
producing asset. Any costs remaining associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any 
surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are 
credited against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in 
the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised 
costs of the asset.
Depletion
Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any signiﬁ cant components within development/producing assets, such as ﬁ elds, 
processing facilities and pipelines which are signiﬁ cant in relation to the total cost of a development/producing asset. 
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment - development/producing assets on a unit of production basis, 
based on proved and probable reserves on a ﬁ eld by ﬁ eld basis. In certain circumstances, ﬁ elds within a single development 
area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment
Exploration/appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. In such circumstances the exploration/appraisal asset is allocated 
to development/producing assets within the same geographic segment, as disclosed in the segmental analysis notes to the 
ﬁ nancial statements, and tested for impairment. Any such impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the 
period. Where there are no development/producing assets within a geographic segment, the exploration/appraisal costs are 
charged immediately to the Income Statement. 
Impairment reviews on development/producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identiﬁ ed in accordance 
with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Cairn’s cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash ﬂ ows 
and are normally, but not always, single development areas. 
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash-generating unit is compared 
with the associated expected discounted future net cash ﬂ ows. If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to 
the Income Statement as impairment. Discounted future net cash ﬂ ows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated oil 
price of $20/bbl (2004: $20/bbl) or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices 
and costs of 3% and a discount rate of 10% (2004: 3% and 10% respectively). Forecasted production proﬁ les are determined on 
an asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques. 
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has 
been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash ﬂ ows are higher than the net book value at 
the time. In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying 
value or the carrying value that would have been determined (net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior 
periods. 65

h) Property, plant & equipment – other
Tangible assets, other than oil and gas assets, are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives 
as follows:
 Annual Rate (%) Depreciation Method 
Tenants’ improvements  10 – 33* straight line
Vehicles and equipment 25 – 50 straight line
* Depreciation is charged over the shorter of 3 – 10 years or the remaining term of the lease.
i) Intangible assets – other
Intangible assets, other than oil and gas assets, have ﬁ nite useful lives and are measured at cost and amortised over their 
expected useful economic lives as follows:
 Annual Rate (%) Amortisation Method 
Software costs 25 – 50  straight line
j) Investments
Unlisted investments are measured at cost when there is no quoted market price available. Investments are carried at cost less 
provisions resulting from impairment.
k) Inventory
Inventories of oil and condensate held at the Balance Sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated 
selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l) Financial instruments
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoiced amount less any allowances for doubtful debts. 
Other debtors are recognised and measured at nominal value. Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Bank deposits
Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented 
on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade payables and other creditors
Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost. 
Interest bearing bank loans
Interest bearing bank loans represent amounts drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facilities, classiﬁ ed according to the 
length of time remaining under the respective facility. Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective 
interest rate method.
Borrowing costs
Interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects are capitalised 
within the development/producing asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
m) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share 
capital and share premium. 66

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
n) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable proﬁ t differs from net proﬁ t as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised. In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable proﬁ t will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ t will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be 
utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction.
o) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a ﬁ eld, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities. Cairn 
recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental 
damage arises. The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant and equipment – development/producing 
assets with the cost of the related installation. The liability is included within provisions. Revisions to the estimated costs of 
decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reﬂ ected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset. 
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the 
‘Depletion and decommissioning charge’ in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included 
within ‘Finance costs’.
p) Foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at 
the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are 
translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings speciﬁ cally allocable to development projects, 
which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of all subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency, which for all material subsidiaries is $. 
Where applicable, Cairn translates subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for 
assets and liabilities, which are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date, and rates at the 
date of the transactions for Income Statement accounts. Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets 
of Group companies whose functional currency is non $ directly to reserves. On transition to IFRS Cairn has taken advantage of 
the exemption offered under IFRS 1 and assumed zero brought forward translation differences on subsidiary undertakings as at 
1 January 2004. 67

q) Pension schemes
Cairn operates deﬁ ned contribution pension schemes in the UK and India. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of Cairn and its subsidiaries. Cairn also operates an insured beneﬁ t scheme for certain Indian employees as required under 
Indian legislation. In accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁ ts’ this is treated as a deﬁ ned contribution scheme. The pension 
cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
r) Leasing commitments
Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
s) Share schemes
The cost of awards to employees under Cairn’s LTIP and share option plans are recognised over the three year period to which 
the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award. 
The shares are valued using a binomial model.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust. The accounts of the ESOP Trust are 
aggregated into these ﬁ nancial statements.
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance (phantom options) are recognised over 
the period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the 
transaction.
t) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business. Such items are identiﬁ ed as 
exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
u) Key estimations and assumptions
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain ﬁ gures within the ﬁ nancial statements. The resulting 
accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time. Those areas believed to be key 
areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions used listed at the relevant note.

3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Geographical segments
As at 1 January 2004, the Group’s exploration, development and production activities were carried out in two geographical 
areas; South Asia and North Sea. Head ofﬁ ce costs relate to administrative expenses of Cairn’s head ofﬁ ce in Edinburgh, as 
well as taxation and interest expenses of the Group which cannot be allocated to a geographical segment. During 2004, Cairn 
disposed of its last remaining asset in the North Sea segment and as a consequence, the North Sea disclosures below relate 
to the discontinued operations presented in note 4(e).

The gain on sale in the year arises on the sale of assets, which completed in March 2005, as part of the ONGC transaction. 
See note 4(d) for details.
d) Transaction with ONGC
In March 2005 Cairn completed the transaction with ONGC whereby Cairn farmed-out interests in Blocks KG-DWN-98/2 
(90%) and CB/OS-2 (15% exploration interest and 10% interest in the Lakshmi and Gauri Development Areas) and farmed-in to 
interests in Blocks GV-ONN-97/1 (30%) and CB-ONN-2001/1 (30%). On completion, Cairn received gross proceeds of $135m. 
A working capital adjustment of $5.2m was paid to ONGC in July 2005 and professional costs of $2.3m were incurred in the 
completion of the deal.
The operating proﬁ ts from the farmed-out interests in the CB/OS-2 producing interest have been recognised in the Income 
Statement up to the date of completion. 
The farmed-out assets were included within the South Asia geographical segment.
A total gain on sale of $15.3m has been recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the farm-out. $2.2m of this gain is in 
respect of intangible exploration/appraisal assets. The proceeds relating to the sale of the development/producing assets were 
compared to the appropriate share of costs and the resultant gain of $13.1m has been recognised in the Income Statement. 72

LTIP
The fair value of the LTIP awards has been calculated using a binomial model. The main inputs to the model include the number 
of shares granted under each award, share price and the following performance conditions:
 • the recipient must remain an employee; and
 • total shareholder return (TSR) targets must be met whereby:
  •  TSR achieved by Cairn must exceed the TSR of the FTSE 250 and then the comparator group identiﬁ ed by the award 
conditions (Tier 1 awards).
  •  The percentage change in Cairn’s TSR over the performance period is compared to the percentage change in the average 
TSR of the comparator group over the same period (Tier 2 awards).
For further details on the vesting conditions attached to the LTIP refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The following awards granted after 7 November 2002 existed under the LTIP:

c) Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges
At 31 December 2005 Cairn had losses of approximately $98.0m (2004: $135.4m) available for offset against future trading 
proﬁ ts chargeable to UK Corporation Tax, surplus management expenses of $17.7m (2004: $21.7m) and a non trade deﬁ cit 
of $7.0m (2004: $7.7m) available for offset against future investment income. There were also capital losses of $24.3m at 
31 December 2005 (2004: $24.3m) available to offset future capital gains arising in the UK in Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited.
 
At 31 December 2005 Cairn had losses of approximately $5.4m (2004: $8.6m) available for offset against future trading proﬁ ts 
chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax but there are restrictions on the use of these losses. No deferred tax asset has 
been recognised in respect of these losses.
At 31 December 2005 Cairn had losses of approximately $4.8m (2004: $22.7m) available for offset against future trading proﬁ ts 
chargeable to Indian Corporate Income Tax.
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against proﬁ ts or gains arising in another jurisdiction.
10 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
The earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a proﬁ t of $79,072,000 (2004: loss $15,674,000) and on a weighted average of 
156,995,878 ordinary shares (2004: 152,522,282). The weighted average of ordinary shares excludes shares held under the LTIP 
– the shares are held by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees’ Share Trust.
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a proﬁ t of $79,072,000 and on 157,841,207 ordinary shares being the 
basic weighted average of 156,995,878 ordinary shares and the dilutive potential ordinary shares of 845,329 ordinary shares 
relating to share options. In respect of 2004, 1,191,457 potential ordinary shares were anti-dilutive. 77

At the Balance Sheet date the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $69.9m (2004: $13.4m). No liability has been recognised in 
respect of these differences because Cairn is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and 
it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at the Balance Sheet date a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of losses of $24.4m (2004: $21.7m) where it is 
not probable that they can be utilised in future periods.

    ––––––––––– ––––––––––– –––––––––––
Provisions at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 are categorised as non-current liabilities. 
Decommissioning costs are expected to be incurred between 2013 and 2020 (2004: 2013 and 2020). The provision has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% p.a (2004: 7%). The 
change in decommissioning estimate in the year has arisen primarily as a result of the disposal of a 10% development interest in 
the Lakshmi and Gauri development areas. See note 4(d) for further details.
Other provisions are principally accrued production payments payable to the Government of India (GoI) speciﬁ ed within the 
Ravva PSC. Payments become due upon certain cumulative production levels being met and will be made throughout the 
life of the ﬁ eld. Of these payments, $5.6m was paid during 2005. In the prior year also included in other provisions was the 
$35.3m provision in respect of additional proﬁ t petroleum payments which have now been settled. A contingent liability has 
been disclosed within these ﬁ nancial statements in respect of additional payments that may fall due with regard to the Ravva 
arbitration proceedings (see note 30).

Shares held by ESOP Trust
Shares held by the ESOP Trust represent the cost of shares held by the ESOP Trust at 31 December 2005. The number of shares 
held by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees’ Share Trust at 31 December 2005 was 2,782,843 (2004: 2,513,607) and the market 
value of these shares was £53,430,586 (2004: £27,398,316).
Foreign currency translation
Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves 
in accordance with IAS 21 ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’. Under the ﬁ rst time adoption exemptions under 
IFRS 1, cumulative translation differences have been set to zero as at 1 January 2004.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation 
reﬂ ecting the exposure to currency ﬂ uctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies. These intra-
group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Other reserves
Other reserves include capital redemption reserves of subsidiary undertakings.
Capital reserves – non-distributable
Capital reserves – non-distributable include non-distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions.

25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Cairn’s primary ﬁ nancial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short and medium term deposits. The Group’s strategy has 
been to ﬁ nance its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁ ts and bank borrowings. Other alternatives like equity ﬁ nance 
and project ﬁ nance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development 
projects.
The Group treasury function is responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash ﬂ ow 
monitoring. It must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn has adequate 
liquidity at all times in order to meet its immediate cash requirements.
Cairn may from time to time, opt to use derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to minimise its exposure to ﬂ uctuations in foreign 
exchange rates, interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices. Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments have not been used 
throughout 2004 or 2005. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, Cairn’s policy that no trading in derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from Cairn’s ﬁ nancial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price 
risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
In addition, a $35m facility is in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees. Fixed rates of interest apply to this facility. $28.7m 
was unutilised at 31 December 2005 (2004: $5m).
Liquidity risk
Cairn has $240m ($40m 7 year and $200m 3 year) unsecured committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities available under 
corporate bilateral agreements to fund its activities. These revolving credit facilities give the Group ﬂ exibility to borrow and 
repay debt as and when appropriate. No debt was drawn at 31 December 2005 under these facilities (2004: $nil). 
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed on short and medium term deposit, ensuring sufﬁ cient liquidity to 
enable the Group to meet its short/medium term expenditure requirements.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED) 87
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed on short/medium term deposit at ﬂ oating rates. It is Cairn’s general policy to deposit funds with a bank 
or banks that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
Short/medium term borrowing arrangements are available at ﬂ oating rates. The treasury function may from time to time opt to 
manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative ﬁ nancial instruments like interest rate swaps. At this 
time, however, there is no requirement for such instruments as there is no debt drawn.
Foreign currency risk
Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the 
same currency, and actively managing the residual net position.
In order to minimise Cairn’s exposure to foreign currency ﬂ uctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by 
borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate. The loan facilities allow 
loans denominated in $, Sterling, Euro or such other currency as may be agreed between the lenders and Cairn from time to 
time.
Cairn now reports in $ which, with most assets $ denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the 
Group’s Balance Sheet.
No forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into during 2005. There were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
Commodity price risk
There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, Lakshmi and Ravva 
Gas Sales Contracts (GSCs). The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva oil sales are required to be made to approved government nominated buyers at ﬂ oating prices. 
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during 2005. There were no outstanding commodity price 
contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
Credit risk
Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the Lakshmi and Sangu 
GSCs. With respect to Ravva there is no payment security, however the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
With respect to deposit and treasury arrangements, as a general rule Cairn only use banks that have a Moody’s rating for long 
term deposits of A and above. Banks rated A offer good credit quality. 
The Board will continue to assess the Group’s strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing policies as 
satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia. At the year end the Group does not have any signiﬁ cant concentrations of bad 
debt risk and overall the exposure to bad debts is not considered to be signiﬁ cant.

The calculation of the GoI share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oilﬁ eld has been a matter of disagreement for some 
years and the disputed issues were put to arbitration in 2002 with a view to binding all parties to the arbitration panel’s decision.
 
The arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as 
favourable as had been hoped. The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts against one issue (‘the ONGC 
carry’) which the panel found in Cairn’s favour. This one issue has the largest economic impact. 
Cairn has challenged both the GoI’s right to appeal, and the grounds of that appeal. If the GoI were successful on both these 
points, it is unclear what process would then follow to resolve the original issue under dispute. Cairn will defend its right to 
continue to refer to the existing arbitration panel, whose composition and terms of reference were agreed by all parties at the 
outset.
In the event that the GoI’s appeal succeeded and a process then ensued which concluded with the arbitration award on the 
ONGC carry being reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding, then Cairn would be due to pay an 
additional $63.9m.
As the GoI share of proﬁ t petroleum is now agreed by all to have reached maximum entitlement, there would be no additional 
impact on Cairn’s oil and gas reserves.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
32 EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS (continued)
Reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS
a) IFRS 6 adjustments
Pre-exploration write-offs
Under IFRS 6, costs incurred prior to the legal rights to explore an area being obtained may no longer be capitalised within 
exploration/appraisal assets. Such costs incurred by Cairn in prior years totalling £18.7m, including general exploration/appraisal 
costs not related to a speciﬁ c licence, have therefore been written off through retained earnings as at 31 December 2003. 
During 2004 Cairn incurred pre-exploration costs of £37,000 which have been expensed through the Income Statement (see h) 
below).
Impairment of exploration/appraisal assets
Previously under UK GAAP and the Statement of Recommended Practice (‘SORP’) issued by the Oil Industry Accounting 
Committee (‘OIAC’), where indicators of impairment existed on an asset held within the exploration/appraisal cost pool, an 
impairment test was performed. Any resulting impairment of an exploration/appraisal asset led to a transfer of the impaired 
amount into the depletable development/producing cost pool, the latter being subject to a separate impairment test.
Under IFRS 6, where indicators of impairment exist on an exploration/appraisal asset, an impairment test is performed by 
assigning the asset to the associated development/producing assets within the same geographic segment and testing this 
combined cost against future net discounted cash ﬂ ows (including any associated with the exploration/appraisal asset). Any 
impairment arising would be recognised directly in the Income Statement for the period. Where no development/producing 
assets exists, impairment losses arising on the exploration/appraisal would be written off immediately to the Income Statement.
As a consequence of this change, previous transfers between Cairn’s exploration/appraisal and development/producing cost 
pools of £4.2m, which arose from the impairment of exploration/appraisal assets, have been reversed. Impairment tests have 
then been reperformed using the IFRS approach with no impairment losses arising.
b) Fair value adjustments 
Cairn has elected to measure certain development/producing assets at the transition date to IFRS at fair value and use this 
fair value as their deemed cost, as allowable under IFRS 1. The total of deemed cost calculated by reference to fair value can 
be seen on the Balance Sheet reconciliations under column b) ‘Fair value adjustments’ on the ‘Property, plant & equipment 
– development/producing assets’ line.
As a result of measuring at fair value at transition date, the exceptional gain on sale under UK GAAP of the sale of the Group’s 
North Sea producing asset in 2004 now results in neither a gain nor a loss being recognised.
c) Unsuccessful exploration/appraisal costs
Cairn previously followed the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets. Under this method, all expenditure incurred 
in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas assets 
were capitalised in two geographical cost pools: South Asia and North Sea. Following guidance from IFRIC in November 2005 
it is no longer permissible to continue this treatment for development/producing assets. Cairn has therefore decided to change 
accounting policies for both exploration/appraisal and development/producing assets to a successful efforts based policy.
Under the Group’s new policy unsuccessful exploration costs previously capitalised (subject to impairment reviews) are now 
written off in the period in which they are determined to be unsuccessful. The adjustments for unsuccessful costs written off 
in the period have been made against the Balance Sheet classiﬁ cations as used under the UK GAAP full cost accounting 
methodology.
d) Depletion and decommissioning
The adjustments to depletion and decommissioning reﬂ ect the revised carrying value of the development/producing assets as a 
result of the pre-exploration write offs, fair value adjustments and the write off of exploration/appraisal costs (as per notes a) to c) 
above). Depletion is now charged on a ﬁ eld by ﬁ eld basis, with certain ﬁ elds within development areas being combined where 
appropriate. It is also now calculated in the functional currency of $ rather than in Sterling as was previously the case under UK 
GAAP .
e) Foreign currency translation
IAS 21 requires that the functional currency for each subsidiary within the Group be determined. Where the functional currency 
is different from the Group’s Sterling presentational currency, all assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries should be converted 
to Sterling at closing rates on consolidation.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED) 99
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (CONTINUED)
Given that the Group’s income and expenses are mainly received and incurred in $, the majority of the Group’s subsidiary 
undertakings have a $ functional currency. This includes UK based subsidiaries holding oil and gas exploration/appraisal and 
development/producing assets. These subsidiaries were fully translated from $ to Sterling at the closing rate at the Balance 
Sheet date on consolidation (rather than historic Sterling conversions) in the 2004 restated results presented in Sterling. 
In accordance with IAS 21, cumulative exchange differences are now recognised as a separate component within equity. 
Cairn has taken advantage of the exemptions offered under IFRS 1 and deemed cumulative translation differences to be zero 
at 31 December 2003. 
f) Taxation
Deferred tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments made in prior business combinations have been recognised on 
transition to IFRS. Such liabilities were speciﬁ cally excluded from recognition under UK GAAP . These deferred tax liabilities are 
only likely to crystallise on disposal of the assets concerned and will reduce as the carrying values of the underlying assets are 
depleted on a unit of production basis.
A deferred tax asset has been created as at 31 December 2004 due to the lower net book values arising under the successful 
efforts based accounting policy and the associated recognition requirements under IFRS. 
g) Share based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, Cairn has recognised a charge for share awards made to employees under its LTIP and share option 
plans since 7 November 2002. This charge is based on the fair value of these awards. The fair value has been calculated using 
a binomial valuation model and is charged to the Income Statement over the relevant vesting period, adjusted to reﬂ ect actual 
and expected levels of vesting. In accordance with IFRS, only awards made after 7 November 2002 should be charged through 
the Income Statement, therefore LTIP charges relating to awards made prior to this date have been reversed. Share options 
awarded prior to this date were not previously charged to the Income Statement.
The reconciling credit of £3.7m between the UK GAAP and the IFRS Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 
is a consequence of the differing fair value methodologies of the binomial valuation model used to fair value LTIP awards under 
IFRS 2 from that previously used to fair value such awards under UK GAAP , the charge relating to share options awarded post 7 
November 2002 and the credit for LTIP charges relating to awards prior to this date.
h) Other adjustments
1)  Cairn have introduced an accrual of £55,000 at 31 December 2003, increasing to £104,000 at 31 December 2004 relating to 
employees entitlements to annual leave, as required by IAS 19 ‘Employee beneﬁ ts’. 
2) Pre-exploration costs of £37,000 have been expensed during 2004 (see note a) above).
3)  The following reclassiﬁ cations have been made in accordance with IAS 1, which requires separate disclosure of certain assets 
and liabilities on the face of the Balance Sheet:
 •  Oil and condensate inventory of £2.3m at 31 December 2003 and £1.1m at 31 December 2004 has been reclassiﬁ ed from 
‘trade and other receivables’;
 •  Current taxation liabilities of £5.7m at 31 December 2003 and £2.9m at 31 December 2004 have been reclassiﬁ ed from 
‘trade and other payables’; and
 •  Computer software costs previously held as ‘tangible ﬁ xed assets’ and within ‘prepayments’ have been reclassiﬁ ed to 
‘intangible assets’ in accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’.
4)  In accordance with the Group’s revised accounting policy, cash and cash equivalents include only short-term deposits with a 
maturity of less than three months. As a consequence, £8.0 million of long term deposits at 31 December 2004 have been 
reclassiﬁ ed to ‘bank deposits’. 
i) Cash flow statements
The IFRS Cash Flow Statement, prepared under IAS 7 ‘Cash ﬂ ow statements’, presents cash ﬂ ows in three categories; cash 
ﬂ ows from operating activities, cash ﬂ ows from investing activities and cash ﬂ ows from ﬁ nancing activities. This is fewer than the 
previous seven categories under UK GAAP . Other than the reclassiﬁ cation of cash ﬂ ow items into the new disclosure categories, 
there are no signiﬁ cant differences between the Group’s Cash Flow Statement under UK GAAP and IFRS. 100

1  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, to 
vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A form of proxy accompanies this Annual Report 
and must be lodged with the Company at the ofﬁ ce of its registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West 
Sussex BN99 6ZR (the ‘Registrars’) or received via the Sharevote service (see Note 2 below) (a) not less than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for the meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof, or (b) lodged using the CREST proxy voting service (see 
Note 5 below). Only holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend (in person or by proxy) and vote at the meeting. The 
appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting from doing so if he or she 
wishes. 
2  Members may register their proxy appointments or voting directions electronically via the www.sharevote.co.uk website, 
where full details of the procedure are given. Members will need the Reference Number, Card ID and Account Number 
set out on the form of proxy which accompanies this Annual Report. If more than one proxy appointment per member is 
returned, either by paper or by electronic communication, those received last by the Registrars before the latest time for the 
receipt of proxies will take precedence. Members are advised to read the terms and conditions of use carefully. Electronic 
communication facilities are available to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged. The Company 
will not accept any communication that is found to contain a computer virus.
3  There will be available for inspection at the registered ofﬁ ce of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday 
(excluding public holidays) from the date of this notice until the date of the meeting and at the place of the meeting for at

attend or vote at the meeting in respect of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register of 
members after 6.00 pm on 18 April 2006 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at 
the meeting, notwithstanding any provisions in any enactment, the articles of association 
of the Company or other instrument to the contrary. 102
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
5  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 April 2006 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members 
who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be 
able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s speciﬁ cations and must contain 
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in 
order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrars by no later than 12.00 pm on 18 April 2006. No such 
message received through the CREST network after this time will be accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which 
the Registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other 
means. 
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that CRESTCo does 
not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will 
therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned 
to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure 
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members 
and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the 
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertiﬁ cated Securities Regulations 2001.
6  This Notice of Annual General Meeting should be read in conjunction with the sections of the Annual Report entitled ‘Board 
of Directors’ on pages 30 and 31 and ‘Directors’ Report’ on pages 43 to 45.

COMPANY INFORMATION CAIRN ENERGY PLC IS A SCOTTISH BASED OIL AND GAS 
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WHOSE ACTIVITIES 
ARE FOCUSED ON SOUTH ASIA
Our interest in South Asia has been active for more than a decade where we are the 
biggest overseas exploration and production company currently operating in India. 
Our assets include three processing plants, 12 platforms, 250 kilometres of pipelines and 
several active drilling programmes. We have made more than 25 oil and gas discoveries 
and are now sitting on more than 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place in Rajasthan including 
the world class Mangala field, the biggest oil discovery in India for 22 years. To date we 
have made 17 discoveries in Rajasthan. 
Since establishing this new hydrocarbons basin we are wholly focused on strengthening our 
relationship with the Government of India, the State Government of Rajasthan, and ONGC 
to bring these resources into production as soon as possible, helping secure the energy 
needs of the third fastest growing economy in the world.
We believe our success has been made possible through strong external relationships and 
partnerships along with creative thinking, depth of knowledge and the experience of the 
employees, management and Board of the Company. We also believe our ability to work 
with and alongside the people of South Asia has strengthened our position immeasurably. 
Cairn’s entrepreneurial spirit, pioneering discoveries, conservative approach and long term 
production plans are helping answer the region’s energy security needs for the future.

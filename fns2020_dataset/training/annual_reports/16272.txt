Deliveries of palletised goods now offered
through the acquisition of UK Pallets
Launch of UK Mail after the end of the year
Exceptional growth in home delivery
volumes via HomeServe I am pleased to report another year of considerable
progress, in line with the Three Year Plan set out in
November 2001.  In particular, pre-tax profit
increased substantially and a strong base has been
established for further profitable development.
FINANCE
On turnover up 23% at £192.7m, pre-tax profit increased
by 19% to £19.1m and earnings per share advanced by
16% to 24.5p, in both cases before deducting goodwill
amortisation of £0.4m (2003: £nil).
Pre-tax profit increased by 16% to £18.7m and earnings
per share advanced by 12% to 23.8p after the deduction
of goodwill amortisation.
Net cash inflow from operating activities rose strongly, to
£22.6m from £13.7m. For the first time since flotation in
1993, Business Post finished the year with net debt (of
£5.6m) and this was entirely due to the UK Pallets
acquisition.
Post-tax return on average net assets increased to 26.5%
from an already substantial 25.1%. 
DIVIDENDS
It is proposed that dividends per share be increased by
7% to 18.0p. 
The increased 1.36x cover by earnings per share before
goodwill amortisation (and 1.32x after goodwill
amortisation) is in the line with the Board’s policy of
increasing dividend cover whilst also increasing
dividends per share.
BUSINESS
The Three Year Plan envisaged two speed progress, with
the newer and smaller businesses advancing at a faster
rate than the traditional Express business-to-business
parcel activity, and this has proved to be the case in the
year under review. 
Whilst Express grew its turnover by 3% in the year, it
increased its market share to an estimated 7
1
/ 2% and
maintained its very high levels of service performance. 
Amongst the newer and smaller businesses, of special
note was the strong growth in HomeServe, operating in
the business-to-consumer market.Launched in January
2000, HomeServe’s turnover increase of 129% followed
an underlying 130% increase in the previous year.
In the year, Business Post made its most significant
acquisition to date, Weaver Pallet Express, since 
re-branded as UK Pallets, a nationwide express
palletised goods delivery service. This specialised
market is experiencing annual growth of around 30% and
we are delighted with this acquisition. 
Of historic significance, in February 2004 Business Post’s
subsidiary, UK Mail, and Royal Mail signed the first
agreement of its kind in Europe, enabling access to
Royal Mail’s downstream delivery network for UK Mail’s
Business Class service.  On 10 May 2004, UK Mail
transported its first letters on behalf of a customer, and
we are very optimistic about further developments this
year.
PERSONNEL
In October 2003, Russell Hodgson, Group Operations
Director, was promoted to Group Managing Director, Parcel
Services reporting to Paul Carvell, Chief Executive. Thereby,
Russell assumed responsibility for the Express, International
and HomeServe business units, all of which rely on the
shared parcels infrastructure of Network Services. By
bringing our parcel services together, we will bring additional
focus to the Group’s principal area of activities and assist us
in maximising our operational leverage.
Richard Saville retires as a non-executive Director on 31
May 2004, having been a non-executive Director since
October 1998. His replacement, who was appointed on 
1 April 2004, is Philip Stephens, aged 61, who was
involved in corporate finance and broking for more than
35 years until his retirement in 2002.
To all the Group employees and associates who are
involved in the owned and franchised depots, I extend
my thanks on behalf of all shareholders.
PROSPECTS
The Board expects further good progress in the current
year and remains very confident about the Group’s long
term potential.

Business Post BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Business Post provides high quality services for
time sensitive deliveries, offering excellent delivery
performance supported by information systems
which are at the forefront of the industry.
Through partnerships and alliances, deliveries can be
made anywhere in the world. However, all the Group’s
business has a UK element and approaching 90% is
intra-UK.
Deliveries range from documents to pallet-based
heavy freight, but the vast majority comprises
packages weighing 5-30kg.
The sectors served are overnight business-to-business
(by the Express, International and UK Pallets business
units), time-definite business-to-consumer (by
HomeServe) and same day (by Courier).  UK Mail, the
Group’s UK business mail service, offers a two day
“Business Class” service.  
For letters and parcels, Express, International,
HomeServe and UK Mail all perform collection and
delivery activity in the UK through a network of 23
corporate and 38 franchised depots linked by an
overnight linehaul operation owned and managed
centrally. International has its gateway site at Bishops
Stortford linked to FedEx’s own air hub at Stansted.
UK Today currently operates from 14 of the depots
but, due to the same day nature of its business,
operates its own pool of drivers and does not utilise
the overnight linehaul operation.
For overnight deliveries, packages and bags of mail
are sorted into metal cages at collection locations, and
these cages transit the country to the relevant delivery
location, thereby reducing the level of manhandling
and risk of damage. Although there is a national hub
at Birmingham, regional sorting is also carried out at
certain mini-hub operations. This reduces vehicle
mileage and enables later collection times from
customers.
The requirements for handling pallet-based freight are
different from mail and parcels, and are managed
through a separate network, comprising a partnership
of 70 independent haulage companies throughout the
UK. Each partner transports pallets of freight into a
central hub in Lichfield, Staffordshire, for onward
shipment, and returns with pallets for delivery on
behalf of other partners.
Sales and customer services are decentralised at each
of the locations, but supported by central marketing
and sales management, and a telesales operation at
UK Today.
As an express delivery business, the Group’s
customers are from a wide range of industry sectors,
including retail (mainly HomeServe), building (UK
Pallets) and publishing. However, the nature of the
Group’s parcel operation, with the use of cages to
transport packages securely and with the minimum of
manhandling, makes our services particularly attractive
to the high-tech sector.
The entire market is deregulated, with the exception of
the UK letter market below 350g or £1, in which UK
Mail operates. This is regulated by Postcomm, an
independent body established by statute in 2000.
A summary of the main developments within each of
the business units is set out on the following pages.

Chief Executive’s Review - Business Post Express
Express has improved
its quality of revenue
during the year through
greater focus on its
customer base
Express, which accounted for 66% (2003: 79%) of Group
turnover, is the Group’s core UK business-to-business parcel
service. It specialises in next-day deliveries for those
customers who need a reliable service backed up by
sophisticated information systems, thereby differentiating itself
from high volume/low price operators.
Express made good progress against subdued market
conditions, improving its market share to some 7
1
/ 2% and
increasing its annual turnover by 3% to £127.5m (2003:
£123.8m). The high quality of delivery performance continues to
assist in new business wins and reduction of customer churn.
Express implemented a number of pricing initiatives at the end of
last year which have held up well during the year, and also
improved the quality of revenue by targeting users of premium
services and by discontinuing less profitable business.
Recent levels of new business wins have been among the
Company’s highest on record and there are initial indications that
the high-tech sector may be experiencing a recovery. In the
current year, Express will maintain its focus on quality of revenue,
positioning itself further at the premium end of the market, and
will also look to introduce new services to existing customers.
The Directors therefore expect increased growth from Express 
in the current financial year.

With the market estimated
to be worth approximately 
£1 billion, International has
considerable scope for
growth.
International, which accounted for 11% (2003: 12%) of Group
turnover, is responsible for all shipments coming into and
leaving the UK and the Republic of Ireland and is primarily a
business-to-business service. A high proportion of its activity
derives from Business Post’s agreement with FedEx, the
world’s largest express transportation company, as its Global
Service Participant in the UK.  Under this contract, Business
Post is responsible for collecting and delivering parcels for
FedEx customers in those areas of the UK not directly served
by FedEx, and Business Post offers a full outward-bound air
express service utilising the worldwide FedEx delivery network.
Additionally, as a member of the Eurodis network, International
handles road-based express shipments within Europe.
International increased its turnover during the year by 17% to
£21.2m (2003: £18.2m), with an increased rate of growth in the
second half.  International Mail continues to develop strongly,
offering business customers an alternative to Royal Mail for their
overseas postal requirements. First launched in July 2002, it
increased its turnover to £1.6m from £0.3m. FedEx-related
business also showed good progress, reflecting the higher rates
of growth in cross-border shipments than the domestic market.
The relationship remains strong, and FedEx has recently awarded
Business Post its international priority freight business, extending
the existing collection and delivery activity from small packages
to bulkier freight items. 
The new Eurodis road arrangement, providing a new delivery
network across Europe with full on-line track-and-trace
capabilities, was launched on schedule in January 2004 and
increased both outbound and inbound turnover in the fourth
quarter. Also in January 2004, International expanded its
operations in the Republic of Ireland through the appointment of
Nightline, an independent eight depot business, to carry out its
deliveries. This provides a strong platform for services into this
important market.

HomeServe, which accounted for 9% (2003: 5%) of Group
turnover, is the Group’s UK business-to-consumer parcel
service, providing a high quality time-definite service to
residential addresses, with full proof of delivery and track-and-
trace facilities.
During the year, HomeServe increased its turnover by an
excellent 129% to £17.4m (2003: £7.6m). The continued success
of HomeServe, following an underlying increase of 130% last
year, reflects a rapidly growing market and also a targeted sales
approach, concentrating on the upper end of the market where
customers are looking for a high quality time-definite delivery
service.
HomeServe will continue to focus its sales efforts on major
manufacturers and retailers and will also continue to explore new
products, offering improved service and a wider range of drop-off
points. Chief Executive’s Review - Business Post Network Services
Business Post
08
Key Points - Network Services
Network Services is responsible for providing high quality
collection and delivery services to the business units within
Parcel Services at a low unit cost.
During the year, the level of on-time deliveries remained
consistently high, and cost increases were kept well below
inflationary levels. The operation benefited from the continued
introduction of double-decked trailers, which enable more
parcels to be shipped in one vehicle movement, and from the
introduction of a new breed of hand-held scanner. Capital
expenditure of £1.6m was incurred during the year on these two
initiatives and a further £2.1m will be spent in the current year as
the new generation scanners are rolled out across the network. 
As the major employer in the Group, Network Services’ principal
challenges for the current financial year are to enhance further
the level of both employee and customer satisfaction. The
Group’s new Employee Consultative Group is operating well and
the feedback from employee satisfaction surveys is being
incorporated into the Group’s practices. Customers are already
benefiting from the advantages of the Group’s new Customer
Relationship Management software, Discovery, and further action
is planned under an internal project, “Delta”, to enhance its use
and give customers improved service when they contact our
depots.

Chief Executive’s Review - Courier
Business Post’s Courier activity, which comprises UK Today
and the re-branded BXTech, accounted for 5% (2003: 3%) of
Group turnover. During the year, Courier increased its turnover
by 133% to £10.5m (2003: £4.5m).   
UK Today is the Group’s UK nationwide same-day courier
service. It operates out of corporate and franchised depots, 
using dedicated delivery vehicles, and has access to the 
National Express coach network linking 1,200 locations each day.
UK Today increased its turnover by 48%, with customer wins both
nationally and locally, but its gross profit margins fell as difficulty
was experienced in recruiting high quality owner drivers at the
same rate as the growth of the business. In the current year,
growth rates for UK Today will be lower, but the current focus 
on improved margins is expected to result in a strong increase 
in profit.
BXTech, the Birmingham-based technical courier active in the
computer, medical and utilities sectors, continues to progress
well.  After a period of consolidation in its first year in the Group,
the emphasis in the current year will be to expand the
geographical spread of activities. The company’s first ever
technical sales director has been appointed, with a focus on
desktop support services.

The acquisition of UK 
Pallets is Business Post’s
most significant to date and
adds another complementary
service for customers
UK Pallets provides a nationwide express palletised goods
delivery service through a partnership network with 70
independent haulage businesses throughout the UK. Run from
a national hub at Lichfield (Staffordshire), UK Pallets currently
handles more than 4,000 pallets each night and is estimated to
be the UK’s fourth largest pallet network company, in a market
that is experiencing annual growth of around 30%.
In the eight months since its acquisition, UK Pallets generated 
a turnover of £14.4m, a substantial increase on the comparable
period of the previous year and representing 8% of Group
turnover. Service levels have remained very high, with over 98% 
of all deliveries being made on time.
A focus for the current financial year is the transfer of existing IT
expertise from Business Post’s parcel businesses to benefit UK
Pallets’ customers and partnership network. Additionally,
following the receipt of planning permission in January 2004, 
it is intended to double the size of its national hub by September 
to enable it to handle daily volumes of up to 8,000 pallets. 11

On 10 February 2004, following an extended period of
negotiation, UK Mail and Royal Mail signed the first agreement
of its kind in Europe, on mutually satisfactory terms. This
enables access to Royal Mail’s downstream delivery network
for UK Mail’s Business Class service, which offers two day mail
delivery with track-and-trace up to the point of handover to
Royal Mail and flexibility of collection to large mailers (initially,
businesses mailing over 4,000 and, typically, over 10,000 pre-
sorted letters a day). 
We were delighted to reach an amicable agreement with Royal
Mail.  The terms we agreed were substantially similar to those
that would have been determined by Postcomm. Following
successful trials during April, on 10 May 2004, UK Mail
commenced daily collections on behalf of a blue chip company,
and it is also in advanced stages of negotiation with other
significant mailers.

REVENUES
2004 2003 Increase
Turnover £192.7m £156.3m 23%
The 23% turnover increase represents like-for-like growth of 11% and a contribution from the acquisitions of BXT (since
re-branded BXTech) in February 2003 and Weaver Pallet Express (since re-branded UK Pallets) at the end of July 2003.
The overall increase reflects the two-speed strategy being pursued by the Company, with relatively modest growth in
Express, which operates in the more mature business-to-business sector, being complemented by rapid progress in the
newer businesses and also from acquisitions.  In the full year, turnover growth ranged from 3% for Express to 129% for
HomeServe and 133% for Courier (which comprises UK Today and BXTech). 
Reflecting the extremely strong increase experienced in the second half of last year, like-for-like growth reduced from
15% in the first half to 9% in the second half. With the acquisitions of BXTech and UK Pallets, the overall increase was
unchanged, at 23%, in both first and second halves.
PROFIT
2004 2003 Increase
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation £19.1m £15.6m 22%
Pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation £19.1m £16.1m 19%
Operating profit after goodwill amortisation £18.7m £15.6m 20%
Pre-tax profit after goodwill amortisation £18.7m £16.1m 16%
The year ended 31 March 2004 was one of strong profit growth. The like-for-like increase in operating profit before
goodwill amortisation was 13% (compared with turnover growth of 11%) and margins at this level improved to 10.1%
from 10.0% last year. The effect of the acquisition of UK Pallets has been to dilute these margins slightly, to 9.9%. After
goodwill amortisation, operating profit increased by 20% to £18.7m (2003: £15.6m).
The figures for pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation are stated after interest receivable of £nil (2003: £0.5m), the
reduction from the prior year reflecting the aggregate £11.5m cash costs of the two acquisitions. After goodwill
amortisation, the increase in pre-tax profit was 16% to £18.7m (2003: £16.1m).
EARNINGS
2004 2003 Increase
Earnings per share before goodwill amortisation 24.5p 21.2p 16%
Earnings per share after goodwill amortisation 23.8p 21.2p 12%
The 16% increase in earnings per share reflects an effective tax rate of 31.9% (2003: 30.4%) before goodwill amortisation.
This higher tax rate than in recent years reflects adjustments of £0.3m relating to prior years’ deferred tax. After goodwill
amortisation, earnings per share increased by 12% to 23.8p.
DIVIDENDS
2004 2003 Increase
Dividends per share 18.0p 16.9p 7%
A final dividend per share of 12.05p (2003: 11.3p), up 7%, is proposed, payable on 22 July 2004 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 2 July 2004. The ex-dividend date is 30 June 2004.
T ogether with the interim dividend per share of 5.95p (2003: 5.6p), dividends per share are 7% higher at 18.0p (2003: 16.9p),
covered 1.36x (2003: 1.25x) by EPS before goodwill amortisation (1.32x after goodwill amortisation).

14 CASH FLOW
2004 2003
Cash inflow from operating activities £22.6m £13.7m
Net (debt)/cash £(5.6)m £1.6m
Net cash inflow from operating activities increased strongly from £13.7m to £22.6m. This result was assisted by
increased profits, a good reduction in working capital despite the significant growth in the business, and a reduction
in amounts due from franchisees.
Net capital expenditure increased to £5.8m from £4.1m, mainly as a result of continuing spend on double decked trailers
and IT . In the current year, with the extensive roll-out of new hand-held scanners to replace the ones bought in 2000,
capital expenditure is expected to increase to some £6.5m.
The acquisition of UK Pallets, representing £9.6m in cash consideration and expenses, was financed by a £10m term
loan, repayable over 10 years. As a result, for the first time since flotation in 1993, Business Post finished the year
with net debt of £5.6m compared with £13.9m at the half year end. This reduction reflects both the seasonality of the
business and also strong working capital management in the second half.
BALANCE SHEET
2004 2003
Goodwill £10.8m £1.7m
Equity shareholders’ funds £49.2m £45.8m
Gearing 11%
__
The acquisition of UK Pallets resulted in additional goodwill of £9.5m during the year and year-end gearing of 11% (2003:
£nil). The balance sheet remains strong, and the Group’s after-tax return on average net assets increased from
25.1% to 26.5%.
EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL RISK
The Group is not significantly exposed to the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates since all income is in sterling
and costs denominated in foreign currency represent less than 5% of all expenditure.
During the year, the Group entered into a 10 year term loan, but the Group’s profitability and strong levels of cash
flow mean that it is not significantly exposed to liquidity risk.  The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk has been
reduced by entering into an interest rate cap hedging contract, and its exposure to fluctuations resulting from
movements in fuel prices has been reduced by entering into a fuel hedge contract.
TREASURY POLICY
The treasury function is run prudently, with cash invested in low risk cash deposits. The Group uses a deposit in Euros to
hedge the Group's limited exposure to purchases denominated in European currency, and gains and losses on the re-
translation of this account offset increases or decreases in the sterling equivalent value of foreign purchases. At the year
end, the balance on this account was £0.3m.
SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE
The shares closed at 354p on the 31 March 2003. The beginning of
Business Post’s financial year coincided almost exactly with the
stockmarket’s seven year low. This market weakness had been
prompted by concerns over the imminent war in Iraq. As hostilities
commenced, the market recovered sharply and the Business Post
share price participated fully in the rise despite having substantially
outperformed in the second half of the previous year. The share
price retreated towards the end of the financial year to 460p  as
small investors took profits after the announcement of the historic
agreement with Royal Mail. The shares recovered in the second
week of March to close the year at 490.5p.

Business Post
Directors & Advisers Corporate Governance
The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require listed companies to disclose
how they comply with the principles of good governance and code of best
practice known as the Combined Code. During 2003 the Combined Code,
originally adopted in 1998, was revised and the Company is required to comply
with the revised Code from 1 April 2004.  Prior to that, including the period
covered by this Annual Report, the Company was required to comply with the
1998 Code and this statement, which incorporates the statement on corporate
social responsibility, explains how the Company has applied the principles of
good governance set out in Section 1 of the 1998 Combined Code.
The Board
During the year Business Post maintained an equal balance of executive and non
executive directors. Biographical details of all directors, including those of Philip
Stephens, who was appointed on 1 April 2004, are set out in the Directors and
Advisers statement. Of the five non-executive directors who served during the
year, two are judged to be independent according to the guidelines set out by the
Association of British Insurers; the other three are not judged to be independent
due either to their shareholdings or their remuneration arrangements. All the non-
executive directors make a significant contribution to the functioning of the Board
and its committees, and no one individual or group dominates the Board’s
decision-making process.
Although the Combined Code recommends that a majority of non-executive
directors should be independent, the Board believes that it has maintained an
appropriate balance of directors, bringing a wide range of skills and experience
to the Board.
All directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit
themselves for re-election at least every three years. The names of those
directors standing for re-election to the Board this year are set out in the Notice
of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board’s focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. There is a formal
schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board which retains all major
operational and risk management decisions with the Board.  These include the
approval of major items of expenditure or commitment, including acquisitions;
major operational projects, including new contract wins; financing, including
lease/buy decisions and the use of derivatives and insurance; and changes in
policy relating to the franchise network. The Board routinely monitors the various
financial, operational and commercial risks facing the Company through reports
from management. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the working of the Board, and the Chief
Executive for the running of the business and implementation of Board strategy
and policy. The Board meets formally at least 9 times a year, with other meetings
as necessary. The Board receives reports in advance of each meeting from the
Chief Executive and Finance Director addressing the financial performance of the
Company and developments since the previous meeting, with further reports on
particular issues as appropriate. All directors have access to the advice and
services of the company secretary, and there is a procedure whereby directors,
wishing to do so in the furtherance of their duties, may take independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense. In addition, detailed reports are
provided to the Board on a monthly basis to enable the Board to discharge its
duties.
The Board has a number of committees, the principal ones being the audit,
remuneration and nomination committees. Each of these committees operates
within written terms of reference. During the year the audit committee comprised
Dennis Clark, chairman and senior independent non-executive director, Richard
Saville, the other independent non-executive director, and Peter Kane, the non-
executive Chairman. Philip Stephens, who is an independent non-executive
director, joined the audit committee on his appointment to the Board on 1 April
2004, and Richard Saville will retire on 31 May 2004. The committee’s duties
include the review of the half year and annual financial statements, including
significant financial reporting judgements contained in them, before submission
to the Board; the review of the Company’s internal financial control system
through reports from management and internal and external auditors; and the
review of the scope and effectiveness of the Company’ s internal audit function. It
is also responsible for the selection of the external auditors, the assessment of
the scope and results of the external audit and its cost effectiveness, and the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors. Details of the
remuneration committee are set out in the Remuneration Report. During the year
the nomination committee comprised Peter Kane, the non-executive Chairman
and chairman of the committee, Paul Carvell, Chief Executive, and Dennis Clark
and Bill Cockburn, both of whom are non-executive directors. Philip Stephens
joined the nomination committee on his appointment to the Board on 1 April
2004. The committee makes recommendations to the Board of new Board
appointments, whether executive or non-executive. Approval of all appointments
is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Directors’ Remuneration
Details of directors’ remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors
while carefully recognising statutory constraints concerning the disclosure of
information. Two-way communication with institutional investors, analysts and
private investors is actively pursued, and a series of presentations and meetings
are held through the year. Feedback from these meetings is collated by the
Company’s advisers and circulated to the Board to keep them informed
concerning the views of shareholders.
18   Business Post Group plc Corporate Governance
Report & Accounts 19
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 13 July 2004 at which time
the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will be
available to answer shareholder questions. The Company will continue its
practice of proposing individual resolutions, including separate resolutions
relating to the Directors’ Report and Accounts and the Remuneration Report. 
Accountability and Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group
and of the profit of the Group for that period. 
After making due enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts. 
In preparing the accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting
policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and estimates that
are reasonable and prudent; and state whether applicable accounting standards
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the accounts. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets
of the Company and Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Business Post Group plc website is the
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of those matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements
since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Internal Controls
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group
maintains a system of internal control to provide it with reasonable assurance
regarding effective and efficient operations, internal financial control and
compliance with laws and regulations. There are inherent limitations in any
system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance.
The Turnbull report issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales in September 1999 provided further guidance as to how the Combined
Code principle on internal control should be applied in practice. 
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the Turnbull report
throughout the year. There is a formal ongoing process for identifying, managing
and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by the Company. This process
operates under the direction of, and is regularly reviewed by, the Board.
The key features of the internal control system within the Group are:
• clearly defined delegation of responsibilities, including relevant
authorisation levels,
• clearly documented internal procedures set out in operational and
administration manuals,
• regular compliance audit visits to all owned and franchised locations which
monitor compliance with procedures and assess the integrity of financial
information,
• review of financial procedures by the internal auditor,
• close personal involvement of executive directors in monitoring and
managing the main risk areas of the business,
• regular information provided to senior management, covering financial
performance and key business indicators, and
• monthly monitoring of results against budget and forecast, with major
variances being followed up and management action taken where necessary.
Details of the Group’s activities in relation to its environmental, employment and
health and safety responsibilities are set out in the Corporate Social
Responsibility statement.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control systems during
the period covered by the accounts and up to the date of the approval of the
accounts. This review covered all controls, including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management. The business has grown significantly
during recent years and this has put increased strain on the Company’s financial
systems. During the year certain weaknesses in procedures and financial control
were identified. These have been addressed and controls have been
strengthened by the recruitment of an internal auditor and additional financial
staff, and the introduction of enhanced internal controls.
Compliance with the Combined Code
With the exception of the number of non-executive directors judged to be
independent, the Board considers that the Company has complied with the
provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code 1998 throughout the financial year. Corporate Social Responsibility
The Board recognises its environmental and employment responsibilities and
devotes significant resources towards both monitoring compliance with
existing standards and improving those standards.
Environmental
The Board is responsible for the Group’s Environmental Policy.  Responsibility
for communicating the policy and monitoring the Group’s compliance with it
rests with the Group’s Transport Manager and Health & Safety Manager.
The policy identifies the following areas as having the most significant impact
on the environment:
• Consumption of non-renewable fuel resources through the use of diesel
to fuel vehicles, and
• Air pollution through vehicle emissions.
Some examples of the actions taken by the Group to minimise its
environmental impact include:
• use of automated vehicle routing to eliminate unnecessary mileage,
• use of double-decked trailers to minimise vehicle journeys,
• a vehicle replacement programme designed to use the latest engine
technology, thereby improving fuel consumption and reducing emissions,
• use of fuel only which is low in both sulphur and lead,
• use of road-friendly air suspension wherever possible, reducing road
damage and noise levels, and
• selection of vehicles which are over 90% recyclable at the end of their
economic lives.
The Group is committed to minimising its environmental impact through
target-setting across different areas of the Group’s operations (eg the
proportion of double-decked trailers in the fleet; average fuel consumption; the
proportion of vehicles driven by personnel with minimum attained skill levels)
and monitoring actual performance against those targets. The most significant
progress made during the year was in the introduction of double-decked
trailers for parcel movements, where numbers increased by 80%.  This brings
the proportion of double-decked trailers to around 30% of the Company’s
trailer fleet and this proportion will increase further over the coming year.
Health & Safety 
The Group has well-established Health & Safety systems which report
accident rates to the Board on a monthly basis.  The Employee Consultative
Group plays a key role in health and safety consultation with employees.
Health & Safety training is a routine part of employee and management
development.  The Group’s commitment in this area was recognised in 2003 by
the ROSPA Gold Award for Health & Safety.
Employment
The Group has made significant progress in its human resource management
since the establishment of a central HR function two years ago. 
The Group’s employment terms and conditions are clearly set out in the
employment handbook, which is given to each new employee upon their
appointment.During the year, significant levels of training were provided
throughout the Group on recruitment, objectives-setting, performance
management and appraisal to improve the rate at which the best people are
attracted, retained and developed. A major exercise was also undertaken
throughout Network Services, the principal employer within the Group, to
evaluate the skill levels within the management group, and individual long
term development plans were devised for all those taking part.
The Employee Consultative Group, established in April 2003 to facilitate
improved communication with staff and enable employees to have the
opportunity to input into matters that affect them, has proved popular with
employees and a range of improvements have been made in working
conditions and health and safety as a direct result of the work of this Group.
As a result, the levels of staff satisfaction and retention have both improved
over the prior year and this work will continue during the current year.
Charitable Support
The Group is an active supporter of charities. For every consignment handled
by the Group which is paid for using direct debit, 1p is contributed to the
National Children’s Home Charity. In addition, the Group has run a "Charity
Challenge" throughout the year, aimed at raising £1,000 at each of its 65
locations.  As a result of these initiatives, the Group and its employees raised
over £100,000 for NCH over the past 12 months.
20   Business Post Group plc Remuneration Report
The directors present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2004. This report is unaudited except for those parts which are indicated otherwise.
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were: Richard Saville (Chairman), Dennis Clark and Peter Kane. During the year and at their request,
the Group’s Chief Executive, Paul Carvell, and New Bridge Street Consultants gave advice and assistance to the remuneration committee. Richard Saville has
notified the Board of his intention to retire from the Board with effect from 31 May 2004 and will be succeeded as Chairman of the remuneration committee by
Philip Stephens. 
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Group, including the policy for executive directors, is determined by the remuneration committee of the Board, the membership of
which consists entirely of non-executive Board members. The remuneration policy for non-executive directors is determined by the Board. 
The objectives of the committee are:
1. To ensure that directors and senior executives are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance.
2. To ensure that the remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives of the Group is set by a committee of Board members who have no personal
interest in the outcome of the decisions and who will give due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Group.
The remuneration policy of the Group is to provide competitive remuneration arrangements for executive directors and senior executives which are commensurate
with those of other companies of a similar nature, size and standing and which reflect the Group’s business and financial objectives and the goals of Corporate
Governance.
Remuneration arrangements are addressed within the context of the Group’s current performance, its progress towards strategic objectives and individual
executives’ personal performance. In developing remuneration arrangements, the remuneration committee (and, in regard to non-executive directors, the Board)
refers to external consultants and relevent market survey data.
Elements of the remuneration package of executive directors
Remuneration of executive directors comprises the following elements:
Base salary
Base salaries are determined in relation to job responsibilities and sustained level of individual performance, and are reviewed annually.
Bonuses
The company operates a bonus scheme for executive directors. The level of bonus payment is dependent upon the Group’s performance evaluated against both
the prior year and annual budget, and also upon each director’s achievement of personal objectives, set out at the beginning of the year. In normal circumstances,
the maximum payment is limited to 50% of annual salary and payments in respect of personal objectives may not exceed payments in respect of the Group’s
financial performance.
Benefits
Health and sickness insurance schemes are provided for executive directors and include private health cover and permanent health insurance. Executive directors
receive an annual car allowance and contributions of 12.5% of each individual director’s base salary into a defined contribution pension scheme.
Share-based incentive schemes
The company utilises both a Long Term Incentive Plan and Executive Share Option Schemes to provide longer term share-based incentives for senior executives
and directors. The schemes are designed to motivate and reward achievement of a combination of corporate financial targets and enhancement of shareholder
value. Executive directors also participate in the Group’s Sharesave scheme. Specific details of the incentive schemes are shown later in this report.
Report & Accounts 21 Remuneration Report
The targeted composition of each executive director’s remuneration, excluding long term incentives, is that 75% is non-performance related and that 25% is
performance related. The remuneration of each non-executive director is 100% non-performance related except that, in addition to his director’s and consultancy
fees, Bill Cockburn has a long-term incentive arrangement whereby he is entitled to receive bonuses if the profit of UK Mail Limited exceeds specified targets
within a four year period of the commencement of trading.
Directors’ service contracts
It is Business Post Group’s policy that, whilst there should not be a fixed duration in respect of directors’ service contracts, each contract contains notice periods
of not more than one year and contains a clause whereby the contractual termination payments do not exceed the director’s remuneration for the previous calendar
year. Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term. All directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves
for re-election at least every three years.
The details of the service contracts of those who have served as directors during the year are:

termination payment.
*In the event of termination following a change of control, executive directors are entitled to termination payments of 12 months’ remuneration.
Performance graph
The adjacent graph compares the total shareholder return for an
investment in the ordinary shares of Business Post Group plc with the
return for the same investment in the FTSE Support Services index over a
five year period commencing on 1 April 1999. In the opinion of the
directors, the FTSE Support Services index, of which the Company is a
constituent, is currently the most appropriate index against which the
total shareholder return of the Company should be measured because it
is widely used by our investors, shareholders and management as a
measure of performance.

No other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the company or other group entities. None of the terms and conditions of the share options
were varied during the year. All options were granted in respect of qualifying services. 
The options were granted at nil cost to the directors and were in respect of past performance. The performance criteria for all the above share options were
consistent with the remuneration policy outlined earlier in this report.
24   Business Post Group plc Remuneration Report
The exercise of options is subject to the condition that the growth in the Company’s earnings per share shall exceed the increase in the Index of retail prices from
the date of grant by more than 3%. In addition, the exercise of share options granted to Paul Carvell in July 2001 is conditional upon the Company’s share price
exceeding certain targets for a minimum of 100 consecutive days between 48 and 66 months from issue. Of the 294,117 options granted, 98,039 become
exerciseable if the share price exceeds 600p, a further 98,039 become exerciseable if the share price exceeds 750p and a further 98,039 become exerciseable if
the share price exceeds 900p.
Following a recent review of the Company’s remuneration policies, the remuneration committee has deteminded that, going forward, awards made under the
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan would be a more effective means of incentivising the Company’s executives. Accordingly, options will only be granted to senior
executives in exceptional circumstances.

The Sharesave scheme provides a savings plan to purchase shares and has no performance criteria in order to participate.
The market price of the Company’s shares at the end of the financial year was 490.5p and the range of market prices during the year was between 351.5p and 542.5p.
Exercise gains in the above table are calculated at the exercise date, although shares may have been retained.

No awards were made during the year. Exercise gains in the above table are calculated as at the exercise date, although the shares may have been retained.
Awards granted in June 2000 may be exercised between June 2003 and June 2010, determined partly by reference to the Company’s earnings per share growth
relative to inflation and partly by reference to the Company’s total shareholder return performance over the three years to 31 March 2003. Based on the Company’s
performance over the three years to 31 March 2003, 40% of the awards granted in June 2000 may be exercised. Although the Company’s performance is measured
over a three year period, in order to enhance the retentive impact of the Long Term Incentive Plan, only 20% of the award may be exercised after three years, with
the remaining 20% exerciseable four years after it is granted. In addition, on the exercise of awards under the Plan or options previously granted under any of the
Company’s other share option schemes, directors are expected to retain a proportion of the after-tax profit in the form of shares until they have acquired a
shareholding equal to their basic salaries. In relation to prior years this proportion was expected to be 25%. An increase in this proportion is being introduced and,
with effect from no later than 1 April 2005, this proportion is expected to be 50%.
Amendments to the Business Post Group Long Term Incentive Plan
Following a recent review of the Company’s remuneration policies, the remuneration committee has determined that, going forward, awards made under the Company’s
Long Term Incentive Plan (“L TIP”)  would be a more effective means of incentivising the Company’ s executives, rather than grants made under the Company’ s Executive Share
Option Scheme 2001. Corporate governance best practice and general market practice have both evolved since the LTIP was introduced in 1999. Accordingly, the
remuneration committee is seeking shareholder approval for a number of changes to the LTIP which will apply to future awards. These changes are explained fully in the
accompanying circular to shareholders.
Proposed new Share Matching Plan
The remuneration committee considers it appropriate to closely align the interests of senior executives with those of long-term shareholders, through the
introduction of a share matching scheme. Accordingly, the remuneration committee is seeking shareholder approval for the introduction of the Business Post Group
Share Matching Plan (“SMP”).
Under the proposed SMP , selected executives will be invited to invest a proportion of their cash bonus in the acquisition of Company shares up to 25% of their pre-
tax salary. Where such an investment is made, the executives will receive the grant of a matching award over shares in the Company with an equivalent value. Full
details of the SMP are explained in the accompanying circular to shareholders.

26   Business Post Group plc Directors’ Report
The directors present their report on the audited financial statements for the
year ended 31 March 2004.
Principal Activity and Review of the Business
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of express collection and delivery
services for parcels, mail and palletised goods. A review of the Group’s
business during the year and its prospects for the future is set out in the
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. 
Results and Dividend
The profit for the financial year of £12.6 million is reported in the Group Profit
and Loss Account. An interim dividend of 5.95p per share was paid on 5
January 2004, and the directors recommend a final dividend of 12.05p per
share payable on 22 July 2004 to shareholders on the register on 2 July 2004.
This, when added to the interim dividend, will make a total of 18.0p for the
year (2003 :16.9p). 
Corporate Governance
A statement on corporate governance and the Group’s compliance with the
Combined Code is set out in the Corporate Governance statement.
Charitable Donations
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of £58,434 (2003:
£63,783) to the National Children’s Home Charity for general charitable
purposes.
Directors
Details of the directors are shown in the Directors and Advisers statement
together with their biographical details and dates of appointment. 
Philip Stephens, having been appointed on 1 April 2004, which was after the
last Annual General Meeting, retires and, being eligible, offers himself for
election.  In accordance with the Articles of Association, Guy Buswell, Paul
Carvell and Russell Hodgson retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
Directors’ Interests
The interests of the directors and their families as appearing in the register
maintained under the provisions of section 325 of the Companies Act 1985 in
the share capital of the Company on 31 March 2004 are set out in the
Remuneration Report. 
Substantial Shareholders
In addition to the interests of Peter Kane (34.0%) and Michael Kane (13.1%),
as at 18 May 2004 the Company had been notified that Ms Joanna Bailey and
Mr John Kane, the adult children of Peter Kane, are each beneficial holders of
3,333,333 shares, each representing 6.3% of the issued share capital of the
Company. In addition, the Company had been notified that Fidelity
International Limited and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are non-beneficial
holders of 1,802,686 shares representing 3.4% of the issued share capital of
the Company. 
Annual General Meeting - special business
The notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 July 2004 may be
found at the back of the Report and Accounts. In addition to the routine
business of the meeting, the special business set out below will be transacted.
On 10 July 2003 resolutions were passed by the Company’s shareholders
whereby the directors were given authority, under Section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985, until the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General
Meeting, to allot shares up to a maximum of the authorised but unissued share
capital of the Company. The directors recommend by Resolution 9 to be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting that this authority
should be renewed so that it applies until the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company.  
If Resolution 9 is approved by shareholders the directors will have authority
to allot up to 16,702,386 ordinary shares, representing 31.3% of the ordinary
shares currently in issue of which 3,306,181 (6.2% of the ordinary shares
currently in issue) are currently reserved for issue under the Company’s share
option schemes. The balance available for allotment is therefore 13,399,205
ordinary shares, representing 25.1% of the ordinary shares currently in issue.
The Company does not currently have any treasury shares in issue. The
directors have no present intention of exercising the authority except in
connection with the issue of shares under the Company’s share option
schemes or under the Business Post Group plc Franchise Share Option
Scheme 2002, or for satisfying the deferred consideration in respect of the
acquisition of UK Pallets Ltd (see note 15).
In addition, the directors were given authority under Section 95 of the
Companies Act 1985 until the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General Meeting
to allot equity securities for cash, other than to existing shareholders in
proportion to their holdings, up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 5%
of the issued ordinary share capital. The directors recommend by Resolution
10 to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting that this
authority should be renewed up to an aggregate nominal amount of £266,488,
being equal to 5% of the ordinary shares currently in issue, until the conclusion
of the 2005 Annual General Meeting or 13 October 2005, whichever is the
earlier.
Report & Accounts 27 Directors’ Report
Since December 2003 the Companies Act 1985 allows shares purchased by the
Company to be held as treasury shares, which may then be cancelled, sold for
cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations under its share option
schemes. The requirements to allot equity securities for cash to existing
shareholders in proportion to their holdings will also apply to the sales by the
Company of any shares it holds as treasury shares. These requirements may
be similarly disapplied by shareholders. The authority sought, and limits set,
by Resolution 10 will then apply also to a sale of treasury shares. However, the
directors have no present intention of holding shares in treasury pursuant to
the Companies Act 1985.
At the 2003 Annual General Meeting the Company was given authority under
Article 9 of its Articles of Association and Section 166 of the Companies Act
1985 until the conclusion of the 2004 Annual General Meeting to make market
purchases of up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital for cancellation at
a price of not less than 10 pence per ordinary share and not more than 105%
of the average of the mid-market quotations for an ordinary share of the
Company (as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange)
for the five business days prior to the date of purchase.
The authority sought by Resolution 11 to make market purchases of its own
ordinary shares is intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the
Company as treasury shares in accordance with the Companies Act. However,
as mentioned above, the directors have no present intention of holding shares
in treasury pursuant to the Companies Act 1985.
The directors recommend by Resolution 11 to be proposed at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting that this authority should be renewed until the
conclusion of the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The directors did not exercise
the Company’s power to purchase its own shares in the year ended 31 March
2004 and do not intend to exercise this power other than in circumstances
where they consider this to be in the shareholders’ interests and where this
would result in an increase in earnings per share.
If they do utilise this authority, the directors will neither be encouraging nor
recommending shareholders to buy or sell shares in the Company nor in any
way suggesting that it is an appropriate time to deal in such shares.
Extraordinary General Meeting
As described in the Remuneration Report, the directors will recommend by
Resolutions to be proposed at an Extraordinary General Meeting, to be held
immediately after the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, amendments to
the Long Term Incentive Plan originally adopted by shareholders in 1999, and
the introduction of a new Share Matching Plan. Details of the proposals are
set out in the accompanying circular to shareholders.
Employment Policy
The Group’s policy is to maintain, as far as practicable, close consultations
with employees on matters likely to affect their interests and, to this end,
established an Employee Consultative Group in April 2003. The Company is an
equal opportunities employer and holds an Investors in People certificate. 
The Group’s policy and practice is to encourage the recruitment and
subsequent training, career development and promotion of disabled persons
according to their aptitudes and abilities and the retention and retraining of
employees who also become disabled during their employment. 
Further information concerning the Group’s human resource management
activities is set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility statement.
Directors and Officers Liability Insurance
The Company maintains insurance against certain liabilities which could arise
from a negligent act or a breach of duty by its directors and officers in the
discharge of their duties.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group’s policy concerning the payment of its trade creditors is to follow
the CBI’s Prompt Payers’ Code. The Group endeavours to agree standard terms
of payment with its major suppliers at the commencement of business.
Suppliers fulfilling the conditions of supply are paid in accordance with the
agreed standard terms. Other suppliers are paid in accordance with
contractual terms as agreed from time to time. The Company does not have
trade creditors and accordingly no creditor days calculation is presented.
Environmental Responsibility and Health and Safety
A statement on the steps taken to operate the business in pursuit of good
environmental and health standards is set out in the Corporate Social
Responsibility statement.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the
Group will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

28   Business Post Group plc Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent auditors' report to the members of Business Post Group plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Consolidated
Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. We have also
audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies
Act 1985 contained in the  Remuneration Report ("the auditable part").
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the statement of accountability and
directors' responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for preparing
the Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of
the Remuneration Report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true
and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of
the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors'
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the
Remuneration Report, the Corporate Social Reponsibility statement and the
Corporate Governance statement (issued in June 1998).
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reflects the
company's compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls,
or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2004 and of the profit and
cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A
to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Report & Accounts 33 Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting Policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The  principal accounting policies which have been applied consistently
throughout the year and the preceding year are summarised below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of
Business Post Group plc and its subsidiary companies for the year ended
31 March 2004. Advantage has been taken of Section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985 not to include the Company’s own profit and loss
account. The profit of the company for the year is £3.5m (2003: £2.2m).
Acquisitions and disposals
The results of businesses acquired or disposed of are consolidated from
or to the effective dates of acquisition or disposal.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill, being the excess of the purchase consideration over
the fair value of identifiable net assets of the newly acquired
undertakings, is capitalised and written off evenly over its estimated
useful economic life.
Turnover
Turnover comprises the value of services provided and income earned in
respect of franchises sold, net of value added tax.
Pension costs
Contributions to the Group sponsored employees’ personal pension plans
and defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss
account in the year in which they accrue.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a
straight line basis over the period of the lease except for non-operational
properties, where full provision is made for future rental costs, less any
rental income, up to the first break in the lease. Provision is also made for
the cost of making good dilapidations where required under property leases.
The benefits of rent free periods on property leases are spread evenly
over the period of the lease up to the date of the next rent review.
Rentals received under operating leases are credited on a straight line
basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not received on such
a basis.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in Sterling at the rate
ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate ruling at the
balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to the profit and
loss account as they arise.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Financial assets are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.
Gains and losses arising as a result of interest rate derivatives, which
manage the interest rate exposure on borrowings, are carried forward so
that the profit and loss account reflects the rate of interest applicable to
the financial instrument that has been entered into.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust for the purposes of
satisfying the Company’s commitments under the Long Term Incentive
Plan are amortised over the life of the Plan.
Impairment
The directors carry out a review of the carrying value of intangible and
tangible fixed assets if an event has taken place that suggests that there
could be an impairment in value. Where, in their opinion, there has been
an impairment then the assets concerned are written down to their
recoverable amount. The amount of the impairment is charged to the
profit and loss account.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of tangible fixed assets
to their estimated residual values over the following useful economic
lives:
• Freehold buildings - fifty years on a straight line basis
• Short leasehold premises - the period of the lease on a straight line
basis
• Motor vehicles, plant, and equipment - 10% to 33.3% annually on a
reducing balance basis
• Computer equipment - 20% to 33% annually on a straight line basis.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences between the
recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their
recognition in tax computations, except that a net deferred tax asset is
recognised only when it can be regarded as more likely than not it will be
recovered. Deferred tax is provided at current rates and is not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where they relate to taxes
levied by the same tax authority and are in the same taxable entity or
group.

On 26 July 2003 the Group purchased Weaver (Four Oaks) Ltd, trading as Weaver Pallet Express, a Midlands-based express palletised goods delivery business,
for an initial amount of £8.9m in cash and a deferred amount of up to £3.5m comprising cash and shares in equal proportions. On 4 August 2003 the company
name was changed to UK Pallets Ltd and trades under that name. From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2004, the acquisition contributed £14.4m to turnover and
£0.8m to operating profit. The contingent element is dependent on the results of UK Pallets Ltd for the year ended 31 March 2004. Management have estimated
that the deferred consideration payable is £2.0m, due no later than 31 July 2004.
The last financial period for Weaver (Four Oaks) Ltd was for a fifteen month period ending 31 March 2003, and was audited by BDO Stoy Hayward. The accounts

Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities

profile was:

Currency £m £m £m £m
Sterling term loan 10.0 10.0 –– ––
Sterling bank overdraft 0.2 0.2 –– ––
10.2 10.2 –– ––
The interest rate on the term loan is based on a floating rate linked to the London Inter Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”). A separate interest rate cap exists to reduce
exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate, ensuring that the interest exposure is capped at 6.0%. The loan has been disclosed as a floating rate financial liability
as the interest rate cap has not been breached. The interest rate on the overdraft is based on a floating rate linked to the Bank of England rate.
All the Group's creditors falling due within one year (other than bank and other borrowings) are excluded from the above table either due to the exclusion of
short term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 March
2004 and 2003. Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing
parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where
market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates. Set out below is a summary
of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.

Hedges
As explained in the Financial Review section of the Report and Accounts, entitled "Exposure to Financial Risk" the Group's policy is to hedge the following
exposures:
Interest rate risk - using interest hedges
Fuel fluctuation - using specific price hedges
There are no unrecognised gains or losses arising from the above hedges which have not been charged to the profit and loss account during the year.
Fair value is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance
sheet date.
The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the
carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the bank loan approximates to the value reported in the balance
sheet since it carries a floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at
intervals less than one year.

or legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of, any regulatory body or any stock exchange or otherwise in any territory, and 
10.1.2 the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 10.1.1 above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £266,488; 
and shall (unless previously revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting) expire on the earlier of 13 October 2005 or the conclusion of the

agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance 
of such offer or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired; and 
10.2 all authorities conferred under section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 prior to the date of this Annual General Meeting be and they are hereby revoked
provided that such revocation shall not have retrospective effect.

Market Overview
An India story: the 
combination of prospective 
underexplored basins 
located within close 
proximity to a growing 
consumer market, presents 
an attractive upstream 
investment opportunity.
India’s sedimentary basins 
are underexplored and 
significant accumulations 
of hydrocarbons remain to 
be found.
Krishna Godavari Basin
Located on the east coast of 
India, the KG basin is 
regarded as the most prolific 
gas basin in India. It is a 
proven oil and gas province 
with the world class D6 gas 
development and a number of 
significant producing oil fields 
(Ravva, MA). The Company 
has an interest in two blocks 
(D3 and D9) within the KG 
Basin. To date the Company 
has drilled six wells in the 
basin resulting in four 
consecutive natural gas 
discoveries on the D3 block.
Cauvery Basin
The Cauvery Basin is located 
in the south east of India. The 
basin is a proven oil and gas 
province. Hardy has interests 
in two licences (PY-3 and 
CY-OS/2) within this basin. 
PY-3 field has been producing 
since 1997 producing over 24 
mmbbl to date. The Company 
believes that it can recover a 
further 21 mmbbls which will 
require the drilling of up to five 
additional wells. 
Gujarat-Saurashtra Basin
Located in the relatively shallow 
waters off the west coast of 
India the Gujarat-Saurashtra 
Basin has many significant 
producing oil and gas fields. 
The Company’s licence is held 
via the Dhirubhai 31 gas 
discovery. A declaration of 
Commerciality proposal has 
been submitted to the GOI for 
their review and adoption.
Assam Basin
Located in the north east of 
India the Assam Arakan basin 
is a proven oil province with 
many producing oil and gas 
fields. The Company’s licence 
is located in the underexplored 
south western portion of the 
basin. It is located north of the 
Brahmaputra river. Natural gas demand growth is projected 
to average five per cent per annum

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 03
Transparent 
political 
environment 
With a population of over 
1 billion, India represents 
the world’s largest 
democracy. This political 
framework provides a good 
level of transparency and 
provides a robust platform 
for political discussion.
Stable  
legal  
framework
The India legal  
system is based  
on common law  
providing a good  
platform to protect 
contractual rights  
and enforcement  
of obligations.
Domestic 
upstream technical 
expertise
As a result of the  
success of ONGC  
(majority owned by GOI), 
there is a strong community 
of upstream technical, 
operating and commercial 
professionals based  
in India.
Attractive  
fiscal  
platform
Production sharing 
contracts provide for  
fiscal stability; full cost 
recovery of investment; 
seven year tax holiday  
on mineral oil; and 
free market pricing  
provisions in PSC’s.
India’s political, legal, and upstream regulatory policies combined with globally 
competitive fiscal terms provides a positive foreign investment environment.
India’s economy is expected to continue its impressive 
growth and, as a result, the country’s energy consumption, 
along with its infrastructure, will materially increase, far 
exceeding current domestic supply.
BP’s Energy Outlook 2030 report states that energy 
consumption in India has grown by 190 per cent over the past 
20 years and is likely to grow by 115 per cent over the next 20 
years, a rate of over 4 per cent per annum. Gas is expected to 
be the fastest growing fossil fuel, with demand growing at a rate 
of nearly 5 per cent per annum between 2010 and 2030. India’s 
gas consumption was 5.0 bcfd in 2009 and is estimated to have 
been 6.1 bcfd in 2010 (comprising 4.9 bcfd production plus 1.2 
bcfd LNG imports). Total Indian gas consumption is projected 
to grow to 12.5 bcfd by 2025, and exceed 15 bcfd by 2030.
 
India’s natural gas carrying capacity is expected to increase 
four-fold by 2015 to 490 mmscmd (length 24,000 km). Natural 
gas prices in India have progressively increased over the past 
ten years by over 250 per cent.
“ Hardy is well positioned to participate in India’s 
energy consumption growth due to its prospective 
exploration asset portfolio, an established 
offshore operating track record, and strong 
technical, financial and commercial capabilities 
critical to upstream exploration and production.” Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 04
Our strategy has produced 
six gas discoveries from 
eleven explorational wells.

Paul Mortimer, Chairman
Corporate overview
During 2010, the Company accomplished a number of key 
objectives and realised a significant improvement in financial 
performance. The divestment of our Nigerian operations has 
resulted in freeing up of capital and management resources to 
focus on exploiting the full potential of our portfolio in India. 
Hardy’s exploration programme on the Company’s two blocks 
in the Krishna Godavari Basin progressed with the drilling of 
two further exploration wells. As a result of this activity, we 
were delighted to announce the fourth consecutive gas 
discovery in D3. We have subsequently submitted a declaration 
of commerciality proposal, for the Dhuribhai 39, 41 and 52 
discoveries on this block, to the GOI for review. The second 
exploration well drilled in 2011 was on our D9 asset (KG-
D9-B3) which recorded gas shows while drilling through good 
quality sands which, on testing, proved to be water bearing 
and the well was plugged and abandoned.
Despite fluctuating market conditions in 2010, the Company 
was pleased to raise $9.5 million in a successful equity placing 
at the end of 2010. The funds raised provide the Company with 
a strong working capital position with which to fund its planned 
work activity and provides some flexibility to explore other 
business development opportunities. We are delighted with the 
continued support of our core shareholder base.
Key financial results
Revenue was up from $7.7 million in 2009 to $13.2 million in 
2010 due to higher production levels (there was an unplanned 
extended shut-in of the PY-3 field in 2009) and a higher average 
realised oil price. Administrative expenses were down 
significantly compared to 2009, resulting in an operating profit 
from continuing operations of $1.9 million in 2010 compared 
with an operating loss of $7.5 million in 2009.
The Company started 2010 with cash reserves of $30.5 million. 
Net cash generated from continuing operating activities (before 
changes in non cash working capital, tax paid, interest and 
investment income and finance costs) was $4.0 million. Cash 
used for investing activities amounted to $6.1 million in 2010 for 
the drilling of exploration wells on D3 and D9. An equity issue in 
December 2010 resulted in net cash infusion of $9.5 million 
augmenting our working capital. As a result, the Company’s cash 
reserves at the end of 2010 were $36.5 million. The Company 
remains in a strong financial position and has no long-term debt.
Strategy
Hardy has a clear objective to create significant shareholder 
value through an India focused upstream exploration and 
development strategy. We believe that the India sedimentary 
basins are underexplored and, as our results in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin have shown, significant accumulations of 
hydrocarbons remain to be found. India’s economy is expected 
to continue its impressive growth and, as a result, the country’s 
energy consumption, along with its infrastructure, will materially 
increase, far exceeding current domestic supply. Our perception 
has been reinforced recently by the entry of BP into this 
exploration province.
India’s natural gas carrying capacity is expected to increase 
fourfold by 2015 to 490 mmscmd (length 24,000 km). Natural 
gas prices in India have progressively increased over the past 
ten years by over 250 per cent. With demand growth projected 
to continue, we anticipate price inflation to continue at pace. 
The combination of prospective underexplored basin’s located 
within close proximity to a growing consumer market, presents 
an attractive upstream investment opportunity.

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 07
Offshore drilling – the Company is directly and indirectly  —
involved in drilling offshore wells. In the event of a loss of 
control of a well could have a material negative impact on 
the Company.
High-cost environment – The effect of a high cost  —
environment is the compounded financial impact of 
operational delays during drilling and other operations.
Production – The Company’s sole source of revenue is from  —
a single producing oil well in the PY-3 field. An unexpected 
shut-in would have a material impact on the Company’s ability 
to generate cash flow in the short to medium term.
CY-OS/2 arbitration – In 2010 the Company and the GOI  —
referred the dispute regarding our claim of entitlement to a 
licence extension for arbitration. Should the arbitration ruling 
not be in Hardy’s favour the block would stand relinquished 
and impairment testing will be required.
Year end audit
The auditors have provided an emphasis of matter comment in 
their audit report with reference to the uncertainty concerning 
the Group’s request for an extension of its exploration licence 
in block CY-OS/2 as disclosed in notes 2 and 15 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Going concern
Having regard to the Company’s existing working capital position 
and its ability to raise potential financing, the Directors are of the 
opinion that the Group has adequate resources to enable it to 
undertake its planned work programme of exploration, appraisal 
and development activities over the next 12 months.
Outlook
In 2011 we aim to continue to create significant shareholder 
value by focusing on high impact exploration in India. We are 
particularly looking forward to the continued exploration of our 
D3 block which, with four consecutive gas discoveries, is in 
the early stage of exploration with significant upside potential. 
We expect to drill at least two further exploration wells in the 
Krishna Godavari Basin by the end of 2011.
BP’s announced acquisition from Reliance of an interest in the 
Krishna Godavari Basin is a welcome development. At the time of 
the announcement, BP noted that the transaction will allow them 
to access the most prolific gas basin in India (Krishna Godavari) 
and secure a place in the fast growing Indian gas markets. We 
believe that their participation is also an endorsement of the 
quality of our exploration assets and we share their outlook of 
India’s substantial natural gas demand growth potential. We join 
our partner Reliance in welcoming BP’s participation in our 
exploration blocks in the Krishna Godavari Basin.
Our existing exploration portfolio in the Krishna Godavari Basin 
remains the core to our organic growth. The Krishna Godavari 
Basin is an emerging world-class petroleum province and, 
together with rapidly improving Indian gas pipeline infrastructure 
and high demand for gas, the prospects for the economic 
development of gas resources in this area are excellent. The 
Company is well positioned to see itself through its key 
exploration activities in 2011.
Paul Mortimer
Chairman
15 March 2011
In the recently announced transaction between Reliance Industries 
Limited (Reliance) and BP, (which represents one of the biggest 
single foreign direct investments in India) BP stated that the 
transaction met with their strategy to increase exposure to growing 
energy markets. BP’s Energy Outlook 2030 report states that 
energy consumption in India has grown by 190 per cent over the 
past 20 years and is likely to grow by 115 per cent over the next 20 
years, a rate of over 4 per cent per annum. Gas is expected to be 
the fastest growing fossil fuel, with demand growing at a rate of 
nearly 5 per cent per annum between 2010 and 2030. India’s gas 
consumption was 5.0 bcfd in 2009 and is estimated to be 6.1 bcfd 
in 2010 (comprising 4.9 bcfd production plus 1.2 bcfd LNG 
imports). Total Indian gas consumption is projected to grow to 
12.5 bcfd by 2025, and exceed 15 bcfd by 2030.
Hardy is well positioned to participate in this growth due to its 
prospective exploration asset portfolio, an established offshore 
operating track record, and strong technical, financial and 
commercial capabilities critical to upstream exploration and 
production. We believe that the Company has a sustainable 
platform to continue to participate in the India growth story. 
We also recognise that the addition of short to medium term 
production would enhance our prospects and management 
is considering various options to achieve this.
Over the past four years, our strategy has produced six gas 
discoveries from eleven exploration wells. The declaration of 
commerciality submissions made in 2010 are the next step in 
reaching our ultimate objective of realising the monetisation of 
our exploration efforts. Today we view the D3 exploration block 
with considerable optimism and continue to believe that our 
existing exploration portfolio offers significant organic growth 
potential for the Company. The arrival of BP as a partner in 
several blocks can only enhance the prospect of early 
development of our discoveries.
Governance
In 2010 Mr Yogeshwar Sharma succeeded Mr Sastry Karra 
as Chief Executive Officer of Hardy. Mr Karra remained as a 
Non-Executive Director until November 2010. Messrs Sharma 
and Karra co-founded Hardy and the Board wishes to thank 
Sastry for his immense contribution and sound leadership to 
Hardy over the past thirteen years and we wish him well in his 
future endeavours.
Following an appraisal of the Board and its members in 2009, 
the Board considers that its current structure, competencies 
and remuneration policies are appropriate for a publicly listed, 
early stage, oil and gas exploration company. In addition to a 
formal annual evaluation, the Board continually reviews the 
appropriateness of the Board’s composition, structure and 
internal processes as the Company evolves.
Risk management
In 2010, the Board adopted a formal risk and uncertainties 
review process, involving the generation, identification of 
key risks and the formulation of mitigation strategies by the 
Company’s senior management team. Through the review 
process the following principal risks for 2011 were identified:
Exploration risk – The Company’s current strategy involves  —
offshore exploration and production activities. Exploration 
is intrinsically very uncertain and whilst substantial 
improvements in predictive/interpretation technology have 
reduced this uncertainty, it cannot be eliminated. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 08
India is an excellent 
investment opportunity  
for upstream oil and  
gas activity.
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Overall our efforts in 2010 resulted in a number of 
positive developments including a significant turnaround 
in the Company’s financial results, the disposal of our 
Nigerian assets, and the drilling of two deepwater 
exploration wells resulting in a natural gas discovery. In 
2011, we will continue to build on this positive 
momentum with further exploration drilling in the 
Krishna Godavari Basin and secure partner approval to 
set in place PY-3 development drilling in 2012.
Execution of Strategy
As a result of the disposal of our Nigerian assets in October 
2010, the Company is now fully committed to its India focused 
strategy with a mandate of creating significant long-term 
shareholder value through the exploration and appraisal of our 
existing exploration portfolio. With India’s robust economic 
growth and attractive upstream fiscal and regulatory regime, the 
Company continues to view India as an excellent investment 
opportunity for upstream oil and gas activity.
The highlight of 2010 was the fourth consecutive natural gas 
discovery on the Company’s D3 asset in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin. Substantial independent evaluation and interpretation 
activities on D3 were undertaken by the Company in 2010.  
This independent work and continued drilling success have 
heightened our enthusiasm for the substantial prospectivity of 
the D3 exploration licence. Although we have four discoveries  
to date, we remain in the relatively early stages of exploration  
as there are many untested play types and an expanding 
prospect inventory.
The submission of declaration of commerciality on two blocks 
(D3 & GS-01) is further endorsement of our India focused 
strategy of de-risking our exploration assets and minimise the 
time cycle from discovery to development.
Maintaining and enhancing the Company’s technical and 
commercial competencies is an integral component for the 
successful execution of our strategy. In this regard, we were 
pleased to announce the appointment of William Satterfield as 
Technical Director of HEPI. Mr Satterfield has extensive 
international upstream exploration, production and business 
development operating experience and has made a positive 
impact on our organisation. We will continue to look to enhance 
our organisation’s core technical, financial and commercial 
competencies to maintain the Company’s platform to capture 
the growth and value creating opportunities unique to India’s 
upstream sector.
“ Although we have four discoveries on D3, we remain 
in the relatively early stages of exploration as there 
are many untested play types and an expanding 
prospect inventory.”

Exploration Highlights
The highlight of our 2010 exploration programme was the 
drilling of two deep water wells on the Company’s Krishna 
Godavari Basin blocks. As a result, the Company announced 
the fourth consecutive natural gas discovery (Dhirubhai 52) on 
the Company’s D3 exploration block in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin. In February 2011, the Company submitted a proposal for 
the declaration of commerciality of the Dhirubhai 39, 41 and 52 
natural gas discoveries on the D3 exploration block.
The second exploration well on the D9 exploration block 
recorded high percentage of gas while drilling through reservoir 
quality sands, however MDT testing recorded high saturation of 
water and as a result the well was plugged and abandoned. The 
well has proven the presence of a petroleum system on the 
North-Central portion of the block. The cost of this well, following 
MDT testing, was below budget due to efficient drilling.
In July 2010, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs of the 
Government of India approved the grant of a drilling moratorium 
of three years up to 31 December 2010. As a result, the 
exploration phase I for the D3 licence is extended into 2013 and 
the D9 licence can be extended by up to 12 months. The D9 
joint venture has subsequently applied for a six month extension 
in order to complete the minimum work commitment of two 
further exploration wells.
A summary of the report, providing a block by block breakdown, 
is provided on pages 72 and 73 and the complete report can be 
downloaded from Hardy’s website www.hardyoil.com.
Development and Production
During 2010, the Company operated PY-3 field produced 
1.15 mmbbl of oil compared with 0.56 mmbbl for 2009. 
The increase in production is principally attributable to the 
uninterrupted production from the field and better than 
expected performance of the field water flood.
The PY-3 field re-commenced production in January 2010 
(following an unplanned six month shut-in) at an initial gross rate 
of 3,336 bbld and the field averaged 3,156 bbld (net: 568 bbld) 
through the year. For 2011, the PY-3 field is forecast to produce 
at an average daily rate of 3,100 bbld (net: 558 bbld).
The PY-3 production facilities are currently contracted through 
April 2011 and we are working closely with our partners and 
contractors to establish a longer-term arrangement for the 
offshore production facilities. This approval is expected in 
conjunction with the budget approval to drill two additional 
production wells in 2012.

Financial Highlights
As a result of sustained production from PY-3, the Company 
sold 192 mbbl of oil at an average price of $81.71 per bbl 
resulting in operating revenue of $12.9 million. As a result, 
Hardy enjoyed an increase in net cash generated from 
continuing operations from a deficiency of $3.6 million in 2009 
to a surplus of $4.0 million, a turn-around of $7.6 million.
Key Partnerships
In 2010, Hardy increased its proactive involvement with 
respect to our non-operated assets, working closely with 
our strategic partners in India, contributing independent 
assessments in conjunction with collaborative dialogue. The 
Company interacts on a regular basis with its partners at 
multiple levels, to ensure that our goals and objectives are 
addressed and to facilitate planning of upcoming work 
programme schedules. Maintaining open and substantive 
relationships with existing partners and other key stakeholders 
in the upstream oil and gas sector in India are critical to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy.
In early 2011, it was announced that BP will become a joint 
venture partner with Hardy and Reliance in both of our Krishna 
Godavari Basin blocks and the Assam block. At the time of the 
announcement, Reliance described BP as one of the finest 
deep water exploration companies in the world. They bring 
considerable additional skills and resources, backed by a 
quality research and development group, to our partnership. 
The combined skills of our companies will be focused on finding 
and developing more hydrocarbons in the deep water blocks of 
India and significantly contributing to India’s energy security. 
We welcome BP and look forward to working with them and 
Reliance on our joint venture projects in the future.
2011 Programme
In 2011 we expect to drill at least two wells, one on each of 
our Krishna Godavari Basin blocks. As mentioned earlier, the 
fourth successive discovery on our D3 block has enhanced 
expectations of this promising block. Further seismic 
processing is required over the toe-thrust area (north east) 
prior to drilling in this area. The processing is expected to be 
ongoing through the first half of 2011. 
As a result of the four consecutive discoveries that have been 
made on D3, this block now singularly stands out as the premier 
asset of Hardy. We have identified 26 prospects or leads with 
an average size of 233 bcf. We remain in the early stages of 
exploration on this block and with six different play types 
present; we view this asset with great optimism. 
We firmly believe in the prospectivity of the D9 Block and 
although the KG-D9-B3 well was plugged and abandoned, 
we are encouraged that the well encountered reservoir quality 
sand and provided evidence of a working petroleum system. 
Hardy looks forward to recommencing drilling operations on 
this block during the second quarter of 2011.

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11
“ This year, our India team will be relied upon 
to drive the core of our business and we will 
look to continue to retain and enhance our 
technical, operational and management 
expertise in this region.”
We currently have submitted declaration of commerciality 
proposals on two blocks – D3 and GS-01. These are under 
review with the GOI and we expect to work closely with the 
operator to advance these projects in 2011.
For the Company’s two operated assets, we are focused on 
securing budget approval for the development drilling programme 
proposed for the PY-3 field. Budget approval will need to be 
secured by mid 2011 to meet our objective of commencing 
drilling in 2012, and upgrade the production facilities to include 
artificial lift to extend the field life. The CY-OS/2 arbitration 
process is ongoing and further activity on this block is deferred 
until the arbitration tribunal has made its ruling.
Overall we are enthusiastic about 2011, as we continue our 
efforts to de-risk our exploration portfolio in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin in India through further exploration drilling. We 
are committed to continue with our disciplined capital allocation 
strategy by focusing on activities that have the potential to 
deliver a significant increase in shareholder value.
Beyond the Company’s existing portfolio, the Company will 
continue to evaluate and assess potential acquisitions in India 
that offer short to medium term production additions and 
complement our existing assets and organisational 
competencies.
Staff
The Company made good progress in 2010 and we have 
generated some positive momentum leading into 2011. This 
can, for a large part, be attributed to our staff in India and the 
United Kingdom. The Group has demonstrated a tremendous 
level of dedication and commitment, having continued to 
work professionally and efficiently to meet our objectives in 
a challenging environment. In 2010 we were successful in 
recruiting some key individuals into our senior management 
team and we will endeavour to compliment them with additional 
mid-level technical and commercial expertise through 2011. This 
year, our India team will be relied upon to drive the core of our 
business and we will look to continue to retain and enhance our 
technical, operational and management expertise in this region. 
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge their 
important contributions in the past year.

Review of Operations
Hardy’s operations in 2010 are highlighted with the 
continued success of its exploration programme, on the 
D3 block in the Krishna Godavari Basin, and, in the 
Company’s role as operator, the extensive efforts taken 
to advance planning, and obtain approvals, for the next 
phase of development on the oil producing asset PY-3.
2010 Performance 
Production from the PY-3 field in 2011 exceeded expectations 
after the resumption of production on 24 January 2010. Gross 
production averaged 3,156 barrels per day (bbld) during 2010, 
compared with the Company’s forecast of 3,000 bbld. The 
Company had targeted securing the necessary technical and 
budgetary approvals from partners in early 2010 in order to 
coordinate the drilling of two further producing wells (Phase III) 
in the PY-3 field at the beginning of 2011. Throughout 2010 the 
Company worked closely with all stakeholders to advance the 
process. Due to minimum time required for planning, preceding 
budgetary approval, and limited marine weather window, drilling 
is now planned to commence in the early part of 2012.
At the beginning of 2010 the Company had planned the drilling 
of up to four exploration wells in the Krishna Godavari Basin. In 
July 2010, the Government of India granted a three year drilling 
moratorium on all deepwater blocks including D3 and D9 to 
the end of 2010 allowing additional time for the joint venture 
to complete its minimum work programme. The Company 
subsequently participated in the drilling of two exploration wells 
and was delighted to announce the fourth consecutive natural 
gas discovery (Dhirubhai 52) on the Company’s D3 exploration 
block in the Krishna Godavari Basin. The well encountered a 
gross gas pay zone of 37.5 m in Pliocene aged sands. The 
second exploration well on the D9 exploration block recorded 
gas shows while drilling and proved the existence of reservoir 
quality sands and a biogenic gas petroleum system in this 
frontier, deep water block, but MDT testing indicated high water 
saturation. The cost of this well, which was plugged and 
abandoned following MDT testing, was well below budget.
2010 highlighted the continued 
success of Hardy’s exploration 
programme on the D3 block.
Appraisal of the earlier discoveries on the D3 (Dhirubhai 39 and 
41) and GS-01 (Dhirubhai 33) exploration blocks was planned 
for 2010. Hardy was pleased to confirm the submission of 
declaration of commerciality proposals, for the two blocks, 
to the GOI.
Through 2010 the Company continued to participate in a 
formal dispute resolution process to extend the expiry date 
of the CY-OS/2 licence. The process is expected to continue 
through 2011. 
In the last quarter of 2010, the Company completed the sale of 
its Nigerian assets realising net proceeds of $4.3 million. The 
transaction is consistent with Hardy’s stated objective to 
concentrate on evaluating the Company’s exploration interests 
and optimising its producing asset in India.
The table on page 13 provides a brief comparison of our stated 
operational objectives for 2010 and our subsequent 
accomplishments through the year.
2011 has commenced with a flurry of activity, and the Company 
is looking forward to the positive contribution BP, our new 
partner, will have on the exploration programmes on our assets 
in the Krishna Godavari Basin.
Outlook for 2011
PY-3 – Gross average daily production for January 2011 and 
February 2011 was 3,520 bbld and 3,512 bbld respectively. We 
anticipate that the PY-3 field will average gross daily production 
of approximately 3,100 bbld for 2011. 
PY-3 – During 2011, Hardy will seek approval from its partners 
and the GOI to drill two further producing wells at PY-3 field in 
2012, and upgrade the production facilities to include artificial 
lift to extend the field life.
“ We view the D3 exploration block with considerable 
optimism and believe that our existing portfolio 
offers significant organic growth potential.” Company

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 13
KG Basin – As announced on 21 February 2011, BP is acquiring 
an interest in 23 blocks from Reliance in India. Following final 
approvals, BP will hold 30 per cent interest in the blocks which 
include Hardy’s D3 and D9 blocks in the offshore Krishna 
Godavari Basin and AS-ONN-2000/1 in the Assam onshore basin.
D3 – The most recent W1 natural gas discovery on D3 brings 
the total number to four. The block has a large portfolio of 
undrilled prospects in various stages of maturation. Four of 
the six commitment wells have now been drilled on the D3 
exploration block. Several material undrilled prospects exist 
on this block and the timing of drilling the two remaining 
commitment wells is pending the 3D seismic PSDM processing 
in the ‘Panhandle’ area and regional integration and prioritisation 
of prospects.
D3 – An application for commerciality of three of the discoveries 
was submitted to DGH during the first quarter of 2011, while 
an appraisal programme was submitted for the fourth discovery. 
The Krishna Godavari Basin is an emerging world-class 
petroleum province and, together with rapidly improving Indian 
gas pipeline infrastructure and high demand for gas, the 
prospects for the economic development of gas resources in 
this area are excellent.
D9 – Following the KG-D9-B3 exploration well result on D9 
announced earlier this year, which was subsequently plugged 
and abandoned, Hardy is working with the operator to update 
plans for this extensive block. The joint venture has submitted 
a request for a six month extension to July 2011 for phase I and 
is likely to drill the third of a four-well commitment within this 
time period.
GS-01 – Hardy expects to receive approval of commerciality in 
respect of the application made for the West Coast offshore, 
GS-01 Dhirubhai 33 natural gas discovery, in the near future.

2010 Operations
The Company’s D3 block provided the highlight of Hardy’s 
exploration programme with the drilling and testing of the fourth 
successive discovery of gas on the Company’s D3 block 
(Dhirubhai 52). The primary results of operations undertaken on 
this block in 2010 are listed below:
KGV-D3-W1
On 31 August 2010, the Company announced a fourth 
discovery on the D3 block (Dhirubhai 52). The well KGV-
D3-W1, was drilled in a water depth of 1,653 m to a total 
measured depth of 3,501 m. A gross gas pay zone of 37.5 m 
was encountered in Pliocene aged sands. The potential of the 
pay was evaluated by wire-line based modular pressure testing 
tool and collection of gas samples. Following post drill data 
analyses and integration with regional data, the KGV-D3-W1 
gas accumulation was included with the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 
gas discoveries as part of the Declaration of Commerciality 
(DOC) submission.
Additional interpretation and processing of the block wide 3D 
seismic surveys was continued on previously acquired data, 
including PSTM and AVO/inversion studies. 
2011 Outlook
Exploration
The joint venture is planning for the drilling of at least one 
additional exploration well by the fourth quarter of 2011 
following PSDM processing of the ‘Panhandle’ area 3D seismic 
and integration with the area geologic model. Current 
exploration analyses involve the multi-play evaluation and 
prospect ranking/risking in the prospect rich block. The drilling 
of the remaining two exploration wells will meet the block’s 
phase one minimum work programme commitments.
DOC of Dhirubhai 39 and 41: In February 2011, the D3 joint 
venture Operating Committee reviewed and approved for 
Governmental submittal, a Commerciality Report of the Dhirubhai 
39 and 41 gas discoveries in conjunction with the recently drilled 
Dhirubhai 52 discovery. The proposed development is a dry gas, 
subsea cluster development with the flexibility to add in additional 
zones and future area discoveries. It is anticipated that MC 
approval of the document will occur in 2011 following government 
review. This will in turn lead to preparation of a detailed field 
development plan for the discoveries.
Appraisal of Dhirubhai 44: In February 2011, the D3 joint 
venture Operating Committee reviewed and approved an 
appraisal programme for the evaluation of the Dhirubhai 44 
gas discovery (KGV-D3-R1). The appraisal programme provides 
for the undertaking of various geological, geophysical and 
development concept studies.
Background
The D3 block, situated in the emerging world class Krishna 
Godavari Basin in India, encompasses an area of 3,288 km
2
, is 
in water depths ranging from 400 m to 2,200 m, and is located 
approximately 45 km offshore. The block is operated by 
Reliance with BP as a new 30 per cent partner.
The minimum work programme for phase one of the licence 
requires the drilling of six exploration wells. To date, four 
exploration wells have been drilled and one well has been 
pre-drilled. The block encompasses several different play types 
ranging from shallow Pleistocene, stratigraphically trapped 
biogenic gas sands, to toe-thrust related Miocene structural 
traps with mixed biogenic and thermogenic sourcing.

Block KG-DWN-2001/1 (D9): Exploration
(Hardy 10 per cent interest)
2010 Operations
2010 saw the continuation of the drilling and geotechnical 
evaluation of the block’s exploration programme. There are three 
play types postulated to be present in the block: structural 
(anticlines – northern, central and southern); strati-structural; 
and stratigraphic. The D9 joint venture has initially focused 
exploration efforts in the north west corner of the block covering 
an area of approximately 3,640 km
2
.
KG-D9-B3
On 5 January 2011, the Company announced the plugging and 
abandonment with gas shows of the second exploration well on 
the D9 block. The well KG-D9-B3, was drilled in a water depth 
of 2,948 m to a total measured depth of 3,829 m. The nearest 
well control is 47 km distant. The well encountered two Tertiary 
aged reservoir quality sand packages of gross thickness 70 and 
40 m each, with gas shows ranging from 6 per cent to  
9 per cent recorded while drilling. Testing was carried out with 
the MDT tool which indicated high water saturation in the  
sand packages.
2011 Outlook
Exploration
Although the KG-D9-B3 well results were disappointing, the 
presence of thick reservoir quality sands and the presence of a 
petroleum system are encouraging for further exploration 
efforts. The cost of this well, which was plugged and 
abandoned following MDT testing, was well below budget.
The joint venture is planning for the drilling of at least one 
additional exploration well during the second quarter of 2011 
following geologic and geophysical analysis of the KG-D9-B3 
well and integration with the area geologic model. The drilling of 
the remaining two exploration wells will meet the block’s phase 
one minimum work programme commitments.
Background
The licence encompasses 11,605 km
2
 in the Bay of Bengal 
where water depths vary from 2,300 m to 3,100 m. The block is 
operated by Reliance with BP as the new 30 per cent partner. 
The joint venture has acquired over 4,188 km
2
 of 3D seismic 
data. Regarding the status of the D9 block, the operator has 
been granted a drilling moratorium for three years from January 
2008 to December 2010 on the basis that the Operator has  
not been able to complete the minimum work obligations of 
exploratory drilling in view of non-availability of suitable deep 
water rigs in the international market. The joint venture has 
applied for a six month extension to July 2011 in order to 
continue its minimum work programme.

The GS-01 joint venture concluded various geological and 
geophysical studies in relation to the appraisal of the GS01-B1 
gas and condensate discovery (Dhirubhai 33), culminating in 
the submittal of a proposal for declaration of commerciality. 
2011 Outlook
Hardy expects to receive approval of commerciality in respect 
of the application made for the GS-01 Dhirubhai 33 natural gas 
discovery in the near future.
Background
The GS-01 exploration licence is located in the Gujarat-
Saurashtra offshore basin off the west coast of India, north 
west of the prolific Bombay High oil field. The original licence 
encompassed 8,841 km
2
 (5,890 km
2
 post relinquishment) and 
water depths vary between 80 m and 150 m. 
The joint venture has previously acquired 2,216 km2 of 3D 
seismic data. As announced on 15 May 2007, the Dhirubhai 33 
discovery (GS01-B1) flow-tested at a rate of 18.6 mmscfd gas 
with 415 bbld of condensate through a 56/64” choke at flowing 
tubing head pressure of 1,346 psi. Upon completion of phase 
one of the exploration programme the joint venture elected not 
to proceed to the second phase of exploration. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 16

2010 Operations
In 2010 the Company processed and interpreted the newly 
acquired 390 line km of 2D data. The exploration block’s phase 
one minimum work programme has now been completed. Two 
material structural prospects have been mapped in the block 
from the new seismic data and are now under additional G & G 
evaluation for possible drilling. A request for a six month 
extension of phase one was submitted to the GOI in the fourth 
quarter of 2010, which is under consideration.
2011 Outlook
Subject to the extension request, the Assam joint venture will 
take a decision to enter into phase two of the exploration 
programme. The phase two work commitment consists of the 
drilling of one well within a two year period.
Background
The AS-ONN-2000/1 exploration licence is located onshore 
in the north eastern state of Assam, India and north of the 
Brahmaputra river. The block is operated by Reliance with BP 
as the new 30 per cent partner. The exploration licence covers 
an area of 5,754 km
2
 and falls within the districts of Darrang and 
Sonitpur. The block is in phase one of a three phase exploration 
licence. Phase one (three years) expired in January 2011 for 
which an extension request has been made.
The topography of the area is primarily a plain of low relief 
and there is a reasonably established road network across the 
block. A national highway runs parallel to the Brahmaputra river 
and passes through the block. Different play types expected are 
structural (anticlinal and fault closures), stratigraphic (pinchout/
wedgeout) within Palaeocene–Eocene and Gondwana 
packages and unconventional fractured/weathered basement.

2010 Production
Gross average daily field production for the year ended 31 
December 2010 was 3,156 bbld (2009: 1,535 bbld; 2008: 
2,542 bbld). The production facilities’ uptime performance was 
93 per cent (2009: 51 per cent). The increase in production 
was the result of a return to full production on 24 January 2010 
following the extended shut down during 2009 and the positive 
effect of water injection based reservoir pressure support. The 
field recommenced production on 24 January 2010.
In 2010, the joint venture extended the contract of the PY-3 
field’s production facility to 23 April 2011 under same terms and 
conditions. Negotiation for a long term facility contract with 
upgraded facilities is ongoing as part of a combined field 
redevelopment plan which is under evaluation.
Gross average daily production for January 2011 and February 
2011 was 3,520 bbld and 3,512 bbld respectively. We anticipate 
that the PY-3 field will average gross daily production of 
approximately 3,100 bbld for 2011.
2010 Operations
Hardy has revised its geological and reservoir simulation 
models to incorporate new data gathered from the PY3-PD4-RL 
well which was drilled in 2009 and additional 3D seismic 
processing and interpretation. PSDM (pre-stack depth 
migration) and seismic facies analysis (Stratamagic) processing 
of the previously acquired 3D seismic survey was completed 
and integrated into new reservoir models. The revised models 
are the basis for the planned drilling and production facility 
programmes.

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 17
2011 Outlook
The Company expects gross daily production of the PY-3 field 
to average 3,100 bbld in 2011. The PY-3 field joint venture’s 
Technical and Operating Committees have recommended the 
drilling of two additional wells and facility upgrades including 
gas compression for gas lift and sales gas. Drilling of these 
wells is expected to commence in 2012, following the 2011 
Monsoon (September – December). Commencement of drilling 
is subject to securing unanimous budget approval from the joint 
venture partners.
Background
The PY-3 field is located off the east coast of India 80 km south 
of Pondicherry in water depths between 40 m and 450 m. 
The Cauvery Basin was developed in the late Jurassic/early 
Cretaceous period and straddles the present-day east coast of 
India. The licence, which covers 81 km
2
, produces high quality 
light crude oil (49° API).
The field was developed using floating production facilities 
and subsea wellheads, a first for an offshore field in India. The 
facility at PY-3 consists of the floating production unit, ‘Tahara’, 
and a 65,000 DWT tanker, ‘Endeavour’, which acts as a floating 
storage and offloading unit. There are four sub-sea wells tied 
back to Tahara. Tahara has a three-stage crude oil separation 
system, with the first two stages being three-phase separators 
and the third stage a two-phase separator.
Liquid processing capacity on Tahara is 20,000 bbld with 
17 mmscfd of gas handling capacity. The field currently 
produces associated gas in the range of 3.5 mmscfd. This 
produced gas is used as fuel gas with excess gas being flared. 
The stabilised crude oil is pumped from Tahara to Endeavour 
for storage and offloading to shuttle tankers. Crude oil from 
the PY-3 field is sold to CPCL at its refinery in Nagapattinam,

(Hardy 75 per cent interest – Operator)
2010 Operations
The formal dispute resolution process to extend the expiry date 
of this licence is progressing.
2011 Outlook
Following confirmation of the extension period, through the 
dispute resolution process, Hardy will undertake the activities 
necessary to fully appraise the Ganesha discovery. It is unlikely 
that an appraisal well will be drilled in 2011.
Background
Licence block CY-OS/2 is located in the northern part of the 
Cauvery Basin immediately offshore from Pondicherry and 
covers approximately 859 km
2
. The CY-OS/2 licence comprises 
two retained areas. The northern area includes the Fan A-1 
discovery and the southern area lies immediately adjacent to 
the HEPI operated PY-3 field. The PY-1 gas field, a separate 
ring-fenced licence, lies within the southern part of the acreage 
and commenced production in the third quarter of 2010.
Ganesha
On 8 January 2007, the Company announced that the Fan A-1 
exploration well had discovered hydrocarbons. In August 2007, 
the Company announced that it would proceed to the appraisal 
phase of the Ganesha non-associated gas discovery to 
establish potential commerciality.
“ We anticipate that the PY-3 field will average  
gross daily production of approximately  
3,100 bbld for 2011.” 2010

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 18
During 2010, the Company enjoyed an increase in 
revenue, resulting from higher production (72 per cent) 
and higher crude oil prices (54 per cent). This has 
resulted in an increase in gross profit, the recording of 
operating profit (compared with a loss for 2009) and a 
profitable year. 
The Company generated cash flow from continuing operations 
(before non-cash working capital changes) of $4.0 million 
compared with a deficiency of $3.6 million. In October 2010, 
the Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Hardy Oil 
(Africa) Limited (including its wholly owned subsidiary Hardy Oil 
Nigeria Limited) for net cash consideration of $4.3 million. In 
December 2010, the Company successfully placed 3.37 million 
Ordinary Shares for net proceeds of $9.5 million. As a result, 
Hardy completed the year with cash and short-term investments 
of approximately $36.5 million and no long-term debt.

Production, Sales and Revenue
The Company operates the PY-3 field in the Cauvery Basin with 
an 18 per cent participating interest. Gross average daily field 
production for the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to 
3,156 stbd compared with 1,535 stbd for 2009. The increase is 
due to the resumption of production from the PY-3 field on 24 
January 2010 whereas there was unplanned six month shut-in of 
the field to undertake repair of the offshore facilities in 2009. 
Revenue from oil sales (after profit oil) increased to $12.9 
million in 2010 compared to $7.7 million in 2009. The average 
price realised per barrel increased significantly by 54 percent 
from $52.96 during 2009 to $81.71 in 2010. Average daily 
sales amounted to 525 stbd compared with 398 stbd. Hardy’s 
share of profit oil to GOI amounted to $2.8 million in 2010. No 
profit oil was payable in 2009 as a result of unutilised capital 
cost recovery pool. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales (production, depletion and decommissioning 
costs) for 2010 increased from $6.8 million in 2009 to $8.0

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19
for more than eleven months in 2010 compared with six months 
in 2009. Average cost amounted to $40.23 per barrel in 2010 
compared with $49.16 per barrel during 2009. Production cost 
per barrel was substantially reduced from $37.87 in 2009 to 
$25.66 in 2010.
 
Gross Profit
As a result, gross profit increased more than five-fold from $0.8 
million in 2009 to $5.2 million in 2010. The substantial increase 
is principally the result of higher revenues from higher oil sales, 
a higher average crude oil price realised in 2010 as well as a 
reduction in production cost per barrel.
Administrative Expenses 
Administrative expenses decreased substantially from $8.4 
million in 2009 to $3.3 million in 2010. The decrease is 
principally the result of a share based credit of $0.9 million 
recorded in 2010 compared with a charge of $2.8 million in 
2009. Also during 2009, additional costs associated with the 
drilling of PY3-PD4-RL well in early 2009 of $1.0 million were 
recorded of which $0.5 million was recovered in 2010. 
Operating Profit 
During October 2010, the Company divested of its operations 
in Nigeria. As a result, the Nigerian operations have been reported 
in the 2010 financial statements as discontinued operations.
The Company is reporting an operating profit from continuing 
operations of $1.9 million in 2010 compared with an operating 
loss of $7.5 million in 2009.
Interest and Investment Income 
Investment and other income in 2010 amounted to $0.4 million 
compared with $0.3 million in 2009 as a result of higher 
average cash balances during 2010.
Finance Costs 
Finance costs principally include the cost of providing bank 
guarantees to the GOI required by the provisions of production 
sharing contracts. 
Profit before Taxation 
The Company has recorded a profit before taxation from 
continuing operations of $2.2 million compared to a loss before 
taxation of $7.4 million in 2009. This results principally from 
higher revenues and a lower per barrel production cost, offset 
by lower general and administrative expenses.
Taxation
The Company has recorded a tax credit of $1.8 million during 
2010 compared to a tax credit of $1.4 million in 2009. This 
arises principally as a result the crystallisation of loss with 
respect to an inter company loan from the Company to Hardy 
Oil (Africa) Limited of $3.7 million, Minimum Alternate Tax offset 
having regard to a ten-year carry forward period, and the non 
taxability of certain share based payments.
Net Profit from Continuing Operations
As a result, the Company recorded profit for the year from 
continuing operations of $4.0 million compared to a loss of 
$5.9 million for 2009.
Discontinued Operations
Effective 30 September 2010, the Company sold its Nigerian 
operations for net cash consideration of $4.3 million which 
approximated the net book value of underlying assets resulting 
in no gain or loss on the transaction. Overhead and depreciation 
expense was recorded amounting to $0.8 million and was 
recorded for the period to the end of September 2010.
Total Comprehensive Income
As a result, the Company recorded total comprehensive income 
of $3.2 million compared to a loss of $6.5 million in 2009.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
During 2010, the Company generated cash flow from continuing 
operations activities, before changes in non-cash working capital, 
amounting to $4.0 million. This compares with cash used in 
operating activities, before changes in working capital, of $3.6 
million in 2009. The positive cash flow results principally from 
higher oil sales (resulting from more than eleven months of 
production in 2010 compared with six months in 2009) and higher 
oil prices, as well as lower general administrative expenses. After 
non-cash working capital changes, cash used in continuing 
operating activities amounted to $0.9 million in 2010, compared 
to $0.4 million in 2009 resulting from increase in accounts 
receivable and a decrease in accounts payable at the end of 2010.
Cash used in discontinued operations amounted to $0.7 million 
in 2010 compared with $0.6 million in 2009 and principally 
represents ongoing overhead in connection with 
Nigerian operations.
Capital Expenditure 
Capital expenditure amounted to $6.1 million during 2010, 
compared to $13.6 million incurred during 2009. Capital 
expenditures amounting to $3.4 million and $2.5 million were 
incurred on the D3 and D9 blocks respectively principally on the 
drilling of exploration wells.
Sale of Hardy Oil (Africa) Limited
During October 2010, the Company sold its entire investment in 
Hardy Oil (Africa) Limited for a net cash consideration of $4.3 
million. As a result of this divestment, the Company no longer 
has any operations in Nigeria. All of its operating assets at the 
end of 2010 are in India.
Site Restoration Deposit 
This represents the deposit for site restoration for future site 
restoration expenses for the PY-3 field. In 2010, the Company 
increased the site restoration deposit by $0.5 million compared 
with $0.4 million in 2009. 
Financing Activities 
During December 2010, the Company completed a placing of 
3,370,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of £2.01 per share for 
net cash consideration of $9.5 million. During April 2009, the 
Company completed a placing of 6,208,997 Ordinary Shares at 
a price of £1.74 per share resulting in net proceeds from the 
equity issue of $15.2 million. In addition, the Company received 
investment income on its surplus cash resources amounting to 
$0.4 million. 
Cash and Short-term Investments 
The Company’s cash and short-term investments increased by 
$6.0 million to $36.5 million at the end of 2010. The Company’s 
net proceeds from financing ($9.5 million) coupled with net 
proceeds from the sale of its Nigerian operations ($4.3 million) 
exceeded its capital expenditure requirements and funds required 
for operations resulting in a $6.0 million increase in cash 
resources. The Company does not have any long-term debt.
Summary Statement of Financial Position 
Hardy’s non-current assets have essentially remained at $148.7 
million. Current assets represent the Group’s cash and short-
term investments, trade and other receivables and inventory and 
have increased from $36.8 million to $43.6 million. At the end 
of 2010, of the $43.6 million of current assets, $36.5 million are 
represented by cash and short-term investments.  2010

Current liabilities are principally trade and other accounts 
payable. The level of current liabilities is $13.4 million at the 
end of 2010 compared with $15.4 million at the end of 2009. 
During 2010, the Company issued $9.5 million of equity and 
recorded a profit of $3.2 million. Consequently, the Company’s 
net assets increased from $155.5 million at the end of 2009 to 
$167.3 million at the end of 2010. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The Company has successfully raised financing in the past to 
provide funding for its ongoing exploration and development 
programmes and to augment its working capital. Having regard 
to Hardy’s existing working capital position and its ability to 
raise potential financing, the directors are of the opinion that the 
Company has adequate resources to enable it to undertake its 
planned work programme of exploration, appraisal and 
development activities over the next 12 months. At the end of 
2010, the Group has cash resources of $36.5 million and had 
no long term debt.
Dividends 
The Company has limited internally generated cash flows and has 
a planned capital expenditure programme. In the circumstances, 
the directors have chosen to reinvest cash flows and do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend in the foreseeable future.
Risk Factors
Hardy is in the international upstream oil and gas business which 
faces a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external 
risks. Under these distinct classes, the Company has identified 
certain risks pertinent to its business including: exploration and 
reserve risks; loss of key human resources; drilling and operating 
risks; security risk in area of operations; costs and availability of 
materials and services; economic and sovereign risks, market 
risk, foreign currency risk, loss of or changes to production 
sharing or concession agreements, joint venture or related 
agreements; and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic 
objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation. 
Hardy manages its risks through compliance with the terms of 
its agreements and application of appropriate policies and 
procedures, and through the recruitment and retention of skilled 
individuals throughout the organisation. Further, the Company 
has focused its activities mainly in known hydrocarbon basins in 
jurisdictions that have previously established long-term oil and 
gas ventures with foreign oil and gas companies, existing 
infrastructure of services and oil and gas transportation 
facilities, and reasonable proximity to markets.
A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Company and the way in which these risks are mitigated is 
provided under: ‘Risks and Uncertainties’ section of this report.
Key Financial Risks
In addition to the global financial risks described above, the 
Company is subject to the following specific financial risks. 
Foreign Exchange Risk 
The proceeds of the Group’s domestic oil and gas sales in India 
are received in US dollars. The majority of the Group’s 
expenditure requirements are in US dollars. The Group has 
general and administrative expenditure with respect to offices in 
India and the United Kingdom. Therefore the Group is exposed 
to foreign exchange risk against Indian rupees and, UK sterling. 
The Company has raised equity capital in the past and has 
received proceeds in UK sterling. The Company generally 
keeps funds in sterling to meet ongoing requirements for the 
foreseeable future. Any surplus sterling funds are converted 
into US dollars. Funds are converted into other currencies as 
and when required. 
Liquidity Risk 
The Group’s cash requirements and cash reserves are 
projected for the Group as a whole and for each country in 
which operations are conducted. Whereas the Group currently 
has no debt, going forward the Group expects to meet these 
requirements through an appropriate mix of available cash, 
equity funds and debt financing. The Group further mitigates 
liquidity risk by seeking funds well in advance of requirements 
and by maintaining an insurance programme to minimise 
exposure to insurable losses. 
Commodity Price Risk 
Historically, oil prices have fluctuated widely and are affected 
by numerous factors over which the Group has no control, 
including world production levels, international economic 
trends, exchange rate fluctuations, expectations for inflation, 
speculative activity, consumption patterns and global or regional 
political events. The aggregate effect of these factors is 
impossible to predict. The production estimates for PY-3 and 
the oil prices will vary depending upon market conditions, which 
are not within the control of the Group. The Group’s production 
in India sold to CPCL is based on the 30 day average (14 day 
prior and 15 day after crude delivery) of Brent Crude less 
$0.35. The Board has no immediate intention to enter into fixed 
price contracts. Although oil prices may fluctuate widely, it is the 
Group’s present policy not to hedge crude oil sales. 
Status of CY-OS/2 Discovery Block 
The auditors have provided an emphasis of matter comment in 
their audit report with reference to the uncertainty concerning 
the Group’s request for an extension of its exploration licence in 
block CY-OS/2 as disclosed in notes 2 and 15 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The Company’s Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement, Review of Operations, Financial Review, and Risks 
and Uncertainties have been prepared to substantially comply 
with the Accounting Standards Board Operating and Financial 
Review Reporting Statement issued in January 2006.

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 21
As an oil and gas exploration and production company 
with operations focused in India, Hardy is subject to a  
variety of risks and uncertainties. Managing risk 
effectively is a critical element of our corporate 
responsibility and underpins the safe delivery of our 
business plans and strategic objectives. It protects our 
reputation, supports our ability to do business and helps 
to create long-term competitive advantage. The Group 
has a systematic approach to risk identification and 
management which combines the Board’s assessment of 
risk with risk factors originating from and identified by 
the Group’s senior management team.
Clear responsibility 
The Board is responsible for the overall group strategy, 
acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital 
expenditure projects, corporate costs, significant financing 
matters and the management of risk. The Board recognises that 
risk is inherent across Hardy’s operations, and all activities are 
subject to an appropriate review to ensure that risks are 
identified monitored and managed to the extent possible.
Identification and monitoring 
The Board has adopted a framework for risk assessment and 
monitoring providing for four distinct categories: strategic; 
financial; operational; and compliance. The Board’s review of 
the Company’s risks and uncertainties involves a detailed 
description of each risk and an assessment of its perceived 
relevance and likelihood of materially impacting Hardy’s 
business. Risks that are identified as high and or trending 
upwards are noted and assigned to the executive directors to 
monitor and if possible pro-actively mitigated. The Board is 
provided regular updates of the identified principal risks at 
scheduled Board meetings.
The underlying risks and uncertainties inherent with Hardy’s 
current business model are summarised below.
Strategy risk 
The Group’s strategy is predominantly driven by the exploration, 
appraisal, development and production of its existing assets in 
India. There are risks inherent in the exploration, appraisal, 
development and production of oil and gas reserves and 
resources. The Group’s strategy includes acquiring additional 
oil and gas properties principally in India. The Group cannot 
guarantee that it will be able to identify appropriate properties, 
or negotiate acquisitions on favourable terms, or that it will be 
able to secure the financing necessary to complete such  
future acquisitions.
Financial risk 
Any volatility and future decreases in crude oil prices could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, 
financial condition and results of operations. Other major 
financial risks facing the Company are: failure to receive 
extensions for expiring exploration and production contracts; 
inability to access debt and/or equity financing for further 
exploration and development; cost inflation or overruns 
associated with exploration; appraisal and development 
activities; and overall deterioration of shareholder sentiment. 
Additional discussion of financial risks is provided for in the 
Financial Review section.
Operations risk
Exploration and production activities by their nature involve 
significant risks. Risks such as delays in executing work 
programmes as a result of access to drilling rigs, in the 
construction and commissioning of drilling platforms or other 
technical difficulties, lack of access to key infrastructure, 
adverse weather conditions, environmental hazards, industrial 
accidents, occupational and health hazards, technical failures, 
labour disputes, unusual or unexpected geological formations, 
explosions and other acts of God are inherent to the business. 
Compliance risk 
The Group’s current business is dependent on the continuing 
enforceability of the PSCs, farm-in agreements and exploration 
and development licences. The Group’s core operational 
activities are dependent on securing various governmental 
approvals. Developments in politics, laws, regulations and, or 
general adverse public sentiment could compromise securing 
such approvals in the future.
Emphasis of matter 
The Board notes that the auditors have provided an emphasis of 
matter comment in their audit report with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s request for an extension of 
its exploration licence in block CY-OS/2. In 2010, the Group 
formally commenced arbitration proceedings pursuant to 
dispute resolution provisions of the governing PSC.
The Group holds a 75 per cent participating interest in the 
block CY-OS/2 which is offshore on the south east coast of 
India. Intangible assets include an amount of $83,530,141 with 
respect to exploration expenditures on the block wherein a gas 
discovery was announced on 8 January 2007. The exploration 
period for the block ended on 23 March 2007 and the GOI has 
been requested to extend the block for appraisal and 
declaration of commerciality for its gas discovery for a period of 
five years from the date of discovery period.
Provisions of the PSC provide for an appraisal period of 60 
months from the date of discovery. For an oil discovery, this 
period is limited to 24 months. DGH has informed HEPI that in 
their opinion the discovery is classified as an oil discovery and 
not a NANG discovery.
The Company has obtained third party legal and technical 
opinions that support the Company’s view that the discovery is 
NANG and have referred the dispute to arbitration for 
adjudication. The Group believes that it will be successful in 
obtaining the extension of its licence in the arbitration.
In the event that HEPI’s application for an extension of the 
CY-OS/2 licence was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised 
expenditure will be subject to impairment testing.
Risks and Uncertainties Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 22
Principal risks for 2011
Throughout the year, Hardy’s senior management and Board have critically reviewed and evaluated the risks facing the Group. As a 
result of this process, the Board has synthesised these risks in this year’s report by defining the principle risks and uncertainties for 
2011 and establishing clear policies and responsibilities to mitigate their possible negative impact to the business, a summary of 
which is provided below:
Risk Mitigation
Strategic Ineffective or poorly executed strategy fails to create stakeholder value or fails to meet 
stakeholder expectations.
Asset portfolio over-weighted to 
long-cycle exploration licences
Preferential allocation of resources to advance current discoveries to the development stage. 
Continually assessing acquisition opportunities, consistent with stated objectives, offering 
near-term production increases. 
Overdependence on a single 
partner and lack of control to 
drive value creating activities
Proactive communication with partner to drive corporate interests and mandates. Each licence is 
governed by joint operating agreements, which provide for processes and procedures designed 
to ensure that the input and interests of non-operating partners are considered. The pending 
addition of BP as a partner to our key exploration licences should further facilitate progress.
Financial Asset performance and excessive leverage results in the Group being unable to meet its 
financial obligations as and when they are due.
Cost overruns of exploration 
programme
Lower participating interest and maintaining strong working capital position to mitigate against 
operations exceeding budgeted number of drilling days.
Reliance on a single producing 
well for revenue
Advance phase III development programme with a view to increasing production from one to up 
to four wells. Maintain sufficient working capital to account for an extended shut-in of the field. 
Maintaining tight controls on overhead inflation.
Relinquishment of assets may 
result in impairment provision
Continue to work closely with partners to ensure minimum work programmes are complete within 
permitted time. 
CY-OS/2 arbitration ruling may 
result in an impairment 
provision
Arbitration process is ongoing. The Company has obtained strong legal and technical opinions in 
support of its position, retained legal counsel in India and assigned the CFO of HEPI to manage 
the process.
Operational Operational event impacting staff, contractors, communities or the environment leading to 
loss of reputation and/or revenue.
An accident or blowout could 
occur during offshore drilling 
operations
The Company’s work programme for 2011 involves the drilling of at least two deepwater wells. 
These wells are on non-operated blocks and as such the Company relies on the HSE procedures 
mandated by the operator and the contractors. Liabilities associated with an accident are insured 
to the extent reasonably possible.
Sustained sub-commercial 
exploration results
Effective portfolio management (low interest, many assets) comprised with rigorous review and 
implementation of best practice exploration processes and techniques. Internal expertise review 
process and, when necessary third party consultation prior to Board approval.
Reliance on a single producing 
asset – limited life of field in 
absence of further development 
The imminent approval of the GS-01 commerciality proposal will enable Hardy to advance plans 
for development. The Company is also indicating that it plans to evaluate acquisitions that have 
the potential to contribute short to medium term production.
Failure to secure budgetary 
approval for PY-3 Phase III 
drilling 
Continue to communicate with partners and DGH to build consensus and obtain unanimous 
approval of operating and development budgets for the field. 
Compliance The overall external political, industry or market environment may negatively impact on the 
Group’s ability to independently grow and manage its business.
Deteriorating stakeholder 
sentiment 
Communicate with investors on a regular basis providing transparent and timely information. 
Effectively convey strategic goals and objectives and improve delivery.
Changing regulatory and 
political environment in India
Develop sustainable relationships with governments and communities. Indian PSC includes 
fiscal stability clauses. Actively collaborate with industry groups to formulate and communicate 
interests to government authorities.

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 23
Corporate Social Responsibility
To deliver this goal, our investment and operational 
decisions take appropriate account of the social, health, 
safety and environmental impacts that may arise during 
our activities.
Based on mutual respect and understanding, the Group strives 
to build and maintain enduring relationships with the GOI, local 
authorities, partners and business associates. Respecting the 
rich cultural diversity of the regions in which we engage in 
business, the Group strives to minimise our impact on the 
environment, taking into consideration the unique requirements 
of the region and local working practices to achieve optimum 
performance and timely delivery of projects. 
Corporate social responsibility is a fundamental part of 
implementing the Group’s corporate strategy and has both 
practical and ethical dimensions. It includes managing business 
concerns, such as risk, enhancing reputation in conjunction with 
investing in the community, and creating a place where people 
feel good about working. 
The Group contributes to community and social development by 
carrying out its business activities in such a manner that provides 
energy and infrastructure, employment, skills development and 
trade to the areas in which the Group operates. The Group will 
consider monetary and human resource contributions to local 
social programmes which the Company deems appropriate to 
contribute or improve the overall well being of the communities in 
which we operate.
In 2010 the Company contributed donations to several charities 
in India. Hardy has consistently supported a Rotary International 
(District 3150) programme focused on increasing access to 
fresh water for agriculture and consumption in underdeveloped 
areas of southern India.
Health, Safety and Environment Activities
The Board has tailored the Group’s health safety and 
environment (HSE) policy and management system taking 
reference from world class operations to suit Indian conditions. 
Safety, security and emergency procedures have been 
incorporated into the weave of the Group’s operations. The 
central HSE Committee and Environment Management 
Committees meet on a monthly basis to assess and monitor 
compliance. The Group regularly undertakes internal and 
external HSE audits, including pre-mobilisation HSE audit of 
rigs and vessels. The Group undertakes periodical 
environmental marine monitoring around production facilities 
and around the drilling locations. Prompt compliance with 
applicable regulations by the Group has been recognised by 
concerned agencies.
All statutory requirements and certification for the operating 
facilities at PY-3 field were maintained. Compliance to 
ministerial and regulatory bodies such as OISD, DGH, MOEF, 
DGMS, ODAG, Coast Guard, Navy, TMB and others are 
maintained by forwarding necessary reports as required. Hardy 
participates in different meetings convened by these agencies. 
Senior officials from these agencies also visited our offshore 
facilities and appreciate our HSE management system.
The CHSE Committee, the Company’s apex body on HSE 
activities, meet every month and review the HSE plans, 
activities, accidents/incidents pertaining to the month. 
Representatives from contractors are also invited for these 
meetings. Regular HSE audits, drills and emergency exercises 
are carried out in all facilities offshore.
Hardy is committed to 
applying high ethical 
standards to maintain its 
reputation as an employer 
and operator of choice. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 24

Environmental Impact Policy and Performance
Offshore petroleum operations interact with marine environment 
which can lead to short-term and long-term physical, chemical 
and biological changes to the area.
Marine
As a part of the commitment for environmental protection and 
towards compliance to the conditions imposed by Ministry of 
Environment and Forests, Hardy has been regularly carrying out 
an environmental marine monitoring programme to assess the 
quality of the marine environment since 1998. A marine 
environmental survey was carried out in 2008 by Onshore & 
Offshore Environmental Consultants in collaboration with the 
Advanced Centre for Marine Biology, Annamalai University. This 
has been accomplished through implementation of adequate 
preventive and control measures.
Based on the detailed study and factors highlighted above, it 
clearly reveals that the marine environment in and around PY-3 
oil field has not been altered or affected by the ongoing 
production activities. Numeration of phyto and zooplanktons 
shows that the populations and diversity of the region is 
maintained and the environment is healthy with good 
productivity. Infaunal analysis reveals that the sediments are rich 
in invertebrate fauna with diverse groups of marine organisms. 
Toxicological studies on fish and crustaceans indicate that the 
bio-accumulation is within permissible limits. The values 
obtained during the present study are in accordance with the 
other marine environments in this region. Company

“ Grass roots level interaction give Hardy the 
awareness of local communities’ sensibilities  
and needs.”
Environmental Management System
Hardy’s Environmental Management System is intended to mitigate the risks of marine pollution due to routine and accidental 
discharges of wastes and consequent adverse impacts on the marine environment. 
Offshore oil platforms generally generate the following wastes:
major produced water, drilling fluids and drill cuttings; and  —
minor deck drainage, sanitary waste and domestic waste.  —
The various conventions held and agreements reached for setting limits for discharge from offshore oil/gas exploration and production 
activities provide necessary guidelines for monitoring required standards before discharging different wastes. 
Set out below is a table outlining the major policies and measures that the Company undertakes as operator of the PY-3 field:
Routine discharges Control measures
Produced water Produced water recovered during crude oil or condensate gas treatment is generally warm and charged with 
salts and solids. The quantity of water produced given by the Water Oil Ratio (WOR) can increase 
considerably with the age of the oil field. Currently, the PY-3 field produces less than 10 stbd and is treated by 
gravity separation. Treated water is discharged overboard after confirming no oil content within allowable limits.
Drilling fluids Drilling fluids are used in exploration and production drilling to maintain hydrostatic pressure control in the well 
and to lubricate the drill bits. Water-based drilling fluids are currently discharged directly to the ocean after 
ensuring that there is no oil contamination.
Drill cuttings The drill cuttings removed from the well are rock debris and mineral particles generated by drilling into 
underground formations. The discharge of rock cuttings and mud may have adverse environmental effects 
especially by changing the sediment particle size distribution and also by the possible suffocation of benthic 
fauna. Except at sensitive areas such as corals and mangroves, water-based cuttings are allowed to be 
discharged directly into sea after clear separation from the drilling fluids and through washings.
Deck drainage Deck drainage is either collected and treated separately for oil removal by gravity separation or is handled by 
the Oil Water Sewage (OWS) system before discharge. Typically, OWS systems are provided with online 
analysers and if the oil content is above the preset value, it will not allow the water to be discharged.
Domestic wastes Domestic waste originates from kitchen, laundries and galleys located on drilling and production facilities. It 
typically comprises metal cans, glass or plastic bottles, papers, boxes and biodegradable wastes. This waste 
is segregated, stored and dispersed as per the waste management plans of the individual facilities concerned.
Sanitary wastes Sanitary waste generated from toilets and lavatories need to be treated before discharge. Our facilities are 
required to maintain a residual chlorine concentration in sanitary waste discharge as close to 1 mg/l as 
possible for disinfection purposes.
Oil spill  
contingency plan
An oil spill contingency plan has been prepared in line with IMO guidelines and the National Oil Spill Disaster 
Contingency Plan. It has been approved by Indian Coast Guard and Oil Industry Safety Directorate (under 
Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, GOI). As per the plan, resources required for an oil spill will be mobilised 
based on a tiered approach as follows: Tier 1 within local capability; Tier 2 over and above local capability, 
resources available with neighbour operations and national agencies (Viz. Indian Coast Guard) will also be 
mobilised; Tier 3 in addition to Tier 2 resources, resources from specialised agencies such as Oil Spill 
Response Ltd (OSRL), and EARL will also be mobilised. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 26
“ As an international oil and gas company, we 
facilitate the development of leadership from  
the communities in which we operate.”
Air Quality
Evaluation of environmental impact via regular ambient air 
quality studies, have confirmed that the air quality is not affected 
by offshore operations and the main focus of monitoring is of 
the impact on the immediate marine ecological system. 
Flaring: Gas produced from the PY-3 field is associated gas 
which is separated from the crude oil through conventional 
processing at the Tahara. Currently the field produces 
approximately 3.9 MMscfd. The current method of disposal is 
via power generation (for use on the Tahara) and flaring 
offshore. The flaring practice will continue until some viable 
alternate emerges. Close to PY-3 field, PY-1 gas field 
commence production in 2009 and the PY-3 joint venture is 
evaluating possibility of routing a pipeline to the PY-1 gas field.
Employment Practices
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunities in career 
development, promotion, training and reward for all of our 
employees. We continually monitor the skills required to manage 
our activities and ensure there is a balance of skilled, 
experienced expatriate and local employees in our offices. We 
seek to avoid discrimination in the workplace in support of our 
aim to attract, develop and retain talented and committed 
people to deliver our business goals and objectives.
Our India team continues to drive the core of our business and 
we will look to continue to retain and enhance our technical, 
operational and management competencies in this region. In 
2011 we will continue to need to receive excellence from our staff 
to effectively execute our 2011 work plan and beyond. The Board 
would like to take this moment to recognise the importance of our 
team and acknowledge their efforts in the past year.
Outlook
The Board believes that prevention of accidents, ill health and 
protection of the environment are essential to the efficient 
operation of its business. The Board is committed to high 
standards of HSE protection. These aspects command equal 
prominence with other business considerations in the decision 
making process. HSE protection are responsibilities shared by 
everyone working for the Company and the full support of all the 
Company’s staff, corporate partners, and contractors is vital to 
the successful implementation of this policy. The Board ensures 
that personnel are aware of their delegated HSE responsibilities 
and are properly trained to undertake them diligently. The Board 
aims to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to 
support this policy fully and to seek continuous improvement 
in performance. 
High corporate social responsibility standards and constant 
grass roots level interaction give the Group the awareness of 
local communities’ sensibilities and needs. With an awareness 
driving the commitment, the Group provides its expertise and 
resources, wherever required, to be a responsible Company.

Corporate Governance Statement
Introduction
Hardy Oil and Gas plc is incorporated in the Isle of Man. The Company is not subject to any corporate governance regime in its 
place of incorporation. The Company substantially complies with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and supports 
high standards of corporate governance.
Although Hardy is a publicly listed company and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities since 
February 2008, the Company continues to be an explorer with limited cash flows and a modest employee base of approximately 
50 people. The Company has a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources to support its exploration programme. 
As such, the Company strives to maintain a balance between conservation of limited resources and maintaining robust corporate 
governance practices. As the Company evolves the Board is committed to address specific Combined Code deficiencies and enhance 
the Company’s corporate governance policies and practices deemed appropriate for the size and maturity of the organisation.
Set out below are Hardy’s corporate governance practices for the year ended 31 December 2010. Disclosures below include 
matters where Hardy has not fully complied during 2010 and its plans for compliance during 2011.
Board of Directors
Composition
The Company’s Board presently has six directors, comprised of two Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors.
Each of the existing executive directors has extensive knowledge of the oil and gas industry with combined experience in excess of 
60 years. The Non-Executive Directors have either held senior appointments in oil and gas companies, companies with interests in 
the energy sector or have significant corporate and financial experience and bring a broad range of business and commercial 
experience to the Board. The Board believes that its composition is suitable for operating an effective publicly traded international 
junior oil and gas company.
Role and Operations of the Board
The Board is accountable to the shareholders for the creation of long-term shareholder value and delivery of strong, sustainable 
operating and financial performance. In order to accomplish its objectives, the Board directs and monitors the Group’s affairs on an 
ongoing basis. It provides the Company with its overall strategic direction, ensures that the Company has the necessary financial 
and human resources in place, monitors performance of the Company and its management and adheres to strong corporate 
governance practices.

The Board is pleased with the high level of attendance and participation by both Executive and Non-Executive Directors at Board 
and committee meetings.
In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the Executive Directors maintain frequent verbal and written contact with the 
Non-Executive Directors to discuss various issues affecting the Company and its business. In addition, the Board executes a 
number of resolutions in writing to conduct Company business.
During the second half of 2009, the Non-Executive Chairman introduced a process whereby all of the Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman, meet without the Executive Directors present, generally at the end of every Board meeting. Matters arising 
out of such discussions are communicated to the Executive Directors as appropriate.
Information Flow
The Chairman establishes the agenda for each Board meeting. Business set out on Board agendas is discussed at each meeting 
with sufficient information provided to all the directors. Board meeting agendas and supporting information are circulated to each 
director prior to each meeting. Directors are provided sufficient information on the basis of which to discuss relevant matters in 
order to allow directors to be appropriately informed and able to make informed decisions.
At most Board meetings, the Board reviews future cash flows and historical financial information with respect to the business and 
affairs of the Company. In addition, the Directors are provided a status report on each of its exploration, development and production 
assets and a meaningful dialogue takes place. The Board receives reports of its various committees – Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination – and takes appropriate action. Matters requiring resolutions are voted upon and approved if appropriate. Matters 
reserved specifically for Board approval are discussed and evaluated prior to approval. Decisions requiring Board approval in between 
scheduled Board meetings are made by circulating supporting information and approved unanimously in writing by the Directors. Business

Independent Professional Advice
All of the Directors are aware that independent professional advice is available to each director in order to properly discharge his 
or her duties as a Director. In addition, each director and committee has access to the advice of the Company Secretary.
Matters Specifically Reserved by the Board
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for consideration by the Board. The matters reserved include management structure 
including appointments and remuneration, consideration of strategic policies and corporate direction, approval of annual and 
interim results, acquisitions and disposals, material contracts, major capital expenditure projects and budgets, approval of capital 
structure, debt and equity financing, dividends, and other matters. Subject to those reserved matters, the Board delegates 
authority for the management of the business primarily to the executive directors and certain other matters are delegated to the 
Board committees, namely the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Performance Evaluation
Hardy has a policy of appraising Board performance annually. Having reviewed various approaches to Board appraisal, Hardy has 
concluded that for a company of its current scale an internal process, in which all Board members submit answers to a 
questionnaire that considers the functionality of the Board and its committees, is most appropriate at this stage. This 
questionnaire also contains a series of questions to evaluate the performance of individual Board members and that of the 
Chairman. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is responsible for reporting on this matter to the Remuneration 
Committee and to the Board, including reviewing the performance of the Chairman, with the exception of reviewing her own 
performance (which is carried out by the Chairman). The process of completing the performance evaluation of the Board as a 
whole, its Chairman, and individual Executive and Non-Executive Directors, was completed in early 2011.
Each director’s position is subject to satisfactory performance of their responsibilities and is subject to reappointment by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors is pleased with the attendance of all directors at Board and 
committee meetings, despite significant travel and time requirements. The Board of Directors is also satisfied with the 
participation by all the directors in formulating corporate strategies and for their engagement in meaningful dialogue and 
discussions at Board and committee meetings.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There is a clear division of duties and responsibilities between the Non-Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the 
Company. The Chairman provides leadership to the Board and ensures its effectiveness of its role and setting the agenda. The 
Chairman is also responsible in ensuring that the Board is provided with accurate, timely, and clear information in relation to the 
Group and its business. He is in regular communication with each of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors on an ongoing 
basis. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the running of the organisation and the execution of the Company’s 
strategies, goals and objectives. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are exercised by different individuals.
Mr Paul Mortimer is the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company. In addition to Hardy, he is also a director of two oil and gas 
royalty funds, Gemini Oil & Gas Limited and Gemini Oil & Gas Management Limited.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board has determined that Mr Paul Mortimer (Chairman), Mr Pradip Shah, Dr Carol Bell and Mr Ian Bruce are independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers that independence is a matter of judgment and believes that the Non-Executive Directors should be free 
from any business or other relationships that could materially interfere in the exercise of their independent judgement. It is the 
Board’s policy to provide its Non-Executive Directors fair remuneration for the contribution they make with respect to the business 
and affairs of the Company and the responsibilities they undertake in performing their duties as Non-Executive Directors. Each of 
Messrs Mortimer and Shah was granted 260,333 options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company on the admission of 
Ordinary Shares of the Company on AIM in June 2005. Dr Bell was granted a similar award on her appointment as a Non-
Executive Director in December 2005. The Board has dispensed with the grant of stock options to the Non-Executive Directors 
since 2006. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to an award of restricted shares on an annual basis.
Each of Messrs Mortimer and Shah has served as a Non-Executive Director for a period of more than nine years. All of the 
Non-Executive Directors continue to provide invaluable services to the Board, its committees and to the Company.
The Board acknowledges that all Non-Executive Directors have shareholdings in the Company thus expressing their confidence in 
the Company and its future.
Notwithstanding Non-Executive Directors’ interest in Ordinary Shares or options of the Company, or their long standing service 
as directors of the Company, the Board considers that their independence is not prejudiced or compromised as a result of 
such positions.
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each of which has terms of reference (approved by 
the Board) setting out its authority and duties. The terms of reference for Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees can 
be found on the Company’s website.
The Board considered various issues that would normally fall within the terms of reference of the various committees. All members 
of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee are Non-Executive Directors. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 32
Corporate Governance Statement continued
Board Committees continued
The Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee meet as and when required, but at least once a year. The Audit 
Committee meets at least three times a year to review, among other things, financial reporting with respect to interim and annual 
results and for audit planning purposes. The Company’s auditors attend at least two of these meetings to discuss any audit related 
issues and to review formally with committee members reports issued to the Company by the auditors. The Audit Committee 
ensures that any non-audit services conform to the ethical standards for auditors issued by the Auditing Practices Board of the UK 
Financial Reporting Council.
Nomination Committee
The Company’s Nomination Committee comprised three Non-Executive Directors – Mr Paul Mortimer (Chairman), Mr Pradip Shah 
and Mr Sastry Karra. Effective 12 May 2010, the Committee was reconstituted with Ian Bruce (Chairman) and Pradip Shah as its 
membership. The Nomination Committee considers the structure, size and composition of the Board, retirements, replacements 
and appointments of additional directors, reviews succession plans for the directors and makes recommendations to the Board on 
membership of the Board, its committees and other matters within its remit.
There was one meeting of the Nomination Committee held during 2010 with 100 per cent attendance by the committee members. 
Any new appointments to the Board are considered by the Nomination Committee and made after Board approval. Following 
appointment, a new director is given a detailed presentation of the activities of the Company. If an appointment is made without 
using an external search agency or open advertisement, the entire Board selects a new director.
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises of three Non-Executive Directors, Mr Pradip Shah (Chairman), Mr Paul 
Mortimer, and Dr Carol Bell. Hardy’s Remuneration Committee operates within the terms of reference approved by the Board. 
There were four meetings of the Remuneration Committee held during 2010 with 100 per cent attendance.
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration policy, employment terms and remuneration of the executive directors and 
also reviews the remuneration of senior management. The Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and makes 
recommendations to the Board on the overall remuneration packages for executive directors in order to attract, retain and motivate 
high quality executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. The Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for the 
share option plans and other incentive plans, makes recommendations for the grant of awards under such plans as well as 
approving the terms of any performance related pay schemes.
None of the directors participate in any discussion or votes on any proposal relating to his or her own remuneration. The Board’s 
policy is to remunerate the Group’s senior executives fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and 
motivation of suitably qualified personnel. The Remuneration Committee, while considering remuneration packages of Hardy 
executives, has reviewed the policies of comparable groups in the industry. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the executive directors outside the framework of the Remuneration Committee.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Dr Carol Bell and its other members are Mr Pradip Shah and Mr Ian Bruce. All of the committee 
members are independent Non-Executive Directors. Dr Carol Bell, Mr Pradip Shah and Mr Ian Bruce have extensive corporate, 
financing and banking experience. The Board is satisfied that the Audit Committee has recent and relevant financial experience.

place to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. In addition, it oversees an effective system of risk 
management within the Company.
The Audit Committee also oversees the relationship with the external auditors, reviews the scope and results of audits and provides 
a forum for reporting by the Group’s auditors. The Company has a policy in place for the award of non-audit services provided by 
external auditors, which requires approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee ensures that the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors is safeguarded when securing non-audit services from the auditors. The Audit Committee also 
focuses on compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules and ensures that an effective system of internal control and risk management systems are maintained. The ultimate 
responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the half yearly reports remains with the Board. 
Some or all executive directors attend meetings of the Audit Committee by invitation.
Shareholder Relations
Communication with shareholders is given high priority and there is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well as general 
presentations made at the time of the release of the annual and interim results. All directors are kept aware of changes in major 
shareholders in the Company and are available to meet with shareholders who have specific interests or concerns. The Company 
issues its results promptly to individual shareholders and also publishes them on the Company’s website – www.hardyoil.com. 
Regular updates to record news in relation to the Company and the status of its exploration and development programmes are 
included on the Company’s website. Shareholders and other interested parties can subscribe to receive these news updates by 
email by registering on line on the website free of charge.
The Chairman and all executive directors are available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and gain an 
understanding of the Company’s business, its strategies and governance. At the 2010 Annual General Meeting of shareholders, all 
of the directors were present. Dr Carol Bell serves in the capacity as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director of the 
Company and is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of 
Chairman or executive directors.
Internal Controls
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls in line with the requirement of the 
Combined Code. The internal control system is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve its business objectives. This 
covers internal financial and operational controls, compliances and risk management. The Company has necessary procedures in 
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The directors acknowledge their 
responsibility for the Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board confirms the need for an 
ongoing process for identification, evaluation and management of significant risks faced by the Company. A risk assessment for 
each project is carried out by a team consisting of the executive directors and senior management before making any commitments. 
This team meets as and when required. Internal and external risks, including exploration and development risks, regulatory and 
compliance obligations under various production sharing contracts, economics including oil price, interest rate and currency 
exposure, as well as natural catastrophes are continuously assessed.
During 2010, the Audit Committee reviewed and reported to the Board the effectiveness of the system of internal control through 
detailed consideration of the financial control procedures in place. Given the size of the Company, the relative simplicity of the 
systems and the close involvement of senior management, the Board considers that there is no current requirement for an internal 
audit function. The procedures that have been established to provide internal financial control are considered appropriate for a 
company of its size and include controls over expenditure, regular reconciliations and management accounts. Most of the assets 
are owned jointly with others, budgets and expenditures are rigorously reviewed and approvals as well as project audits take place 
with respect to capital and operating expenditures on a regular basis.
The directors are responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably available to them to safeguard the assets of the Company 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future operations, financial position, and liquidity position 
are set out in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, Review of Operations, Financial Review, and the 
Risks and Uncertainties section of the Annual Report. In addition, note 26 to the consolidated financial statements discloses the 
Company’s financial risk management practices with respect to its capital structure, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, and other related matters.
The directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Company has adequate working capital to execute 
its operations and has the ability to access additional financing, if required, over the next 12 months. The directors, therefore, have 
made an informed judgement, at the time of approving financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, the directors have continued to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements in accordance with Going Concern and 
Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009.
Share Options
The executive directors believe that equity incentives are and will continue to be an important means of retaining, attracting and 
motivating directors, senior management and key employees. Accordingly, in June 2005, the Board adopted the share option 
scheme entitling the Company to award options to directors and employees. The Company’s share option scheme has been  Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 34
Corporate Governance Statement continued
considered and approved by the shareholders in 2006. Options are not granted at a discount to the market value. Under the 
scheme, options are exercisable between the first and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant. Options granted in June 2005 were 
subject to performance conditions whereby the share price of Hardy would need to rise by 20 per cent, 45 per cent and 70 per 
cent of the price at which the Hardy IPO was undertaken. In the first year of the performance period, one third of the options will 
become exercisable at or after 12 months following the date of grant. One third of the options will become exercisable at or after 
24 months following the date of grant. The remaining one third of the options will become exercisable at or after 36 months 
following the date of grant. All of such performance conditions have been met.
All options granted in 2010 and subsequent years, will generally vest between the third and fifth anniversary of the date of grant 
(the “Vesting Period”) subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition. The Performance Condition shall be satisfied where 
at any time during the Vesting Period, the volume weighted average market price of an Ordinary Share for any ten consecutive 
London Stock Exchange trading days is equal to or greater than the Ordinary Share price of the Company on the date of grant as 
increased by compounded growth of 5 per cent per annum in the share price as at the end of such ten day period. In the event that 
the Performance Condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. Options will vest 
immediately upon the occurrence of a Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme (relating to change of control etc).
No options were granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
Non Compliance with Combined Code
The Company did not comply with the Combined Code with the following matters during 2010.
Code Provision Subject Matter Discussion
A3.1 Non-Executive Directors meeting 
independence requirements
Paul Mortimer and Pradip Shah have served for more than nine years. 
As a result, under the Company’s policy, both directors are subject to 
annual re-election.
Paul Mortimer, Pradip Shah and Carol Bell were granted share options 
in 2005 when the Company’s Ordinary Shares were listed on AIM.
The Board has confirmed, notwithstanding the above, that all of the 
Non-Executive Directors are independent.
B1.3 Remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors should not include 
share options
Share options were granted in 2005 to Non-Executive Directors when 
the Company was listed on AIM and not subject to Combined Code.
The Company has changed its policies whereby no share options are 
granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
The Board believes that its composition is suitable having regard to its international stature with a focus on India. Notwithstanding 
the long tenure of some of the Directors, the Board believes all of the Non-Executive Directors are independent and provide 
valuable advice and counsel in furthering the business objectives of the Company.
Although Hardy is a publicly listed company and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities 
since February 2008, the Company continues to be an early stage exploration company with limited cash flows and a modest 
employee base of approximately 50 people. The Company has a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources to 
support its exciting exploration programme. As such, the Company strives to maintain a balance between conservation of limited 
resources and maintaining robust corporate governance practices. As the Company evolves the Board is committed to address 
specific Combined Code deficiencies and enhance the Company’s corporate governance policies and practices deemed 
appropriate for the size and maturity of the organisation.

Consideration by the Directors of Matters Relating to Directors’ Remuneration
The Company has a Remuneration Committee comprised of Mr Pradip Shah (Non-Executive Director) as Chairman, Mr Paul Mortimer 
(Non-Executive Chairman of the Company), and Dr Carol Bell (Senior Non-Executive Director).
The Remuneration Committee had engaged Simon Patterson of Patterson Associates as a Remuneration Consultant to assist the 
committee in setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors in the past. No remuneration advisors 
were retained by the Committee during 2010.
Statement of Hardy’s Policy on Directors’ Remuneration
The Company has established levels of remuneration that are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the 
quality required to run its business successfully. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is structured so as to 
link rewards to corporate and individual performance, align their interests with those of shareholders and to incentivise them to 
perform at the highest levels. The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration policy and the employment terms and 
remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and makes recommendations to 
the Board of Directors on the overall remuneration packages for Executive Directors in order to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives capable of achieving Hardy’s objectives.
The main goals of the Hardy’s remuneration policy are to reward past performance, incentivise future performance, encourage 
teamwork, retain Company talent and assure alignment with shareholders. These goals are achieved by maintaining appropriate 
base salaries, annual cash bonuses and providing a systematic annual grant of options. All incentive compensation levels are 
subject to recommendations of the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
Base salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis. No changes to base salaries have been made since 1 July 
2007 except for the Chief Executive Officer whose base salary was increased effective 1 April 2010. Although the Company has 
the policy of awarding cash bonuses, no such awards have been made to Executive Directors to date. In the future, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider recommending the total amount available for annual bonuses having regard to the cash 
requirement and overall performance of the Group. The size of the bonus will correspond to the salary of the Executive Director and 
each participant based upon performance targets, including corporate, team and individual performance measures. Any cash 
bonus shall be targeted at 20 per cent of base salary and shall not exceed 40 per cent of base salary. Each year, transparent 
objectives will be set for each participant.
The Company has adopted a policy of granting stock option awards on an annual basis although stock option awards cannot be 
made during close periods. None of the Directors participate in any discussion or votes on any proposal relating to his or her own 
remuneration. The policy of the Board of Directors is to remunerate Hardy’s executive directors fairly and in such a manner as to 
facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors outside the framework of the Remuneration Committee and approved by 
the Board of Directors.
The Directors (other than Ian Bruce) have been granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares of Hardy in the past. Executive 
directors were granted stock options during October 2010. No options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
All options granted in 2010 and subsequent years, will generally vest between the third and fifth anniversary of the date of grant 
(the “Vesting Period”) subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition. The Performance Condition shall be satisfied where 
at any time during the Vesting Period, the volume weighted average market price of an Ordinary Share for any ten consecutive 
London Stock Exchange trading days is equal to or greater than the ordinary share price of the Company on the date of grant as 
increased by compounded growth of 5 per cent per annum in the share price as at the end of such ten day period. In the event that 
the Performance Condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. Options will vest 
immediately upon the occurrence of a Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme (relating to change of control etc).
Previously, options were granted subject to vesting over a three-year period from date of grant. All of the options granted are at 
market prices based on the five-day average closing price prior to the date of grant.
Options will be forfeited if a Director resigns before the options vest. In other circumstances, the vesting of options will be at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee and Board approval. In the event of a change of control, all of the unvested options 
will vest.
Options granted following the initial public offering in June 2005 were subject to performance conditions based upon appreciation 
in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company. All of the performance conditions have been met. Subsequent options granted 
have been subject to vesting provisions over a three-year period, commencing from the anniversary of the date of grant. Options 
granted in 2010 are subject to vesting and performance conditions described above.
All of the service contracts with Directors are on an evergreen basis, subject to termination provisions. The Company may in lieu of 
notice terminate an executive’s employment with immediate effect by making a payment which does not exceed a lump sum equal 
to basic salary at the rate prevailing at the date of termination for a period which does not exceed 12 months; and a bonus to the 
extent earned and awarded by the Company at the date of termination in lieu of the notice period. As a matter of Company policy, 
no bonuses shall accrue as a result of lapse of time in the event of termination. With respect to Mr Dattani, in the event of a change 
of control, the Company may be entitled to terminate the executive’s employment on payment of 12 months’ salary together with all 
benefits and bonuses. The appointments of Executive Directors are subject to termination of 12 months or less by either party. The 
appointments of Non-Executive Directors are subject to termination upon at least three months’ notice. Company

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The main goals of the Company’s remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are to assure alignment with 
shareholders through independence, recognise time commitments devoted to corporate affairs and attract and retain 
outstanding candidates.
Effective 1 January 2009, restricted shares will be issued to the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director on an annual basis. 
The number of restricted shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual fee based on the market value of 
Hardy shares on the last trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain restricted for three years from the date of 
issue. The shares will become unrestricted and are delivered to the individual three years after the date of issue. The share award 
will be in addition to the annual cash fee. In the event of a close period, such shares will not be issued until after the close period is 
over. In the event of change of control of Hardy and the participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of the restricted shares 
will vest. In the event of death of a Director, all shares will become fully vested. Upon the Director not being re-elected at a general 
meeting of shareholders after offering himself for re-election as a Director at a general meeting, the shares will vest. In all other 
circumstances, shares that will remain restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a Director of Hardy. In addition, the 
Board has discretion to accelerate vesting on a date determined by it.
A one-time restricted share award may be made to a new Non-Executive Director on joining the Board. Such an award was made to 
Mr Ian Bruce upon his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 24 October 2008. Such shares are held in trust and will be 
released to Mr Bruce after three years from the date of issue (subject to earlier release in certain circumstances) provided he 
remains a Director of the Company provided for that period.
Ordinary Shares of the Company were listed on the AIM exchange from 10 June 2005, and on the Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange’s market for listed securities (‘Main Market’) from 20 February 2008. In the circumstances, and since the Company’s 
principal business is upstream oil and gas exploration, development and production, the Company has chosen to compare its 
performance with the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE 350 Oil and Producers Index.

No price was paid for any grant of options by the Directors to the Company. There were no variations made during the year in the 
terms and conditions with respect to any outstanding share options granted by the Company.
Upon resignation of Mr Karra as a Non-Executive Director, all of his options lapsed; however, the board used its discretion to permit 
the exercise of 780,700 options at £1.44 per share for a six month period (up to 31 May 2011) that are in the money. None of such 
options have been exercised as at the date of this report.
Options granted on 7 June 2005 are subject to performance criteria based upon appreciation in the market value of Ordinary 
Shares of the Company. All of such performance conditions have been met. All subsequent options granted to the end of 2009 are 
subject to vesting provisions whereby one third of the options granted vest on each of the three anniversaries from the date of 
grant. All options granted in 2010 and subsequent years, will generally vest between the third and fifth anniversary of the date of 
grant (the “Vesting Period”) subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition. The Performance Condition shall be satisfied 
where at any time during the Vesting Period, the volume weighted average market price of an Ordinary Share for any ten 
consecutive London Stock Exchange trading days is equal to or greater than the Ordinary Share price of the Company on the date 
of grant as increased by compounded growth of 5 per cent per annum in the share price as at the end of such ten day period. In 
the event that the Performance Condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. 
Options will vest immediately upon the occurrence of a Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme (relating to 
change of control etc).
No share options were exercised by any of the Directors of the Company during 2010.
On 31 December 2010, the market price of an Ordinary Share of Hardy was £2.15 per share. The highest and lowest market price 
of an Ordinary Share of Hardy during 2009 was £1.55 and £2.73 respectively.
Restricted Shares
As mentioned above, the Board of Directors has adopted a policy whereby restricted shares will be issued to the Chairman and 
each Non-Executive Director on an annual basis. The number of restricted shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of 
their annual cash fee based on the market value of Hardy shares on the last trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will 
remain restricted for three years. The share award will be in addition to the annual cash fee. In the event of change of control of 
Hardy and the participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of the restricted shares will vest. In the event of death of a 
Director, all shares will become fully vested. Upon the Director not being re-elected at a general meeting of shareholders after 
offering himself for re-election as a Director at a general meeting, the shares will vest. In all other circumstances, shares that are 
still restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a Director of Hardy. In the event of a close period, the restricted shares will, 
subject to Board approval, be issued after the close period is over. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 42

Financial 
Statements Governance
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Hardy Oil and Gas plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, the Consolidated 
and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 15 of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 1982. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  —
31 December 2010 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; —
 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European  —
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to  —
2004 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Emphasis of Matter – Request for extension of an Exploration Licence
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made 
in notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements concerning the process of arbitration with the Government of India for an extension of 
its exploration licence in block CY-OS/2. In the event that the Group is not successful in the arbitration, the exploration expenditure 
capitalised in respect of this block will be subject to impairment testing. No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of this 
capitalised expenditure.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 the parent company and the Group have not kept proper accounting records; —
 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; —
 if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or —
 if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. —
We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implication for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
inconsistencies within it. The information in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Review of 
Operations and Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern; —
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008  —
Combined Code specified for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board of Directors’ remuneration. —

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparation of consolidated financial statements of Hardy Oil and Gas plc 
(“Hardy” or the “Group”).
a) Basis of measurement
Hardy prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis except as otherwise stated.
b) Going concern
The Group has a history of profitable operations and has successfully raised financing in the past to provide funding for its ongoing 
exploration and development programmes and to augment its working capital. Having considered the guidance given in the 
document “Going concern and liquidity risk: Guidance for Directors” issued in October 2009 by the Financial Reporting Council 
and having regard to the Group’s existing working capital position and its ability to raise potential financing, if required, the 
Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to enable it to undertake its planned work programme of 
exploration, appraisal and development activities over the next twelve months.
c) Basis of preparation
Hardy prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (Revised 2009)
Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of rights issues
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
IFRIC 14 (Amendment) Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement
Improvement to IFRS issued May 2010
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instrument: Disclosures
Amendment to IAS12 Income Taxes
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future reporting periods will have a 
material impact on the Group’s results.
d) Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial information presented 
is rounded to the nearest US dollar.
e) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Hardy Oil and Gas plc and its subsidiary undertakings. The 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows include the results and cash flows 
of subsidiary undertakings up to the date of disposal.
The Group conducts the majority of its exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint arrangements with 
other companies.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the Group’s share of production revenues and costs attributable to its participating 
interests under the proportional consolidation method.
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue represents the sale value of the Group’s share of oil which excludes the profit oil sold and paid to the Government of India 
as part of profit sharing, tariff, and income from technical services to third parties if any. Revenues are recognised when crude oil 
has been lifted and title has been passed to the buyer or when services are rendered.
g) Oil and gas assets
i) Exploration and evaluation assets
Hardy follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas assets. Under this method, all expenditures incurred in 
connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 
“Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources” are accumulated and capitalised in a geographical cost pool, which is not 
larger than the Indian segment.
The capitalised exploration and evaluation costs are classified as Intangible assets – exploration which includes license acquisition, 
exploration and appraisal costs relating either to unevaluated properties or properties awaiting further evaluation but do not include 
costs incurred prior to having obtained legal right to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the statement of 
comprehensive income as they are incurred.
Intangible exploration and evaluation cost relating to each license or block remain capitalised pending a determination of whether 
or not commercial reserves exists. Commercial reserves are defined as proven and probable reserves on a net entitlement basis.
When a decision to develop these properties is taken or there is evidence of impairment, the costs are transferred to the cost pools 
within development/producing assets when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have been established. Company

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 49
ii) Oil and gas development and producing assets
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field by field basis. These comprise the cost of developing commercial 
reserves discovered to put them on production and the exploration and evaluation costs transferred from intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets, as stated in the policy above. In addition, interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings 
directly attributable to development projects, if any, and assets in the production phase, as well as cost of recognising provision for 
future restoration and decommissioning, are capitalised.
iii) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning facilities, plugging and abandoning 
wells. Future decommissioning costs are estimated and stated at an amount representing the costs which would be incurred 
should decommissioning occur at the year end date and the estimates are reassessed each year. The provision is assessed at 
prices ruling at the year end date and, accordingly, it is not appropriate to discount this provision. The decommissioning asset is 
included within the property, plant and equipment with the cost of the related assets installed and is adjusted for any revision to the 
decommissioning costs and the provision thereof. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on 
proved and probable reserves, is shown as “Decommissioning charge” in the statement of comprehensive income.
iv) Disposal of assets
Proceeds from any disposal of assets are credited against the specific capitalised costs included in the relevant cost pool and any 
loss or gain on disposal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Gain or loss arising on disposal of a subsidiary is 
also recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
h) Depletion and impairment
i) Depletion
The net book values of the producing assets are depreciated on a field by field basis using the unit of production method, based on 
proved and probable reserves taking into consideration future development expenditures necessary to bring the reserves into 
production. Hardy periodically obtains an independent third party assessment of reserves which is used as a basis for computing 
depletion.
ii) Impairment
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment, if any, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
might not be recoverable. In such circumstances, if the exploration asset has a corresponding development/producing cost pool, 
then the exploration costs are transferred to the cost pool and depleted on unit of production. In cases where no such 
development/producing cost pool exists, the impairment of exploration costs is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Impairment reviews on development/producing oil and gas assets for each field are carried out each year by comparing the 
net book value of the cost pool with the associated discounted future cash flows. If there is any impairment in a field representing a 
material component of the cost pool, an impairment test is carried out for the cost pool as a whole. If the net book value of the cost 
pool is higher, the excess amount is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as impairment.
i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful 
economic lives as follows:
Annual
Rate (%)
Depreciation
Method
Leasehold improvements over lease period Straight-line
Furniture and fixtures 20 Straight-line
Information technology and computers 33 Straight-line
Other equipment 20 Straight-line
j) Intangible assets
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives 
as follows:
Annual
Rate (%)
Depreciation
Method
Computer software 33 Straight-line
k) Investments
Investments by the parent company in its subsidiaries are stated at cost.
l) Short term investments
Short term investments are regarded as “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” and are carried at fair value. In practice, 
the nature of these investments is such that the fair value equates to the value of initial outlay and therefore in normal circumstances 
no fair value gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 50
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2010
1. Accounting Policies continued
m) Inventory
Inventory of crude oil is valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. Average cost is determined based on actual 
production cost for the year. Inventories of drilling stores are recorded at cost including taxes duties and freight. Provision is made 
for obsolete or defective items where appropriate based on technical evaluation.
n) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the Group’s statement of financial position based on the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value as reduced by necessary 
provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value.
o) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Hardy and the Group are recorded at net proceeds after direct issue costs.
p) Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit of the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income as it excludes certain items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in years other than the 
current year, and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or subsequently enacted by the year end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investment in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is possible that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the year end date, where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive 
more tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods 
in which temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
q) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the year end date, 
all foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities are restated at the closing rate. Exchange difference arising out of 
actual payments/realisations and from the year end restatement are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income.
Rates of exchanges are as follows:
31 December
2010
31 December
2009
£ to US$ 1.5544 1.6154
US$ to Indian Rupees 44.92 46.67
r) Leasing commitments
Rental charges or charter hire charges payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as 
part of production cost over the lease term.
s) Share based payments
Hardy issues share options to Directors and employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the 
equity settled options determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period. In performing the 
valuation of these options, only conditions other than the market conditions are taken into account. Fair value is derived by use of 
the binomial model. The expected life used in the model is based on management estimates and considers non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Company

Review Overview
Hardy Oil and Gas plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2010 51
2.  Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
(i) Intangible assets – exploration
The Group holds a 75 percent participating interest in the block CY-OS/2 off the east coast of India. Intangible assets include an 
amount of US$83,530,141 with respect to exploration expenditures on the block wherein where a gas discovery was announced 
on 8 January 2007. The exploration period for the block ended on 23 March 2007. The Government of India (“GOI”) has been 
requested to extend the block for appraisal and declaration of commerciality for its gas discovery until 7 January 2012. This request 
was declined. Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) provides for a period of 60 months from the date of discovery for declaration 
of commerciality in case of a discovery being Non–Associated Natural Gas (“NANG”). This period will be limited to 24 months for 
an oil discovery.
The Group has obtained third party legal and technical opinions that support the Group’s view that the discovery is NANG and has 
referred the dispute to arbitration for adjudication. The Group believes that it will be successful in obtaining the extension of its 
licence in block CY-OS/2 in the arbitration. Therefore, the intangible assets arising from expenditure on this block continue to be 
recognised in full and the directors do not believe that any impairment of these costs has arisen.
The arbitration process is continuing as at the date of approval of these financial statements.
(ii) Decommissioning
The liability for decommissioning is based on estimates of the costs of decommissioning that will arise in the future. Significant 
changes in costs as a result of technical advancements and other factors can result in a material change to this provision. A 5% 
change in the liability for decommissioning will impact the decommissioning charge by US$17,330. A 5% change in proven and 
probable reserves will impact the decommissioning charge by US$8,665.
(iii) Depletion
Depletion is based on best estimates of commercial reserves existing as at the year end date. The determination of commercial 
reserves is based on assumptions which include those relating to the future prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital expenditure 
plans, cost of production and other factors. A 5% change in proven and probable reserves will impact the depletion charge by 
US$124,776. A 5% change in future development costs will impact the depletion charge by US$109,178.
3. Segment analysis
The Group is organised into two business units as at end of the year: India and United Kingdom. The India business unit is 
operated by the wholly owned subsidiary, Hardy Exploration & Production (India) Inc. In addition, Hardy Oil and Gas plc operates in 
the United Kingdom. A Nigeria business unit was operated by Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited, which was sold on 27 October 2010 with 
an effective date of 30 September 2010.
The India business unit focuses on exploration and production of oil and gas assets in India. The United Kingdom business unit is 
the holding company. Management monitors these business units separately for resource allocation, decision making and 
performance assessment. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 52

Indian operations of the Group are subject to a tax rate of 42.23 percent which is higher than UK and US corporations tax rates. To 
the extent that the Indian profits are taxable in the US and/or the UK, those territories should provide relief for Indian taxes paid, 
principally under the provisions of double taxation agreements. Based on the current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that 
the tax allowances will continue to exceed the depletion charge of each year, though the timing of related tax relief is uncertain. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 56

Provisions of the PSC provide for an appraisal period of 60 months from the date of discovery. For an oil discovery, this period is 
limited to 24 months. The Company has obtained third party legal and technical opinions that support the Company’s view that the 
discovery is NANG. Accordingly, the dispute has been referred to arbitration for adjudication. The arbitration process is continuing 
at the date of approval of these financial statements.
In the event that Hardy’s application for an extension of the CY-OS/2 licence was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised expenditure 
will be subject to impairment testing.
Hardy Oil (Africa) Limited was sold on 27 October 2010 with an effective date of 30 September 2010. Therefore the exploration 
expenditure relating to the Nigeria cost pool is deleted.

26. Financial risk management
Hardy finances its operations through a mixture of equity and retained earnings. Finance requirements are reviewed by the Board 
when funds are required for acquisition, exploration and development of projects.
Hardy’s policy is to maintain a strong financial position to sustain future development of the business. There were no changes to the 
Group’s capital management approach during the year.
Hardy treasury functions are responsible for managing fund requirements and investments which includes banking and cash flow 
management. Interest and foreign exchange exposure are key functions of treasury management to ensure adequate liquidity at all 
times to meet cash requirements.
Hardy’s principal financial instruments are cash, deposits and short term investments and these instruments are for the purpose of 
meeting its requirements for operations.
Hardy’s main risks arising from financial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk and credit risks. 
Set out below are policies that are used to manage such risks:
Foreign currency risk
The Group reports in US dollars and the majority of its business is conducted in US dollars. All revenues from oil sales are received 
in US dollars and all costs except a portion towards expenses for overhead are incurred in US dollars. For currency exposure other 
than US dollars, a portion of the cash is kept on deposit in other currencies to meet its payments as required. No forward exchange 
contracts were entered into during the year.
Liquidity risk
The Group currently has surplus cash, which has been placed in deposits and short term investments which can be converted into 
cash at short notice, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the Group’s expenditure requirements. Hardy has no outstanding loan 
obligations at year end dates.
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed in deposits and short term investments at fixed or floating rates. Hardy’s policy is to place deposits only 
with well established banks or financial institutions that offer competitive interest rates and ensure security of capital at the time of 
issue.
Commodity price risks
The Group’s share of production of crude oil from PY-3 field is sold to the Government of India’s nominee Chennai Petroleum 
Corporation Limited. The sale price is arrived at based on an average price for the 30 day period commencing 15 days before and 
ending 15 days after the delivery of crude oil. No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into by the Group.
Credit risk
All Hardy’s sales are to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited, a state oil company in India. As it is the Government of India 
nominee for the purchase of crude oil, the credit risk is negligible.
Deposits and other money market instruments, as a general rule, are placed with banks and financial institutions that have ratings of 
not less than AA or equivalent, which are verified before placing the deposits. Cash surpluses are also invested in short-term 
investments in certain liquid funds. These funds are primarily invested in term deposits and graded commercial papers of not less 
than AA or equivalent.
The Board will continue to assess the strategies for managing credit risk and is satisfied with the existing policies for sale of crude 
oil to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited. At year end, the Group did not have any bad debt risk. The maximum financial risk 
exposure relating to the financial assets is the carrying value of such financed assets as on the year end date. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 / Hardy Oil and Gas plc 60

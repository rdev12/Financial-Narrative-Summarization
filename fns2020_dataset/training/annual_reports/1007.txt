The vision
To create a leading 
international diversified 
royalty company with  
a focus on base metals 
and bulk materials.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (‘Anglo Pacific‘, the ‘Company’ or  
the ‘Group’) is the only listed company on the London Stock 
Exchange focused on royalties connected with the mining of 
natural resources. Our strategy is to build a diversified portfolio 
of royalties, focusing on accelerating income growth through 
acquiring royalties in cash or near-term cash producing assets.
It is an objective of the Company to pay a substantial portion  
of these royalties to shareholders as dividends.

The opportunity
T o lead the industry  
in developing royalty 
financing for base 
metals and bulk 
materials companies.
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 02 APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | FRONT proof 13
Past 
Historically, royalties have originated as a result  
of the sale of a mineral property, allowing the  
seller to retain some ongoing profit participation  
in the property.
Present
An increasing number of royalties are now  
created directly by operators and developers  
as a source of finance.
Falling commodity prices, operating cost inflation,  
poor capital allocation (in particular M&A at the top of 
the cycle and unproductive exploration spending) in 
conjunction with slowing growth in China have led to  
a de-rating of mining equities. Raising capital through 
conventional sources has therefore become increasingly 
difficult. Consequently, demand has increased for 
alternative forms of financing.
Future
Anglo Pacific is well positioned to grow its  
business in the underserved base metals and  
bulk materials sector.
Alternative financing has been more prevalent in  
the precious metals sector. With a focus on base 
metals and bulk materials, and a solid existing asset 
base, Anglo Pacific intends to lead the development  
of this market and continue to support operators in 
bringing their projects into development.

GROUP OVERVIEW 
Chairman’s statement
Despite the current challenges facing the global mining industry, Anglo Pacific 
continued its underlying profitability during the period. We have maintained our total 
dividend for the year, despite the headline loss reported, as we view the potential 
outlook for the business as being one where we expect to see future growth. 
We are pleased to welcome Julian Treger and Mark Potter as the Company’s new Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Investment Officer respectively. Julian and Mark joined late in 2013 from Audley 
Capital Advisors LLP, an investment advisory firm managing value-orientated, special situations 
investment strategies through hedge fund and co-investment vehicles. Both have a strong track record  
of investing in the mining sector and a level of financial expertise that we believe will be of considerable 
benefit to Anglo Pacific’s current portfolio of royalty investments and also to future acquisitions.  
In particular, they bring with them new avenues for acquiring and creating royalties and opportunities 
for a wider spectrum of new investors in the Company. Julian and Mark invested £2.5m in new Anglo 
Pacific shares and the expectation is for them to increase their shareholding as the Company grows. 
We believe that there is increasing demand for alternative financing in the base metals and bulk 
materials sector. This should provide many opportunities to acquire value-accretive royalties, increasing 
and diversifying the Group’s revenue sources.
Our ambitions to expand are underpinned by our cornerstone asset, the Kestrel royalty. The completion 
of Rio Tinto’s US$2bn capex program on its new Kestrel South mine underlines its commitment to  
the Kestrel operations. Rio Tinto’s production update for Q4 2013 reflects substantial increases across 
both its coking coal and thermal coal operations and further strengthens our conviction in Kestrel’s 
ability to meaningfully contribute to EBITDA growth for the Group in the medium-term.
Our adjusted profit (refer to page 30) of £9.1m (2012: £9.4m (restated)), which excludes non-cash 
impairment and valuation items and their associated tax impact, demonstrates that the underlying 
business of the Group remains profitable. The Group’s strategic equity investments, currently 
representing 7.7% of its assets, amount to £20.1m as at December 31, 2013. Despite difficulties in  
the junior mining markets during the year, the Group realised £5.3m in cash from the sale of equities 
where a royalty was no longer considered achievable. The Group plans to retain a select group of 
strategic equity investments, which is hoped will enable future royalty discussions.
In November 2013, the Group was pleased to announce the signing of a co-investment agreement  
with FlowStream Commodities Ltd (‘FlowStream’), an oil & gas streaming and royalty company.  
Anglo Pacific was also a founding shareholder in this venture. The agreement entitles the Group to 
participation in FlowStream’s first five investments.

of Rio Tinto US$2bn capex program 
Impairment has been widespread across the international mining industry amidst falling commodity 
prices and continued tightening in the capital markets. We believe that Anglo Pacific is well placed to 
endure these challenges and the underlying business of the Group has remained profitable. We have  
not escaped our own impairments, particularly in our strategic equity investments, most of which  
are junior mining equities. However, as these are carried at market value at each reporting date, this  
has had little impact on the balance sheet. There have also been impairment charges in relation to  
some of the Group’s long dated royalties where macro-economic conditions may delay the eventual 
production expected from them.
The Company is pleased to recommend a final dividend for 2013 of 5.75p per share, maintaining a total 
dividend of 10.2p per share, equalling the level paid out to shareholders for the year ended December 
31, 2012. This reflects our confidence in future production from Kestrel and our other producing royalties 
as well as our ability to acquire additional cash-producing royalties in the near-term.
Board
It was with great sadness that on January 7, 2014 Peter Boycott passed away. Peter had served as 
Chairman of the Board of the Company since 1997. He stepped down as Chairman in August 2012  
for health reasons but was still able to participate actively at Board meetings and to chair the Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) in May 2013. With his tireless energy and business skills, Peter made an 
enormous contribution to the Company’s recovery and growth over the past decade, transforming it  
into the successful mining royalty company it is today. As I took on the role of Acting Chairman due to 
Peter’s ill health, I will be stepping down from this intermediary position and will not be offering myself 
for re-election at the next AGM. I will be handing over to Mike Blyth, who will succeed me as Non-
Executive Chairman with effect from April 1, 2014. John Whellock and Michael Atkinson will also be 
stepping down from the Board at the next AGM. I would like to thank both John and Michael for their 
contribution to the Company over the years and have every confidence in Mike, and the rest of the  
team, in leading Anglo Pacific through a new period of growth.
Finally, I am pleased to welcome Robert Stan onto the Board. Robert is a Canadian national with a 
prominent background in the mining industry, most recently serving as CEO for Grande Cache Coal 
Corporation until the company was sold in 2012 for US$1bn. His extensive knowledge and experience  
in the mining industry makes him a strong addition and his particular focus on the coal sector should 
provide valuable insights to the Group’s bulk materials royalties. His considerable network of contacts 
within the Canadian investment community will also prove beneficial as the Company seeks to  
expand its North American investor base.
Renewed focus on near-term,  
cash-producing royalties

GROUP OVERVIEW APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | FRONT proof 13
Outlook
The Group enters 2014 with cautious optimism. The mining majors appear to be focused on increasing 
returns to their shareholders, which they are trying to achieve through renewed focus on the efficiency  
of their existing operations. Cutbacks have been announced for many new projects, which over  
the medium and long-term should positively affect the supply/demand balance across commodities.
In the meantime, opportunities continue to arise for alternative financing in the base metals and bulk 
materials sector. The Group is currently assessing a number of suitable opportunities and we look 
forward to updating shareholders as and when these materialise. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their considerable energy and unstinting 
dedication to the running of our Company throughout the year. 
On behalf of the Board

STRATEGIC REPORT 
Chief Executive Officer’s 
statement
I am pleased to be joining Anglo Pacific at an important stage in the Company’s 
development. We believe we are well positioned to lead the Company into  
its next phase of growth.
I was encouraged by our maiden set of results for 2013. The Company was able to maintain a steady 
royalty income, at £14.7m for 2013 only slightly down from £15.2m for 2012, despite continued 
difficulties in the mining sector. The Company’s ability to withstand the current macro-economic 
backdrop is further reflected in a resilient adjusted earnings after tax number (refer to page 30), which  
has in turn encouraged us to maintain our total dividend at 10.2p.
Since my appointment in October 2013, the team has been hard at work on a number of fronts.  
Our primary focus has been on sourcing viable royalty transactions and I am pleased to say that our 
pipeline continues to grow. Our current focus is on diversifying our existing asset portfolio and securing 
near-term, cash-producing royalties in base metals and bulk materials projects, providing the Company 
with a clearly differentiated strategy from its North American listed precious metals peer group. 
Furthermore, we have sought to provide a fair and balanced picture of the Group’s assets in these 
accounts and believe our results reflect this. Updates during the year in relation to some of our royalties 
resulted in impairment charges as there is some uncertainty as to if and when these royalties will  
come into production. We believe these impairment charges are accurate in the context of long-term 
commodity prices and the challenges facing those operations. We believe we now have a robust 
balance sheet and this should serve as a good base for future growth.
In February 2014, we also took on a new US$15m twelve-month unsecured revolving credit facility. 
Together with our net cash position, this gives availability of between US$35m and US$40m and 
provides additional funding flexibility for the next 12 months.
We were also pleased to welcome BMO Capital Markets (‘BMO’) to work alongside Liberum Capital  
as Joint Corporate Broker in January 2014. BMO will play an increasingly important role as we look to 
grow the Company and increase our profile internationally. Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to 
thank Brian Wides for his contribution to the Company as Acting Chairman over the past 15 months and 
in particular for his wise, thoughtful leadership and guidance since my appointment in October 2013.
We look forward to 2014 and are confident of the opportunity to provide our shareholders with growth and 
income from our dividend, through the existing assets in our portfolio and the acquisition of new royalties. 
The following section of our Annual Report, up to and including page 34 is our strategic report for  
the year ended December 31, 2013 and outlines amongst other things, our business model and new 
strategic objectives along with an overview of the market and how we performed in the period.

STRATEGIC REPORT APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | FRONT proof 13
STRATEGIC REPORT 
Market overview
Increased capital constraint amongst base metals and bulk materials producers...
Over the past few years, the mining industry has faced increased funding challenges. Some of the 
world’s biggest projects have suffered from high cost inflation and budget overruns. M&A activity at  
the peak of the last economic cycle also resulted in a substantial increase in leverage across global 
miners, which in a falling commodity price environment has resulted in substantial declines in earnings 
and reduced balance sheet flexibility. For instance, the net debt to EBITDA multiple for the Bloomberg  
World Mining Index increased from 0.8x in 2010 to 1.4x in 2013. This has impacted on share prices.  
As the most capital intensive sector within the mining industry, base metals and bulk materials 
producers have been under additional pressure. 
Falling commodity prices have put junior miners under increasing financial strain with limited access  
to capital. This is further compounded by the typically higher cost operations of junior miners versus  
the mining majors.
...who are left with limited financing 
Traditional funding routes remain limited
During the course of 2013, the sell-off in the mining sector impacted on the mining equity markets. 
Global mining equity issuance in 2013 amounted to US$16.4bn, 17% and 59% down from 2012  
and 2011 respectively. 
Lending to the global mining industry has also been impacted. For example, there has been a notable 
decrease in high yield debt issuance to the mining industry over the past two years, down 41% from 
US$14.6bn in 2011 to US$8.6bn as of the end of 2013.

Royalty financiers are focused almost exclusively on precious metals producers
The financing provided by the royalty and streaming industry has grown considerably in recent years, 
with upfront payments totalling more than US$2bn in each of 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, the 
industry’s historical focus on precious metals is disproportionately channelling investment into only a 
small part of the mining industry. The aggregate market cap of the top listed precious metals royalty 
companies in 2013 was approximately US$20bn, yet gold and silver producers made up approximately 
11% of global mining production by value. By contrast, the largest non-precious metals royalty company, 
Labrador Iron Ore, had a market cap of just under C$2bn. Anglo Pacific intends to provide royalties  
and streams to the rest of the mining sector.

Specialise 
Focus on base metals and bulk materials, typically linked to GDP 
growth. The supply side economics of metals such as copper and  
zinc make it an attractive investment proposal. Infrastructure-led 
GDP growth in developed economies combined with urbanisation  
in developing countries should ensure continued demand for  
bulk materials.
Accelerate 
Acquire royalties on producing or near-term producing mines with 
operators who have a strong track record. In order to manage its risk 
profile, the Group will focus mainly on mines in established mining 
jurisdictions, primarily North America, South America, Europe and 
Australia. The current portfolio will be enhanced by the acquisition 
of existing royalties or the negotiation of new agreements.  
Royalties will be preferred which can demonstrate the potential  
to generate additional income from (amongst other things): 
• 
Increased realised commodity prices
• 
Increased production volumes
• 
Increased reserves and resources and subsequent mine  
 life extensions
Diversify 
Rebalance the commodity spread and stage of production of the 
Group’s royalty assets, recognising that Kestrel, our cornerstone 
producing asset, currently accounts for c. 67% of revenues, which  
in turn has meant an overweight position in coal. Our target portfolio 
would see increased exposure to iron ore, copper and zinc, in line 
with our strategic objective to specialise in the non-precious metals 
sector. Opportunistic investment in non-core commodities such as 
oil & gas, uranium, diamonds and precious metals may be pursued. 
The Group will also be reviewing existing non-core royalty assets 
and mining and exploration interests which no longer fit with  
the new strategy.

STRATEGIC REPORT APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | FRONT proof 13
STRATEGIC REPORT
Our business model
The Group is seeking to grow its portfolio of cash-generative 
royalties and streams by investing in producing or near-term 
producing assets with long mine lives. Given the relatively low 
overhead requirements of the business, the Group believes cash 
flow to shareholders can be maximised through economies of 
scale, which would allow for growth in the portfolio without 
significantly increasing our cost base.
Revenue-based royalties limit the Group’s direct exposure to 
operating or capital cost inflation of the underlying mine operations, 
as there is no ongoing requirement for the Group to contribute  
to capital, exploration, environmental or other operating costs at 
mine sites. 
The Group is seeking to build a diversified portfolio of royalties 
across a various commodities and geographic locations.  
Investing in royalties across a wide spectrum of commodities and 
jurisdictions reduces the dependency on any one asset or location 
and any corresponding cyclicality. A fully diversified portfolio can 
help to reduce the level of income volatility, stabilising cash flows 
which contribute towards investment and dividend payments.
Royalty holders generally benefit from improvements made to  
the scale of a mining operation. Exploration success, or lower 
cut-off grades as a result of rising commodity prices, can serve to 
increase economic reserves and resources. Increased reserves  
will extend a mine’s life, or facilitate an expansion of the existing 
operations. Any subsequent increases in production will generally 
result in higher royalty payments, without the requirement of the 
royalty holder to contribute to the cost of expanding or optimising 
the operation. 
Royalties provide exposure to underlying commodity prices.  
The Group expects to benefit from a rising commodity price 
environment, with the upside feeding through to increased  
royalty receipts.

Royalties reduce the upfront capital required to fund the 
development of a project. These are generally structured as asset 
(or even bi-product) specific, often leaving the remaining assets  
of the developer unencumbered for raising additional finance.  
The creation of a new royalty can create positive news flow  
for the developer and provides some validation of the economic 
viability of a project. Together, these can help developers in 
securing additional funds from more traditional sources.
Compared to the issuance of new equity, royalties do not depend 
on the prevailing state of the capital markets but are rather the 
result of bilateral negotiations. The issuance of new equity can also 
serve to dilute existing shareholders, particularly during periods of 
depressed share prices. Furthermore, as royalties are asset 
specific, the reduction in the upside for existing shareholders can 
be limited to a certain mine or product. This is particularly relevant 
for companies with more than one asset for which the issue of  
new shares gives away upside over all assets or future assets  
in the company. Finally, there are costs associated with issuing 
equity, which can be direct in the form of underwriting fees or 
indirect via the pricing of an issue at a discount to market. 
Royalties represent an alternative form of raising finance. 
Royalties do not typically levy interest, nor do they typically require 
principal repayments or have a maturity date. More importantly, 
unlike conventional debt arrangements where interest payments 
tend to start immediately or are capitalised until cash payments  
can be made from a project’s cash flow, most royalties are 
repayable when a project comes into production and is generating 
sales. In addition, many forms of debt such as project finance, 
include restrictive covenants and may require commodity price 
hedges to be put in place. These are not only typically costly in 
terms of fees, but can also limit the miner’s exposure to upside  
in the prices of their core commodities. Finally, debt financing 
agreements can also be slower to implement, typically requiring 
more intrusive due diligence and increased documentation.

Key performance indicators
Adjusted earnings  
per share
(p)
Adjusted earnings per share 
reflects the profit which 
management is capable of 
influencing. It disregards any 
valuation movements caused by 
short-term commodity price 
fluctuations along with any 
non-cash impairment charges. 
It also adjusts for any profits or 
losses which are realised from the 
sale of equity instruments within 
the mining and exploration 
interests as these are determined 
based on market forces outside 
the control of the Directors.  
(see note 12 for further details) 
Dividend cover 
(x)
It is a policy of the Group to pay  
a significant portion of its royalty 
income as dividends. Just as 
important to maintaining the 
dividend is maintaining the quality 
of the dividend. Dividend cover is 
calculated as the number of times 
adjusted earnings per share 
exceeds the dividend per share.
Royalty assets acquired
(£m)
The Group’s strategy is to acquire 
cash or near-cash producing 
royalties which will be accretive 
and in turn enable dividend 
growth. The above chart shows 
how much the Group invested in 
royalty acquisitions in each period.

The Group’s strategy is to diversify more broadly within the base 
metals and bulk materials sector, increasing exposure to copper, 
zinc and other metals not directly linked to steel production,  
in line with our objective of specialising in the non-precious  
metals sector. 
The Group’s current strategy is to accelerate the process of 
acquiring cash-generative royalties to reduce the current reliance  
on Kestrel, our principal cash-generative royalty.
Management is looking to improve relationships with the operators 
of the Group’s existing royalties and to try to obtain better 
information rights for both existing and new royalties. 
A renewed focus on acquiring income generating royalties along 
with liquidity in its mining and exploration interests should allow  
the Group to seek to maintain and grow its dividend. In addition,  
the Company has considerable accumulated distributable reserves. 
The Group understands the importance of and is committed to 
attracting, retaining and incentivising key executives. For more 
information on the Group’s remuneration policies, please refer to 
the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 44 to 51.
The Group has an experienced management team with an extensive 
network of contacts and a strong track record of investing in the 
mining industry. The new management team bring with them 
alternative avenues in exploring for and creating new royalty 
opportunities. The Group believes it can lead the development  
of royalty financing in the base metals and bulk materials sector, 
given the predominant focus of its peers on precious metals.
The Group is cash generative and has liquidity in its mining and 
exploration portfolio. In addition, the potential to access capital 
markets and the entering into by the Group of a twelve-month 
unsecured revolving credit facility provide additional resources  
to acquire new royalties.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Principal risks and uncertainties
Whilst limiting a number of the risks associated with traditional mining and 
commodity investments, royalties remain exposed to a number of risk factors.  
An optimised selection of royalty investments within a balanced portfolio  
should nevertheless help to mitigate these. 
Anglo Pacific also undertakes measures to seek to further mitigate the key  
risks related to its strategy:
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 17
STRATEGIC REPORT APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | FRONT proof 13
The Directors have significant experience of investing in the mining 
industry and have considerable expertise in assessing the forward 
demand for commodities. The Group uses consensus or lower 
forecasts when valuing all royalty investments, which reduces the 
risk of underperformance and a site visit is undertaken to assess 
the viability of the underlying project.
The Group has limited control over the operation of the mine it  
has invested in. The Group conducts detailed due diligence on  
all investments, which will often include a site visit by suitably 
qualified personnel that will highlight any economic, operational  
or environmental concerns. Further, newly created royalties can  
be tailored to allow for performance milestones to try to ensure  
that the operator performs as intended.
Newly created royalties can be tailored to allow for performance 
milestones to try to ensure that the operator performs as intended.
The Group seeks to invest in countries with well established legal 
jurisdictions which will provide a means of recourse for breach  
of contract. In addition, the Group will seek to register its royalty 
interest where possible to try to ensure the royalty survives both 
bankruptcy and change of control. 
(i) The Group seeks to focus its investments on those countries 
with established legal jurisdictions, low geopolitical risk and an 
established mining industry. Having a diversified portfolio has 
allowed the Group to de-risk small investments in operations in 
developing countries.
(ii) The Group does not operate the mines which it invests in and 
bears no liability for any adverse event or disaster at site level. 
(iii) As part of the due diligence process the Group considers 
applicable withholding taxes and any existing state royalties.  
A material alteration of a tax regime could impact the economic 
viability of a project, and ultimately royalty income. As the royalty 
rate for the Kestrel royalty is set by the state, a change in the tax 
regime could have a direct effect on royalty income. The Group’s 
assets are generally located in developed economies which 
encourage mining activity through a fair and consistent tax system.

The Group’s strategy is to diversify away from its dependence on 
coking coal through acquiring royalties in the base metals and bulk 
materials sector. The Group uses consensus or lower forecasts 
when valuing all royalty investments which reduce the risk of 
overpayment. A fall in commodity price is mitigated by virtue of the 
relatively low fixed cost base of the Group as it is not an operator 
nor has it any hedging contracts to fulfil.
The Group seeks to ensure that it can meet all of its obligations  
as they fall due by preparing regular cash flow projections, 
highlighting any currency requirements well in advance of 
settlement. The Group has a strong balance sheet, an undrawn 
US$15m twelve-month revolving credit facility and potential  
access to the capital markets to provide additional funding to  
meet its obligations as well as its investment objectives. 
The Group operates controlled treasury policies which spreads  
the concentration of the Group’s cash balances amongst separate 
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Group’s credit  
risk on monies advanced to explorers and operators is taken into 
account when assessing the fair value of these assets at each 
reporting date. For receivables, the Group presents these on  
the balance sheet net of any amount for doubtful debt. As these 
primarily relate to the Kestrel royalty, the credit risk is minimal  
due to the world class nature of the operator. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises from different 
currencies associated with income (mainly Australian dollars), 
expenditure including dividend (mainly in pounds sterling)  
and investment (usually in US dollars). As there are so few 
transactions, the risk is managed by the Board using detailed  
cash flow projections prepared regularly. At present the Board  
has determined that a hedging policy is unnecessary.
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, and its 
twelve-month revolving credit facility is unhedged. 
The value of the Group’s royalties is underpinned by commodity 
prices which may affect the future expected cash flows.  
This is taken into account at each reporting date in assessing for 
impairment. The Group has a portfolio of junior mining equity 
investments which fluctuate in value based on the active quoted 
share price. The reduction in value of the portfolio over the last few 
years has resulted in a full impairment of unrealised losses such  
that any further pricing risk should be much less material to the Group.

Significant developments across our principal royalties during 2013
Producing royalties 
Kestrel, Coking coal, Australia
What we own
Kestrel is an underground coal mine located in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia. It is operated  
by Rio Tinto Limited (‘Rio Tinto’). The Group owns 50% of certain sub-stratum lands which, under 
Queensland law, entitle it to coal royalty receipts from the Kestrel mine.
The royalty rate to which the Group is presently entitled is prescribed by the Queensland Mineral 
Resources Regulations. These regulations currently stipulate that the basis of calculation is a three-tiered 
fixed percentage of the invoiced value of the coal as follows: 7% of value up to and including A$100, 
12.5% of the value over A$100 and up to and including A$150, and 15% thereafter.
Performance
Rio Tinto successfully completed the transition into its new Kestrel South mine in H2 2013 and provided  
a strong Q4 2013 production update. More specifically, a steady ramp up in Kestrel hard coking coal 
production during 2013 was reported by Rio Tinto in its fourth quarter operations review 2013, released  
on January 16, 2014, from 402kt in Q1 to 908kt in Q4, an increase of 126%.
Coking coal royalty receipts for Anglo Pacific amounted to A$16.1m (2012: A$16.7m) translating into 
£9.9m compared to £10.9m reported in 2012. The decrease in income is due to both the weakening of 
the Australian dollar throughout 2013 and production disruptions associated with the extension to the 
new Kestrel South mine. With the transition to the new Kestrel South mine now completed, it is 
anticipated that production at Kestrel should become less volatile, which will benefit the Group as  
and when production moves fully within its private royalty land.

Valuation
The Kestrel royalty accounts for 51% of the Group’s total assets. The value of the land is calculated by 
reference to the discounted expected royalty income from mining activity. This is an independent valuation 
conducted by suitably qualified consultants. A discount rate of 7% is applied. The Group monitors the 
accuracy of this valuation by comparing the actual cash received to that forecasted.
The decline in coking coal prices in addition to the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate over the  
last two years has impacted on the valuation of expected future cash receipts and, therefore, valuation. 
Amapá and Tucano, Iron ore, Brazil 
What we own
Amapá
The Group has a 1% life of mine GRR on all iron ore and other non-precious minerals produced from  
the Amapá Iron Ore System (‘Amapá’) in northern Brazil. Amapá consists of the mine in Pedra Branca  
do Amapári and the port in Santana, which are linked by a railway. Amapá’s recorded revenue in  
2012 was US$327m and US$481m in 2011, based upon production volumes of 6.1Mt and 4.8Mt, 
respectively. The mine produces a mix of sinter feed, pellet feed and spiral concentrates. 
On January 4, 2013 Zamin Ferrous Ltd (‘Zamin’) announced that it had signed a binding agreement  
for the purchase of Amapá from Anglo American Plc (70%) and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (30%).  
This process completed on November 4, 2013 and Zamin is now the owner and operator. The Group  
is encouraged by this change of ownership and looks forward to establishing a good working 
relationship with Zamin going forward.
Tucano
The Group has a 1% life of mine GRR on all iron ore and other non-precious metals (other than copper) 
produced from the Tucano Project owned by ASX-listed Beadell Resources Limited (‘Beadell’). Tucano 
was acquired by Beadell in 2010 and is located adjacent to Amapá in northern Brazil. Tucano is focused 
on gold mining, with first gold being poured in 2012. However, it also produces an iron ore concentrate 
from the tailings created by its gold processing plant. The iron ore is sold to Zamin pursuant to an 
off-take agreement for 500ktpa of ~65% Fe concentrate.
The Group is also entitled to royalties over a number of concessions governed by a joint exploration 
arrangement between Zamin and Beadell. 
Performance
Shipments of iron ore from Amapá were suspended in March 2013 due to a serious incident at the 
Santana port, which impacted key infrastructure at the loading bay. This resulted in reported 2013 
income from Amapá of £0.7m (2012: £2.2m). Shipments have now recommenced and the expectation  
is that royalties will resume in the near-term. The Group is also expecting royalty income to commence 
from the adjacent Tucano mine in 2014. 
 For additional information, please see www.zaminferrous.com and www.beadellresources.com.au
Valuation
The Group acquired these pre-existing royalties in 2010. These are considered to be intangible assets 
and, as such, are presented on the balance sheet at cost. Intangible royalties are amortised when 
production commences, on a straight line basis over the expected life of the mine.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Business review
El Valle-Boinás/Carlés (‘EVBC’), Gold, copper and silver, Spain 
What we own
The Group has a 2.5% life of mine NSR royalty on the EVBC gold, copper and silver mine owned by  
TSX-listed Orvana Minerals Corp (‘Orvana’). EVBC is located in the Rio Narcea Gold Belt of northern 
Spain and was previously mined from 1997 to 2006 by Rio Narcea Gold Mines. The royalty rate 
increases to 3% when the gold price is over US$1,100 per ounce. 
The EVBC royalty was originally structured as a non-interest bearing, convertible debenture, but 
following an amendment in 2012, the convertible element has been removed. The royalty is secured  
by way of ‘censos’ on the mining concessions and there is an intercreditor arrangement in place  
with Credit Suisse AG, which has provided finance to Orvana. 
Performance
Production at EVBC was encouraging throughout 2013. The Group received royalty income of £2.0m 
during the year, a satisfactory result considering the decline in the gold price in 2013. The Group 
received an additional payment of £2.0m in 2013 representing repayment of the original debenture 
instrument. Orvana announced FY 2013 calendarised production for EVBC of 65,992 ounces of gold, 
197,768 ounces of silver and 6.7m pounds of copper, whilst FY 2014 production guidance was 65,000  
to 75,000 ounces of gold, 175,000 to 200,000 ounces of silver and 6 to 6.5m pounds of copper.
 For additional information, please see www.orvana.com
Valuation
Although EVBC is a royalty, the original debenture agreement displayed characteristics of a financial 
asset. As such, the asset is carried on the balance sheet at its fair value by reference to the discounted 
expected future cash flows over the life of the mine.

Near-production royalties
Four Mile, Uranium, South Australia 
What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR royalty on the Four Mile uranium mine in South Australia.  
Four Mile is operated by Quasar Resources Pty Ltd (‘Quasar’) on behalf of its JV partners: Quasar  
(75%) and ASX-listed Alliance Resources Limited (‘Alliance’) (25%).
Performance
Significant progress was made in advancing the Four Mile project during 2013 and the expectation  
of Alliance is for this to enter production during 2014. The progress at the project includes:
• On August 16, 2013, Alliance announced that the Program for Environment Protection and 
Rehabilitation had been approved. On the same day, it was announced that the Environment 
Protection Authority South Australia had approved a Licence for Mining and Mineral Processing, 
including Radiation Management and Radioactive Waste Management plans. 
• On September 3, 2013, Alliance announced that the Four Mile Uranium Mine Monitoring,  
Mine Closure and Community Engagement Plans had also been approved. 
• On December 3, 2013, Alliance announced that construction had commenced and that the 
production budget had been approved. 
• On January 31, 2014, Alliance announced the approval of the Four Mile Revised Start-Up Plan  
and Program and Budget. The Start-Up Plan envisages in-situ recovery mining commencing  
in April 2014, with first uranium oxide sales in July 2014.

Development royalties
Isua, Iron ore, Greenland 
What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine GRR on AIM-listed London Mining PLC’s (‘London Mining’) Isua iron ore 
project in Greenland. The royalty rate increases for iron ore of less than 55% Fe to a maximum of 1.4%.
The royalty agreement contains a number of milestones, the breach of which would allow the Group  
to convert the royalty back into the US$30m consideration, the satisfaction of which can be in cash  
or London Mining shares at London Mining’s election. The remaining milestones include commercial 
production not occurring prior to June 20, 2017, a change of control of the project (or of London Mining) 
and the revocation of any material licences or permits. 
London Mining announced a feasibility study for Isua on March 27, 2012, which envisaged an initial 
10-year mine life with annual production of 15Mtpa.
Performance
The project was granted an exclusive 30-year exploitation licence on October 24, 2013. This is a key 
milestone in advancing the project.
 For additional information, please see www.londonmining.co.uk
Valuation
As there is a contractual means of recovering the monies advanced, the royalty is considered a financial 
asset and carried at fair value at each reporting date.
Salamanca, Uranium, Spain
What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR royalty on the Salamanca uranium project located in Spain  
and operated by ASX-listed Berkeley Resources Ltd (‘Berkeley’). The project consists of three main 
deposits (Retortillo, Alameda and Gambuta) and is located in Salamanca Province, Spain, approximately 
250km west of Madrid.
Performance
On September 26, 2013, Berkeley announced the results of its pre-feasibility study, which estimated  
an average production of 2.7Mlbs U3O8 per annum over an 11-year mine life and a total capital cost  
of US$169m. In October 2013, Berkeley announced that it had been granted its Environmental Licence 
for the Retortillo deposit. This is a major milestone for the project. 
 For additional information, please see www.berkeleyresources.com.au
Valuation
This is an intangible asset, carried at cost until such time as production commences at which point 
amortisation will commence.

Ring of Fire, Chromite, Canada
What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR royalty over a number of claims on the Black Thor, Black Label  
and Big Daddy chromite deposits, operated by NYSE-listed Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (‘Cliffs’),  
in the Ring of Fire region of Northern Ontario, Canada.
Performance
Cliffs announced on November 20, 2013 its decision to halt development of its chromite project for the 
foreseeable future. Cliffs referenced the risk associated with the development of infrastructure required 
to advance the project as the main reason for its decision. Cliffs has announced that it will continue to 
work with stakeholders to explore for potential solutions to the current impasse.
 For additional information, please see www.cliffsnaturalresources.com
Valuation
This is an intangible asset and accounted for at cost. Due to the announcement referred to above,  
the expected future cash flows no longer exceed cost. An impairment charge has been recognised  
to reflect the difference.
Footnotes to the royalty table on page 21
Kestrel: For more information on the royalty rate, please see page 22.
Tucano: The 1% GRR is only on iron ore and other non-precious metals (other than copper). The Company is also entitled to royalties over a number of concessions 
governed by a joint exploration agreement between Zamin and Beadell. The royalty rate for these royalties is either 0.7% or 1% depending on the concession.
EVBC: The Company owns a 2.5% NSR royalty which escalates to 3% when the gold price is over US$1,100 per ounce.
Isua: The royalty rate increases to 1.4% for iron ore of less than 55% iron content and 1.2% for beneficiated ore of less than 55% iron content.
Jogjakarta: The NSR royalty reduces to 1% after repayment of the principal amount of the debenture if at the time the pig iron price is below US$700 per tonne.  
The royalty is only payable over a 70% share in the project.
Dugbe 1: The royalty is 2% except where both the average gold price is above $1,800 and sales of gold are less than 50,000 ounces, in which case it increases  
to 2.5% in respect of that quarter.
Mount Ida: The consideration was payable in three tranches as follows: US$6m paid for a 0.3% GRR on completion and agreement on the terms of the transaction; 
US$4m for a further 0.225% GRR on the production of a positive DFS, plus a formal decision to mine, plus 20% of pre-production capital costs being provided for;  
and US$4m for a further 0.225% GRR on commencement of commercial production. To date only the first tranche has been paid by the Group.
STRATEGIC REPORT
Business review
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 28 The Group revised some of its accounting policies during the year in light of a review of the Group’s 2012 Annual Report by the 
Conduct Committee of the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) as part of their annual review process.
The following changes/clarifications have been reflected in the financial statements:
• Kestrel: following the FRC review, this is now accounted for as Investment Property in accordance with IAS 40. This has no 
impact on valuation.
• Royalty instruments (EVBC): this is accounted for as an available for sale equity financial asset in accordance with IAS 39. 
As such, all receipts should be accounted for as returns on investment. Previously, the Group treated the EVBC debenture 
repayments as offsetting the capital outstanding. These are now restated as a return on investment and recognised in the 
income statement. This has no impact on the balance sheet, as these are carried at fair value.
• Royalty instruments (other): these are accounted for as available for sale debt financial assets in accordance with IAS 39, as the 
agreements contain several features which are similar to those found in conventional financing contracts. As such, regardless 
of the contractual interest rate, an effective interest rate is applied where material. Similar to IAS 39 equity financial assets, 
these too are carried at fair value at each reporting date.
• Impairment of equity instruments: although the way in which the Group considers impairment has not changed in the period, 
a key input into this assessment is relevant underlying mining indices. As this has changed the threshold which the Directors 
consider to be significant, this is deemed a change in policy which requires a prior period adjustment. This does not alter the 
value of the equities which are always accounted for at mark to market at each reporting period end.
Please see note 2.1.3 to the financial statements, which describes the items yet to be resolved with the FRC and the Group’s 
assessment of their potential impact.

The Group’s underlying business remained profitable throughout 2013. A number of valuation and non-cash items recognised in 
the income statement results in the Group reporting a loss after tax of £42.5m compared to a profit of £11.6m in 2012 (restated). 
Due to the number of such items, the Group has decided to present an adjusted earnings per share metric to better report the 
underlying performance of the Group.

Non-cash valuation of coal royalties 13,568 (9,512) This represents the revaluation of Kestrel, in accordance with IAS 40. 
Previously, Kestrel was accounted for in accordance with IAS 16. This change

26,321 11,401 The further unrealised decline in value of the Group’s mining and exploration 
interests in the period is considered ‘significant’ in the context of the Group’s 
impairment policy and IAS 39. Such decline requires previous unrealised losses 
recognised in the Revaluation Reserve to be recognised as impairment in the 
income statement. The balance sheet always reflects current market value. 
Non-cash impairment of intangible 
assets (royalty interests)
8,313 – An impairment review is carried out to determine whether the expected 
future cashflows exceed carrying value. As discussed below, events during 
the year have created uncertainty as to if and when some of the 
Group’s royalties will come into production. 
Non-cash revaluation of available for

Effective interest rate on available for

(1,140) (570)
IAS 39 requires an effective interest rate to be applied to financial assets 
which fall under the definition of debt. As this is a non-producing royalty, it is 
considered un-prudent to reward income ahead of receiving the equivalent 
cash. (See note 2.9(e)(ii).)

STRATEGIC REPORT Royalty income
The Group was encouraged by the performance of its producing royalties during the year. Despite falling commodity prices and foreign 
exchange rates, royalty income during the year was resilient. Overall, royalty related income was £14.7m in 2013, a decrease of only 
£0.4m from that reported in 2012 (restated).

Crinum – 117
Total 14,731 15,157
Income from Kestrel was £9.9m (2012: £10.9m). The weakening of the Australian dollar resulted in a foreign exchange loss of £0.5m. 
Underlying income was A$16.1m compared to A$16.7m in 2012.
Elsewhere, royalty income from EVBC during the year of £2.0m reflects the favourable impact of an increased level of gold and copper 
production, despite lower gold and copper prices. The additional £2.0m received represents repayment of the initial debenture 
investment. As EVBC is accounted for as an available for sale equity interest in accordance with IAS 39, this represents a return on 
investment and not a return of capital and is recognised in the income statement and is not recurring. All income from EVBC will be in 
the form of royalties going forward.
As previously reported, royalty income from Amapá was significantly impacted by the incident at the Santana port in March 2013, 
which resulted in the suspension of all shipments of iron ore from the mine. This has not stopped production at the mine, and royalties 
will resume once shipping recommences.
The Group was encouraged that operating profit remained steady in 2013 at £11.3m (2012: £11.2m (restated)).
Impairment
The following table summarises the impairment charges reflected in the income statement:

2012 
£ ’000 Description
Ring of Fire (4,047) – The operator’s announcement that it was placing its operation on care and 
maintenance places uncertainty over the future of this project. This announcement 
has resulted in a partial impairment of this royalty. However the Group maintains 
its view that this is a world class deposit that will eventually come into production.
Mount Ida (3,319) – Similar to the Ring of Fire, the operator has placed this operation on care and 
maintenance and is now focusing on its other projects. Should iron ore prices 
increase significantly in future years, this project could restart. In the meantime, 
the Group has ascribed limited value to this royalty.
Bulqiza (947) – The operator is increasingly focused on its copper projects in Turkey rather than  
this chromite deposit in Albania. This has altered the timing of expected cash flows, 
impacting on the value of the Group’s royalty.
Royalty impairment (8,313) –
Mining and exploration interests (26,321) (11,401) This represents the transfer of the absolute decline in value of the strategic equity 
investments from the revaluation reserve to the income statement in the period.

Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets decreased in value from £301.0m at the end of 2012 to £216.9m at December 31, 2013. Foreign exchange 
movements accounted for a significant portion of this decline, as several of the Group’s royalty assets, including Kestrel, are 
denominated in Australian dollars. The underlying valuation of the majority of these royalties remained resilient in 2013.

Net assets at December 31, 2013 216.9 196
The net decline in the valuation of the Kestrel royalty of £27.7m in the period largely reflects the weakness in the Australian dollar. 
The royalty was independently valued at A$244.6m before tax at December 31, 2013 – a decrease of A$22m from the value at the 
beginning of the year. The decline in the royalty valuation also reflects the foreign exchange impact of the exchange rate between  
the US dollar (the currency in which the income is derived) and the Australian dollar (the currency in which the royalty is reported). 
The US dollar also weakened substantially against the pound during the year.
Royalty intangibles represent the Group’s ‘plain vanilla’ royalties. As a proportion of these are denominated in Australian dollars, the 
decrease in value is largely represented by unfavourable exchange rate movements. As discussed above, certain of these interests 
were considered impaired as at December 31, 2013.
Royalty instruments represent the EVBC, Isua and Jogjakarta royalties, which are accounted for as financial assets. These are carried at 
fair value on the balance sheet as they represent financial assets in accordance with IAS 39. The decline in value is largely attributable 
to project assumptions for Jogjakarta along with a risk assessment of operating in Indonesia. The decline in the gold price during the 
year also had some impact on the valuation of EVBC.
The decline in value of the Group’s mining and exploration interests (strategic equity investments) largely reflects a decline in the mark 
to market value during the period, although there were some sales when it was considered a royalty was no longer probable. The 
magnitude of the decline is such that the Directors consider this to be significant in the context of the Group’s impairment policy and 
have recognised an impairment charge accordingly. 
The Group ended the year with £15.7m of cash and cash equivalents and together with the new US$15m unsecured twelve-month 
revolving credit facility signed in February 2014, this leaves the Group in a favourable position to continue to expand and diversify its 
portfolio of royalties.
Allowing for deferred tax associated with the unrealised revaluation surplus of Kestrel and the royalty instruments, the Group ended the 
year with net assets of £216.9m (2012: £301.0m (restated)).

STRATEGIC REPORT Corporate social responsibility report
Anglo Pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in all  
areas of its business. As part of this, the Board has committed to 
undertake a review all of Anglo Pacific’s current corporate social 
responsibility (‘CSR’) practices and activities, focusing on 
examining current activities and identifying areas of improvement 
based on industry best practice. The Board expects to be in a 
position to implement changes commencing in 2014.
Integrity 
Anglo Pacific is committed to maintaining its reputation for fair 
dealing. We do not offer, give or receive bribes or inducements 
whether directly or through a third party. 
We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all of our 
Directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisers, business 
partners, and anyone else who may be acting on our behalf, are 
aware of their responsibilities in this area. We actively promote a 
transparent approach to all of our business dealings and expect 
our employees to adopt a zero tolerance attitude to corruption. 
Our employees are encouraged to report any potential or 
apparent misconduct in accordance with our internal whistle 
blowing policy and any employee that refuses to pay bribes, or 
raises any issues honestly, and in good faith, will be supported  
by the Group. 
We choose our business partners and counterparties carefully, 
based on merit, and only work with persons of known integrity, 
who will act consistently with our own standard. We do not make 
facilitation payments. Where we do business in countries with 
laws that are less restrictive than our own policies and procedures, 
we will seek to follow our own policies and procedures and 
promote our standard of integrity wherever possible.
Environment 
Anglo Pacific is committed to an environmental policy of 
collaborating fully with statutory authorities, local communities 
and other interested parties in order to limit any potential adverse 
impacts of its activities on the natural and human environments 
associated with its operations. The nature of our royalty 
investments is such that we do not operate any of the properties 
underlying our royalty portfolio and consequently, we do not 
always have the ability to influence the manner in which the 
operations are carried out. Nevertheless, a responsible approach 
to a project’s environmental impact and its sustainability 
management is essential to the success of the project over its 
life. As part of our investment decision process, we give careful 
consideration to the environmental aspects of any potential  
asset purchase during the due diligence phase. In particular,  
we typically engage with consultants who have the requisite 
expertise to ensure that we can consider and, if necessary, 
mitigate any risks in this regard to a properly maintainable level.  
In 2010 for instance, a due diligence report was commissioned 
which investigated the environmental aspects of the Amapá 
project. Where we do engage in exploration efforts as part of 
advancing a property, we undertake to do so in accordance with 
the highest industry standards. We expect our employees to 
address environmental and sustainability responsibilities within 
the framework of normal operating procedures and to look to 
minimise waste as much as economically practicable. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the Group’s 
environmental practices and for monitoring their effectiveness.
Social and Community Issues
Anglo Pacific acknowledges that, whilst its activities have little 
direct contact with communities, it can positively influence the 
social practices and policies of companies it conducts business 
with. Positive social and community relationships are essential  
to profitable and successful mining activities and we endeavour 
to ensure that companies we work with have appropriate 
procedures in place to facilitate this. More specifically, Anglo 
Pacific’s investment decision process for potential asset 
purchases routinely involves a due diligence process on the 
environmental, social, and health and safety aspects of the 
project. The Group standardises its due diligence process with 
regards to CSR aspects by including these in its due diligence 
checklists. In 2011, the Group’s due diligence of the Isua project 
involved a detailed review of the ecology, ground water, surface 
water and socio economic effects of the project by an external 
specialist consultant. Where we believe our own operational 
activities may have an impact on local community groups, we 
consult with these groups and provide them with the opportunity 
to engage at the planning stage. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for periodically reviewing the Group’s social and 
community practices and for monitoring their effectiveness.
Diversity 
Our people are instrumental to our success, we respect and 
value the individuality and diversity that every employee brings 
to the business. As at December 31, 2013, the Group had 
13 employees, four of whom were female. Of the total 
workforce, two were senior managers (both male). In terms of 
the Company’s Board of Directors, there were nine Directors, all 
of whom were male. Prior to any appointment to the Board, the 
Nomination Committee gives due regard to diversity and gender 
with a view to appointing the best placed individual for the role. 
We recognise that we have more to do in encouraging and 
supporting gender diversity and hope to be able to identify and 
develop talent at all levels in the organisation as the Company 
continues to grow.
More information on the Nomination Committee’s approach  
to diversity can be found on  p a g e 41.
Human Rights
Over the past year, there has been continued external attention 
and debate on the role of business and human rights. Anglo Pacific 
welcomes this focus as respect for human rights is implicit across 
all of the Group’s employment practices. Further, a commitment to 
human rights is an important part of any successful organisation, 
and, as part of our investment decision process, we have access 
to consultants with the requisite expertise to ensure that we can 
consider and, if necessary, help to mitigate any such risks.
Health and Safety 
The health and safety of our employees is a fundamental 
responsibility. The small size of our organisation allows the 
day-to-day responsibility to remain at the Board level, being 
monitored by the Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, a 
commitment to health and safety is a fundamental component of 
a mining project, and, as part of our investment decision process, 
we have access to consultants with the requisite expertise to 
ensure that we can consider and, if necessary, help to mitigate 
any such risks.

STRATEGIC REPORT
APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7 Donations 
Our philosophy on charity has historically been that this is a 
decision best made by shareholders with their own resources. 
The Group is currently evaluating its donations policy and will in 
future consider supporting select charities at the discretion of  
the Directors. No donations were made in 2013.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
During the year, the UK Government introduced a requirement 
that UK listed companies should report their global levels of 
Greenhouse Gas emissions in their Annual Report. Anglo Pacific 
is a relatively small organisation, with 13 employees, which 
means that any emission sources within our operational and 
financial control, such as business travel, purchase of electricity, 
heat or cooling by the Group, are not material in their impact.  
The Group pays for the consumption of utilities through its  
annual service charge, and therefore does not receive detailed 
information on its carbon emissions. Anglo Pacific does not 
operate (or control) any of the properties where royalty interests 
are held, which means that the Group does not have any 
greenhouse gas measures to quantifiably report from operations. 
The information on  pages 9 to 34 represents the Group’s 
Strategic Report and has been approved by the Board.

GOVERNANCE Approach towards corporate governance
The Group is characterised by a high ratio between its market 
capitalisation (£204m as at December 31, 2013) and the size  
of its management team (staff total: 13, of which three are 
Executive Directors, as at March 27, 2014), and by relatively few, 
but high value, transactions. The Board believes that corporate 
governance and internal control processes need to be 
appropriately tailored to this distinctive profile.
As a premium listed company on the London Stock Exchange, 
the Group is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’), and specifically to the revised 2012 version, which is 
available from the Financial Reporting Council’s website. The 
Board believes that it complies with the main principles of the 
Code as it applies to companies below  
the FTSE 350, except in respect of a formal annual process to 
evaluate the performance of the Board and of its Committees 
and individual Directors. The reasons for this departure from the 
Code are explained on  p a g e 4 0.
With the appointment of the new management team in October 
2013 and in conjunction with the Group’s newly publicised 
strategy to create a leading international diversified royalty 
company with a focus on base metals and bulk materials, the 
Board is focused on improving its corporate governance in line 
with FTSE 350 best practice and believes that it has already 
taken some useful steps forward in this process, as detailed 
below.
Board and committee structure
The Board is collectively responsible for approving the Group’s 
long-term objectives and strategy and for reviewing performance 
against it, and for the general oversight of the Group’s operations 
and management. 
During 2013, the Board continued to be chaired by an Executive 
Chairman, responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of  
the Board. The year was overshadowed by the illness, and  
death early in 2014, of the Chairman, Mr. Boycott. He had been 
Executive Chairman of the Company since 1997, and had, 
together with Mr. Wides (then Chief Executive Officer), played  
a large part in the Group’s strong growth over the following 
decade. Despite his illness, Mr. Boycott continued during 2013  
to participate actively in many meetings of the Board, and chaired 
the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in May. Mr. Wides was 
appointed Executive Acting Chairman in 2012. During 2013, both 
Mr. Wides and Mr. Boycott served on a part-time (3-day-a-week) 
basis.
In the 2011 Annual Report, prior to Mr. Boycott’s illness, the 
Board announced its intention that the role of Chairman should 
become a Non-Executive post within the following two to three 
years, and that thereafter Mr. Boycott and Mr. Wides would 
consider acting as Non-Executive Directors. On March 28, 2014,  
in accordance with this objective the Board announced the 
appointment of Mr. Blyth as Non-Executive Chairman, with 
effect from April 1, 2014, from his role as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Mr. Wides will continue in his role as  
an Executive Director until the 2014 AGM, or earlier by mutual 
agreement, when he is to retire from the Board. He will then 
continue in a part-time consulting role for six months to ensure  
an effective handover of his responsibilities. 
The time commitment expected of the new Non-Executive 
Chairman is around 6 days per month. Mr. Blyth’s other (mainly 
charitable) commitments are shown on  p a g e 3 6, none of which 
are considered to be significant.
The day to day management of the Group is delegated to the 
Executive Committee, save for certain matters reserved for 
consideration by the Board. The Executive Committee is chaired 
by the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), and comprises the 
Executive Directors (which throughout 2013 included the Acting 
Chairman), the General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer 
(‘CFO’). The Chairman/Acting Chairman and CEO continue to 
have distinct roles which have been defined in writing and agreed 
by the Board.
Other responsibilities are devolved to the Nomination, 
Remuneration and Audit Committees; their members are all 
Non-Executive Directors and their work is described more fully 
below. The terms of reference of each Committee, and the 
matters reserved to the Board, are available on the Group’s 
website.
Mr. Atkinson acted as the Group’s Senior Independent Director 
(‘SID’) throughout the year. The role of the SID is to provide a 
sounding board for the Chairman and to serve as an intermediary 
for the other Directors where necessary. The SID takes the lead 
on meetings of the Non-Executive Directors outside the formal 
committee structure, and is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels, or where such channels would be inappropriate.
Following the appointment of Mr. Blyth, who the Board also 
considers to be independent, as a Non-Executive Director in 
March 2013, the Company complied with the requirement of the 
Code to have at least two independent Non-Executive Directors 
on the Board for the remainder of the year.

APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7 Appointment, development and assessment of directors
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment. Under the terms of the 
Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are required 
to retire and seek reappointment by shareholders at an AGM 
on the third anniversary of their appointment. Of the current 
Non-Executive Directors, Mr. Yadgaroff, Dr. Whellock and Mr. 
Atkinson were not appointed to specified terms of office. 
Mr. Cooke, Mr. Blyth and Mr. Stan were appointed on rolling 
three-year contracts, and the Board intends that all future 
Non-Executive Director appointments will be on similar terms. 
Notwithstanding this, it is the Board’s intention that all Directors, 
including the Non-Executive Directors, shall be subject to 
re-election at each AGM.
Each Director is required to disclose to the Board their other 
significant commitments prior to appointment and when there  
is any significant change. The Board considers that all of the 
Directors allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.
Actual and potential conflicts of interest are regularly reviewed. 
As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s 
Articles of Association contain provisions that enable the Board 
to authorise conflicts or potential conflicts that individual 
Directors may have and to impose such limits or conditions  
as the Board thinks fit. During the year the Group’s policy on 
conflicts of interest was reviewed and tightened in line with 
evolving best practice.
The Company’s Directors have a wide range of skills as well  
as appropriate experience in financial, commercial and mining 
activities. Each Director takes responsibility for undertaking the 
appropriate training required for developing and updating their 
knowledge and capabilities. Where appropriate, the Group 
provides the resources to meet the Directors’ requirements.
Board evolution
During 2013, alongside the move to a Non-Executive Chairman, 
the Directors took the view that the Board should be rejuvenated 
and reinvigorated ahead of the next stage of the Group’s 
development, with the transition handled in an orderly and 
progressive way. In October 2013, Mr. Theobald (CEO) and 
Mr. Orchard (Chief Investment Officer (‘CIO’)) stepped down 
from the Board by mutual agreement and left the Group. The 
Board would like to express its appreciation for what they 
achieved over the four years they served in these roles.
In October 2013, the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee, appointed Mr. Treger and Mr. Potter as 
CEO and CIO respectively. Mr. Treger and Mr. Potter joined from 
Audley Capital Advisors LLP . Both have a strong track record of 
investing in the mining sector, and a level of financial expertise 
and breadth of contacts that will be of considerable benefit in 
developing the Group’s business. Mr. Treger joined the Group 
initially on a three-day a week basis, but, since January 2014, he 
has increased his formal commitment to three and half days a 
week. The expectation is for Mr. Treger to increase this further 
over the coming year.
Dr. Whellock and Mr. Atkinson have indicated that they will be 
standing down at the forthcoming AGM after 11 and eight years 
service respectively as Non-Executive Directors. Each has 
contributed his own valuable expertise to the work of the Board, 
and the Board is extremely grateful for the experience and wise 
advice they have provided.
In March 2014, on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, the Board appointed Mr. Stan as a replacement 
Non-Executive Director. Mr. Stan is Canadian-based and comes 
with a deep knowledge and proven track record in the Canadian 
and international mining industry. He was a founding shareholder 
and, until 2012, the President and CEO of Grande Cache Coal 
Corporation. On account of his strong experience and 
entrepreneurial background, the Board considers Mr. Stan to be 
independent, despite his being a fellow director alongside Mr. 
Treger on Whetstone Minerals Ltd. The Nomination Committee 
is currently conducting a search for an additional independent 
Non-Executive Director.

GOVERNANCE Relations with shareholders
The Group is the only major mining royalty company in the  
UK and recognises the importance of developing a fuller 
understanding of its business model amongst investors. and  
an effective two-way communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts. During 2013 the illness of  
our Chairman reduced the opportunity for dialogue with major 
shareholders, although the SID continued to meet a range of 
fund managers and institutions.
There are over 2000 private investors in the Group. The Board 
was pleased by the attendance at the 2013 AGM, where 
investors were able to ask about current business activity. At  
this year’s AGM it is anticipated that all of the Directors, including 
the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees will be available to answer any shareholder 
questions.
In November 2013, the Group appointed a designated head  
of marketing and investor relations, as part of a strategy of 
strengthening investor relations. In January 2014, the Board 
appointed BMO Capital Markets (‘BMO’) to work alongside 
Liberum Capital as Joint Corporate Broker. BMO will play an 
increasingly important role as we look to grow the Company and 
internationalise our share register. At the same time we have put 
in place arrangements for more regular investor relations reports 
to the Board, including commentary on the perception of the 
Company, views expressed by the investment community, 
media reports, share price performance and analysis, so as  
to ensure that all Directors are made aware of the major 
shareholders’ issues and concerns.
Nomination Committee
During 2013, the Nomination Committee comprised Mr. 
Atkinson, Mr. Yadgaroff, Dr. Whellock (until March 2013) and 
Mr. Blyth (from March 2013). Mr. Atkinson was Chairman of the 
Committee. Consequently, for most of the year under review, 
the Committee complied with the Code requirement that it be 
comprised of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Mr. Stan joined the Committee following his appointment to the 
Board in February 2014.
The Nomination Committee was actively involved during 2013  
in reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, in 
the light of the succession policies discussed earlier, the need  
to maintain a balance of appropriate skills and accepted best 
corporate governance practice. The Committee is responsible  
for identifying and nominating candidates for both Executive  
and Non-Executive Directorships for approval by the Board.
Although the Committee has the authority to use an external 
search consultancy or open advertising, it chose not to do so in 
respect of any of the appointments made during 2013, nor for the 
appointment of Mr. Stan. The background to Mr. Blyth’s March 
2013 appointment as Non-Executive Director was described in 
the Group’s 2012 Annual Report. The October 2013 appointment 
of Mr. Treger as CEO and Mr. Potter as CIO was seen as the 
bringing in of an executive team rather than as separate individual 
appointments, and the issues raised, which included the future 
strategic direction of the Group, meant that it was appropriate for 
the Board as a whole to take the lead in considering their joint 
appointment.
The Code recommends that the Board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
Committees and individual Directors (including the Chairman). 
Given the compactness of the organisation, the long-established 
personal working relationships and the extent of collective 
decision-taking, the Board has not hitherto felt such formal 
stand-alone systems were justified. However, in the light of the 
current changes in its composition, the Board believes a more 
structured and rigorous annual assessment process is needed, 
which would be linked to the Directors’ training and development 
needs and expects to comply with the Code’s requirements 
during 2014.
Similarly, the Board has previously provided an informal induction 
process for new Directors on joining the Board, but now believes 
a more structured process is needed and expects to comply with 
the Code’s requirements for a full, formal and tailored induction 
moving forward.
Functioning of the board
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for setting the Board’s agenda and for ensuring that 
the Board receives accurate, timely and clear information. The 
agenda includes regular reports from the Executive Committee 
and from the Board’s Committees on all matters relating to the 
running of the Group. The Chairman is also responsible for 
ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of all 
agenda items and in particular strategic issues.
Peter Mason, the Group’s General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, is responsible for advising the Board, through the 
Chairman, on all governance matters. All of the Directors have 
access to his services and advice. All of the Directors may also 
seek independent professional advice in the performance of  
their duties, at the Group’s expense.
Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings which 
they were eligible to attend during 2013 was as follows:

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 40
APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7 The Committee meets at least three times a year at appropriate 
times in the reporting and audit cycle and may be attended, by 
invitation, by the Chairman, the CEO, the CFO and the Company 
Secretary. The external auditors are invited to attend meetings  
on a regular basis. The Committee’s primary duty is to monitor 
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and the related 
reports and announcements. In doing so, the Committee reviews 
and, where necessary, challenges the consistency of the Group’s 
accounting policies, methods and standards, the clarity and 
context of disclosures and the material information presented 
with the financial statements. The Committee is also responsible 
for monitoring and reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls, including the Group’s policies and 
procedures in relation to anti-corruption and whistle blowing and 
to the environmental and social impact of the Group’s activities. 
One particular area of focus of the Committee in 2013 was the 
Group’s policy on conflicts of interest, which was thoroughly 
reviewed and tightened in line with evolving best practice.
The Committee also considers the adequacy of arrangements  
for the statutory audit and supporting the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. In particular, the Committee 
advises the Board in respect of the external auditor’s 
appointment, performance and remuneration and meets  
regularly with the external auditor to discuss its remit, any issues 
arising from the audit and its effectiveness. The Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor. The Committee accepts that 
some non-audit work is most appropriately undertaken by the 
firm responsible for the statutory audit, but requires any such 
engagement to be approved in advance by the Committee’s 
Chairman. The Group also uses other accounting firms for 
non-audit work, with the decision on each engagement being 
taken with the objective of maintaining an appropriate balance 
between experience, objectivity, independence and value for 
money.
The Committee also considers, on an annual basis, whether an 
internal audit function is required. Its present view is that one  
is not yet justified given the compact size of the Group and the 
Directors’ involvement with individual transactions.
In 2013, the Committee met seven times. During the year  
the Committee undertook an in depth review of the Group’s 
accounting policies following an enquiry by the Conduct 
Committee of the FRC into the Group’s 2012 Annual Report  
and Accounts. The particular matters under review included the 
Group’s accounting policies in respect of coal royalties, royalty 
interests and royalty instruments, together with its impairment 
policy in respect of its mining and exploration interests. The 
Committee sought external professional accountancy advice in 
relation to some of these matters. This review has resulted in 
changes in policy in relation to the accounting for the Group’s  
coal royalties and royalty instruments as detailed in note 2.1.4. 
The FRC enquiry remains open in relation to royalty interests, 
royalty instruments and the impairment of mining and exploration 
interests. Our accounts have been prepared in accordance  
with our existing policies in these areas. See note 2.1.3 which 
discusses the possible impact on the financial statements  
should any further restatement be required.
In the case of Mr. Stan’s appointment, the Committee was 
looking for a replacement for the coal industry experience of  
Mr. Atkinson and the insight into North American mining and 
mineral processing provided by Dr. Whellock. Although the 
combination of familiarity with the global coking coal market (on 
which the Group has historically been heavily dependent), and an 
understanding of the Canadian mining scene (which is likely to be 
a key focus for the Group’s future) is not unique, the Committee 
felt that the degree of Mr. Stan’s insights and his successful 
entrepreneurial background was unlikely to be matched through a 
search process. Further, once Mr. Stan had been identified as a 
potential candidate, the Committee did use the services of OPUS 
Executive Partners, to interview him and advise on his suitability 
for the role. OPUS Executive Partners does not have any other 
connection with the Group.
Given the appointment of an external Executive Director team, 
there was a general view amongst the Board, including all of the 
Non-Executive Directors, that in the interests of continuity the 
new Non-Executive Chairman should be an internal appointment, 
and that Mr. Blyth’s experience of financial and corporate 
governance made up him well-qualified for this role. 
Consequently, the Committee also chose to use neither an 
external search consultancy nor open advertising for this 
appointment. 
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity and that its  
current composition does not provide this in several respects.  
A description of the Board’s policy on diversity can be found on 
 page 33. One particular focus of the Committee has been to 
increase gender diversity on the Board and it is its intention to 
include, wherever possible, at least one woman on the short-list 
for future Non-Executive Director appointments. The final 
selection will continue to be based on merit and on what the 
Committee judges to be the best interests of shareholders.  
The opportunities for developing and appointing women to 
Executive Directorships will be kept under review.
Audit Committee
Until March 20, 2013, the Audit Committee comprised 
Mr. Yadgaroff, Mr. Atkinson and Dr. Whellock, who was also the 
chairman of the Committee. Following Mr. Blyth’s appointment 
to the Board on that date, the Audit Committee comprised of 
Mr. Blyth, Mr. Atkinson and Dr. Whellock, who remained the 
chairman of the Committee until February 14, 2014 when 
Mr. Blyth assumed that role. Consequently, the Committee 
comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors, the majority of 
whom the Board consider to be independent, for most of the 
year under review. The Board believes that Dr. Whellock still 
brings useful skills and experience to the Committee and that he 
should continue to be a member until he steps down from the 
Board at the forthcoming AGM. Mr. Stan joined the Committee 
following his appointment to the Board in February 2014. 
Mr. Blyth and Mr. Atkinson both have recent and relevant 
financial experience.

GOVERNANCE The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate 
delegation of authority.
• There are established procedures for planning and approving 
investments and information systems for monitoring the 
Group’s financial performance against budgets and forecasts.
• The Chief Financial Officer is required to undertake an annual 
assessment process, in conjunction with the Company 
Secretary, to identify and quantify the risks that face the 
Group’s businesses and functions, and to assess the adequacy 
of the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices in place 
for those risks. This process covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls.  
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the risk 
assessment process for completeness and accuracy.
• In addition to its work on the above, the Audit Committee also 
receives regular reports about significant risks and associated 
control and monitoring procedures. The Group’s risk register 
and internal controls and procedures documentation are regular 
agenda items for the Committee. The Committee also receives 
regular reports from the external auditors.
• The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on these 
matters, so as to enable the Directors to review the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control. The Board also 
receives regular reports from its other Committees and directly 
from management.
• The system accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 
up to the date of approval of the report and financial statements 
that have required the Board to deal with any related material 
internal control issues.
The Directors confirm that the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control as described 
during the period and concluded that the controls and procedures 
are adequate.
The Committee continued to place a particular focus on the 
Group’s risk management systems. It reviewed in detail the 
annual assessment conducted by the CEO and the Company 
Secretary of the risks that face the Group and the adequacy of 
the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices in place for 
those risks. Whilst the review did not highlight any significant 
issues with the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls  
and procedures, it did highlight a few areas where improvement 
could be made and the Group has subsequently implemented 
the Committee’s recommendations. The review also resulted  
in an updating of the Group’s risk register following the changes 
in senior management team and the resulting revision to the 
Group’s strategy. Additional information on the Group’s internal 
controls can be found below. 
The current year is the sixth that Christopher Smith, the audit 
partner of the Group’s external auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP , 
has been in post as Senior Statutory Auditor. In normal course 
there would have been a rotation of Senior Statutory Auditor  
after five years’ service. The Committee felt, however, that, given 
the changes in accounting policy that have taken place and the 
further changes which may occur following the conclusion of the 
FRC review, it was important to maintain continuity of Senior 
Statutory Auditor for a further year. The Committee is satisfied 
that this extension does not in any way prejudice the objectivity 
and independence of the Senior Statutory Auditor. The 
Committee is due to conduct a full review of the effectiveness  
of the external audit process following the completion of the 
year-end process and will consider the appointment or the 
reappointment of the Senior Statutory Auditor in light of its 
findings.
Risk management & internal control
The Board retains overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and determines the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives. A statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in the preparation of the financial statements is set out on  
 p a g e 58.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to provide the 
Directors with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the 
Group will not be hindered in achieving its business objectives,  
or in the orderly and legitimate conduct of its business, by 
circumstances that may reasonably be foreseen. However, no 
system of internal control can eliminate the possibility of poor 
judgment in decision-making, human error, fraud or other 
unlawful behaviour, management overriding controls, or the 
occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances and the resulting 
potential for material misstatement or loss.

was implemented in 2013. What is different this year is that, in 
accordance with new regulations governing the disclosure and 
approval of directors’ remuneration, the Policy Report is being 
put to a binding shareholder resolution at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) and the Annual Remuneration Report 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder resolution.
There have been significant changes in our remuneration 
strategy over the last few months, and I thought it might be 
helpful to briefly explain the background and put the changes  
in context. 
All four Executive Directors in post at the last AGM have either 
left the Board or will be doing so at the forthcoming AGM. In 
October 2013, we recruited in their place a strong team of two 
Executive Directors, Mr. Treger as CEO, and Mr. Potter, as CIO 
with a venture capital background and a mission to reinvigorate 
the Company and achieve a significant increase in total 
shareholder return over the next five years.
The basic salaries paid to the previous Directors were well below 
those in companies of comparable size, but this was offset by  
a relatively high annual bonus opportunity of 150% of salary.  
To recruit the new Directors we needed to offer basic salaries  
in line with market rates. Their annual bonuses have, however, 
been capped at 100%, the bonus criteria are being made more 
specific, and the increases in basic salary for the following two 
years have been pre-determined.
The major change, however, is a five year Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) in the form of a Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’) which 
will offer awards of shares (in the form of nil cost share options) 
at the end of five years to the two Executive Directors (and to  
a lesser extent to other senior managers) for increases in Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) at rates above 7% per annum. 
Shareholder approval for the VCP will be sought at our 
forthcoming AGM and will replace the previous Joint Share 
Option Plan (‘ JSOP’), which has not rewarded outperformance.
The VCP offers potentially significant rewards for 
outperformance, but only to the extent of the increase in TSR 
actually achieved over the five year period. The Remuneration 
Committee has worked hard with our remuneration advisers, 
New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), to ensure that the Plan supports the 
ambitious growth strategy discussed earlier in the Annual Report, 
and we believe that the incentives offered are strongly aligned 
with shareholder interests.
I accordingly hope you will feel able to support our new 
remuneration policy at this year’s forthcoming AGM, as well  
as endorsing the level of remuneration paid during 2013.
Yours sincerely
M.H. Atkinson 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Introduction
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) determines, on 
behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy on the remuneration of 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. It also recommends 
and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other 
senior executives. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
Membership of the Committee during 2013 is set out in the table 
below, together with the attendance record for meetings of the 
Committee. Since March 2013, all of the Committee’s members 
have been independent Non-Executive Directors, in accordance 
with the Corporate Governance Code.

Following Mr. Stan’s appointment to the Board on February 19, 
2014, the Remuneration Committee is now comprised of 
Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Blyth and Mr. Stan.
External advisors
The Committee has access to the advice of independent 
remuneration consultants when required. No such consultants 
were used during 2013. However, during 2014, the Committee 
has received advice from NBS. NBS was appointed by the 
Committee on January 20, 2014. NBS is a signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has no other 
connection with the Company. The Committee is satisfied that 
the advice that it receives from NBS is objective and 
independent.
The remuneration report is in two parts. 
The first part constitutes the ‘Remuneration Policy Report’ and 
sets out the remuneration strategy that the Company proposes 
to apply for 2014 onwards. It has been developed taking into 
account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2012 and the views of our major shareholders. The Policy Report 
will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and 
the policy will take formal effect from that date. It is structured  
in the following sections:
A. Strategic overview and policy drivers;
B.  How the views of shareholders and employees have been 
taken into account;
C. The new remuneration policy for Executive Directors;
D. Reasons for changing the previous remuneration policy;
E.  Annual bonus – Choice of performance measures and 
approach to target-setting;

GOVERNANCE
GOVERNANCE These are continuing factors. However, there have been major 
changes in our remuneration strategy since last year, driven by 
the decision to rejuvenate and reinvigorate the Board and to 
sharpen the focus of the executive team on raising total 
shareholder returns over the next five-year period. It is anticipated 
that by this year’s AGM, all Executive Directors in post at the last 
AGM will have left the Board. In October 2013 the Company 
recruited two new Executive Directors Mr. Treger as CEO, and 
Mr. Potter as CIO on the explicit basis that they would be entitled 
to a significant share of any increase in shareholder value created 
from when they joined. The Committee has worked with its 
remuneration advisers, NBS, on designing a new LTIP in the form 
of a VCP , the details of which are discussed at section F below.
The VCP is based on the growth in the absolute TSR achieved 
over the next five years. We believe that this offers the most direct 
alignment of Directors’ interests with those of shareholders. We 
have considered how far a TSR measure could lead to over- or 
under-rewarding due to the impact on the share price of factors 
outside management control such as commodity price volatility. 
We believe this risk is limited, partly by the length of the 
performance period which comes close to covering a full 
commodity price cycle, partly by the relative predictability of royalty 
volumes; and partly by the relatively large dividend component  
of the TSR expected to flow from the Company’s progressive 
dividend strategy. The performance target that has to be achieved 
before any options are awarded is considered challenging; and 
there is a powerful incentive for both outperformance and 
retention over the next five years. If shareholders endorse these 
remuneration proposals, the Committee proposes to offer senior 
non-Board managers some access to the LTIP . 
To attract the new Executive Directors the Company needed  
to offer basic salaries closer to market levels than the sub-lower 
quartile salaries of the past. However, they have been pre-set  
for the period through to December 2016 and, as part of the 
package, the cap on annual bonus has been reduced from 150% 
of salary to 100% whilst the bonus criteria has been made more 
transparent. The Committee is reviewing the bonus structure for 
non-Board senior managers to ensure a sensible relationship 
between Board and non-Board remuneration (see section I below).
B. How the views of shareholders and employees have been taken 
into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in 
relation to the AGM each year. Details of votes cast for and against 
the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report are 
provided in the Annual Remuneration Report. This feedback, plus 
any additional feedback received during any meetings from time 
to time, is then considered as part of the Company’s annual 
review of remuneration policy. Feedback during 2013 included 
concern that the Company’s JSOP did not reward performance 
above the hurdle rate and concern about its ‘all or nothing’ nature.
The Committee actively engaged with major shareholders  
on the proposed remuneration of the new Directors, and was 
encouraged by the general support shown for the proposals  
on basic salary and annual bonus. We have made a number of 
changes to the LTIP in response to the constructive feedback we 
received. A remuneration framework has now been set for the 
next three years. If there is a need for a material change to the 
framework within this period, the Committee Chairman will 
consult major shareholders in advance.

compared to other employees;

The second part, the Annual Remuneration Report for 2013, 
details the remuneration paid to Directors during 2013 with a 
comparison to the previous year. It will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM. It is structured as follows. 
The information in sections A to G and I to M has been audited.

Remuneration policy report
A. Strategic overview and policy drivers
In our 2012 Report we identified three important elements that 
had historically shaped the Company’s remuneration policy. The 
Company has:
• Long investment horizons (typically there can be an interval of 
between two and 10 years before a royalty comes on stream 
and the royalty may continue to flow for 20 years or more). As 
the business focus has increasingly shifted towards royalty 
acquisition, we have given greater weighting towards 
incentivising longer-term performance.
• No comparable peer group, certainly in the UK, for the 
purposes of benchmarking Director performance. As a result, 
our incentive plans are based on absolute performance rather 
than performance relative to other companies.
• A high ratio between its market capitalisation (£204m as at 
December 31, 2013) and the number of its employees (13 as at 
March 28, 2014, of whom three were Executive Directors). The 
risk to the business of losing key employees is correspondingly 
significant, and we have traditionally regarded retention as an 
important objective of our remuneration strategy.

and level of their own pay and bonuses.
C. The new remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The policy proposed for shareholder approval in respect of basic salary and annual bonus covers the three years 2014-16. The LTIP covers a 
five year period from the date of its grant (i.e. to mid-2019). The Committee expects to seek shareholder agreement in 2016 to a follow-on 
policy on basic salary and annual bonus, and probably also to further long-term incentive arrangements covering the period beyond 2018.
The Committee’s specific policy for each element of remuneration is as follows:
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Salary
To recruit, retain and reward 
executives of a suitable calibre 
for the role and duties 
required.
Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, 
experience and responsibilities to reflect the market rate 
for the individual and their role, determined with 
reference to remuneration levels in companies of similar 
size and complexity, taking into account pay levels within 
the Company in general.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase but 
salaries have been set for 2014 to 2016 on a full-time 
equivalent basis, as follows:
£’000 2014 2015 2016
CEO 360 380 400
CIO 180 190 200
Pension and benefits
To provide market competitive
benefits
A Company contribution to a money purchase pension 
scheme, or a cash allowance in lieu of pension at the 
request of the individual. Other than a death in service 
policy which the Company subscribes to, no other benefits 
are provided.
Executive Directors are entitled to 30 days’ leave.
Pension: 10% of salary.
Death in service policy: five times salary.
Annual bonus
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
operational objectives
The annual bonus will be paid wholly in cash with no 
deferred component, but with a provision for clawback. 
Up to 60% may be awarded for in-year achievement 
of corporate performance targets which are to be agreed 
by the Board at the beginning of the year.
Up to 40% may be awarded for in-year achievement 
of personal performance targets which are to be agreed 
with the Chairman and the Committee. 
The Committee will use a balanced scorecard approach to 
assess performance against targets at the end of the year.
The targets are discussed more fully at section E below.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100% of salary.
Long-term incentives
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
strategic objectives and 
provide alignment with 
shareholders through the use 
of shares and incentivise 
retention of key personnel.
The LTIP will take the form of a VCP with a performance 
period of five years from the date of grant (i.e. to 
mid-2019).
Awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition.
The detailed design is discussed at section F below.
The maximum number of shares that can be awarded under 
the option grants equates to 7.5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at the end of the measurement period.
The Committee intends to allocate the pool as follows:
CEO   56%
CIO   24%
Non-Board senior managers  20%
The potential rewards achievable by Executive Directors under the remuneration policy are illustrated at section G. The policy in respect 
of any future Director appointments is discussed at section J below.
D. Reasons for changing the previous remuneration policy
The new remuneration package summarised above represents a significant change to the remuneration policy that has applied up 
until 2013. 
Previously basic salaries were reviewed annually by the Committee, with a view to progressive alignment with lower quartile levels 
within similar sized FTSE companies through annual increases of around £20-25,000, and with a primary aim of retention. To attract 
new directors, the Company has had to offer, in addition to stronger long-term incentives, initial basic salaries closer to the median 
market rate for similar companies.
The annual bonus opportunity was previously capped at 150% of basic salary. It was designed to encourage and reward delivery of the 
Company’s operational objectives and to build Directors’ shareholding in the Company (through part payment in shares). The cap has 
now been reduced to 100%, partly reflecting the higher basic salary, but mainly to reflect the Committee’s concern to tilt the remuneration 
package towards incentivising longer-term TSR performance through a new LTIP . The focus of the annual bonus has also changed. 
It was previously geared largely to securing a threshold value of new royalty agreements during the year, which meant that Directors’ 
remuneration was not directly exposed to the risk that income from them might be later or lower than expected. Under the new 
remuneration policy, royalty acquisition is principally rewarded through the LTIP , and those rewards will accordingly reflect any royalty delays 
and shortfalls to a much greater extent. The annual bonus is now focused on the achievement of in-year corporate business, financial and 
relationship objectives, together with a greater emphasis on achievement of personal objectives by individual Directors (see section E).

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report
• Subject to such threshold growth, participants would become 
entitled to receive nil or nominal cost options over ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company, subject to a cap, set by 
reference to a share of a pool value equal to 10% of the growth 
in the Company’s TSR over the five year period or, if less, 50% 
of the growth in the Company’s TSR over the five-year period in 
excess of the threshold growth.
• The maximum number of shares to be awarded under the 
option grants will not be capable of exceeding such number 
equating to 7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 
the end of the measurement period. This cap would apply for 
total growth in TSR above 300%.
• This will mean that, if the total growth in TSR over the five-year 
period is:
 – below approximately 40%, no value accrues;
 – between approximately 40% and 50%, the value that 
accrues is equal to 50% of the growth in the Company’s TSR 
over the five-year period in excess of the threshold growth;
 – between 50% and the 300% cap, the value that accrues is 
equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over a 
five-year period; and
 – above the cap, the value that accrues is equal to the value of 
7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the end of 
the measurement period.
• Options to which participants become entitled at the end of the 
five-year period will become exercisable as follows:
 – One-third immediately;
 – One-third after 12 months;
 – One-third after 24 months.
• Awards will be made following shareholder approval of the VCP 
at the forthcoming AGM, and no other grants to the Executive 
Directors under the VCP are planned during the five year plan 
period; although the Committee will have discretion to dilute 
the pool by an additional 10% for new joiners.
• The Committee intends to allocate the pool as follows:
 – CEO – 56%
 – CIO – 24%
 – Non-Board senior managers – 20%
The following table and graph illustrates the potential return for 
participants and shareholders for various levels of growth in TSR 
over the five-year period:

Under the previous strategy it was normal for part of the annual 
bonus to be paid in the form of shares. However the rewards 
available under the new LTIP will be wholly in the form of shares. 
In addition the Executive Directors have separately agreed to inject 
substantial new share capital into the Company over time. The 
Committee accordingly believes it is appropriate that the annual 
bonus for Executive Directors should be paid wholly in cash.
The Company has previously offered two share-based longer-
term share schemes to Executive Directors and certain other 
employees: a Company Share Option Scheme (‘CSOP’) and the 
JSOP . Awards were granted subject to continued employment 
and satisfaction of performance conditions measured over three 
years including a TSR performance condition. No grants were 
made under either plan in 2013, and it is not intended that further 
grants under either scheme will be made to Executive Directors. 
E. Annual bonus – Choice of performance measures and approach 
to target setting
Annual bonuses for 2014 and the two subsequent years will be 
based on a scorecard of performance during the year. The 
scorecard will set challenging targets for triggering bonus, and for 
rewarding out performance on a sliding scale. The scorecard will 
be split on a 60/40 basis between corporate objectives and 
personal objectives.
The corporate objectives will be agreed by the Board at the 
beginning of each year, together with an assessment of the 
potential for outperformance and the risk of shortfall. They will 
cover such areas as business performance, finance, relationships 
and reputation. These will constitute the criteria for triggering a 
bonus and for assessing the levels of challenge and 
outperformance that would warrant higher levels of bonus. The 
CEO’s personal objectives for the year will be agreed at the 
beginning of the year by the Chairman of the Board in conjunction 
with the Committee, who will also agree the personal objectives 
of the CIO in conjunction with the CEO. The personal objectives 
will focus on the required contribution of the individual Director to 
the achievement of the Company’s objectives for the year, but 
also on important but less measurable aspects such as 
leadership, building personal and team relationships, and the 
extent to which they personally have ‘gone the extra mile’.
The CEO’s and CIO’s performance against corporate and 
personal objectives will be assessed by the Board Chairman and 
the Committee at the beginning of the following year, and bonus 
will be awarded on the basis of the agreed criteria.
F. LTIP – Principal terms and conditions and reward scenarios
The LTIP will take the form of a VCP . The key features of the VCP 
are as follows: 
• All employees will be eligible to participate in the VCP; although 
it is currently expected that initial participation will be limited to 
the two new Executive Directors together with other non-Board 
members of the senior management team at the discretion of 
the Committee acting in consultation with the CEO.
• No value would accrue under the VCP to its participants unless 
growth in the Company’s TSR over a five year performance 
period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum (or 
approximately 40% total growth over the period).

• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
• adjusting basic salaries for changes in time commitment  
(within the full-time equivalent levels set out in this policy);
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments

the nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and 
the impact of any performance conditions. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable  
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take  
into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval 
at the earliest opportunity. 
For external Executive Director appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance  
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
K. Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The Committee, together with the Nomination Committee, 
reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors’  
to ensure that these reflect best practice. 
Although all of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are  
for an indefinite term, it is the Company’s continuing policy that 
service contracts should not have a notice period of more than 
one year.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. 
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice 
and without any further payment or compensation, except for 
sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence 
of certain events such as gross misconduct. If the employing 
company terminates the employment of an Executive Director 
in other circumstances, compensation is limited to salary due 
for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by 
the Committee as representing the value of other contractual 
benefits (including pension) which would have been received 
during the period. Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. 
The service contracts of Mr. Potter and Mr. Treger provide for a 
six month notice period and an additional termination payment 
equivalent to six months’ basic salary (as did the service 
contracts of Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard), whereas the service 
contract of Mr. Wides simply limits payment for loss of office  
to twelve months’ basic salary (as did the service contract of 
Mr. Boycott). In the event of a change of control of the Company 
there is no enhancement to contractual terms. Service contracts 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, variation of share capital 
including rights issues and corporate restructuring events,  
and special dividends); 
• determining ‘good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan from 
year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or 
long-term incentive performance conditions and/or targets  
being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition  
or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust 
appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy.
I. Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee aims to ensure, over time, a proper differential 
between the level of the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
other employees, but also appropriate differences in the structure 
of remuneration to reflect different levels of responsibility and 
planning horizons of employees across the Company.
The remuneration framework of non-Board employees will be 
reviewed for 2014 and subsequent years in the light of the overall 
remuneration package shareholders agree for the new Executive 
Directors. There are likely to be two main differences: 
• the Committee will reserve access to the LTIP to the most 
senior executives who have the greatest potential to influence 
the Company’s long-term performance; and
• the Executive Directors will receive any annual bonus wholly in 
cash because of the large potential shareholding offered by the 
LTIP; but in order to encourage employees without access (or 
with less access) to the LTIP to build up a shareholding in the 
Company, consideration will be given to either including a share 
component in any annual bonuses awarded to non-Board 
employees, or continuing to offer them a CSOP arrangement, 
or a combination of the two. 
J. Approach to appointment of new Executive Directors
The remuneration package for a new Director would be set  
in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Currently, for an Executive Director, this would include a potential 
annual bonus of no more than 100%. There is provision within 
the proposed LTIP arrangement for the Committee to dilute the 
pool by an additional 10% for new appointees.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases following an initial 
probationary period and over the first few years as the executive 
gains experience in their new role. This is the salary profile 
applied to the two Executive Directors appointed in 2013.
The Committee may offer new appointees additional cash and/or 
share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders, including the use 
of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. Such payments 
would take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report
In summary, the contractual provisions for Executive Directors are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms 
Notice period One year or less.
Termination payment Basic salary plus benefits (including pension), paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection  
with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Additional termination payment to bring total to the equivalent of twelve months’ basic salary.
Remuneration entitlements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting  
for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the VCP will be determined based on the plan rules. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual’s 
performance and the reasons for their departure) ‘good leaver’ status can be applied. For good leavers, the unvested awards remain 
subject to performance conditions (measured over the original time period) and are reduced pro-rata in size to reflect the proportion of 
the performance period actually served. The Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to  
do so. In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
L. Non-Executive Directors
The Company aims to attract and retain a high-calibre Chairman and Non-Executive Directors by offering a market competitive fee 
level. 
The Committee’s specific policy is as follows: 
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Fee
Attract, retain and 
fairly reward high 
calibre individuals.
Fees are paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s  
annual performance related incentive schemes, share option schemes or pension scheme. 
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The Non-Executive Directors are paid  
a basic fee. Additional fees are paid to Chairmen and members of the main Board Committees and  
to the SID to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees are reviewed by the Board taking into account individual responsibilities, factors such as 
Committee Chairmanships, time commitment, other pay increases being made to employees in  
the Company, and fees payable for the equivalent role in comparable companies. 
Normally fees are reviewed bi-annually and fee increases are generally effective from annual 
re-election after the AGM.
The Board may adjust the fees for an individual Non-Executive Director during the intervening period 
if there is a significant change in their responsibilities and/or time commitments.
Current fee levels are set 
out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Overall fee limit will be 
within the £400,000 limit 
set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
Mr. Yadgaroff, Dr. Whellock and Mr. Atkinson have letters of appointment for an indefinite term, although they may be terminated 
by either party subject to one month’s notice. Mr. Cooke , Mr. Blyth and Mr. Stan were appointed on rolling three-year contracts 
with a one-month notice period and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive Directors appointments will be on similar terms. 
None of the letters of appointment have provisions that relate to a change of control of the Company. 
The details of the Non-Executive Director’s letters of appointment are as follows:
Non-Executive Date of appointment Notice period
M.H. Atkinson February 9, 2006 30 days
W.M. Blyth March 20, 2013 One month

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report
B. Annual bonus for the year ending December 31, 2013
The bonus award for the year under review was based on performance against the value of new royalties achieved, operating profit and 
dividends per share. As in 2012, the value of new royalties acquired during the year fell short of the target. Further, although the dividend was 
maintained, the fall in operating profit and net asset value led the Committee to conclude that no bonus should be paid in respect of 2013.
C. Vesting of long-term incentive awards
Awards granted on May 20, 2010 under the CSOP were subject to a performance condition that the Company’s absolute TSR must 
grow at a rate of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three years from the date of grant. 
This condition was not met and, consequently, no awards vested.
Awards granted on May 19, 2010 under the JSOP were subject to two performance conditions as follows: 
(a)  that the Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price of 315p during the three years from the date of grant; and 
(b)  that the Company’s absolute total shareholder return must grow at a rate of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the  
UK Retail Price Index over the three years from the date of grant. 
Whilst the first condition was met, the second was not and, consequently, no awards vested. 
The following table summarises the awards held by Executive Directors who served during the year and whose performance periods 
ended during the year.

Long-term incentive awards made during the year
There were no awards granted to Executive Directors under either the JSOP or the CSOP in 2013.
Outstanding share awards
There are currently no awards to Executive Directors outstanding under either the JSOP or the CSOP . 
D. Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee encourages the Executive Directors to build up a shareholding in the Company, so as to ensure the alignment of their 
interest with those of shareholders; but there is no formal shareholding guideline. In addition, the proposed new VCP is designed to 
increase this alignment. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company although the 
Chairman and independent Non-Executive Directors are expected to ensure that the level of their shareholding is not significant and 
cannot call into question their continuing independence.
Details of the Directors’ interests in shares are shown in the table below.

The Company makes contributions to employees’ pensions and 
has designated AEGON Scottish Equitable PLC as its stakeholder 
pension provider. The Committee is prepared to pay additional 
basic salary (or fees) in lieu of part or all of a Director’s pension 
contribution.
During 2013, the Company paid additional basic salary (or fees) 
in lieu of pension contribution to Mr. Boycott, Mr. Wides, and 
Mr. Orchard.
F. Loss of office payments
Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard left the Company on October 21, 
2013. Mr. Theobald received his annual salary and pension up to 
November 30, 2013 and Mr. Orchard received his annual salary 
and pension up to October 31, 2013. Under the terms of their 
service agreements, the Company then paid them termination 
payments equivalent to 6 months’ salary and payments in lieu 
of notice as compensation for loss of office as follows:
J. Theobald A.C. Orchard
Termination payment  
(equivalent to six months salary) £95,000 £85,000
Payment in lieu of notice £63,333 £70,833
Total £158,333 £155,833
Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard each also received £2,400 as a 
contribution to legal fees incurred by them in connection with 
their departures.

  This reflects the salary for Mr. Theobald up until October 21, 2013, the date 
Mr. Theobald resigned from the Board and Mr. Treger joined, and the salary 
(on a full-time equivalent basis) for Mr. Treger thereafter.
The table above shows the movement in the salary, benefits and 
annual bonus for the CEO between the current and previous 
financial year compared to that for the average UK employee. 
The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that it 
provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of the 
average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage bill, 
which is distorted by movements in the number of employees. 
For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those 
employees eligible to participate in such schemes.
H. Total shareholder return
The performance of the Company’s ordinary shares compared with the FTSE 350 Mining Index for the five-year period ended on 
December 31, 2013 is shown in the graph above. Both have been rebased at the start of the period in order to provide a graphical 
measure of comparative performance.
The Company has chosen the FTSE 350 Mining Index as a comparator for historical reporting purposes as it believes it to be the 
nearest relevant index appropriate to the Group.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on December 31, 2013 was 184p. During the year the share price ranged from a low  
of 159p to a high of 293p.

M. Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Company’s approach 
to setting Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is with 
reference to market levels in similar companies, levels of 
responsibility and time commitments. A summary of current  
fees is as follows: 
2014 2013 % Increase
Chairman 95,000 N/A
1
n/a
Base fee 36,000 36,000 0%
Senior Independent 
Director 42,000 42,000 0%
Committee Chairman 
or Member 38,000 38,000 0%
1)
 The Chairman during 2013 was an acting Executive Chairman
Up to the end of March 2014, the Chairman was a part-time 
Executive Director post, and the Chairmanship component was 
not separately remunerated. On March 28, 2014, the Company 
announced the appointment of Mr. Blyth as Non-Executive 
Chairman with effect from April 1, 2014. On the recommendation 
of the other members of the Remuneration Committee his fee 
was set at £95,000 per annum for a two-year period having 
regard to the time commitment required (6 days a month) and 
the level of fees in similar companies.
Chairmen and members of the main Board Committees are paid 
an additional amount, currently £2,000 per annum, to reflect 
extra commitments. The SID also receives a further additional 
fee, currently £4,000 per annum, to reflect his extra duties.
N. Performance targets for the annual bonus and LTIP awards  
to be granted in 2014 and beyond
Annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards for 2014 will be 
made in accordance with the new policy, further details of which 
are detailed in the Remuneration Policy Report.
For 2014, annual bonuses will be based on a scorecard of 
performance during the year. The scorecard will set challenging 
targets for triggering bonus, and for rewarding outperformance 
on a sliding scale. The scorecard will be split on a 60/40 basis 
between corporate objectives and personal objectives.  
Corporate objectives for 2014 will cover areas such as business 
performance, finance, relationships and reputation. 
The Committee has chosen not to disclose the performance 
targets for the forthcoming year in advance as these include 
items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. 
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against 
them will be provided in next year’s Annual Remuneration 
Report.
Long-term incentive awards for 2014 will be made under a  
new one-off VCP (subject to approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM) with a five-year performance period from the 
date of grant (i.e. to mid-2019). No value accrues under the VCP 
to its participants unless growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
performance period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum  
(or approximately 40% total growth over the period).

‘plans’, ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘seeks’, ‘intends’, ‘targets’, 
‘projects’, ‘forecasts’, or negative versions thereof and other 
similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as 
‘may’, ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘would’ and ‘could’. Forward-looking 
statements are based upon certain material factors that were 
applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or 
projection, including assumptions and analyses made by the 
Group in light of its experience and perception of historical  
trends, current conditions and expected future developments,  
as well as other factors that are believed to be appropriate in  
the circumstances. The material factors and assumptions upon 
which such forward-looking statements are based include: the 
stability of the global economy; the stability of local governments 
and legislative background; the relative stability of interest rates; 
the equity and debt markets continuing to provide access to 
capital; the continuing of ongoing operations of the properties 
underlying the Group’s portfolio of royalties by the owners or 
operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past 
practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures 
(including feasibility studies, estimates of reserve, resource, 
production, grades, mine life and cash cost) made by the owners 
or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse 
change in the price of the commodities underlying the Group’s 
portfolio of royalties and investments; no material adverse 
change in foreign exchange exposure; no adverse development 
in respect of any significant property in which the Group holds 
a royalty or other interest, including but not limited to unusual 
or unexpected geological formations and natural disasters; 
successful completion of new development projects; planned 
expansions or additional projects being within the timelines 
anticipated and at anticipated production levels; and maintenance 
of mining title. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees  
of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those anticipated, estimated or intended in the forward-
looking statements.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 58
APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7 Report of the independent auditor  
to the members of Anglo Pacific Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Anglo Pacific Group 
PLC for the year ended December 31, 2013 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated and company balance 
sheets, the consolidated and company statements of changes 
in equity, the consolidated and company cash flow statements 
and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on  page 58, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Auditor commentary
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit scope included a full audit of the consolidated 
and parent company financial statements of Anglo Pacific 
Group PLC. The Group is currently organised into three principal 
operating divisions operating in Australia, the Americas and 
Europe. The Group financial statements are a consolidation 
of 25 subsidiaries comprising the Group’s operating businesses 
within these divisions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or 
component auditors operating under our instruction. Where 
the work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work 
at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
The reporting units vary significantly in size and we identified 
19 subsidiaries that, in our view, due to their size or risk 
characteristics required a complete audit of their financial 
information, providing 98% coverage of the Group’s total assets. 
Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions 
were performed at a further three reporting units, with the 
remaining reporting units subject to analytical procedures.
Our audit approach was based on a thorough understanding 
of the Group’s business and is risk-based. The audit approach 
included obtaining an understanding of and evaluating the 
Group’s internal controls over key financial systems identified as 
part of our risk assessment, reviewed the accounts production 
process and addressed critical accounting matters. We 
undertook substantive testing on significant transactions, 
balances and disclosures, the extent of which was based on 
various factors such as our overall assessment of the control 
environment, the effectiveness of controls over individual 
systems and the management of specific risk. 
Our audit approach included the use of the work of an auditor’s 
expert to assist with the audit. We used the work of a mining 
valuations specialist to assist in the audit of investment 
valuations, in particular challenging the reasonableness of both 
the valuation models used and the key assumptions made. 
We have evaluated the adequacy of the work of this expert  
in respect of our audit.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
our audit, in evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements 
and in forming our opinion. For the purpose of determining 
whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of a 
misstatement or an omission from the financial statements 
or related disclosures that would make it probable that the 
judgement of a reasonable person relying on the information 
would have been changed or influenced by the misstatement 
or omission. For the Group audit, we established materiality for 
the Group financial statements as a whole to be £2.6 million, 
which is 1% of total assets. For the financial information of the 
individual subsidiary undertakings, we set our materiality based 
on a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative 
scale of each of the subsidiary undertakings.
We have determined the threshold at which we communicate 
misstatements to the Audit Committee to be £0.1 million. In 
addition, we communicate misstatements below that threshold 
that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
Our assessment of risk
Without modifying our opinion, we highlight the following 
matters that are, in our judgement, likely to be most important 
to users’ understanding of our audit. Our audit procedures 
relating to these matters were designed in the context of our 
audit of the Group financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual transactions, account balances 
or disclosures.
Financial Reporting Council review
In June 2013 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued a 
letter to the Company requesting additional information and 
explanation regarding the accounting treatment of the thresholds 
applied for significant or prolonged for impairment of financial 
instruments, the classification of certain royalty instruments and 
the treatment of available for sale instruments. As a result of the 
FRC’s review, the Directors reconsidered the application of

impairment review in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial 
instruments: Recognition and measurement’. Impairment 
reviews and calculations performed by management are highly 
judgemental. We therefore identified the impairment review 
as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, an 
assessment of the policy for determining when an instrument 
was impaired and determined that the Group had recorded 
any such impairment when the carrying value of any individual 
investment exceeded its fair market value. We also evaluated 
and challenged the significant inputs and assumptions used in 
management’s discounted cash flow analyses that supported 
the carrying values of these investments, including corroboration 
of those inputs to publicly available data. The Group’s accounting 
policies are outlined in note 2 and relevant disclosures included 
in notes 15, 16 and 17.
Management override of financial controls
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), for all our audits we are required to 
consider the risk of management override of financial controls. 
Due to the unpredictable nature of this risk we are required to 
assess it as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, specific 
procedures relating to this risk as required by ISA 240 ‘The 
auditor’s responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit of financial 
statements’. This included tests of journal entries, the evaluation 
of judgements and assumptions in management’s estimates 
and tests of significant transactions outside the normal course 
of business.
In particular, our work on fair value calculations and impairment 
reviews addressed key aspects of ISA 240.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
December 31, 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS regulation.
Other reporting responsibilities
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006;
• the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
certain accounting policies in the preparation of the financial 
statements. We therefore identified the FRC’s review into 
certain accounting treatments as a risk requiring special 
audit consideration. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, understanding 
management’s existing and revised accounting policies in 
respect of the items listed above, and challenging management’s 
judgements and assumptions. Further detail on our audit 
response is reflected in the reported audit risks; Classification 
of royalty instruments; Valuation of royalty instruments and 
Impairment review, below. The Group has revised certain 
accounting policies and made prior year adjustments as disclosed 
in note 2.1.4. 
Classification of royalty instruments
The Group has significant investments in royalty instruments that 
are accounted for based on contractual provisions in accordance 
with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’, IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement’ or IAS 40 ‘Investment property’. 
The process applied in determining the proper classification of 
each instrument is highly judgemental. We therefore identified 
this activity as a significant risk requiring special audit 
consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, an evaluation 
of the methodology by which the Directors determine the proper 
classification for each instrument. We compared management’s 
assessment of the instruments to the relevant accounting 
standards and challenged management’s assumptions on 
the contractual provisions of the royalty instruments. We also 
reviewed management’s use of a third party expert, with 
specialist skills, on the classification of these instruments. 
The Group’s accounting policies are outlined in note 2 and 
relevant disclosures included in notes 15, 16 and 17.
Valuation of royalty instruments
The Group has significant investments in royalty instruments. 
The determination of fair value of these instruments in 
accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition  
and measurement’ or IAS 40 ‘Investment property’, involves 
significant management judgement. We therefore identified  
the fair valuation of the royalty instruments as a significant risk 
requiring special audit consideration. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, understanding 
the controls put in place over the calculation of fair value of the 
instruments. We examined and assessed the appropriateness 
of the models used for the fair value, challenging management’s 
key assumptions and the underlying forecasts. This included 
using the work of our valuations specialist in respect of the 
reasonableness of the models and inputs used. The Group’s 
accounting policies are outlined in note 2 and relevant disclosures 
included in notes 15, 16 and 17.
Impairment review
The Group has significant investments in royalty instruments 
and mining and exploration interests accounted for under various 
accounting standards based on their classification. In accordance 
with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, non-financial assets are 
subject to an impairment test when there is an indication that 
an asset may be impaired. Financial assets are subject to

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that were communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
In accordance with the requirement contained in National 
Instrument 52-107 we report below on the compatibility 
of Canadian Generally Accepted Auditing Standards 
(‘Canadian GAAS’) and International Standard on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (ISAs).
We conducted our audits of the Group’s financial statements for 
each of the two years ended December 31, 2013 in accordance 
with ISAs. If we had been required to conduct the audits of the 
Group’s financial statements for each of the two years ended 
December 31, 2013 in accordance with Canadian GAAS there 
would have been no material differences in the form or content 
of our audit reports.
Furthermore an auditors’ report prepared in accordance  
with reporting standards under Canadian GAAS on the 
aforementioned consolidated financial statements would  
not contain a qualification.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2013
1 General information
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’) secure natural resources royalties by acquisition 
and through investment in mining and exploration interests. The Group has royalties and investments in mining and exploration 
interests primarily in Australia, North and South America and Africa, with a diversified exposure to commodities that is strongly 
represented by coal, iron ore, gold and uranium.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange and 
incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ, United 
Kingdom (registered number: 897608).
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Anglo Pacific Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of coal royalties (investment property), available-for-sale financial assets, and financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are 
disclosed in note 4.
2.1.1 Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing the Group’s forecasts and projections, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
2.1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after January 1, 2013 
and have a material impact on the Group:
• Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income
The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive 
income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). 
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’
Changes in relation to this standard relate to certain disclosures in the fair value hierarchy tables in note 3. This has no impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 
January 1, 2013 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for annual periods beginning after 
January 1, 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have  
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – effective date pending
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those 
measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification 
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where 
the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other 
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 9’s full impact. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the International 
Accountings Standards Board.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on  
the Group.

2.1.3 Financial Reporting Council
The Conduct Committee of the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) wrote to the Group during 2013 requesting information and 
explanations about a number of accounting and disclosure matters relating to the Group’s 2012 Annual Report and Accounts as part  
of their annual review of financial statements in the public domain. 
The matters included: coking coal royalties (Kestrel), royalty interests (currently accounted under IAS 38), royalty instruments (currently 
accounted for under IAS 39) and the impairment policy with respect to its mining and exploration interests. Other than Kestrel, which 
has been restated as an investment property in accordance with IAS 40, correspondence with the FRC is ongoing with respect to the 
remaining areas. 
The Group sought external professional accountancy advice in relation to some of these matters. Once the advice has been shared 
with the FRC the Group acknowledges that the FRC will need to consider this separately, and that further changes are still possible. 
Until this process has been concluded, the following is a summary of the matters resolved and those still open.
The Group acknowledged that the coal resources in the Kestrel land are not used in the production or supply of goods and services  
and concluded that it could be inappropriate to treat them as in the scope of IAS 16 without recognising depreciation. The Group is  
now applying IAS 40, Investment Property to the land at Kestrel. The effect is that the valuation movements are now reflected in  
the income statement below operating profit, rather than in other comprehensive income. The balance sheet value is unchanged. 
The following three matters remain open:
Royalty interests – intangibles 
The FRC noted that the Group applied IAS 38 to some of its royalties (Royalty interests – intangibles) and IAS 39 to others (Royalty 
instruments). The FRC has asked why IAS 39 is not relevant to all royalty assets.
The Group’s accounting policy in relation to Intangible Assets is set out in note 2.7(b).
Royalty instruments – financial assets
The FRC has questioned whether the financial asset accounting complies with the requirements for available for sale assets in  
IAS 39 and specifically whether the Group believes these assets to be either IAS 39 available for sale debt or equity instruments. 
Impairment of mining and exploration interests 
The FRC sought information on the criteria applied by the Group in considering whether a decline in the value of its equity instruments 
was significant or prolonged. Such a decline requires previous reductions in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income to  
be recognised as impairment charges in the income statement. 
The Group acknowledges that, although it has restated its prior year numbers to recognise a change in accounting policy in respect  
of impairment, it has yet to agree the criteria with the FRC.
Possible impact on the Group’s financial statements
Applying the IAS 39 definition of available for sale financial asset to the Group’s intangible and financial assets would significantly alter 
the presentation of the Group’s financial statements. At present, the Group’s royalty intangibles are carried at cost. An impairment 
review determines whether this amount is recoverable through future cash flows. Accounting for these intangibles in accordance with 
IAS 39 would require these assets to be carried at fair value, with interest income recorded at an effective interest rate recognised in 
the income statement when considered a debt instrument.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 70 2.1.4 Prior period adjustment
As mentioned in note 2.1.3 above, the Group has made certain accounting policy changes at December 31, 2013. The reasons for 
these changes along with the impact of the changes on what was reported in 2012 are discussed below. There is no impact on the 
previously reported net asset values.
(a) Coal royalties
The Group’s entitlement to its coking coal royalty is a function of its freehold ownership of certain sub-stratum lands in Queensland, 
Australia. The Group previously accounted for this asset as land in accordance with IAS 16 and adopted the revaluation method of 
subsequent measurement. It did not, previously, depreciate this land. The Group acknowledges that there are instances whereby  
it would be appropriate to depreciate land. The Group has decided to change its accounting policy and account for Kestrel as an 
investment property in accordance with IAS 40. An investment property is defined in IAS 40 as ‘property held to earn rentals or for 
capital appreciation’. The royalty income earned from owning the land is akin to rental income and, as such, IAS 40 is now considered  
a more appropriate accounting standard to adopt.
Previously under IAS 16 the revaluation movement and deferred tax was recognised in the revaluation reserve. Going forward, this  
will be reflected in the income statement. The balance sheet value will be the same as would have been derived under IAS 16.
(b) Royalty instruments
Following a thorough review of its royalty instruments during the year, the Group has determined that it has two different types  
of financial asset, debt and equity, in accordance with IAS 39. These are categorised as available for sale financial assets and the 
accounting treatment is discussed in further detail in note 2.9(e).
(i) EVBC
The Group’s EVBC debenture instrument falls under the classification of an equity financial asset as it differs from other debt assets in 
that there is no stipulated interest rate, maturity or minimum payment terms. As such, all receipts from this royalty represent a return 
on investment and are presented in the income statement. Previously, royalty receipts offset the principal balance. Going forward, all 
receipts will be reflected in the income statement. The value of the royalty on the balance sheet remains unchanged as this is carried  
at fair value at each reporting date.
(ii) Jogjakarta
The Group’s remaining instrument, Jogjakarta, is recognised as a debt financial asset as it displays certain characteristics which are 
more similar to financing agreements such as interest rates and minimum payments. Although there is a contracted interest rate of 
8%, the Group recognises that it should have applied an effective interest rate to the future expected cashflows. Although the valuation 
remains unchanged, a portion of this should be recognised as interest, the remainder as the valuation movement. Previously, the entire 
valuation was recognised in other comprehensive income. In accordance with IAS 39, any subsequent valuation movement caused by 
changes to the estimated future cash profiles (and not to do with changes to the effective interest rate) should be recognised in the 
income statement. This has retrospectively been applied in the current financial statements and will form the basis for accounting 
going forward.
(c) Isua
The Group’s Isua royalty was previously accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangibles’ and is now accounted for as an available 
for sale debt instrument in accordance with IAS 39. The Group is entitled to receive its initial investment back should the operator fail  
to achieve commercial production by a predefined date. This right to receive cash is considered to fall within the definition of an IAS 39 
financial asset. Similar to Jogjakarta, the Group will apply an effective interest rate where material. The royalty is still carried at cost as 
this does not materially differ to its fair value. Should this become material, an effective interest rate will be recognised in the income 
statement along with any associated valuation movement.
(d) Impairment of mining and exploration interests (held at fair value)
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held at fair value at each reporting date. Any unrealised loss (or gain) is reflected in  
the revaluation reserve up to the point when the absolute unrealised loss is considered ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ in accordance with 
IAS 39 at which point these investments would be deemed impaired and the losses transferred to retained earnings via the income 
statement.
The Group recognised an impairment charge during the year as it considered that the unrealised losses in its mining and exploration 
interests were significant in the context of the Group’s impairment policy and IAS 39. This policy is explained further in note 2.9(d). 
One of the considerations is the relative decline in value of the portfolio compared to relevant industry indices, which by definition 
changes at each reporting date.
As the equities are always carried on the balance sheet in accordance with market price, the change in the trigger point for assessing 
impairment does not alter the balance sheet value. This is, therefore, not deemed a change in estimate. By default, IAS 8 implies that 
this must be a change in accounting policy and therefore requires a retrospective assessment. Had the Group’s impairment thresholds 
not changed, an impairment charge of £58.8m would have been recognised in 2013.

2.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from  
the date that control ceases.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for in the parent company at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes  
in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.3 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the Group’s operating 
segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee which makes the strategic decisions for the Group.
2.4 Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction (not retranslated). Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured  
at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency  
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
(c)  all resulting exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation 
reserve in equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When a foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are reclassified in the income statement as part of the gain  
or loss on sale.
2.5 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of 
property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location  
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Once a mining project has been 
established as commercially viable, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under ‘Producing 
assets’ together with any amount transferred from ‘Exploration and evaluation costs’ (note 2.7(a)).
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter. The major categories 
of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production and/or straight line basis as follows:
Producing assets  Units of production
Coal tenures   Units of production
Fixtures and equipment  4 to 10 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 74 2.6 Coal royalties (investment property)
The Group owns a royalty entitlement to the output from the Kestrel and Crinum underground mines in Queensland, Australia, 
excluding the output from Crown areas by virtue of its ownership of the sub-stratum land, including the right to the minerals contained 
within. The Group holds this land in order to earn a return which is based on the royalty income received from mining activity carried 
out within the land. The Group accounts for this land (and royalty) as an investment property in accordance with IAS 40 carrying it at  
fair value at each reporting date. The coal royalties are valued at fair value based on future discounted royalty cash flows receivable  
as calculated on a quarterly basis by an independent external consultant (see note 15 for further details). Management consider the 
valuation on a quarterly basis for any indications of possible impairment considering factors such as pricing and production forecasts.
Any movement in the valuation of the royalties is recognised in the income statement.
2.7 Intangibles
(a) Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to:
• researching and analysing exploration data;
• conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;
• examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or
• compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies.
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed 
assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential.
Expenditure on exploration and evaluation activities is capitalised when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability  
and hence it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. Amortisation of capitalised exploration and evaluation 
costs does not commence until the underlying project commences commercial production.
The carrying values of capitalised amounts are reviewed twice per annum by management and the results of these reviews are 
reported to the Audit Committee. In the case of undeveloped projects there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for the 
impairment review. The review is based on a status report regarding the Group’s intentions for development of the undeveloped 
project.
Subsequent recovery of the resulting carrying value depends on successful development or sale of the undeveloped project. If a 
project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any related impairment provisions are written  
off to the income statement. For developments that are considered viable and move to commercial production, these are transferred  
to producing assets.
(b) Royalty interests
Royalty interests represent the net smelter return royalties acquired on the Four Mile project in South Australia, the Salamanca uranium 
project in Spain, the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects in Northern Ontario, Canada and a number of tenements 
in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada, together with the gross revenue royalties covering the Amapá iron ore system in Brazil, the 
Mount Ida magnetite iron ore project in Western Australia and three exploration licences, including the Railway iron ore deposit, in the 
central Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Most of the royalties listed above have been pre-existing royalties acquired by the Group. These royalties mainly exist by way of the 
sale of land or certain prospecting rights, with the retention of a royalty for any future discoveries of economically viable resources. 
Upon acquisition, the Group effectively assumes the position of the original holder, who will usually have had an interest in the 
underlying mineral at some point. These royalties should survive any change in ownership of the asset or bankruptcy of the operator.
These royalties, although entitling the Group to cash upon the commencement of production, are not considered to fall within the 
definition of financial assets in accordance with IAS 39. The Group considers, amongst the characteristics listed in the above 
paragraph, that they do not contain an absolute right to receive cash as the Group cannot force the operator to produce and, 
furthermore, the counterparty can avoid the payment of cash by deciding not to produce. This is in contrast to the Group’s royalty 
interests structured as financing arrangements.
The Group does not own the physical rights to the minerals contained within these deposits. The royalties receivable from the interests 
held are derived from the rights attached to the underlying mineral resources. In line with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ these royalties are 
recognised at cost. 
The useful life of the royalty interests will be determined by reference to planned mine life on commencement of mining and the cost 
of the royalty contract will be amortised on a systematic basis over the life of the mine. Amortisation rates are adjusted on a 
prospective basis for all changes to estimates of the life of mine.

for the year ended December 31, 2013
2.8 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date and the assessment includes variables such as the production 
profiles, commodity prices and management representations.
The Group changed its method of assessing impairment during the year. Although the value in use is still assessed based on 
discounted net present value of expected future cash flows, using a narrow range of discount rates of between 7 and 10%, the 
outcome of this calculation is then risk weighted to reflect management’s current assessment of the overall likelihood of each project 
coming into production and royalty income arising. This assessment is impacted by news flow relating to the royalty in the period, in 
conjunction with management’s assessment of the economic viability of the project based on commodity price projections. This is a 
change in the basis of estimation, had the method been applied previously, it would not have resulted in an impairment charge in prior 
years. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of fair value less costs to sell or value-in-use. 
Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
2.9 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments  
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
On initial recognition loans and receivables are stated at their fair value. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
The Group’s trade and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received 
that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in 
groups, which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available features of shared credit  
risk characteristics. The percentage of the write down is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified 
group. Impairment of trade receivables are presented within ‘other losses’.
(c) Mining and exploration interests
Mining and exploration interests are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Mining and exploration interests are classified upon initial recognition as either available-for-sale or as assets at fair value through profit 
or loss, depending on the characteristics of the particular instrument and its purpose.
Interests classified as available-for-sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at their fair value. For available-for-sale 
investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit or loss for the period. Unquoted 
investments are measured at cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. When a market price can be established these 
investments are revalued to fair value accordingly. 
For those mining and exploration interests which contain an embedded convertible option, these embedded derivatives are separated 
and recognised at fair value through profit or loss with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised directly in 
the income statement. The fair values of such instruments are assessed with reference to the relevant factors, which include, inter alia, 
equity prices in active markets, commodity prices, production profiles and management representations. These assets are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that the initial classification remains correct given the asset characteristics and the Group’s investment policies. 
These assets may be initially recognised using transaction price as the best evidence of fair value at acquisition (see note 18). Options 
can be carried at cost if they are linked to unquoted equities where fair value cannot be reliably measured.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 76 (d) Impairment of mining and exploration interests
All mining and exploration interests held as available for sale are assessed for impairment at least at each reporting date. The Directors 
initially compare any absolute decline in the value of the portfolio compared to the decline in relevant junior mining indices for an 
indication of underperformance against the wider industry. If underperformance exists, the Directors then consider the absolute 
decline in value for each instrument and this assessment includes variables such as the progress made by the operator in the period to 
advance its project towards development, the instrument’s valuation in active markets, the quality of the Company’s underlying assets 
as well as any potential for economic mineral development within the relevant company’s licences. 
Impairment charges arise when the outcome of this assessment indicates a ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ fall in value of the interest in 
accordance with IAS 39. IAS 39 requires the Directors to use judgement in order to define the parameters of ‘significant’ and ‘prolonged’ 
and there is little available guidance as to what has become best practice. The Directors have been of the view that higher tolerance can 
be accepted in relation to junior mining instruments, one of the most volatile sectors over the last number of years. The Directors have 
considerable experience of investing in this sector, over many economic cycles when commodities have both out and underperformed. 
At December 31, 2012 the Group’s mining and exploration interests when taken as a whole were 43% below cost. The Executive 
Directors, and the Audit Committee, did not consider this to be ‘significant’ in the context of investments in the junior mining sector, 
and these declines were not out of line with what similar companies were experiencing. At this point, a decline in value of 60% would 
have been considered ‘significant’. The further decline in value during 2013 resulted in the absolute decline being considered ‘significant’.
In addition to being ‘significant’, an impairment charge must be made if the decline in value is considered ‘prolonged’, regardless of 
how ‘significant’ the decline is. Again, the Directors have used their considerable experience in order to determine what period of 
decline would be considered ‘prolonged’ in the context of investing in the junior mining sector. The ultimate value of the equity is likely 
to be achieved once the underlying project achieves commercial production. As long as the operator is advancing the project towards 
production, then the Directors tolerate a longer timeframe. This is usually between three to five years, the time in which an operator 
should have made sufficient progress with their operations.
Regardless of the judgment exercised by the Directors in defining ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’, the net assets of the Group remain 
unchanged as the equities are carried at fair value at each reporting date. The point at which an impairment charge is made does  
not impact net assets as the unrealised loss in the investment revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings via the income 
statement, and interest will only be recognised at the discount rate used to measure the impairment, unless the asset has been  
fully impaired. 
This is one area which remains subject to review by the FRC, particularly the Group’s definitions of ‘significant’ and ‘prolonged’.
(e) Royalty instruments
Royalty instruments are recognised or derecognised on completion date where a purchase or sale of the royalty is under a contract, 
and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Royalty instruments give the Group a right to future cash flows and are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance 
with IAS 39. These royalties are different to the Group’s intangible royalties as there is a means to securing future cash flows 
irrespective of the success of the underlying project. Royalty instruments are classified as either debt or equity instruments depending 
on the nature of the individual agreement. Considerations such as contractual interest rates, defined repayment terms and the means 
to recover initial investment distinguish whether the financial asset is debt or equity. Some royalty contracts include clauses relating to 
the possibility of conversion to equity in the Company granting the royalty. These clauses are treated as embedded derivatives and are 
classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Similar to the Group’s royalty intangibles, these assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. For equity financial assets 
any cumulative loss previously recognised in equity is reclassified in the income statement for the period. For debt financial assets the 
impairment charge reverses previous gains reflected in the income statement and no further effective interest will be recognised.

APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2013
(i) EVBC
The Group’s royalty instrument relating to the EVBC royalty has been classified as an equity financial asset as it does not have a contracted 
interest rate, there is no contractual requirement to develop the mine, there are no predefined repayment terms, there is no maturity date 
(the royalty continues into perpetuity) and the ultimate flow of cash is wholly dependent on the success of the project which then 
determines royalty payments. The return is related to performance which is a riskier type of return involving more than just credit risk.
The substance of the royalty is similar to that of an ordinary equity instrument as ultimately both can only be of value if the project is 
successful. Any income received represents a return on investment and is recognised in the income statement. The asset is carried at 
fair value, determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows. The discount rate applied is 9% reflecting the nature of the 
asset, quality of resource, track record and the experience of management. The change in estimated future cash flows is determined 
by reference to the guidance published by the operator, which is considered non-observable market data. Any valuation movement is 
recognised in the investment revaluation reserve, other than a significant or prolonged fall in value in fair value below cost, which would 
be accounted for as an impairment.
(ii) Jogjakarta
Jogjakarta is considered to be an available for sale debt financial asset in accordance with IAS 39. The key differential in respect to this 
royalty instrument is the right to receive cash and the ability to enforce this. Furthermore, Jogjakarta has a contracted interest rate of 
8% p.a payable quarterly along with predefined contracted minimum payments which the operator must make, regardless of what the 
royalty equivalent would be.
At initial recognition an effective interest rate is computed based on the estimated future cash flows. Expected future cash flows  
are based on non-observable market data, generally management’s latest expectation of future royalty income determined based  
on commodity price forecast and estimated production profiles. The difference between this value and cost is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The effective interest is recognised in the income statement in each period. Any subsequent valuation 
movement caused by changes to the effective interest rate is recognised in other comprehensive income. Valuation movements 
caused by changes to expected future cash flows are recognised in the income statement. 
The recognition of effective interest rate is recorded in the income statement during the period in which the income is earned.  
The cash receipt of interest would reduce the carrying value of the asset as it is received.
The asset is carried on the balance sheet at fair value, based on a risk weighted net present value of future cash flows at each reporting 
date. The risk assessment takes into account the probability of the mine coming into production.
The Jogjakarta royalty contains an embedded derivative. This derivative is separated and measured as an asset at fair value through 
profit or loss with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in the income statement. The fair values of 
such derivatives are assessed with reference to the relevant factors, which include, inter alia, equity prices in active markets, 
production profiles, commodity prices and management representations. These assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the initial 
classification remains correct given the asset characteristics and the Group’s investment policies. These assets may be initially 
recognised using transaction price as the best evidence of fair value at acquisition; however, embedded derivatives are valued at 
acquisition and are recognised separately from the host royalty instrument (see note 16).
(iii) Isua
Isua, although displaying very similar characteristics to the Group’s royalty intangibles, allows for the full recovery of the initial investment 
subject to various predefined milestones prior to the commencement of commercial production. The key remaining milestone is that 
production has to be achieved by June 20, 2017. Should this not be achieved, the Group has the right to demand full repayment of 
monies advanced. The operator has the option to settle this by either cash or equivalent equity. If production is achieved, the right  
to recover the initial investment ceases to be available to the Group and royalty payments are receivable over the life of the mine. 
The mechanism to recover the initial investment is considered to be a contractual right to receive cash and falls within the definition  
of an available for sale debt like financial asset as there is a predefined ‘maturity’. Although there is no contractual interest rate, IAS 39 
requires an effective interest rate to be calculated and recognised in the income statement when material. As this is a non-cash measure 
in relation to assets with varying risk profiles, the Group only applies this interest rate when material.
The fair value of Isua is calculated based on the discounted expectation of the receipt in 2017 of the original funds invested discounted 
by reference to the effective interest rate calculated. The difference between this value and cost has been determined to be immaterial 
and as such the asset is carried at cost. Any expected future changes in value caused by revisions to future cash flow will be 
recognised in the income statement along with any effective interest rate.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 78 (f) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
(g) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition. After initial recognition these are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(h) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
2.10 Current and deferred income tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity,  
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2.11 Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options and jointly-owned shares) of the Company. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions;
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are expected to 
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are 
to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and jointly-owned shares 
that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as  
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
2.12 Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares in issue.
• ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue.
• ‘Investment revaluation reserve’ represents gains and losses due to the revaluation of the investments in mining and exploration 
interests and royalty instruments from the opening carrying values, including the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
• ‘Share-based payment reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
• ‘Foreign currency reserve’ represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
• ‘Special reserve’ represents the level of profit attributable to the Group for the period ended June 30, 2002 which was created as part 
of a capital reduction performed in 2002.
• ‘Investment in own shares’ represents the shares held by the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust for awards made under the 
Joint Share Ownership Plan (‘ JSOP’) (note 25).
• ‘Retained earnings’ represents retained profits.
2.13 Revenue recognition
The revenue of the Group comprises mainly royalty related income. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. The royalty income becomes receivable on extraction and sale of the relevant minerals, at which point the revenue is 
recognised.
Disposals of mining and exploration interests are disclosed net of any commissions and foreign exchange.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the carrying value and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
2.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are not transferred to the lessee 
are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
2.15 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
3 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal treasury objective is to provide sufficient liquidity to meet operational cash flow and dividend requirements and to 
allow the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value. The Group’s activities expose it 
to a variety of financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk. The Group operates 
controlled treasury policies which are monitored by management to ensure that the needs of the Group are met while minimising 
potential adverse effects of unpredictability of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance.
Liquidity and funding risk
The objective of the Company in managing funding risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. 
At the year end there was no debt outstanding and the Company, with its strong balance sheet, had good access to capital markets, if 
required. The addition of a twelve-month US$15m revolving credit facility signed in February 2014 adds further flexibility and liquidity  
to the Group’s cash balances.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 80 Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables  
and investments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, including royalty receivables. It is the policy of the Group to 
present the amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
prior experience and the current economic environment. Where possible the Group has registered its interests against the relevant 
mining titles for the royalties it has acquired. In addition, the Group is generally entitled to full reconciliations of amounts paid and retains 
the right to audit the royalty returns and verify the calculations.
The Group’s credit risk on royalty instruments held as financial instruments, has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure  
is as disclosed in note 16 where the future contractual right to cash flow from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies and 
counterparties.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated  
in foreign currencies. As each material commitment is made, the risk in relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Executive 
Committee and regularly reviewed. The Group does not consider it necessary to have a hedging programme in place at this time.
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into Pound Sterling at the closing rate, are as follows:

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties. If  
the interest rates the Group received had increased by 1% during the year, the net result for the year would have been increased by 
£95,000 (2012: £537,000). If the interest rates the Group received had decreased by 1% during the year, the net result for the year 
would have been reduced by £95,000 (2012: £387,000). There would have been no impact on equity. Going forward, the Group is 
exposed to interest rate risk on any portion of its revolving credit facility which is drawn.

Other price risk
The Group is exposed to other price risk in respect of its mining and exploration interests which include listed and unlisted equity 
securities and any convertible instruments.
A sensitivity analysis based on a 49% increase or decrease in listed equity prices has been performed (2012: 30%). If the quoted stock 
price for these securities had increased or decreased by this percentage the net result for the year would have been increased/reduced 
by £2.6m (2012: £5.8m). Equity would have changed by £7.8m (2012: £15.4m).
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the prices of coking 
coal, iron ore, gold and uranium. As the Directors obtain independent commodity price forecasts, the generation of which takes into 
account fluctuations in prices, no detailed analysis of the impact of fluctuations on the valuations of the royalties has been undertaken.
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, 
strategic investments. This strategy is unaffected by recent fluctuations in prices for mining and exploration equities; however, interests 
are continually monitored for indicators that may suggest problems for these companies raising capital or continuing their day-to-day 
business activities to ensure remedial action can be taken if necessary.
No specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these interests and the voting rights arising from these equity instruments 
are utilised in the Group’s favour.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 82 Capital management and procedures 
The Group’s capital management objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to increase the value of the assets of the Group and to enhance shareholder value in the Company and returns to shareholders.
The achievement of these objectives is undertaken by managing the Group’s existing portfolio of royalty interests together with its 
investments mining and exploration interests and indentifying new royalty opportunities. During the year the Group advanced US$10m 
under an existing royalty financing agreement which is expected to yield royalty revenue in the future. In addition, the Group realised 
£5.3m in cash from the sale of certain mining and exploration interests where royalty opportunities were no longer identifiable.
Subsequent to year end, the Group entered into a US$15m unsecured twelve-month revolving credit facility, which in addition  
to the Group’s current cash balances, provides further means to finance future royalty acquisitions. 
The Directors continue to monitor the capital requirements of the Group by reference to expected future cash flows. Capital for  
the reporting periods under review is summarised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The optimal capital structure for the Group is to have no long-term structured debt, unless the income profile of the Group were  
to change significantly. The Group is currently achieving this objective.

Fair value hierarchy
The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with the fair value 
hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring 
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input  
to the fair value measurement.
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2013, December 31,

There have been no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 in the reporting period.
The methods and valuation techniques used for the purposes of measuring fair value altered slightly compared to the previous 
reporting period. The Group gives more prominence to the probability of production by applying a risk weighting to the discounted net 
present value outcome in order to fully reflect the risk that the operation never comes into production. Previously, this risk was factored 
into the discount rate applied to the future cash flow.
(a) Coal royalties (Investment property)
The Group’s coal royalties derive from its ownership of certain sub-stratum land in Queensland, Australia. In accordance with IAS 40, 
this land is revalued at each reporting date on the basis of future expected income discounted at 7% by an independent valuation 
consultant. See note 15 for further details. All unobservable inputs are obtained from third parties.
(b) Royalty instruments
The Group’s royalty instruments have been classified as available for sale, with value on initial recognition being calculated as the total 
cost of the agreement less the valuation of the option to convert to shares. At the reporting date the royalty streams have been valued 
on the net present value of the pre-tax cash flows discounted at a rate management considers reflects the risk associated with each of 
the underlying projects. The outcome is then risk weighted to reflect the likelihood of the project achieving production based on any 
published updates in the year. Note 16 details the discount rates used. This is the only unobservable input determined by management. 
All other unobservable inputs are obtained from third parties.
The option to convert to shares has been treated as fair value through profit or loss as designated on initial recognition at the date of 
acquisition and has been valued at December 31, 2013 utilising an option model. The key assumptions, in addition to those utilised in 
the royalty stream valuations such as mine life and expected cash flows, include the price, volatility of the projects listed equity and 
where applicable the conversion price and redemption value of redeemable shares.
(c) Mining and exploration interests – quoted
All the quoted mining and exploration interests have been issued by publicly traded companies in Australia, Canada, the UK and 
Norway. Fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
(d) Mining and exploration interests – unquoted
All the unquoted mining and exploration interests are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. 
The Group notes any trading activity in the unquoted instruments and will value its holding accordingly. At present the Group holds 
these investments with a view to generating future royalties and there is no present intention to sell. The vast majority of these are  
in investments which the Group anticipates a realistic possibility of a future listing.
(e) Mining and exploration interests – royalty options
All the royalty options are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. The Group considers the 
progress of the projects related to each of the royalty options to ensure there has been no material change in the fair value since initial 
recognition.

There have been no transfers into or out of Level 3 in any of the years.
The Group measures its entitlement to the royalty income and any optionality embedded within the royalty instruments using 
discounted cash flow models. In determining the discount rate to be applied, management considers the country and sovereign risk 
associated with the projects, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects 
of a similar nature.
Management has not undertaken detailed analysis of the impact of using alternative discount rates on the fair value of the royalty 
streams or the optionality embedded in the royalty instruments, as the risk weighting applied to the discounted present value of 
expected future cashflows more than offsets any valuation downside by applying higher discount rates.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations  
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below:
(a)  Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals – note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 2.9, note 15, note 16, 
note 17 and note 18.
(b)  Recoverability of deferred tax assets – note 2.10 and note 22. The calculation of deferred tax for investment property is on  
a continuing use basis rather than sale.

APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 86 4.2 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are:
(a)  Classification of mining and exploration interests – note 2.9 and note 18.
(b)  Classification of royalty instruments and royalty interests.
  The Directors review each royalty acquired to determine whether there is a contractual right to receive cash which would meet  
the definition of a financial asset, or if the royalty receivable for the interest acquired is derived from the rights attached to the 
underlying asset/mineral resource. In the latter case these are treated as an intangible asset – note 2.7(b) and note 17. 
 Key differing characteristics between intangible and financial assets
 (i) Primary or secondary royalties
   Generally speaking, any secondary royalties which the Group acquires are likely to be intangible assets which have historically 
originated from the sale of land to a developer whilst the seller has retained an interest to benefit from any reserve expansion. 
The Group, in this instance, has not provided finance to the operator but has acquired an indirect interest in the underlying 
mineral. 
   Primary royalties tend to be negotiated as financing agreements between the Group and the operator directly and are much 
more likely to fall within the definition of IAS 39.
 (ii) Interest in the underlying mineral
   Quite often, the Group will have a registered interest in the underlying mineral. The nature of secondary royalties is often such 
that they are considered interests in the underlying land as the Group effectively assumes the role of the original counterparty.
   With financial assets, although there may be security in place over the assets of the counterparty, this does not constitute an 
interest in the underlying mineral.
 (iii) Limited rights to enforce the receipt of cash
   Intangible royalties are structured such that there is no means for the royalty holder to force the operator to produce. Therefore 
there is no contractual right to receive cash as the operator can avoid this obligation by refusing to produce. Cash is payable 
upon the successful commercial production at the underlying mine. There is no recourse to amounts invested, nor any 
production milestones. The receipt of future cash flow is solely dependent on production commencing at the mine.
   With financial assets, there is usually a contracted interest rate, maturity date (or milestones which need to be achieved), 
conditions of default and security. These are all characteristics of debt instruments and ensure the contractual right, or means 
of recourse where breaches occur, to future cash. A key differential is that there is a right to receive cash regardless of the 
success of the underlying operation. 
 (iv) Bankruptcy/change in control
   Generally, a royalty may often survive any change in control of the mine or bankruptcy of the developer. In the latter, there  
is no recourse to funds invested.
   Where there is a sale of a mine which the Group has financed it would be expected that the Group would have the right to 
carry its royalty across. If this is not possible, then the financial asset will be repaid. In events of bankruptcy, the Group will  
seek to recover its financial asset through the courts.
  Key differing characteristics between available for sale debt versus equity financial assets
  Upon determining that a royalty interest is a financial asset, the next step is to determine whether it is a debt instrument or an 
equity interest.
Debt financial asset: Equity financial asset:
Time-based interest charge on outstanding principal payable quarterly No interest rate
Defined maturity date No maturity date, continues into perpetuity
Minimum payment terms, irrespective of the development of the mine Payment is not dependent upon the successful development of the mine
Enforceable security No provision for the return of principal
  Equity instruments can sometimes display characteristics similar to debt. However, their return is related solely to performance 
which is a riskier type of return involving more than just credit risk.
 Other judgements in relation to royalty interests
  Where a royalty agreement contains a convertible option within it, the contracts are reviewed to determine whether the assets 
should be classified as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss or can be classified as an available for sale financial asset  
with an embedded derivative – note 2.9 and note 16.

  Judgement is also applied in conducting a review for impairment at each reporting date. In many cases there will not have been 
any updates in the period in relation to production scheduling or reserve estimates. In the absence of such observable market data 
and an active secondary market for the Group’s royalties, the Directors risk weight the expected future cash flows in order to apply 
a probability based approach to the value of each the royalty. This applies a much higher weighting to the probability of the operator 
achieving commercial production. 
(c)  Review of assumptions underlying the independent coal industry advisors’ valuation of the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalty – note 15.
(d)  Review of assumptions underlying the valuation of royalty instruments and their associated embedded derivatives – note 16.
  The Directors review the latest available mine plans and obtain independent foreign exchange and commodity price forecasts to 
determine each of the royalty instruments carrying value at reporting date. In the absence of any published production guidance, 
the Directors use a probability risk weighted method to the expected discounted future cash flows as described in (b) above.
(e)  Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals – note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 2.9, note 15, note 16, 
note 17 and note 18.
(f)  Recognition of deferred tax liabilities and the continued application of relevant exemptions – note 2.10, note 11 and note 22. 
The Group has deferred tax assets in relation to unrealised revaluation losses. The availability of these assets will depend of 
the recovery of value of similar assets in future periods or the realisation of gains on similar assets. The Directors consider there 
to be opportunities to acquire warrants as part of future royalty financing, which should result in profits which can utilise any 
losses currently unrealised.
(g)  Treatment of unrealised losses on mining and exploration interests – note 18.
  As noted in note 2.9, considerable judgement is used by the Directors in determining the meaning of ‘significant’ and ‘prolonged’  
in the context of the impairment of mining and exploration interests in accordance with IAS 39. Although this has no impact on net 
asset value, as the mining and exploration interests are carried at fair value, it does impact the point at which the unrealised losses 
are extracted from the investment revaluation reserve and recognised in the income statement.
5 Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee that are used  
to make strategic decisions.
The Committee considers the Group’s undertakings from a business perspective. This has resulted in the Group being organised into 
two operating segments – royalties and mining and exploration interests.
The royalties segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the royalties received from mining operations. The mining 
and exploration interests segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the acquisition, disposal and continued 
monitoring of the Group’s investments in listed and unlisted entities operating in mining and mineral exploration. The segment

The Group’s coal royalty entitlements comprise the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalties, and derive from mining activity carried out within 
the Group’s private land area in Queensland, Australia. Rather uniquely to this royalty, the sub-stratum land is the property of the 
freeholder, including the minerals contained within. The ownership of the land therefore entitles the Group to a royalty, equivalent to 
what the State receives on areas outside the Group’s private land.
As discussed in note 2.6, the Group had previously accounted for this as land in accordance with IAS 16 and elected to revalue the land 
at each reporting date. The Group now accounts for this land as freehold investment property in accordance with IAS 40. Although the 
balance sheet value remains unchanged, applying IAS 40 results in the valuation movement previously recognised in the revaluation 
reserve now being recognised in the income statement. 
The coal royalty was valued during December 2013 at £131.4m (A$244.4m) (2012: £171.0m and A$266.6m) by Resource Management 
International Pty Ltd, independent coal industry advisors, on a net present value of the pre-tax cash flow discounted at a rate of 7%. 
The net royalty income from this investment is currently taxed in Australia at a rate of 30%. This valuation is incorporated in the 
accounts and the above revaluation adjustment represents the difference between the opening carrying value and the external 
valuation, excluding the effects of foreign currency changes. 
The Group reviews the independent valuation carefully and reconciles it against its own estimates of future cash flow. As there 
is some uncertainty with regard to production forecasts in the valuation model, the Group carefully monitors the estimated future 
cashflow reported by its independent consultant against actual cash flows received. Where the results differ, the Audit Committee 
seeks detailed explanations from the consultant. The other key variable is coking coal price, and the prices used by the independent 
consultant are compared against those of other forward consensus models. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the price used 
is relatively conservative. Finally, the future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 7%. Bearing in mind that this is a high quality 
coking coal mine with an impressive track record by a world class operator, who have recently invested heavily in the mine’s expansion, 
the Audit Committee considers this to be an appropriate discount rate which should ensure the asset is represented fairly on the 
balance sheet.
Were the coal royalty to be realised at the revalued amount there are £2.0m (A$3.1m) of capital losses potentially available to offset 
against taxable gains. These losses have been included in the deferred tax calculation (note 22). Were the coal royalty to be carried at 
cost the carrying value would be £0.2m (2012: £0.2m). The Directors do not presently have any intention to dispose of the coal royalty.

The Group’s royalty instruments are represented by four royalty agreements which entitle the Group to either the repayment 
of principal and a net smelter return (‘NSR’) royalty for the life of the mine or a gross revenue royalty (‘GRR’) where the project 
commences commercial production or the repayment of principal where it does not. Details of the Group’s royalty instruments

(a) Available for sale
The Group’s entitlements to cash by way of the repayment of the principal and the NSR royalty or the GRR have been classified 
as available for sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 and are carried at fair value. When the financial asset is considered 
to be an equity instrument, changes in valuation are reflected in the investment revaluation reserve and any income is treated as a 
return on investment and recognised in the income statement. For financial assets which are considered debt instruments, any initial 
valuation movement caused as a result of the difference between an effective interest rate and actual interest is reflected in other 
comprehensive income, when material. Any subsequent valuation adjustment caused by changes in estimated cash flow is reflected 
in the income statement when considered material. Any effective interest credit is recognised in the income statement. Should the 
valuation fall beneath cost an impairment charge will be recognised in the income statement. See note 2.9 for further details.

The Group’s option to convert the outstanding balance of the debentures into common shares of the grantors is an embedded 
derivative requiring a separate valuation to the NSR royalty. As at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 the Directors considered 
the likelihood of the options being exercised to be remote and therefore, assessed the fair value of the options to be nil. The options are 
classified as fair value through profit and loss, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value directly recognised in the income 
statement as detailed below:

The exploration and evaluation costs comprise expenditure that is directly attributable to the Trefi and Panorama coal projects in British 
Columbia, Canada.
Royalty interests represent the NSR royalties acquired on the Four Mile project in South Australia, the Salamanca uranium project in 
Spain, the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects in Northern Ontario, Canada and a number of tenements in the 
Athabasca Basin region of Canada, together with the GRRs covering the Amapá iron ore system in Brazil, the Mount Ida magnetite iron 
ore project in Western Australia and three exploration licences, including the Railway iron ore deposit, in the central Pilbara region of 
Western Australia.
The NSR on the exploration licences in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada remain impaired as a result of the inherent uncertainty 
of these licences entering commercial production and have a carrying value of nil (2012: nil). The Group will continue to review the 
development of these licences on an annual basis. See note 2.7(b) and 4.2(b) for further information.
The Amapá royalty interest is the only producing interest and therefore, subject to amortisation. Amortisation of the remaining interests 
will commence once they begin commercial production. No intangible assets have been pledged as security for liabilities.
As described in note 2.7 and 2.8, an annual impairment review is carried out to determine whether the future expected cashflows 
exceed cost. This has resulted in the Directors determining that three of the Group’s intangible royalties were impaired at December 31, 
2013 as outlined below. See note 2.8 for the impairment methodology applied.
Ring of Fire
The operator, Cliffs Natural Resources Inc, announced the placing of its chromite asset on indefinite care and maintenance. Although 
the Group believes that this is too important a project to all stakeholders, in the absence of any other publically available information, 
it has deferred the estimated production profile and applied a risk weighted probability measure accordingly. The combination of both 
has resulted in the estimated future royalty income being less than the acquisition cost of the royalty. Should the impasse resolve and 
production commence, this impairment would be reversed in the income statement. This has resulted in an impairment charge of 
£4.0m in the year.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 98 Bulqiza
The Directors have taken a view that this project is no longer the principal focus of the owner of the licences. In the absence of a sale 
during the year, the Directors have changed the probability of future production such that the estimated future cashflows is less than 
the acquisition cost. This was a relatively small investment made by the Group in 2010. This has resulted in an impairment charge of 
£0.9m in the year.
Mount Ida
The Group acquired the Mount Ida royalty in 2012. Due to the significant infrastructure required to bring the project into production, 
including the construction of port and rail facilities, the owner has placed this project on care and maintenance. Although this is a large, 
relatively high grade deposit which, with a recovery in iron ore prices could become economic, in the meantime the Directors are of the 
view that it is unlikely that production will happen in a time frame such that the future cash flows will exceed cost. This has resulted in 
an impairment charge of £3.3m in the year.
The remaining royalties were assessed for impairment on the same basis. No further impairment charges were made.

The Group’s mining and exploration interests are acquired as part of the Group’s strategy to acquire new royalties and are not held for 
the purpose of trading. Gains may be realised where it is deemed appropriate. The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted 
market prices. Unquoted investments and royalty options are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably 
determined. In the absence of an active market for these securities, the Group considers each unquoted security to ensure there has 
been no material change in the fair value since initial recognition. Further guidance on fair value measurement is provided in note 3.
The Group’s impairment policy is outlined in note 2.9. In line with this policy, the absolute decline in value in the Group’s mining and 
exploration interests is now considered significant in the context of IAS 39. As such, all unrealised losses recognised in the revaluation 
reserve are transferred to retained earnings via the income statement in the period. Any recovery of value will not reverse this 
impairment charge, instead will be reflected in the revaluation reserve.

A non-repayable convertible instrument was acquired by the Group in 2007. The convertible instrument was designated as fair value 
through profit or loss. This convertible instrument was created to provide finance to a listed mining development company and is 
convertible into equity in the Company or royalties over the Company’s properties at the Group’s option for a period of up to five years. 
The instrument was initially recognised using cost as fair value could not be reliably determined. Prior to the instrument’s expiration in 
November 2012, the Group notified the underlying company of its intention to convert the instrument to royalties. The conversion was 
completed in the first quarter of 2013.

On August 13, 2012, the Group provided Laramide Resources Ltd with an interest bearing facility of C$5m, which is repayable in 
December 2015. In return Laramide Resources Ltd granted Anglo Pacific an option to acquire a 5% gross revenue royalty for an 
exercise price of US$15m. The facility bears interest at a rate of 7% per annum payable quarterly in arrears.
On December 18, 2012 the Group entered into a royalty financing agreement with Hummingbird Resources PLC, under which the 
Group was to provide a non-interesting bearing advance of US$15m in three tranches of US$5m subject to the satisfaction of various 
conditions precedents. During the year, the Group advanced two of the three tranches.
Amounts due from subsidiaries, are considered long-term loans. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of amounts due  
from subsidiaries is approximately their fair value.

Following the approval at the 2010 AGM, the Group operates two equity-settled share based compensation plans as follows:
• The HMRC approved Company Share Ownership Plan (the ‘CSOP’); and
• The JSOP operated through the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust.
(a) Company Share Ownership Plan 
Under the CSOP , share options are granted to Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is equal 
to the average mid market closing price of an ordinary share for the three days before the grant. The options are conditional on the 
employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period). The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date, 
subject to the Group achieving its target growth in absolute TSR over the period of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the 
UK Retail Price Index; the options have a contractual option term of ten years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
repurchase or settle the options in cash.

There were no grants made during 2013. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2012 determined using the 
Black-Scholes valuation model was £1.649 per option granted in March 2012 and £1.318 per option granted in September 2012. The 
significant inputs into the model were weighted average share price of £3.286 and £2.668 at the grant date in March and September 
2012 respectively, exercise price shown above, volatility of 40%, expected option life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate 
of 1.1% and 0.8% for the options granted in March and September 2012 respectively. See note 8(a) for the total expense recognised  
in the income statement for share options granted to Directors and employees.
In accordance with the rules of the CSOP , Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard forfeited all their outstanding options at the time of their 
resignation on October 21, 2013.
(b) Joint Share Ownership Plan 
Under the JSOP , the Remuneration Committee invites selected Directors and employees to enter into an agreement with the Anglo 
Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Co-owner’) to acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The 
shares are held in the name of the Co-owner, however, the selected Directors and employees maintain a beneficial interest in these 
shares.
Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period) and the Group’s absolute 
total shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three-year 
vesting period. In addition the Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price during the three year vesting period as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee at the time of making the award.
Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the director or 
employee to receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of  
all sales proceeds in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the 
Remuneration Committee and will not be set less than the market value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP 
award is made.

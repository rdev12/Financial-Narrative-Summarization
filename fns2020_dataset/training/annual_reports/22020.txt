Results
I am pleased to report another good set of 
results against the background of mixed 
macroeconomic and market conditions 
across the countries in which we operate. 
Overall currency translation movements 
due to the weakening of sterling had 
a significant positive impact on the 
reported Group growth rates at actual 
exchange rates. 
Group revenue increased 14% to £7,429.1 
million (2015: £6,489.7 million) and adjusted 
operating profit before customer 
relationships amortisation and acquisition 
related costs was up 15% to £525.0 million 
(2015: £455.0 million). Adjusted earnings 
per share were 106.1p (2015: 91.0p), an 
increase of 17%.
At constant exchange rates, revenue 
increased by 4% and adjusted operating 
profit rose by 5%. The Group operating 
margin improved from 7.0% to 7.1% with 
adjusted earnings per share up 6% at 
constant exchange rates. 
Return on average operating capital 
increased to 55.9% from 55.5% in 2015, 
driven by an improvement in the operating 
capital in the underlying business, partly 
offset by an adverse impact from exchange 
rate movements, a slightly lower underlying 
operating margin and the impact of the 
lower return on operating capital from 
acquisitions. Return on invested capital of 
16.7% was down from 17.1% in 2015 
principally due to the effect of acquisitions 
and limited organic growth. 
Dividend 
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 29.0p. This brings the total dividend for 
the year to 42.0p, up 11% compared to 2015. 
Shareholders will again have the 
opportunity to participate in our dividend 
reinvestment plan.
Strategy
Our consistent and proven strategy of 
developing the business through organic 
growth, consolidating our markets through 
focused acquisitions and continuously 
improving our operations has delivered 
another successful year of growth for 
the Group.
We look to achieve organic growth by 
applying our resources and expertise to 
enable our customers to reduce or 
eliminate the hidden costs of sourcing and 
distributing a broad range of goods not for 
resale. By outsourcing these activities to 
Bunzl they are able to focus on their core 
business and run their operations more 
cost-effectively by achieving purchasing 
efficiencies and savings, while at the same 
time freeing up working capital, improving 
their distribution capabilities, reducing 
carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
By continuing 
to focus on our 
strengths and 
consolidate the 
markets in which 
we compete, we 
have achieved 
another year of 
growth in earnings 
and dividends.

Acquisition activity continued throughout 
2016. Including Saebe Compagniet and 
Prorisk and GM Equipement, which we 
agreed to acquire in November 2016 and 
completed in January 2017, we made 14 
acquisitions with a total committed spend of 
£184 million, thereby adding annualised 
revenue of £201 million. These acquisitions 
have helped to strengthen our position in 
many of the markets that we serve. In 
addition, the acquisition of Packaging Film 
Sales in the US was announced and 
completed at the beginning of 2017 and we 
are today announcing the purchase of LSH 
in Singapore. We now have operations in 
30 countries.
Investment
Investment in the business to support our 
growth strategy and enhance our asset base 
is an ongoing process. We have continued to 
improve our facilities and open new ones, 
both as a result of acquisitions and by 
consolidating our warehouse footprint in 
order to make it more efficient. Systems are 
critical to our ability to serve our customers 
in the most effective way. We continuously 
upgrade our IT systems as we integrate new 
businesses into the Group’s operations and 
increase the functionality of our existing 
systems. By doing so we are able to 
enhance our customer offering and retain a 
competitive advantage, thereby maintaining 
our leading position in the marketplace.
Corporate responsibility
We continue to focus on sustainable 
operating processes throughout our 
businesses while at the same time, through 
our one-stop-shop offering to our 
customers, also actively contribute to the 
sustainable footprint of our customers’ 
businesses by consolidating their product 
deliveries. We work closely with our 
suppliers with a view to ensuring that they 
also adopt corporate responsibility (‘CR’) 
policies similar to our own, while the quality 
assurance/quality control team in Shanghai 
undertakes audits of our key Asian 
suppliers to assist them in meeting our 
stringent standards. In addition, we 
continually look to add to our full range of 
environmentally friendly products. Integrity 
is at the heart of Bunzl’s standards and we 
ensure that all relevant employees 
undertake CR training and that our 
whistleblowing programme is 
communicated throughout the Group.
Employees
Bunzl’s decentralised business model 
drives local empowerment and fast decision 
making, thereby allowing us to demonstrate 
repeatedly our understanding of our 
customers’ needs and deliver great service. 
Throughout our operations around the 
world, it is the enthusiasm with which our 
employees undertake their responsibilities, 
their commitment to improve our 
performance and their willingness to go 
the extra mile that allows us continually to 
delight our customers. I would like to thank 
them all for their achievements this year 
which have contributed greatly to the 
Group’s continued success. 
Board
After more than a decade in the role, 
Michael Roney retired as Chief Executive 
and stood down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 
April 2016. He was succeeded by Frank van 
Zanten who for the previous 10 years was 
Managing Director of the Continental 
Europe business area. The management 
transition has gone well with Frank’s 
appointment providing continuity for 
the business as well as its customers 
and employees. 
Following his appointment as Chief 
Executive of Brammer plc, Meinie Oldersma 
resigned as a non-executive director in 
August 2016. 
David Sleath, who has served as a non-
executive director since September 2007, 
will be retiring after the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting in April 2017. During his 
time he has also served as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and Senior Independent 
Director. His independent advice and 
significant contribution to our success have 
been greatly appreciated and he leaves the 
Board with our thanks and best wishes.
Today we are announcing the appointment 
of Lloyd Pitchford as non-executive director 
with effect from 1 March 2017. Lloyd is 
currently Chief Financial Officer of Experian 
plc and has extensive international business 
experience which will be of great value to 
Bunzl as we continue to expand and develop. 
Upon David Sleath’s retirement at the 
Annual General Meeting, Lloyd will assume 
the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and Vanda Murray will become the Senior 
Independent Director.

05 the Company’s new Chief Executive 
who was appointed in April 2016 after 
a period of 10 years as the Managing 
Director of Continental Europe.
Q Who is Frank van Zanten? 
I am 50 years old and I was born and 
raised in the Netherlands. I have spent 
almost 20 years with the Bunzl Group 
in a variety of different roles.
After completing my Master’s degree in 
business, I took the opportunity to go into 
our family business, Hopa Disposables, 
assuming the role of Managing Director 
in 1991. In 1994, after an approach by Bunzl, 
we decided it was time to sell the business 
and Hopa became the first Bunzl business 
in Continental Europe. Following the 
acquisition I had the opportunity to work 
in Denmark, spend time in our German 
business and I also worked in the UK for 
two years.

Chief Executive
 Q&A
with Frank van Zanten
06
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Q&A with Frank van Zanten In 2001, after seven years with Bunzl, 
I became the Chief Executive of a listed 
distribution company in the Netherlands. 
Bunzl approached me again in 2005 and 
I subsequently rejoined the Group as the 
Managing Director of the Continental 
Europe business area based in Amsterdam. 
At that time we had operations in only four 
countries but by 2015 had expanded to 
14 countries, having doubled the size of 
the business to more than €1.5 billion in 
revenue and increased the operating profit 
almost five times to €144 million.
After 10 years managing Continental Europe 
I became Chief Executive of Bunzl plc in 
April 2016. It has been an incredible journey. 
I believe it is a great story for all the people 
in the Bunzl Group that if you work hard and 
you want to develop anything is possible.”
Q When you first took over as 
Chief Executive what were your 
initial observations? 
Having worked within the Group for a long 
time, it was not all new to me but I have 
spent a lot of time travelling around the 
world to visit many of our businesses. 
I strongly believe that Bunzl has an excellent 
business model with an experienced 
management team that is successfully 
executing a proven strategy.”
Q Do you anticipate continuing the 
acquisition strategy that has 
contributed to the strong growth 
of the Group? 
I am incredibly committed to the acquisition 
strategy. I compare our acquisition spend 
to capex in a manufacturing business; 
purchasing businesses and integrating 
them into our existing operations is part 
of our DNA. We often buy family owned 
businesses that require a trigger to sell, 
and therefore the timing of transactions 
is difficult to predict, but our strong balance 
sheet and consistently high cash conversion 
means we have the firepower to act quickly 
when the opportunities arise.”
Q Will the Group continue to grow 
organically as well as by acquisition? 
Yes, growing the Group organically 
continues to be a key part of our strategy. 
By partnering with market leading 
customers, we grow as the markets in 
which we operate grow. However, we also 
aim to increase our share of those markets 
by selling more products to our existing 
customers, what we call ‘filling the gap’, 
as well as by expanding our product ranges 
and winning new customers.” 
Q Do you have any other specific 
areas you want to focus on? 
I have two areas I have spoken about before 
that I am particularly passionate about, 
namely our investment in IT and digital 
projects and the sharing of best practice 
across the Group. In the last couple of 
years, we have rolled out state-of-the-art 
digital platforms across Continental Europe 
and UK & Ireland which have enhanced our 
customers’ experience when interacting 
with our businesses and we plan to make 
similar investments elsewhere in the near 
future. Intensifying the sharing of best 
practice across our businesses globally 
is also a key area of focus for me. We have 
successfully established a global forum 
across our fast growing safety business, 
bringing together the world leading industry 
knowledge of our management which 
includes many former business owners. 
I want to expand this type of collaboration 
to other businesses within the Group as the 
benefits to those involved can be significant.”
Q What do you think is Bunzl’s 
greatest asset? 
I have to say that without any doubt it is our 
people. Across the Group in all areas of the 
business we have incredibly dedicated, loyal 
and hardworking employees. Some of them 
have been with us for a long time and some 
are new to the Group but their continued 
commitment to improving our business 
on a daily basis and servicing the needs of 
our customers is what makes Bunzl the 
fantastic business that it is.” 
Q In your opinion what makes 
Bunzl more than just a 
distribution business? 
Our business model offers so much 
more than just a set of wheels. We not 
only partner with many leading global 
branded suppliers but through our Far East 
sourcing operations we are able to provide 
our extensive own brand product offering. 
Our field sales teams work with our 
customers across all of our sectors to 
identify specific products to suit their 
needs and we offer varying delivery 
solutions such as direct to store, cross-
dock and warehouse replenishment. 
With our global sourcing and procurement 
capabilities, our international warehousing 
and distribution infrastructure and our 
range of delivery options, we are able 
to provide a comprehensive and complete 
one-stop-shop solution for all of our 
customers’ non-food consumables 
requirements. By providing this 
consolidated offering we are able to 
simplify and improve the efficiency 
of their own supply chains.”

retaining full responsibility for the financial 
performance of their businesses.
Strong financial discipline
Over many years we have delivered

time enabling our acquired businesses to 
continue to feel ‘local’.
Our strategy
1 Organic growth
We are constantly looking to grow Bunzl 
organically, both by expanding and 
developing our business with existing 
customers and by gaining new business 
with additional customers.
2 Acquisition growth
We seek out businesses that satisfy key 
criteria, including having good financial

while at the same time providing 
opportunities to extract further value 
as part of the Bunzl Group.
3  Operating model 
improvements
We continually strive to improve the 
quality of our operations and to make

investing in new IT systems, digital 
projects and warehouse facilities as 
well as implementing and sharing best 
practice operational procedures.
Creating value for stakeholders
Customer benefits
Our customers benefit from a lower 
cost of doing business by reducing or 
eliminating many of the hidden costs of 
in-house procurement and distribution 
and reducing carbon emissions.
Employee benefits
We provide our employees with career 
development opportunities and meet 
their training needs while providing 
opportunities for advancement within 
the business.
Environmental awareness
Our continued focus on operational 
excellence allows us to reduce both

impact by reducing our warehouse 
footprint, introducing more sustainable 
products and business practices and 
providing a one-stop-shop consolidated 
product offering.
Shareholder returns
We seek to deliver good returns  
for our shareholders over time  
with sustained improvement in profits 
and earnings which drive long term

Strategic report | Business model and strategy Building relationships
One of the greatest opportunities for organic 
sales growth comes from building long 
term relationships with existing customers. 
By being both flexible and reliable and by 
providing excellent levels of service, we gain

their future needs over a sustained period of 
time through a broad and effective product 
and service offering.
Acquiring new customers

in-house procurement and distribution 
or satisfy their requirements more cost-
effectively than their current suppliers.
Expanding our offering
Once we have established a good 
relationship with a particular customer, 
we endeavour to increase our level of 
business with that customer. This can be 
achieved by expanding our offering to parts 
of their operations where we might not have 
previously been a recognised supplier or by 
increasing the type and variety of products 
that are available, whether branded or 
own brand. We do this either by extending 
the range of products within a particular 
category or adding new categories of 
products to those already supplied, often 
by optimising cross-selling opportunities 
across other Bunzl businesses.
Organic growth
Growing Bunzl organically, either by 
expanding and developing our business with 
existing customers or by gaining new business 
with additional customers, is an integral part 
of our strategy to enhance shareholder value.
We build strong relationships with each 
of our customers to understand their 
needs and identify where we can support 
them, while continually looking for new 
ways to help make their businesses run 
more smoothly.

markets
Since 2004 we have completed 
more than 130 acquisitions  
with a total committed spend 
of £2.5 billion and have expanded 
the Group’s operations from 
12 to 30 countries.
Acquisition 
growth
Expanding and developing the Group 
through acquiring businesses is also a 
key component of our growth strategy. 
Historically, approximately three 
quarters of our year-on-year growth 
has been achieved through an ongoing 
programme of focused and targeted 
acquisitions in both new and existing 
market sectors and geographies.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016

Strategic report | Business model and strategy Acquisition types
There are two different types of acquisition 
that we undertake depending on whether 
we are already present in the country or 
market sector in which the target business 
is operating:
• Anchor
 − new geographies; or
 − new market sectors.
• Bolt-on
 − existing geographies; or
 − existing market sectors.
Growth in existing countries 
Unlike many industries that are 
characterised by a relatively small number 
of large businesses, the markets in which 
we compete are very fragmented. As a 
result, there are numerous opportunities 
for us to develop through acquisitions in 
those countries where we already have a 
presence. We do this either by extending our 
existing operations in a particular market 
sector or by acquiring a business in a sector 
in which we do not currently operate within 
that country.
Growth in new countries
We are a truly international business with 
operations in 30 countries but there are a 
number of potentially attractive countries 
where we do not yet have a presence. 
In evaluating whether to enter a new 
country through acquisition, we consider 
a number of different criteria. These include 
a detailed analysis of our market sectors, 
the local macroeconomic indicators and the 
ease of doing business in, and the political 
risks and business practices associated 
with, the particular country under review.
Key acquisition parameters
In considering potential acquisition 
opportunities, we only target those 
businesses that meet the specific 
parameters that fit our business model and 
growth strategy. These include businesses: 
• that sell business to business (‘B2B’);
• with a consolidated not for resale  
product offering;
• in resilient and growing markets; 
• that operate in markets with scope for 
further consolidation and synergies; 
• whose products represent a small 
percentage of total customer spend; 
• that have opportunities for own label 
products; and 
• with attractive financial returns.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Operating model 
improvements
We are continually looking to refine and develop our 
processes and procedures to improve our operations 
and make our businesses more efficient. By doing so, 
we are able to gain a competitive advantage, by offering 
our customers more cost-effective solutions, while at 
the same time improving our profitability.
Through careful planning and by being flexible and 
working together efficiently as a team, we ensure 
that our customers get their orders where and 
when they need them.
Nick Howe
UK & Ireland
Consolidating warehouses
As warehouse lease terms come to an 
end, we are often able to consolidate our 
warehouse footprint in a particular area 
by closing a number of smaller and less 
efficient facilities and relocating our 
operations into a single, larger and 
more efficient building.
Routing and safety systems
By installing state-of-the-art routing 
and safety systems in our facilities and 
delivery vehicles, we are able to plan 
our delivery routes to minimise the 
distances travelled and encourage safe 
and efficient driving practices, thereby 
reducing fuel and other transport costs.
Warehouse lighting
Recent improvements in lighting technology 
have meant that we are able to make 
significant savings in electricity costs by 
installing energy efficient and 
environmentally friendly lighting systems.
Global purchasing
With the annual cost of the goods we 
sell exceeding £5.6 billion, our global scale 
provides substantial purchasing synergies 
with our international suppliers that we 
are able to share with our customers in 
the form of more competitive selling prices.
Sharing best practice
As we have continued to expand 
internationally, we are increasingly making 
use of our collective resources, experience 
and expertise to share best practice across 
the Group and collaborate between our 
different businesses.
IT systems
Systems are an important part of our 
ability to serve our customers in the most 
cost-effective and efficient manner and, 
accordingly, we are continually improving 
and upgrading our IT systems in order 
to increase functionality and improve 
customer service.
Digital capabilities
The implementation of a variety of digital 
projects throughout the Group, such as 
web-based ordering portals, has increased 
the efficiency of our operations while at 
the same time provided an enhanced 
experience for our customers when 
interacting with our businesses.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Chief Executive’s review
Bunzl’s continued 
success is based 
on our extensive 
knowledge and 
experience of the 
markets in which we 
operate and a deep 
understanding of 
our customers’ 
requirements.
Operating performance
With more than 85% of the Group’s revenue 
generated outside the UK, the weakening 
of sterling against most currencies has had 
a significant positive translation impact on 
the Group’s reported results, increasing 
revenue, profits and earnings by 
approximately 10%. As in previous years, 
the operations, including the relevant 
growth rates and changes in operating 
margins, are therefore reviewed below 
at constant exchange rates to remove 
the distorting impact of these currency 
movements. Changes in the level of revenue 
and profits at constant exchange rates have 
been calculated by retranslating the results 
for 2015 at the average rates used for 2016. 
Unless otherwise stated, all references 
in this review to operating profit are to 
adjusted operating profit (being operating 
profit before customer relationships 
amortisation and acquisition related costs). 
Revenue increased 4% (14% at actual 
exchange rates) to £7,429.1 million, 
principally due to the effect of recent 
acquisitions together with some organic 
growth. Although the level of organic 
growth at 0.3% was subdued for most of 
the year by the impact of some previously 
announced customer losses and price 
declines on plastic resin-based products, it 
started to improve during the fourth quarter 
to approximately 1.5% as a result of recent 
business wins and the abatement of the

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review impact of such price declines. Operating 
profit was £525.0 million, an increase of 
5% (15% at actual exchange rates). The 
percentage growth in operating profit was 
greater than that of revenue due to the 
impact of higher margin acquisitions, 
resulting in an improvement in the Group 
operating margin by 10 basis points at both 
constant and actual exchange rates to 7.1%.
In North America revenue rose 3% (15% 
at actual exchange rates) principally due 
to the impact of acquisitions completed in 
both 2015 and 2016, while operating profit 
increased 4% (16% at actual exchange rates) 
with the operating margin unchanged at 
both constant and actual exchange rates at 
6.6%. Revenue in Continental Europe rose 
10% (24% at actual exchange rates) as a 
result of organic revenue growth and the 
impact of acquisitions, with operating profit 
up 13% (27% at actual exchange rates) and 
the operating margin up 20 basis points at 
both constant and actual exchange rates to 
9.3%. In UK & Ireland revenue was down 2% 
(down 1% at actual exchange rates) with a 
decline in organic revenue principally due to 
a previously announced account loss in our 
food retail business at the beginning of 2016. 
Operating profit also reduced 2% (down 1% 
at actual exchange rates) with the operating 
margin stable at both constant and actual 
exchange rates at 7.7%. In Rest of the World 
revenue increased 11% (21% at actual 
exchange rates) with operating profit up 4% 
(11% at actual exchange rates) due to the 
impact of acquisitions completed in 2015, 
particularly in Latin America. Margins came 
under pressure due to the challenging 
macroeconomic conditions and some 
adverse foreign exchange transaction 
impact of weaker local currencies in the 
relevant markets in both Latin America 
and Australasia, with the business area 
operating margin down 50 basis points 
(70 basis points at actual exchange rates) 
to 7.5%.
Basic earnings per share were 4% higher 
(14% at actual exchange rates) at 80.7p. 
Adjusted earnings per share, which 
excludes the effect of customer 
relationships amortisation and acquisition 
related costs, were 106.1p, an increase of 
6% (17% at actual exchange rates).
The operating cash flow, which is before 
acquisition related costs, continued to be 
strong with cash conversion (the ratio of 
operating cash flow to adjusted operating 
profit) at 99%. The ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA calculated at average exchange 
rates decreased from 2.1 times as at the end 
of 2015 to 2.0 times, which is at the lower 
end of our target range of 2.0 to 2.5 times.
As a responsible business, Bunzl actively 
promotes sustainability and we continually 
challenge ourselves to reduce the 
environmental footprint of our operations, 
introduce more sustainable practices to the 
businesses we acquire and improve the 
safety of all our sites. We remain committed 
to reducing our impact on the environment 
and supporting the communities within 
which we operate. Once again a rigorous 
assessment of our supply chain with regard 
to social issues has been undertaken and 
in our Corporate responsibility report we 
seek to show the benefits of our collective 
endeavours on the lives of our people, 
suppliers and customers. During the year 
we undertook a detailed employee survey 
and were delighted that 82% of our 
employees took part and 93% of 
respondents ‘enjoy the work they do’. 
Finally, our focus on collaboration and the 
sharing of best practice continues to bring 
opportunities for our colleagues to work 
together, contributing greatly to Bunzl’s 
continued success.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are a key component of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Our committed 
spend in 2016 was £184 million from a 
total of 14 transactions, including Saebe 
Compagniet and Prorisk and GM 
Equipement which we agreed to acquire 
in November 2016 and completed in 
January 2017.
At the beginning of February we purchased 
Earthwise Bag, a distributor of reusable 
bags to supermarkets and other retailers in 
the US, which has expanded our offering of 
environmentally friendly products. Revenue 
in 2015 was £12 million. Bursa Pazari, which 
had revenue of £31 million in 2015, was 
acquired at the end of March and represents 
our second step in Turkey, extending our 
operations there into the foodservice and 
healthcare sectors. It is engaged in the 
sale of a variety of packaging and other 
foodservice supplies and disposable gloves 
to wholesalers, retailers and hospitals 
throughout Turkey and also exports to a 
number of countries.
At the end of May we completed three 
further acquisitions. Inkozell and Mo Ha Ge 
are both engaged in the sale of healthcare 
related consumables, mainly incontinence 
products, to a variety of home end users 
and care homes throughout Germany. The 
aggregate revenue of the businesses in 2015 
was £16 million. In the UK we purchased 
Classic Bag which develops and distributes 
bespoke retail packaging for non-food 
retailers in the UK, Hong Kong and 
elsewhere in Europe. It complements our 
existing retail supplies business in the UK, 
enhances our customer base and extends 
our presence in this market in Hong Kong. 
Revenue in 2015 was £7 million. Polaris 
Chemicals distributes cleaning & hygiene 
supplies to both redistributors and end 
users, including government and education 
establishments, retirement homes and 
19
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Chief Executive’s review continued
cleaning companies, throughout the 
Brussels and Walloon regions of Belgium. 
The acquisition has brought additional scale 
to our cleaning & hygiene supplies business 
in Belgium. Revenue in 2015 was £3 million. 
The purchase in July of Plus II and Apex, 
which had revenues in 2015 of £16 million 
and £6 million respectively, has further 
expanded our cleaning & hygiene supplies 
business in Canada which has grown 
significantly in recent years through 
acquisition. At the end of August we 
acquired Blyth, a Prague based distributor 
of a broad range of personal protection 
equipment to a variety of end user 
customers throughout the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia. Revenue in 2015 was 
£5 million.
In September we purchased three further 
businesses. Kingsbury Packaging, which is 
located in Northern Ireland and had revenue 
of £5 million in 2015, supplies food 
packaging related products to convenience 
stores and food retailers in Ireland. Silwell 
has provided additional scale to our 
business in Hungary by extending our 
operations there in the foodservice sector. 
Revenue in 2015 was £6 million. Tri-Star 
Packaging is also engaged in the 
distribution of food packaging and 
foodservice products, as well as some 
cleaning & hygiene consumables, to end 
user customers including ‘food-to-go’ 
retailers, contract caterers and food 
processors throughout the UK. Revenue 
in 2015 was £28 million.
At the end of December we acquired 
Woodway, a leading supplier of packaging 
products and solutions to a variety of end 
user customers in the UK. It specialises in 
supporting the e-commerce activities of 
retailers and had revenue in the year ended 
June 2016 of £31 million.
In November we entered into agreements to 
acquire Saebe Compagniet in Denmark and 
Prorisk and GM Equipement in France, both 
of which were completed in January 2017. 
Saebe Compagniet is a distributor of 
cleaning & hygiene related products to a 
variety of end user customers, particularly 
in the hotel, restaurant and catering 
sectors, in Denmark. Revenue in the year 
ended April 2016 was £13 million. Prorisk 
and GM Equipement, which together had 
aggregate revenue in 2015 of £6 million, are 
principally engaged in the sale of a variety of 
personal protection equipment and first aid 
related products to both end users and 
distributors throughout France.
Since the year end we have acquired two 
further businesses. In early January 2017 
we purchased the business of Packaging 
Film Sales which distributes food packaging 
products, including flexible barrier films 
and speciality bags and pouches, to food 
processors in the US. Revenue in 2015 was 
£5 million. Finally, today we are announcing 
the acquisition of LSH, a distributor of safety 
products, primarily to end users, based in 
Singapore which was completed at the end 
of January 2017. This represents our first 
step into Singapore and should provide a 
base from which to develop our operations 
in Asia. Revenue in 2016 was £5 million.
Prospects
Against the backdrop of mixed 
macroeconomic and market conditions, 
the combination of our strong competitive 
position, diversified and resilient businesses 
and ability to consolidate our fragmented 
markets further is expected to lead to 
continued growth. If exchange rates remain 
at their current levels, the significant 
weakening of sterling last year will have 
a further positive translation effect on the 
reported results in 2017, particularly in the 
first half.
In North America, the pick up in organic 
revenue growth towards the end of 2016 is 
expected to continue due to some additional 
business won, albeit at lower margins, and 
the abatement of the impact of price 
declines on plastic resin-based products. 
In Continental Europe we expect to see a 
good performance due to the benefit of 
acquisitions and organic growth. Despite 
ongoing uncertainty in some of our markets, 
UK & Ireland should make progress due to 
the impact of acquisitions and the benefit of 
a recent account win, although we continue 
to focus on mitigating the adverse foreign 
exchange transaction impact from the 
weakening of sterling. With many of the 
economies in Rest of the World showing 
less volatility and the major local currencies 
having strengthened, we expect to see a 
more stable trading performance from our 
businesses there.
The pipeline of potential acquisitions 
remains promising. We are in discussions 
with various targets and we expect to 
complete further transactions during 2017.
The Board believes that the prospects of the 
Group are positive due to its strong market 
position and ability to grow the business 
both organically and through acquisitions.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 In North America, revenue increased by 3% 
to £4,362.1 million due to the impact of the 
acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as 
well as organic growth of 1%, the level of 
which improved relative to that achieved in 
2015. The recent acquisitions have expanded 
our footprint in several of our market 
sectors while adding further products and 
services to our portfolio. Although we 
continued to face challenges in growing 
sales organically due to deflationary 
pressures on product prices and slow 
growth rates in several customer sectors, 
we saw a pick up during the fourth quarter 
of the year due to some additional business 
won and the abatement of the impact of 
price declines on plastic resin-based 
products towards the end of the year. 
Operating profit increased 4% to £289.6 
million with the operating margin remaining 
unchanged at 6.6%.
Despite the deflationary pressures on 
product prices that persisted for most of the 
year, our largest business serving the 
grocery sector grew as a result of securing 
new contract wins and expanding business 
with existing customers. We have activated 
our ‘pick-and-pack’ services at several 
large customers to provide many new items 
and offer a wider range of products with the 
convenience of single source delivery. 
Additionally, the acquisition of Earthwise 
Bag, acquired in February 2016, has 
strengthened our offering in eco-friendly 
products through the supply of reusable 
bags that can be custom-branded for 
promotional purposes. Our expanded 
product offering combined with our flexible 
store delivery programmes allow us to 
deliver unmatched service and improved 
asset utilisation for our customers. For our 
largest customer we have also agreed to 
take on the distribution of a range of 
additional items which are new to the 
business area and which we expect to offer 
to other customers operating in both the 
grocery and retail sectors.
Overall, our business serving the retail 
sector remained stable with the adverse 
impact of some lost accounts being offset by 
new business secured during the year. We 
have expanded our available products as 
well as enhanced our service capabilities by 
consolidating operations to provide faster 
deliveries. Our network of warehouses 
and fleet of trucks provide an attractive 
business model for large retailers with 
expansive footprints requiring distribution 
to multiple locations. We have continued 
to promote our material consolidation 
services, primarily used by our largest 
retail customer, to retailers with similar 
operations. Our materials management 
capabilities help retailers reduce costs and 
open or remodel stores faster so that they 
can begin generating revenue sooner.
In our business serving the redistribution 
sector, we have experienced growth 
through the implementation of category 
management programmes at new and 
already established foodservice distribution 
customers. These engagements often begin 
using innovative, proprietary digital tools to 
illustrate to both prospective and existing 
customers the substantial revenue 
generating opportunities that a complete 
redistribution programme has to offer. 
Our customers rely 
on our sourcing 
expertise, the 
depth and breadth 
of our product 
offering and the 
comprehensive 
service we provide 
from our extensive 
distribution facilities.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review We are expanding our sales of janitorial and 
sanitation (‘jan-san’) products in this sector 
and others through our central warehouse 
initiative. In support of this initiative, we 
opened a warehouse in the north east  
US for the stocking and distribution of 
jan-san products in the region and we 
have continued to enhance our central 
warehouse infrastructure and jan-san 
inventory in strategic US locations.  
We have also continued to drive sales 
through innovative products such as our 
proprietary oneSAFE
 
single-use glove 
dispensing system.
Our business serving the safety sector 
experienced a difficult year with lower 
revenue and operating profit due to a 
downturn in the oil and gas industry as well 
as some weakness in the welding segment. 
Despite these factors, we have made gains 
in other areas, such as the automotive and 
industrial markets. We have taken steps to 
reduce operating costs while seeking new 
ways to expand our business. We have also 
continued to invest in the development of 
our own brand of personal protection 
equipment. These products contribute 
higher margins while at the same time allow 
us to offer added value to our customers 
when compared to branded alternatives.
In our business serving the food processor 
sector, although customer consolidation has 
continued, we have expanded our existing 
customer relationships and gained new 
business by offering a total plant operating 
supplies programme. This one-stop-shop 
solution encompasses jan-san and safety 
products as well as our own label products 
including vacuum pouches, shrink wrap 
bags and bin liners. Our national accounts 
sales team is continually looking to drive 
sales by identifying and pursuing customers 
who understand the benefit of a single-
source solution for their plant operations. 
We have also seen growth in our business 
that supplies the agricultural sector. 
The business is achieving greater levels 
of profitability after migrating all of our 
companies serving this sector onto a 
unified IT platform that includes a 
warehouse management system which 
has enhanced operational efficiencies 
across the business.
Our business serving the convenience 
store sector has grown strongly despite 
competition from non-traditional suppliers 
as well as some customer consolidation. We 
continue to execute our pull-through selling 
strategy by partnering with our primary 
wholesale customers to help them increase 
sales with convenience store retailers 
and we have expanded this business with 
the addition of other items carried by 
convenience stores. Our ability to manage 
our customers’ inventory enables them to 
have the right products at the right time so 
that they can reduce their working capital 
and warehouse space needs. We have also 
improved our transportation efficiencies 
and inventory management capabilities in 
this sector.
Our business in Canada continues to 
operate successfully with all of the recent 
acquisitions continuing to perform well. In 
the second half of the year we acquired two 
further businesses, Apex in Toronto and 
Plus II in Montreal, which have allowed 
us to expand our jan-san products and 
services in the region as well as our 
e-commerce capabilities for our Canadian 
customers. We continue to leverage our 
national distribution platform and 
restructure our business as needed to 
enhance our operations serving all of our 
market sectors in Canada. 
Finally, all of our businesses throughout 
North America are benefiting from a 
continuous improvement initiative which 
is focused on enhancing our operational 
capabilities. This includes a warehouse 
optimisation programme to ensure we have 
the most efficient infrastructure to support 
our customers as well as a routing system 
that maximises our truck fleet utilisation.
North America is Bunzl’s largest and  
longest-established business area, having 
started in 1981 with the acquisition of Jersey 
Paper Company in the US. The revenue of 
the business area that year was £20 million. 
Over the last 35 years the operations have 
grown substantially throughout the US 
while at the same time have expanded into 
Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico to become 
the market-leading business that it is today 
with revenue of £4.4 billion.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Continental Europe once again developed 
strongly with revenue rising by 10% to 
£1,355.1 million and operating profit up 13% 
to £126.6 million. Organic revenue growth of 
2% improved on the level seen in 2015 with 
the results also boosted by the full year 
impact of the eight acquisitions made in 
2015 and the part year contribution of the 
five acquisitions completed in 2016. While 
gross margins reduced slightly, ongoing 
management of the cost base enabled the 
business area to maintain its underlying 
profitability and, with the benefit of higher 
margin acquisitions, the business area 
operating margin rose by 20 basis points at 
constant exchange rates to 9.3%. 
In France, sales at our cleaning & hygiene 
business returned to growth following 
investment in our e-commerce and 
telesales capabilities. Additional cost 
reductions offset margin pressures and 
operating profit again increased in the 
year. However, our personal protection 
equipment business recorded lower sales 
which could only partly be offset by lower 
costs. Ligne T, the specialist safety business 
acquired in May 2015, traded ahead of 
expectations and the acquisition of Prorisk 
and GM Equipement, which was completed 
at the end of January 2017, has further 
increased our scale in the French safety 
market and broadened our product range. 
Comatec, which was acquired in December 
2015 and specialises in the distribution of 
high-end, innovative, single-use tableware 
to the hotel, restaurant and catering 
(‘horeca’) sector, also traded well ahead of 
expectations with growth both in the local 
French and export markets. 
In Switzerland, sales declined as a 
contraction in the horeca sector, linked to 
lower levels of tourism due to the continued 
strength of the Swiss franc, was not fully 
offset by gains in the retail and industry 
sectors. Sales to the medical sector were 
broadly flat. Competition from lower cost 
neighbouring countries in the Eurozone also 
put further pressure on margins resulting 
in operating profit being below that of the 
previous year.
Meier Verpackungen, which we acquired in 
September 2015 as our first business in 
Austria, grew well with an increase in sales 
of food and meat packaging products more 
than offsetting lower fruit and vegetable 
packaging sales which were disrupted by a 
poor local harvest due to extreme weather 
conditions in the spring. 
In Denmark, revenue increased strongly, 
in particular due to higher sales to the 
horeca sector, food processors and 
redistributors as well as higher demand 
for personal protection equipment. Sales 
to customers serving the retail sector 
improved marginally while sales to 
customers in the public sector were flat 
following the loss of one major account. 
As a result of the overall revenue growth, 
the operating profit also increased. 
The acquisition of Saebe Compagniet 
was completed in early January 2017 
and has further strengthened our 
cleaning & hygiene operations.
In the Netherlands, sales grew modestly 
with mixed performances across the 
sectors that we serve. The results were 
particularly impacted by De Ridder which 
delivered a weaker performance in 2016, 
having benefitted in the prior year from 
unusually high sales of products to 
government agencies.
In Belgium, sales continued to increase in 
the cleaning & hygiene sector as a result of 
additional business with a number of larger 
customers although this growth was partly 
offset by lower sales in the grocery and food 
processor sectors. Gross margins were 
stable but operating profit was impacted 
by higher temporary costs linked to the 
implementation of a new ERP system in 
one of the hygiene businesses.
In Germany, sales again grew well with both 
national and regional accounts and gross 
margins improved. Some cost reductions 
and efficiency gains following the 2015 
implementation of a new ERP system also 
helped lead to a significant increase in 
operating profit. In May 2016 we acquired 
Inkozell and Mo Ha Ge, both active in the 
distribution of incontinence products to 
‘at home’ end users and care homes. The 
businesses are integrating well with our 
other German operations.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review In Spain, sales grew well in both the 
cleaning & hygiene and safety sectors due 
to a combination of customer wins and 
product range extension. The cleaning & 
hygiene business relocated to a new 
warehouse in Madrid to provide a platform 
for further growth and efficiency gains. 
Quirumed, the healthcare products 
business acquired in January 2015, saw 
lower sales but improved profitability due 
to cost reduction measures. Cemelim and 
Faru, both acquired in the last quarter of 
2015, have integrated well with Cemelim 
now fully merged into our cleaning & 
hygiene business. Overall profitability 
in Spain increased significantly.
In Israel, sales have grown rapidly in the 
horeca sector and also increased in the 
bakery sector despite disruption caused 
by a warehouse relocation following a fire. 
Margins improved in both areas and careful 
cost control led to a substantial rise in 
operating profit.
In central Europe, revenue rose strongly 
in all of our local businesses from new 
customer wins as well as increased levels 
of activity with existing customers and 
underlying profits rose accordingly. In 
August we completed the acquisition of 
Blyth, a specialist distributor of personal 
protection equipment based in the Czech 
Republic, and in September we bought 
Silwell, which is based in Hungary and 
sells disposable foodservice items to 
the horeca sector. Both businesses are 
integrating well with our existing 
operations in those countries.
In Turkey, sales at our personal protection 
equipment business, Istanbul Ticaret which 
was acquired at the end of May 2015, grew 
strongly despite the uncertain environment 
in the country following the failed coup 
attempt in July. The weaker Turkish lira 
has, however, put pressure on margins. 
At the end of March 2016 we acquired 
Bursa Pazari, a distributor of packaging 
and other foodservice supplies and 
disposable gloves, which has subsequently 
traded ahead of expectations. 
We continue to roll out our common 
e-commerce platform across the business 
area. After launching this at our first 
company in late 2015, a further five 
businesses went live on the system during 
2016. This will be further rolled out in 2017, 
helping to drive both sales growth and cost 
efficiencies going forward.
Bunzl acquired its first business in Continental 
Europe with the purchase of Hopa Disposables in the 
Netherlands in 1994. This was followed by acquisitions 
in Germany, Denmark and France in 1997, 2000 and 
2004 respectively. By 2010 the business had expanded 
through acquisition into a further eight countries and 
today operates in 14 countries across the continent.
Our broad portfolio 
of operations across 
a variety of market 
sectors and countries 
means we are 
a balanced and 
resilient business 
that has delivered 
consistently good 
results over time.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 In UK & Ireland revenue decreased by 2% 
to £1,087.8 million and operating profit was 
also 2% lower at £83.7 million. The 
previously announced loss of an account in 
food retail at the beginning of 2016 
combined with subdued market conditions 
in the UK resulted in a weaker performance 
compared to 2015 with organic revenue 
declining by 3%. Although a significant 
amount of our products sold are essential 
everyday items, some uncertainty, which 
was seen in the run up to the EU 
referendum in June, continued across 
certain of our markets in the second half of 
2016, most notably in relation to investment 
in the hospitality and construction sectors. 
We completed four acquisitions during 
the year which, due to the timing of their 
completion, will have a greater impact on 
the results in 2017. 
Despite our safety business successfully 
winning new business with a number of 
major companies, it continues to operate 
in sluggish markets. This is particularly 
so in the construction sector where the 
lack of major government investment in 
infrastructure has delayed projects and in 
the oil & gas sector where production has 
been curtailed, in both cases resulting in 
reduced demand for protective clothing and 
equipment. The business undertook a 
restructuring at the end of 2015 to reduce 
its cost base further and has continued to 
develop its own label product offering 
which has resulted in increased levels of 
profitability. We have also continued to 
invest in both people and technology to help 
drive operational efficiencies. Our cleaning 
& hygiene business has continued to 
perform well in a competitive marketplace 
and has similarly invested in additional 
technology, most notably in vehicle 
telematics and e-commerce enhancements, 
to improve our efficiency and enhance our 
levels of customer service.
The food retail business has been 
successfully restructured following the 
account loss at the start of 2016 and has 
recently won new business with a clearly 
defined value proposition supported by an 
improved suite of customer centric 
technology. The acquisition of Classic Bag 
in May complements our existing non-food 
retail business which has performed well 
during the year, growing with both existing 
and new customers, completing a re-brand 
and delivering innovative new packaging 
solutions to the high street retail sector. Our 
recent acquisition of Woodway in December 
has further strengthened our offering in 
high quality packaging products. It provides 
bespoke value-added services through a 
specialist technical services team that gives 
customers a complete solution for their 
distribution packaging needs, particularly 
relating to their e-commerce activities. 
Finally, our marketing services business 
has continued to develop its online 
marketing tools for customers alongside 
the fulfilment of point-of-sale products and 
has created capacity for further growth by 
opening an additional distribution centre. 
By outsourcing 
the purchasing, 
consolidation 
and distribution of 
everyday essential 
items, our customers 
are able to focus on 
their core businesses, 
saving them time 
and money.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review The catering and hospitality sector has 
continued to be both competitive and 
challenging with many customers cutting 
back on future investments, particularly 
in kitchen design and heavy catering 
equipment. However, our proposition 
remains strong and we have managed to 
win a long term contract with a major 
contract caterer across a range of non-food 
areas, adding expertise and value to the 
customer offering. We have invested heavily 
in digital technology with both new web and 
app developments giving our customers 
sophisticated tools to help them run their 
businesses better. We continue to grow our 
exclusive brand product offering, creating 
new ranges that offer both quality and value 
and the addition of Tri-Star Packaging in 
September has further expanded our reach 
with ‘food-to-go’ retailers, contract 
caterers and food processors.
Although the UK healthcare market 
continues to be under pressure from 
ongoing government imposed spending 
constraints, our healthcare business has 
continued to grow in both the public and 
private acute sectors. Our business that is 
focused on own brand products has been 
challenged by both rapid commoditisation 
and the significant weakening of sterling in 
the wake of the EU referendum vote but has 
continued to develop new value-adding 
products and has also increased sales 
overseas. The care home supplies business 
continues to grow against a backdrop of an 
ageing UK population needing more care. 
Our business in Ireland experienced 
excellent growth throughout the year and 
profitability improved as we continued to 
put a greater focus on margin improving 
initiatives. All sectors benefited, from 
catering, hospitality and retail through to 
cleaning & hygiene and safety. We are 
investing in a new purpose built warehouse 
in Northern Ireland to support future 
growth. Finally, the acquisition in 
September of Kingsbury Packaging has 
further expanded our product offering and 
extended our customer base in the 
foodservice and food retail sectors.
It is difficult to give a firm view as to the 
probable impact of the 2016 referendum 
result in the UK as the terms of leaving 
the European Union are not yet known. 
However, with more than 85% of our 
business based outside the UK, we do not 
currently expect the impact on the Group’s 
overall operations to be significant.
 The acquisition of Automatic Catering Supplies in 1993 
marked the beginning of the Group’s expansion into 
Europe. Bunzl subsequently entered the cleaning & 
hygiene sector in 1996, the retail and grocery sectors 
in 1999 and the healthcare and safety sectors in 
2000. Since then the UK & Ireland business area has 
continued to develop significantly with annual revenue 
now in excess of £1 billion.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 In Rest of the World revenue increased 11% 
to £624.1 million and operating profit was up 
4%. With no organic revenue growth, the 
results benefitted from the impact of 
acquisitions made in 2015, particularly in 
Latin America. Margins remained under 
pressure due to the challenging 
macroeconomic conditions and the impact 
of currency movements which affected 
those businesses that import large volumes 
of products. As a result, the business area 
operating margin reduced by 50 basis points 
at constant exchange rates to 7.5%.
In Brazil, the economic and political 
volatility has continued although the market 
has begun to show some signs of greater 
stability following the challenges faced 
during the Presidential impeachment 
process. Despite some of the sectors we 
serve experiencing ongoing market 
weakness, our diversified business portfolio 
enabled us to grow our underlying revenue 
and maintain operating profit. In our safety 
business, due to the continued impact of our 
customers postponing investments and 
higher levels of unemployment, sales and 
margins grew only slightly. Operating 
margins were impacted by the cost of 
restructuring measures undertaken during 
the year to reposition the business for the 
anticipated upturn. The challenging market 
conditions also affected Casa do EPI, 
acquired in November 2015, which 
performed below our expectations due to 
soft demand in Minas Gerais, particularly in 
the mining sector. Further steps were taken 
to integrate fully Casa do EPI with our 
Prot Cap business which is expected to 
generate future synergies and strengthen 
our end user personal protection 
equipment offering. 
The cleaning & hygiene sector in Brazil 
continued to be adversely affected by the 
difficult market conditions. Large account 
losses by several key contract cleaning 
customers reduced sales volumes while 
intense competition also impacted margins. 
To combat these declines, operating costs 
were reduced and we moved our São Paulo 
headquarters to a more efficient and lower 
cost location. A new online B2B platform 
was also developed and launched, 
the results of which have so far been 
very encouraging. 
In contrast, our healthcare businesses in 
Brazil saw strong sales growth, particularly 
with imported products. The highly 
successful integration of Labor and 
Lamedid, which consolidated three 
warehouses into one, led to cost synergies 
with minimal business interruption and 
operating profits grew significantly. Dental 
Sorria, acquired in December 2015, has 
settled in well and towards the end of the 
year moved into new premises which will 
improve service levels and support further 
growth. We continue to see the growing 
healthcare sector in Brazil as one of the 
most attractive markets in which to invest.
In the rest of Latin America, the picture is 
more positive with our overall business 
trading in line with our expectations. In 
Chile, Vicsa grew sales and significantly 
improved its gross margins through product 
We source products 
from all over the 
world, liaising closely 
with our suppliers so 
that we are able to 
offer a full range of 
items which satisfy 
our customers’ 
demands.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review  The current operations of the Group in 
Rest of the World started in 1983 with the

of other businesses throughout Australia 
and New Zealand over the next 30 years. 
The Group’s first move into Latin America 
was in 2008 with the acquisition of Prot Cap

mix management. Tecno Boga, on the other 
hand, suffered from lower demand for its 
premium footwear products in the mining 
industry which impacted both sales and 
margins. New product lines were launched 
to reverse this trend and operating costs 
were reduced. DPS, our catering 
disposables business, traded in line with 
expectations but achieved higher operating 
margins due to strong purchasing initiatives.
In Colombia, our business grew sales 
well. Solmaq, acquired in June 2015, 
performed in line with our expectations 
and relocated its offices and warehouse 
to more suitable locations.
In Mexico, our safety business grew sales 
and operating profit through successful 
margin management initiatives combined 
with good cost control. The outcome of the 
US Presidential election resulted in a sharp 
devaluation in the Mexican peso towards the 
end of the year but the business was able to 
mitigate much of this impact with selling 
price adjustments. However, in the short 
term we expect more volatility and 
uncertainty in the Mexican market but our 
business is well prepared to react to these 
changing conditions. 
In Australasia, the market conditions also 
remained challenging throughout the year. 
There were, however, some positive signs in 
the resources sector towards the end of the 
year with commodity prices improving. 
While our business in Australasia has a 
significant exposure to this sector, our 
business strategy continues to focus on 
developing a sustainable position in more 
resilient market sectors to enable our 
operations to remain strong throughout all 
economic cycles. 
Our largest business, Outsourcing Services, 
has been impacted by the market downturn 
and currency related margin pressure. 
However, the business is focused on the 
more resilient healthcare, cleaning, 
catering and retail sectors and is well 
placed to take advantage of changes to 
government funding for community 
healthcare. We are also continuing to work 
with new and existing customers to develop 
supply solutions. Part of this will come from 
the work we have underway with our new 
digital trading platform to create an efficient 
and easy to access online mobile customer 
portal. In addition, we migrated two of our 
recently acquired businesses onto the main 
ERP system and also consolidated the 
Newcastle warehouse operation into the 
larger and more efficient Enfield operation 
in Sydney. We will shortly relocate the 
Melbourne head office and distribution 
centre into a larger and more efficient 
facility in Dandenong and will also 
consolidate our two healthcare businesses 
in Victoria. 
Our food processor business also faced a 
number of challenges throughout 2016. This 
was due mainly to a shortage of livestock as 
a result of severe drought conditions in 
some regions causing plant closures and 
reduced operating schedules which 
impacted our results in these areas. This 
sector should recover as the herds are 
replenished. The ongoing business strategy 
has been to continue to diversify our 
presence across the wider food processor 
sector and, as such, we continue to make 
good progress with these endeavours. The 
business has had a number of major 
customer wins across Australia and New 
Zealand and we should see the benefit of 
this diversification through the coming year. 
Our industrial and safety supplies business 
has again been the most impacted by the 
resources market downturn in Australia, 
particularly in the regions that support this 
sector. We have been working hard to widen 
our operations into sectors outside mining 
and have made solid progress developing 
new business opportunities in the 
construction, energy and government 
sectors. We have also continued to reduce 
costs by consolidating facilities and 
reorganising the business to fit the current 
market environment. By doing so we have 
been able to maintain our market presence 
by retaining our regional footprint to ensure 
that we are able to capitalise quickly as the 
market starts to improve. An upgrade of our 
ERP system in the industrial and safety 
businesses has been successfully 
completed. This forms part of our ongoing 
technology investment and will enable us 
to streamline our operational platform 
and processes to help drive productivity 
and enhance our competitive position. 
We will continue to evaluate opportunities 
across our national footprint and, where 
applicable, consolidate facilities and 
realign the business to the prevailing 
market conditions.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review Providing development  
and training opportunities
We endeavour to ensure that everyone takes 
personal responsibility for themselves to 
grow within their roles. Where appropriate 
to do so, we foster internal appointments 
and promotions and support personal 
development through formal training 
programmes, as well as help to provide 
learning on the job.
Encouraging feedback  
and communication
A combination of regular employee 
engagement surveys, company social media 
sites and intranet and video technologies 
allows us to receive feedback from our 
workforce and to collaborate effectively 
across the world.
Valuing our people
Our decentralised organisation structure 
provides the framework for how we do 
business. Local autonomy, within a clearly 
defined Group strategy, underpins everything 
we do such that, despite our size, we retain the 
culture of a dynamic, local business for both 
our employees and customers with our teams 
incentivised to provide a high quality service 
and produce sustainable returns.
The acquisition of businesses is a key 
part of our strategy to grow and develop 
and we are proud of our track record of 
retaining former owners and other key 
staff of the companies we acquire. We 
value highly their local knowledge and 
expertise which is essential to ensure 
that the successful ongoing customer 
relationships are maintained.
One of the main 
objectives of selling 
our family business 
to Bunzl was to give 
us access to their 
extensive knowledge, 
experience and 
resources in order to 
grow and develop our 
operations further .

Group performance
With more than 85% of the Group’s revenue 
generated outside the UK, the weakening 
of sterling against most currencies has 
had a significant positive translation 
impact on the Group’s reported results 
increasing revenue, profits and earnings 
by approximately 10%.
Revenue increased to £7,429.1 million 
(2015: £6,489.7 million), up 4% at constant 
exchange rates and 14% at actual exchange 
rates, reflecting the benefit of acquisitions 
and some growth in the underlying 
businesses. Adjusted operating profit 
(being operating profit before customer 
relationships amortisation and acquisition 
related costs) increased to £525.0 million 
(2015: £455.0 million), an increase of 5% at 
constant exchange rates and 15% at actual 
exchange rates. At both constant and actual 
exchange rates, the adjusted operating 
profit margin increased from 7.0% to 7.1% 
due to the impact of higher margin 
acquisitions. Customer relationships 
amortisation and acquisition related costs 
increased £26.8 million to £115.3 million 
due to a £14.5 million increase in customer 
relationships amortisation and a £12.3 
million increase in acquisition related costs. 
The net interest expense of £46.8 million 
was £3.0 million higher than in 2015 at 
actual exchange rates but down £0.8 million 
at constant exchange rates principally due 
to a reduction in the net interest expense 
associated with the Group’s pension 
schemes. Adjusted profit before income tax 
(being profit before income tax, customer 
relationships amortisation and acquisition 
related costs) was £478.2 million (2015: 
£411.2 million), up 6% at constant exchange 
rates and up 16% at actual exchange rates, 
principally due to the growth in adjusted 
operating profit.
Tax
The tax rate on adjusted profit for the year 
was 26.9% (2015: 27.5%). The reduction in 
the rate compared with recent years is 
principally due to one-off benefits in 2016 
which are not expected to be repeated 
in 2017. In addition, enacted changes in tax 
legislation will increase the taxable base 
which will increase the tax rate in the 
coming year. It is therefore expected that 
the tax rate on adjusted profit for 2017 will 
be between 1.5 and 2.0 percentage points 
higher than in 2016. This estimate does not 
seek to anticipate the impact of other 
potential changes for which legislation has 
not been published. As noted in the

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Financial review Principal risks and uncertainties section 
on page 37 the Group is monitoring the 
development of proposals for tax reforms in 
the US. The reported tax rate on statutory 
profit before tax was 26.7% (2015: 27.9%).
Profit for the year
Profit after tax of £265.9 million was up 
£33.2 million, primarily due to a £43.2 
million increase in operating profit offset 
by a £3.0 million increase in the net interest 
expense and a £7.0 million increase in the 
tax charge.
Earnings
The weighted average number of shares 
increased to 329.4 million from 327.6 million 
in 2015 due to employee share option 
exercises, partly offset by shares being 
purchased from the market for the Group’s 
employee benefit trust. Earnings per share 
were 80.7p, up 4% on 2015 at constant 
exchange rates and 14% at actual exchange 
rates. After adjusting for customer 
relationships amortisation, acquisition 
related costs and the associated tax, 
adjusted earnings per share were 106.1p, an 
increase on 2015 of 6% at constant exchange 
rates and 17% at actual exchange rates. 
Customer relationships amortisation, 
acquisition related costs and associated tax 
are items which are not taken into account 
by management when assessing the results 
of the business as they do not relate to the 
underlying operating performance. 
Accordingly, such items are removed in 
calculating the adjusted earnings per share 
on which management assesses the 
performance of the Group. For further 
details of this and other non-GAAP 
measures see Note 2w to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 102. 
Dividends
An analysis of dividends per share for the 
years to which they relate is shown below:
2016 2015 Growth
Interim dividend (p) 13.00 11.75 11%
Final dividend (p) 29.00 26.25 10%
Total dividend (p) 42.00 38.00 11%
Dividend cover 
(times)* 2.5 2.4
* Based on adjusted earnings per share.
The Company’s practice has been to pay 
a progressive dividend with the aim 
of delivering year-on-year increases in 
dividends, growing at approximately the 
same rate as the growth in adjusted 
earnings per share. The 2016 dividend is 11% 
higher than the 2015 dividend, compared to 
the adjusted earnings per share which have 
grown by 6% at constant exchange rates and 
17% at actual exchange rates. Bunzl has 
sustained a growing dividend to 
shareholders over the past 24 years. 
Before approving any dividends, the Board 
considers the level of borrowings of the 
Group by reference to the ratio of net debt 
to operating profit before depreciation, 
amortisation and acquisition related costs 
(‘EBITDA’), the ability of the Group to 
continue to generate cash and the amount 
required to invest in the business, in 
particular into future acquisitions. The 
Company’s long term track record of strong 
cash generation, coupled with the Group’s 
substantial borrowing facilities, provides 
the Company with the financial flexibility to 
enable dividends to be funded. 
The risks and constraints to maintaining 
a growing dividend are principally those 
linked to the Group’s trading performance 
and liquidity, as described in the Principal 
risks and uncertainties section on pages 
35 to 37. The Group has substantial 
distributable reserves within Bunzl plc 
and there is a robust process of 
distributing profits generated by subsidiary 
undertakings up through the Group to Bunzl 
plc. At 31 December 2016 Bunzl plc had 
sufficient distributable reserves to cover 
more than three years of dividends at the 
cost of the 2016 dividends, which is expected 
to be approximately £139 million. 
Acquisitions
We completed 12 acquisitions and agreed to 
acquire two further businesses during the 
year ended 31 December 2016. The 
estimated annualised revenue and adjusted 
operating profit of the businesses acquired 
were £182.3 million and £21.5 million 
respectively. Including the two businesses 
agreed to be acquired during 2016 but which 
completed in January 2017, the estimated 
annualised revenue was £201.1 million. 
A summary of the effect of acquisitions is 
as follows:
£m
Fair value of net assets acquired 86.4 
Goodwill 51.0

Total cash outflow in respect of 
acquisitions 176.6
*  Cash flow on acquisition related costs relates to £5.9 
million of transaction costs paid and £11.1 million of 
payments relating to the retention of former owners.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations before 
acquisition related costs was £546.7 million, 
an £81.7 million increase from 2015, 
primarily due to a £70.0 million increase in 
adjusted operating profit. The Group’s free 
cash flow of £355.5 million was up £45.3 
million from 2015, primarily due to the £81.7 
million increase in cash generated from 
operations, partly offset by a £30.7 million 
increase in the cash outflow relating to tax. 
After payment of dividends of £125.4 million 
in respect of 2015 (2015: £116.1 million in 
respect of 2014), an acquisition cash outflow 
of £176.6 million (2015: £371.2 million) and a 
£37.5 million outflow on employee share 
schemes (2015: £29.5 million), the net cash 
inflow was £16.0 million (2015: £206.6

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Financial review continued
from underlying business activities. No 
transactions of a speculative nature are 
undertaken. The treasury department is 
subject to periodic independent review by 
the internal audit department. Underlying 
policy assumptions and activities are 
periodically reviewed by the executive 
directors and the Board. Controls over 
exposure changes and transaction 
authenticity are in place.
The Group continually monitors net debt and 
forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient 
facilities are in place to meet the Group’s 
requirements in the short, medium and 
long term and, in order to do so, arranges 
borrowings from a variety of sources. 
Additionally, compliance with the Group’s 
biannual debt covenants is monitored on 
a monthly basis and formally tested at 
30 June and 31 December. The principal 
covenant limits are net debt, calculated at 
average exchange rates, to EBITDA of no 
more than 3.5 times and interest cover of 
no less than 3.0 times. Sensitivity analyses 
using various scenarios are applied to 
forecasts to assess their impact on 
covenants and net debt. During 2016 all 
covenants were complied with and based 
on current forecasts it is expected that 
such covenants will continue to be complied 
with for the foreseeable future.
The Group has substantial borrowing 
facilities available comprising multi-
currency credit facilities from the Group’s 
banks and US private placement notes 
denominated in US dollars, sterling and 
euros. At 31 December 2016 the nominal 
total of US private placement notes 
outstanding was £1,251.1 million (2015: 
£1,001.9 million) with maturities ranging 
from 2017 to 2028. The Group’s committed 
bank facilities mature between 2017 and 
2022. At 31 December 2016 the available 
committed bank facilities totalled £954.2 
million (2015: £969.0 million) of which 
£101.3 million (2015: £154.9 million) was 
drawn down.

Balance sheet
Return on average operating capital 
increased to 55.9% from 55.5% in 2015, 
driven by an improvement in the operating 
capital in the underlying business, partly 
offset by an adverse impact from exchange 
rate movements, a slightly lower underlying 
operating margin and the impact of the 
lower return on operating capital from 
acquisitions. Return on invested capital of 
16.7% was down from 17.1% in 2015 
principally due to the effect of acquisitions 
and limited organic growth. 
Intangible assets increased by £301.5 
million to £1,947.6 million due to an increase 
from exchange of £249.9 million, intangible 
assets arising on acquisitions in the year of 
£131.3 million and software additions of 
£7.3 million, partly offset by an amortisation 
charge of £87.0 million. The Group’s net 
pension deficit of £84.1 million at 
31 December 2016 was £44.1 million higher 
than at 31 December 2015, largely due to an 
actuarial loss of £42.4 million. The actuarial 
loss arose largely as a result of the impact 
of an £81.7 million increase in the present 
value of scheme liabilities from changes in 
assumptions, principally lower discount 
rates, partly offset by the actual return on 
scheme assets being £39.3 million higher 
than expected.
Net debt to EBITDA calculated at average 
exchange rates was 2.0 times (2015: 2.1 
times). The movements in shareholders’ 
equity and net debt during the year were 
as follows:
Shareholders’ equity £m

Group tax strategy
The Group’s tax strategy is to comply with 
tax laws in all of the countries in which it 
operates and to balance its responsibilities 
for controlling the tax costs with its 
responsibilities to pay tax where it does 
business. Therefore management of taxes 
is carried out within defined parameters. 
The Group’s tax strategy has been approved 
by the Board and tax risks are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base so as to maintain investor, 
creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. 
The Group funds its operations through 
a mixture of shareholders’ equity and bank 
and capital market borrowings. All of the 
borrowings are managed by a central 
treasury function and funds raised are 
lent onward to operating subsidiaries as 
required. The overall objective is to 
manage the funding to ensure the Group 
has a portfolio of competitively priced 
borrowing facilities to meet the demands 
of the business over time. There were no 
changes to the Group’s approach to capital 
management during the year and the 
Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements. 
Treasury policies and controls
The Group has a centralised treasury 
department to control external borrowings 
and manage liquidity, interest rate and 
foreign currency and credit risks. Treasury 
policies have been approved by the Board 
and cover the nature of the exposure to be 
hedged, the types of financial instruments 
that may be employed and the criteria for 
investing and borrowing cash. The Group 
uses derivatives to manage its foreign 
currency and interest rate risks arising

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Financial review Principal risks and uncertainties
Bunzl has an extensive 
risk management 
framework designed 
to identify and assess 
the likelihood of risks 
arising, and the 
consequences of 
them doing so, and 
subsequently manage 
the actions necessary 
in order to mitigate their 
impact to acceptable 
levels. It also identifies 
the assurance activities 
relating to the relevant 
mitigating actions. 
Risk overview
The effective identification, management 
and mitigation of risks and uncertainties 
across the Group are an integral part of 
successfully delivering the Group’s strategic 
objectives. The ‘Risk management and 
internal control’ section of the Corporate 
governance report on page 54 includes 
further information on the specific 
procedures designed to identify, manage 
and mitigate risks which could have a 
material impact on the Group’s business, 
financial condition or results of operations 
and for monitoring the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems. 
The Company’s risk management 
framework provides a consistent 
methodology by which every business and 
business area, the Executive Committee 
and ultimately the Board assess the risks 
that the Group faces against a defined set of 
probability and impact criteria. In assessing 
impact, the following criteria are 
considered: business continuity; health, 
safety and the environment; regulatory; 
reputational; and financial. The probability 
and impact of each risk is assessed on two 
bases. The first, defined as Gross Risk, is 
the probability and impact of a risk if none 
of the mitigating actions or internal controls 
designed to reduce either the probability or 
the impact of a risk occurring were in place. 
The second, defined as Net Risk, is the 
residual probability and impact of a risk 
assuming that the mitigating actions and 
internal controls operated as intended in 
an effective way.
Using this framework, every business 
documents its key risks in a consistent 
reporting format which specifically 
identifies the mitigating activities, relevant 
controls and related assurance activities 
for each significant risk. Management then 
consolidates the risk information at both 
a business area and Group level using 
the same reporting format, culminating 
in the Group risk assessment. The Executive 
Committee then reviews the Group risk 
assessment, the relevant controls and other 
steps taken to mitigate the risks identified 
and the assurance procedures in place over 
such controls with a view to determining 
any further actions required in order to 
reduce the levels of risk to acceptable 
levels. The risk assessment is then 
submitted for review and approval by the 
Board. The Audit Committee also reviews 
the process for the management of risk 
and the assurance procedures over controls 
designed to manage key risks. Accordingly, 
the directors confirm that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
The risk profile
The Group operates in many business 
environments and across a number of 
geographies in which risks and 
uncertainties exist, not all of which are 
necessarily within the Company’s control. 
The risks identified in the 2015 Annual 
Report remain those of most concern to 
the business at the end of 2016. 
Although the principal risks affecting the 
Group are unchanged from the previous 
year, the Board is continuing to monitor 
the potential risks associated with the 
June 2016 referendum vote for the UK 
to leave the European Union. The position 
is presently unclear and it is too early to 
understand properly the impact that the 
UK leaving the European Union will have 
on the Group’s operations. However these 
risks are most likely to relate to the impact 
of foreign exchange volatility, an economic 
slowdown in the UK and the imposition of 
trade tariffs. Of these risks, the first two 
have already been identified as principal 
risks for the Group, further details of which 
are set out below under ‘Foreign exchange’ 
and ‘Economic environment’. The risk 
relating to trade tariffs is considered to be 
a Group risk but is not currently thought 
to be a principal risk.
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors 
have taken account of the Group’s principal 
risks in assessing the prospects of the 
Company when considering whether 
there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue operations 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment. 
The principal risks and uncertainties faced 
by the Group and the steps taken to 
mitigate such risks and uncertainties are 
summarised below. The risks identified 
do not comprise all of the risks that the 
Group may face and accordingly this 
summary is not intended to be exhaustive 
and is not presented in order of potential 
probability or impact.

Risk Description Mitigating factors
Competitive  
pressures
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and faces 
competition from international companies as well as national, 
regional and local companies in the countries in which it operates. 
Increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors 
or customers could lead to an adverse effect on results and hinder 
the Group’s growth potential. This could result from: customer 
pressure on sales volumes or margins; the loss of customers 
due to service or pricing issues; increased price competition; 
customers and suppliers dealing directly with one another; 
or unforeseen changes in the competitive landscape due to 
the introduction of disruptive technologies or changes in routes 
to market.
The Group seeks to remain competitive by maintaining high 
service levels and close contacts with its customers to ensure that 
their needs and demands are being met satisfactorily, developing 
a national presence in the markets in which the Group operates 
and maintaining strong relationships with a variety of different 
suppliers, thereby enabling the Group to offer a broad range of 
products to its customers, including own brand products, in a 
consolidated one-stop-shop offering. The Group also regularly 
reviews the competitive environment in which it operates.
Product 
price 
changes
The purchase price of products distributed by the Group can 
fluctuate from time to time, thereby potentially affecting the 
results of operations. There could be significant increases in the 
cost of specific products leading to a diminution in margins if cost 
increases cannot be passed on in full to customers or substitute 
products sourced from elsewhere. Potential causes could include 
changes in the input costs of products purchased through 
commodity price inflation. In addition, a period of commodity price 
deflation may lead to reductions in the price and value of the 
Group’s products where sales prices are indexed or if competitors 
reduced their selling prices. If this was to occur, the Group’s 
revenue and, as a result, its profits, could be reduced and the 
value of inventory held in stock may not be fully recoverable.
The Group endeavours, whenever possible, to pass on price 
increases from its suppliers to its customers and to source its 
products from a number of different suppliers so that it is not 
dependent on any one source of supply for any particular product. 
Increased focus on the Group’s own import programmes and 
brands, together with the reinforcement of the Group’s service and 
product offering to customers, helps to minimise the impact of 
price deflation. The Group also mitigates against the risk of holding 
overvalued inventory in a deflationary environment by managing 
stock levels efficiently and ensuring they are kept to a minimum.
The Group uses its considerable experience in sourcing and selling 
products to manage prices during periods of both inflation and 
deflation in order to minimise the impact on operating margins.
Economic 
environment
The Group’s business is partially dependent on general economic 
conditions in the US, the UK, the Eurozone and other important 
markets. A significant deterioration in these conditions could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s business and results 
of operations.
The Group’s operations and its customer base are diverse, with 
a variable and flexible cost base, and many of the sectors in which 
it competes are traditionally, by their nature, relatively resilient 
to economic downturns.
Financial risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Foreign 
exchange
The majority of the Group’s sales are made and income is earned 
in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies. The Group does 
not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on 
translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates. 
As a result, movements in exchange rates may have a material 
translation impact on the Group’s reported results.
The Group is also subject to transaction exposures where 
products are purchased in one currency and sold in another. 
As a result, movements in exchange rates may also adversely 
impact both operating margins and the value of the Group’s 
net assets.
The Group believes that the benefits of its geographical spread 
outweigh the associated risks.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the 
functional currency of the Group’s operations. As a result, 
transaction exposures are usually limited and exchange rate 
fluctuations have minimal effect on the quality of earnings unless 
there is a sudden and significant adverse movement of a foreign 
currency in which products are purchased which may lead to a 
delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases. 
The Group undertakes some forward purchasing of foreign 
currencies for identified exposures to reduce the impact of short 
term volatility.
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and related 
hedging activity is regularly monitored by senior management. 
The Group’s approach to managing foreign exchange risk is 
reviewed annually by the Board. 
Financial 
liquidity  
and debt 
covenants
The Group needs continuous access to funding in order to meet its 
trading obligations, to support investment in organic growth, to 
make acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise, and to 
pay dividends to shareholders. There is a risk that the Group may 
be unable to obtain the necessary funds when required or that 
such funds will only be available on unfavourable terms.
The Group’s borrowing facilities include a requirement to comply 
with certain specified covenants in relation to the level of net debt 
and interest cover. A breach of these covenants could result from 
a significant and rapid deterioration in the business’s 
performance, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or the failure 
to manage working capital levels. Ultimately this could result in 
a significant proportion of the Group’s borrowings becoming 
repayable immediately.
The Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different 
sources and continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows 
to ensure that it will be able to meet its financial obligations as they 
fall due and that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Group’s 
requirements in the short, medium and long term.
Compliance with the Group’s biannual debt covenants is monitored 
on a monthly basis based on the management accounts. Sensitivity 
analyses using various scenarios are applied to forecasts to assess 
their impact on covenants.
The majority of the Group’s borrowings are effectively denominated 
in US dollars, sterling and euros, aligning them to the respective 
functional currencies of the component parts of the Group’s EBITDA. 
This currency composition minimises the impact of movements in 
foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.

Taxation
In an increasingly complex corporate tax environment, it is 
possible that changes in tax law, including those that might arise 
from the OECD’s current Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, 
may lead to higher tax rates for many international businesses, 
thereby adversely affecting the Group’s future cash flows.
Following the change in administration in the US, there is also an 
increased likelihood that future tax reform there could affect the 
Group’s results, either positively or negatively. 
Oversight of the Group’s tax strategy is within the remit of the 
Board. The Group seeks to plan and manage its tax affairs 
efficiently but also responsibly with a view to ensuring that it 
complies fully with the relevant legal obligations in the countries 
in which the Group operates while endeavouring to manage its tax 
affairs to protect value for the Company’s shareholders in line with 
the Board’s broader fiduciary duties.
The Group manages and controls these risks through an internal 
tax department made up of experienced tax professionals who 
exercise judgement and seek appropriate advice from specialist 
professional firms. At the same time the Group monitors 
international developments in tax law and practice, adapting its 
approach where necessary to do so. Tax risks are assessed by the 
Audit Committee and are also incorporated within the Group risk 
assessment reviewed by the Board as part of the formal 
governance process relating to risk management.
Operational risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Acquisitions
A significant portion of the Group’s historical growth has been 
achieved through the acquisition of businesses and the Group’s 
growth strategy includes additional acquisitions. Although the 
Group operates in a number of fragmented markets which provide 
future acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that 
the Group will be able to make acquisitions in the future. There is 
also a risk that not all of the acquisitions made will be successful 
due to the loss of key people or customers after the acquisition, 
deterioration in the economic environment of the acquired 
business or the failure to perform adequate pre-acquisition due 
diligence or appropriately manage the post-acquisition integration 
of the business. 
In the longer term, if an acquisition consistently underperforms 
compared to its original investment case, there is a risk that this 
will lead to a permanent impairment in the carrying value of the 
intangible assets arising on that acquisition.
The Group’s acquisition strategy is to focus on those businesses 
which operate in sectors where it has or can develop competitive 
advantage and which have good growth opportunities. The Group 
continually reviews acquisition targets and has established 
processes and procedures with regard to detailed pre-acquisition 
due diligence and post-acquisition integration.
The Group endeavours to maximise the performance of an 
acquisition through the recruitment and retention of high quality 
and appropriately incentivised management combined with 
effective strategic planning, investment in resources and 
infrastructure and regular reviews of performance by both 
business area and Group management.
Business 
continuity
The Group would be adversely affected if any of its major 
distribution facilities was destroyed or damaged or there was a 
significant failure of its information systems resulting from either 
hardware failure or a cybersecurity breach. 
The Group seeks to reduce the impact of destruction of, or 
damage to, facilities through the use of multi-site facilities 
with products stocked in more than one location together with 
appropriate insurance cover. The impact of information systems’ 
failure is mitigated through regular renewal of hardware, layered 
security measures and disaster recovery plans which are 
periodically tested and which would be implemented in the 
event of any such failure.
  Laws and 
regulations
The international nature of the Group’s operations exposes it to 
potential claims as the Group is subject to a broad range of laws 
and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
In addition, the Group faces potential claims from customers 
in relation to the supply of defective products or breaches of 
their contractual arrangements. The sourcing of products from 
lower cost countries increases the risk of the Group being 
unable to recover any potential losses relating thereto from 
the relevant supplier.
Although the Group does not operate in particularly litigious 
market sectors, it has in place processes to report, manage and 
mitigate against third party litigation using external advisers 
where necessary. 
The use of reputable suppliers and internal quality assurance and 
quality control procedures reduces the risks associated with 
defective products.
Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements includes information relating to the Group’s risk management policies so far as they relate 
to financial instruments.

Business context
We are a focused and successful 
international distribution and outsourcing 
group with operations across the Americas, 
Europe and Australasia. By outsourcing the 
purchasing, consolidation and delivery of a 
broad range of everyday items, our 
customers are able to focus on their core 
businesses, achieve purchasing efficiencies 
and savings, free up working capital, 
improve distribution capabilities, reduce 
carbon emissions and simplify their 
internal administration.
We do not manufacture any products but as 
part of our business strategy we source and 
procure branded, own brand and unbranded 
products globally. These products are then 
consolidated into our extensive global 
warehouse infrastructure, giving our 
customers a one-stop-shop solution to help 
reduce or eliminate the hidden costs of 
self-distribution and reduce their 
environmental impact. We also offer several 
delivery options to ensure our customers 
receive their products when and where they 
are needed.
Sourcing
We source everyday essential non-food 
items for a number of market sectors 
including foodservice, grocery, cleaning & 
hygiene, retail, safety and healthcare. We 
liaise closely with our suppliers so that we 
are able to offer a full range of items which 
satisfy our customers’ demands, including 
offering alternative products which reduce 
their environmental impact and, as a result, 
their effect on climate change. Our quality 
assurance/quality control department 
based in Shanghai monitors and works with 
our key suppliers in Asia to ensure that 
appropriate corporate responsibility (‘CR’) 
standards are in place.
Consolidation
We have an extensive footprint of 
warehouse facilities across four continents. 
Our broad range of products are therefore 
never far from where they need to be, 
allowing us to meet our customers’ needs 
quickly and easily, as well as reducing the 
number of deliveries to our customers, 
thereby cutting fuel usage, carbon 
emissions and administration. 
Whether in the warehouse or on the 
road, our commitment to safety is 
paramount. We are all trained to use 
safe working practices and to make 
sure we look after both ourselves 
and our colleagues.

Distribution
With our fleets of delivery vehicles and 
third party carriers, we are able to get 
products to our customers in a timely 
manner. Our flexible delivery service allows 
our customers to increase the efficiency 
and competitiveness of their operations.
As well as day-to-day operations, our 
business relies on developing strong 
and stable relationships with all of our 
stakeholders. We believe in managing our 
business with integrity, making sustainable, 
long term decisions.
Strategy, framework and materiality 
We believe that positive actions with respect 
to CR are not only desirable in their own 
right but are also of potential economic and 
commercial benefit to the Group. A strong 
reputation for CR can provide business 
advantage and contribute to shareholder 
value. Conversely, perceived weakness in 
CR may damage our reputation and cause 
risks. Bunzl’s good practice in sustainability 
has again been recognised by its FTSE4Good 
listing and CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure 
Project) score. Details of our strategy and 
framework in relation to CR can be found on 
the Bunzl plc website in the Responsibility 
section at www.bunzl.com.
• suppliers: responsible sourcing, 
working as partners with our suppliers 
to encourage high levels of CR and 
ethical trading initiatives; and
• community: providing support by 
encouraging employee fundraising, 
donating to charitable projects that 
benefit our employees and the 
communities we work in and by donating 
stock and cash to charitable organisations 
and good causes.
These issues are governed by a policy 
framework, which is approved and 
monitored by the Board, with 
implementation at a business area level.
Business conduct/code of ethics
The Group’s business conduct/code of 
ethics policy is disseminated to every 
employee as a guide to how employees are 
expected to conduct themselves both from 
a corporate and individual perspective. The 
policy clearly states that employees should 
avoid conflicts of interest, provides guidance 
on the giving and receiving of gifts and 
entertainment, prohibits illegal payments 
as well as political donations and reinforces 
the need to comply with laws, rules and 
regulations, protect confidential information 
and company assets and maintain high 
standards in relationships with our 
customers and suppliers.
No material breaches of our business 
conduct/code of ethics policy were recorded 
in 2016. However, some minor incidents 
relating to employee conduct, such as theft 
or misuse of the Group’s property, did occur 
and were dealt with during the normal 
course of business using Group human 
resources (‘HR’) policies and procedures. 
16 (2015: 17) calls/letters were received 
through our confidential whistleblowing 
process, ‘Speak Up’, none of which related 
to any issues of material concern.
All directors, managers, sales 
representatives and purchasing staff 
are required to undertake all of the CR 
e-learning modules which have been 
developed and enhanced since their original 
launch. There are now a total of 11 modules 
which provide an overview of the business 
conduct/code of ethics policy and anti-
bribery issues such as facilitation payments 
and gifts and entertainment. In addition, we 
refreshed the posters which are displayed 
in all our locations to advertise ‘Speak Up’.

Materiality
Understanding our material issues is 
important to enable us to manage our 
CR related impacts and stakeholder 
relationships effectively. It also helps to 
focus our resources, engagement and 
reporting activities by addressing those 
issues most material to our business. 
Our current areas of focus are:
• business conduct/code of ethics: training 
to ensure everyone understands our 
standards;
• employees: engaging through clear 
communication using a variety of 
channels, as well as provision of training 
and development opportunities;
• health & safety: improving safety in our 
warehouses and on our vehicles and 
ensuring that everyone takes personal 
responsibility for this;
• environment/climate change: reducing 
our and our customers’ impacts on the 
environment by reducing carbon 
emissions and promoting the reduction 
of waste and providing innovative 
products to meet our customers’ needs, 
for example environmentally friendly 
packaging;

The accident incidence rate reduced by 7% and the 
accident severity rate reduced by 31%. The accident 
incidence rate improved in UK & Ireland, Continental 
Europe and Latin America. In North America the 
significant improvement made in the previous year was 
partially offset by the performance of some recently 
acquired businesses. The accident severity rate decreased 
in North America, Continental Europe and UK & Ireland, 
where our focus on behavioural safety and assisted 
return to work programmes appears to be improving our 
performance. Although Latin America saw an increase in 
severity rate, their performance compares favourably with 
other business areas. Australasia’s incidence and severity 
rates have both increased. While their incidence rate is 
only slightly above the Group average, their severity rate 
was adversely affected by two manual handling accidents 
accounting for 68% of their days lost. 
We continue to enhance and extend our Safety

Strategic report | Corporate responsibility Health & safety
Health and safety remains a priority for 
Bunzl and it is our aim that no employee or 
other person should be injured as a result of 
our operations. Regretfully in the 2016 
reporting period there was one fatality 
(2015: two) when a motorcyclist died 
following a collision with a Bunzl car driver. 
We continue to invest in premises and 
equipment to improve the safety of our 
employees and others. Although we aim to 
minimise the risks which occur, particularly 
relating to the operation of our warehouses 
and vehicles, incidents involving manual 
handling, slipping and tripping and impact 
with equipment/objects remain the highest 
causes of accidents and days lost. Together 
these three hazards represent 90% of 
incidents and 92% of days lost. All our 
businesses are required to comply with 
Group policies issued through the Risk 
Management Committee which reviews 
Group safety performance on a quarterly 
basis. Implementation of Group policies is 
audited by a team of safety professionals 
and safety standards are also reviewed as 
part of our internal audit process. The Head 
of Internal Audit has joined the Risk 
Management Committee to integrate CR 
further into our broader risk management 
processes.
Following a successful pilot project, the use 
of telematics has been extended across 
France Hygiene’s commercial fleet which 
is our largest fleet in Continental Europe. 
The majority of commercial vehicles now 
have on-board telematics that enable 
us to improve safety. UK & Ireland have 
completed 37% of the project to fit 
commercial vehicles with multiple cameras, 
side proximity sensors and audible left turn 
and reversing warnings to improve road 
safety both for our drivers and other road 
users, as well as reduce vehicle damage. 
They have also introduced a Safe Urban 
Driving course comprising practical cycling 
and a classroom based session designed to 
provide our commercial drivers with 
first-hand experience of being a vulnerable 
road user.
Our safety awareness programmes are

Employees
Bunzl currently operates in 30 countries 
worldwide. We are a service provider, not a 
manufacturer and, as such, our business 
relies heavily on the skills and experience of 
our employees. We pride ourselves on the 
fact that we run our businesses locally with 
local managers. We do not unfairly 
discriminate and we respect human rights. 
We seek to recruit the right people who are 
passionate about our business and to 
provide opportunities for people to progress 
within the organisation on the basis of their 
skills, experience and aptitude. We believe 
that to get the best from people we need to 
respect each other and encourage honest, 
straightforward communication. Our 
acquisition pipeline continues to be a 
valuable source of management talent for 
the Group and the completion of a number 
of acquisitions during the year has brought 
further highly skilled people into Bunzl. 
Details of the Group’s workforce diversity 
at 31 December 2016 are set out in the 
charts on the right.
Human rights
Bunzl adheres to the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (‘UDHR’) and upholds the 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 
policies, defined by the International Labour 
Organization, as well as applicable local 
laws. The majority of countries in which 
Bunzl operates have their own laws banning 
child and forced labour and promoting 
human rights. We monitor the age of our 
workforce across the world to ensure 
compliance and identify any potential 
succession issues. In the US some of our 
operations, particularly in the north east, 
are represented by trade unions with which 
we have negotiated pay contracts. Bunzl 
does not restrict any of its employees in any 
of the countries in which it operates from 
joining a trade union if they wish to do so. 
We also work closely with our suppliers 
with a view to ensuring that they at least 
meet internationally recognised minimum 
requirements for workers’ welfare and 
conditions of employment, as defined by 
the International Labour Organization or 
the Ethical Trading Initiative, and do not 
use any forced labour.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 high risk groups of workers. Initiatives 
identified at the meeting are being 
implemented across the business. The root 
cause of many incidents is shown to be a 
failure to implement established safe 
working practices. Our Safety Observation 
Programme, providing ongoing feedback to 
our employees on both good and poor safety 
performance, continues to be extended 
across the business. In North America a 
number of sites are evaluating pre-shift 
stretching programmes as a way to reduce 
manual handling injuries. Investment in 
additional Environment, Health & Safety 
(‘EHS’) management resource has occurred 
in North America and Continental Europe. 
During the year we have implemented our 
upgraded web-based EHS reporting system 
in order to provide improved analysis and 
management reports. The system includes 
an improved audit system which enables 
progress on corrective actions to be tracked 
by the EHS managers. 
Details of our performance from 2012 to 
2016 are provided in the bar charts above. 
The accident data provided covers more 
than 99% of the Group by revenue as it 
excludes the most recent acquisitions 
whose employee numbers are not included 
when calculating the index.
All acquisitions made prior to the 2016 
reporting year are now providing 
environmental data. Revenue relating 
to more recent acquisitions which are 
not yet reporting emissions is excluded. 
The reported data covers around 99% of 
the Group by revenue. 
The requirements of the EU Energy 
Efficiency Directive have been implemented 
in all relevant businesses across 
Continental Europe and UK & Ireland. 
A number of locations in UK & Ireland, 
Australasia and Continental Europe have 
renewed their ISO 14001 accreditation. 
Currently, measured by revenue, 
approximately 26% of the Group’s 
operations are ISO 14001 accredited. 
Accreditation is based on processes and 
practices which are implemented Group-
wide through our EHS management 
programme, although some parts of the 
business have not elected to become 
formally certified. In Continental Europe, 
France Securite has become MASE certified 
to reflect the requirements of its customer 
base. This certification encompasses 
continuous improvement in EHS 
performance and is externally assessed.
Environment/climate change
We seek to minimise the contribution of 
Bunzl’s operations to climate change and to 
prevent other harmful effects of Bunzl’s 
operations on the environment. Operational 
efficiency forms part of our long-
established and successful strategy to 
develop the business and the reduction of 
energy consumption is an integral part of 
operational efficiency. Our facilities 
worldwide operate to Group standards and 
we promote environmental awareness 
throughout the business. Our policy of 
leasing premises provides flexibility in the 
configuration of our footprint to optimise the 
efficiency of our distribution. Bunzl had no 
significant environmental incidents in 2016.
Direct water usage is not a significant 
environmental impact for our business as it 
is principally confined to staff hygiene and 
workplace cleaning purposes. As we do not 
manufacture any of the goods we sell, water 
discharges, apart from internal sanitation, 
are limited to rainwater run-off from the 
yards of Group locations where the water is 
treated by interceptors in accordance with 
local legislation.
Our reported environmental data includes 
all businesses that are subsidiaries of the 
Group for financial reporting purposes, with 
the exception of those recent acquisitions 
where there has been insufficient 
opportunity for the businesses to adopt our 
reporting guidelines, in which case the 
revenue from the businesses is not included 
when calculating the indexed emissions. We 
integrate our environmental reporting with 
our financial reporting through the annual 
budget review. Businesses provide 
commentary on their environmental 
performance and set targets for the 
following year. Environmental data is 
reviewed and agreed by the relevant 
Finance Directors.

training programmes. In North America, 
where we have our largest commercial 
fleet, the combination of these measures 
provided a 4% improvement in fuel 
efficiency during the year. At Group level 
diesel consumed by our commercial fleet 
decreased by more than 2%. Increases in 
Continental Europe and Latin America 
resulting from acquisitions have been offset 
by decreases in North America, UK & 
Ireland and Australasia. In Australasia the 
need for greater flexibility of transport 
methods and efficiency in distribution has 
resulted in the decision to transfer 
distribution to third party carriers. This is 
an ongoing process. We seek to minimise 
the number of miles that our vehicles travel 
empty on the road by backhauling, typically 
using empty vehicles to collect stock from 
suppliers. Consumption of gas during the 
year fell by 11% primarily as a result of the 
relatively mild winter.
Scope 2: Electricity consumption has 
decreased by 1% despite an increase in 
warehouse space due to acquisitions and 
organic growth of the business. Lighting is 
our highest category of electricity 
consumption and we continue to review the 
return on investment on low energy lighting 
at all our sites worldwide as the technology 
progresses and improves the efficiency of 
such lighting. We also fit voltage optimisers 
where this is beneficial. During the year 
there have been 13 projects to upgrade 
lighting providing annualised savings of 
approximately 2.1 million kWh of electricity.
In addition, as energy contracts are 
renewed, businesses are moving to low 
carbon energy where this makes 
commercial sense and is supported by the 
local infrastructure. 
Scope 3: We are continuing to refine the 
data for our Scope 3 emissions. Our 
reporting comprises emissions from third 
party carriers, business flights, waste and 
electricity transmission losses. The 
majority of the businesses which have been 
acquired since 2010 do not have their own 
fleet and in addition all our businesses, 
irrespective of whether they have their own 
fleet, will distribute a proportion of goods 
by third party carriers where it is more 
efficient and cost-effective to do so. The 
bar graph opposite shows that third party 
carriers produce the largest part of our 
reported Scope 3 emissions. Bunzl is an 
international company with an active global 
acquisition programme and business flights 
are essential for the effective management 
and growth of our business. We increasingly 
use alternative means of communication 
such as video and telephone conferencing 
and flights are justified by business needs 
and subject to authorisation by senior 
management. Reduction and segregation of 
waste continues to be an area of focus and 
the data provided covers approximately 95% 
of the Group by revenue, although accurate 
waste measurement remains challenging. 
Despite including this in our Scope 3 
calculation, we have for transparency 
continued to provide waste data separately 
as well. 
Suppliers
Price is only one factor in our purchasing 
decisions and matters such as quality, 
availability, our customers’ preferences and 
our policies are also taken into account. The 
vast majority of our products are sourced 
locally by our businesses but many products 
are sourced elsewhere if it is appropriate to 
do so. Each business area is responsible for 
implementing appropriate processes to 
assess key suppliers’ compliance with the 
relevant CR standards and to monitor 
performance and improvements against 
such standards. Bunzl focuses on its key 
suppliers to ensure that they meet the same 
CR standards we have set for ourselves. 
We periodically write to those suppliers 
that provide us with 50% of our products 
by value to ensure that our CR aspirations 
are compatible.
To assist the business areas, we have our 
own quality assurance/quality control 
department based in Shanghai which 
performs regular audits of our suppliers in 
Asia to ensure that they meet international 
standards, as well as testing the factories’ 
production capabilities and their quality 
assurance and quality control systems. 
Employees’ terms and conditions of work, 
customer service capabilities, hygiene 
management systems and their policies and 
practices on environmental issues are also 
checked. Our policy is that all our suppliers 
meet internationally recognised minimum 
requirements for workers’ welfare and 
conditions of employment, as defined by 
the International Labour Organization or 
the Ethical Trading Initiative. During 2016 
the team has continued to grow and has 
further refined its CR audit programme 
to categorise suppliers appropriately in 
relation to their standards and practices. 
Suppliers who are unable to meet all the 
requirements after an initial assessment/
audit are given the opportunity to comply 
fully within a period which is deemed 
appropriate for the circumstances. If a 
serious breach is identified following 
assessment, an action plan is documented 
and the supplier is expected to commit 
to addressing all the areas where 
discrepancies have been identified. The 
process of improvement via this method is 
principally reliant on the commitment of the 
supplier’s management team/owner/agent 
to ensure that all areas are addressed.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 If we have reason to believe that the 
supplier is not making sufficient or 
committed progress, this could lead to a 
suspension in the relationship until such 
time that we are confident that all areas 
are being satisfactorily addressed. Bunzl 
companies reserve the right to cease a 
relationship with a supplier if it is found that 
unacceptable practices are being employed 
at any sites used for producing or sourcing 
Bunzl products. Such practices include use 
of child labour, forced or bonded labour 
as well as physical abuse or discipline and 
intimidation, illegal discrimination, wages 
not meeting local minimum requirements 
and not providing adequate days of rest. 
Since 2015, in order to enhance the 
processes further, any suppliers that are 
being monitored and assessed due to 
identification of a serious breach are now 
reported to and reviewed by the Board. In 
2016 we completed a quantitative analysis 
of material social risks in our worldwide 
supply chain. Suppliers were ranked against 
Human and Labour rights identified by 
internationally agreed standards and 
credible data taking account of geography 
and product. This is an ongoing project 
but we are satisfied that those suppliers 
assessed as high risk and who are currently 
supplying Bunzl are covered by our audit 
programme.
We work with our suppliers with the aim of 
ensuing the products we supply are 
manufactured from sustainably sourced 
raw materials. We also continue to refine 
our processes to ensure that imported 
paper and wood based products are 
manufactured from legally sourced timber.
Community
Although Bunzl’s operations are 
international, our strength is in the local 
nature of our businesses. In keeping with 
this ethos, we particularly support the 
fundraising activities championed by our 
employees locally. This is supplemented by 
donations made at Group level to charities 
predominantly in the fields of healthcare 
and the environment to support projects 
often in the communities where our 
operations are based. Where possible and 
appropriate, Bunzl also looks to donate 
stock free of charge (‘in-kind’). Group wide, 
Bunzl donated a total of £712,000 to 
charitable causes during 2016 (2015: 
£631,000). This does not include in-kind 
donations or employee fundraising. 
We continue to support our employees in 
their charitable fundraising, for example 
a triathlon challenge raising money for 
childrens’ medical research, as well as 
supporting projects for healthcare and 
environmental charities, such as sponsoring 
Buglife who improve parks and green 
spaces within big cities to create natural 
habitats for invertebrate insects which play 
a big part in our ecosystem.

CR policies and activities please visit the 
Responsibility section of our website,

External assurance
We engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) to undertake a limited assurance 
engagement, reporting to Bunzl plc only, 
using International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised): 
‘Assurance Engagements Other Than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information’ and ISAE 3410: ‘Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements’ over the three KPIs on page 17 
and the data on pages 44 and 45, in each 
case that has been highlighted with the 
symbol ‘†’. They have provided an 
unqualified opinion in relation to the 
relevant KPIs and data and their full 
assurance opinion is also available in the 
Responsibility section of our website,  
www.bunzl.com. 
A limited assurance engagement is 
substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment 
procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed 
risks. In order to reach their opinion, PwC 
performed a range of procedures including 
making enquiries of relevant Bunzl 
management, and evaluating the design 
of the key structures, systems, processes 
and controls for managing, recording 
and reporting the selected information. 
This included analysing and testing over 
a number of sites selected on the basis of 
their inherent risk and materiality to the 
Group, to understand the key processes 
and controls for reporting site performance 
data and to obtain supporting information. 
Finally PwC performed limited substantive 
testing on a selective basis of the selected 
information in relation to one site in UK & 
Ireland and multiple sites across North 
America and Continental Europe to check 
that data had been appropriately measured, 
included, collated and reported. 
Non-financial performance information, 
including greenhouse gas quantification 
in particular, is subject to more inherent 
limitations than financial information. It is 
important to read the selected corporate 
responsibility information contained in 
this Annual Report in the context of PwC’s 
full limited assurance opinion and the 
Company’s Corporate Responsibility 
Performance Reporting Guidelines which 
are also available in the Responsibility 
section of our website.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Strategic report | Corporate responsibility Risks
The Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 35 to 37 details the principal risks and uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Although many CR risks are not seen as principal risks to the 
Group, as part of the Group risk analysis a number of CR risks which could impact the Group’s business have been identified and these are 
set out below together with the steps taken by management to mitigate such risks.
CR risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
CR compliance 
failures
Lack of adherence to the Group’s CR policies could result in 
a variety of issues including those relating to inappropriate 
business practices, accidents at work and increased levies 
due to levels of waste or carbon emissions.
The Group has comprehensive CR policies and procedures 
(including those relating to anti-bribery and corruption) in 
place throughout the business as well as an established 
reporting framework. Regular training in all areas of CR 
takes place using our suite of e-training modules.
Loss of key 
employees
The Group is not capital intensive but the business is based 
on strong customer and supplier relationships which are 
built up locally. Stability of key relationship roles amongst 
the Group’s employees is therefore important.
The Group seeks to secure key staff with appropriate 
incentive packages, development opportunities and career 
progression. Voluntary staff turnover and sickness absence 
is measured on a monthly basis and employee age profiles 
are reviewed annually. This enables any issues to be 
identified and resolved.
Loss of operating 
facilities/
unavailability  
of staff
Climate change may result in higher frequency of extreme 
weather conditions. This could result in some of the Group’s 
facilities being affected or employees being unable to attend 
for work.
The Group has multi-site facilities with products stocked in 
more than one location, as a result of which the Group 
usually has the ability to distribute products from nearby 
facilities. Business continuity plans are in place to minimise 
the impact of any such issues.
Suppliers’  
non-compliance 
with good CR 
practices
The Group is not a manufacturer and has many international 
suppliers across the world. The failure of one of the Group’s 
key suppliers to adhere to recognised CR standards could 
affect the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s key suppliers are principally publicly owned 
multinational organisations with high standards of 
operations. Suppliers are monitored by the Group’s 
purchasing departments and the quality assurance/quality 
control department based in China audits key suppliers 
throughout Asia. The top 50% of suppliers by value of Bunzl 
spend are made aware of the Group’s CR aspirations.
These risks are seen to be outweighed by a variety of opportunities that arise as a consequence of CR and its impact on the business 
environment as previously outlined in this report.
Sustainability has been at 
the heart of our business for 
many years. Segregation of 
waste is embedded in our 
everyday working practices, 
while we work hand-in-hand 
with our customers on 
packaging reduction ideas.

Our Board has continued to focus on overseeing 
the implementation of a consistent and proven 
strategy which has successfully built the 
business and created shareholder value.
Philip Rogerson
Chairman
49
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Corporate governance report
Chairman’s introduction
Good governance is absolutely key to the 
effective management of the Company and 
its long term sustainability and continued 
success. The Board is therefore committed 
to maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance and, as Chairman, it 
is my role to ensure that we continue to do 
so. Although we are a decentralised Group 
which gives management autonomy to take 
decisions relating to our operations locally, 
our governance framework allows the 
Board to lead the Company in the right 
direction as we develop and pursue our 
future strategy, while ensuring that the tone 
of the Group’s culture and values is set from 
the top and that the standards established 
by the Board are maintained throughout 
the Group.
One of the key aspects of good governance 
by any Board is to plan for future 
management succession. As I reported last 
year, following an extensive search and 
selection process, we appointed Frank van 
Zanten to succeed Michael Roney as Chief 
Executive following Mike’s decision to retire 
from the Board in April 2016 after more 
than 10 years in the role. Frank, who was 
formerly an owner of a business we 
acquired in 1994 and the Managing Director 
of our Continental Europe business area 
from 2005 until earlier last year, has 
extensive knowledge and experience of our 
business gained over many years. This, 
together with his successful track record of 
implementing our strategy for developing 
and expanding the Group both organically 
and by acquisition, meant that he was ideally 
placed to take on the role.
The latest edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), which is 
published by the Financial Reporting 
Council and a copy of which is available at 
www.frc.org.uk, contains broad principles 
together with more specific provisions 
which set out standards of good practice 
in relation to Board leadership and 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration 
and relations with shareholders. The report 
that follows provides an overview of the 
work undertaken by the Board and its 
Committees in fulfilling our governance 
responsibilities and describes how the 
principles of the Code have been applied 
by the Company during the year ended 
31 December 2016. An updated version of 
the Code was published in April 2016 and 
will apply to the Company for the year 
ending 31 December 2017. The Company 
has already taken account of the small 
number of changes required and will report 
formally in accordance with the revised 
edition of the Code in the 2017 Annual 
Report. However all references to the 
Code in this report relate to the 2014 edition 
of the Code.
Philip Rogerson
Chairman 
27 February 2017
Compliance statement
It is the Board’s view that for the year ended 
31 December 2016 the Company has been 
fully compliant with all of the relevant 
provisions set out in the Code applicable 
to this reporting period. The Company’s 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are 
required to review whether this statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with 
those provisions of the Code specified for 
their review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority and to report if 
it does not reflect such compliance. No such 
report has been made. 
Board composition
As at 31 December 2016, the Board was 
made up of eight members comprising a 
Chairman, a Chief Executive, two other 
executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. Frank van Zanten was appointed 
to the Board on 1 February 2016 in 
anticipation of Michael Roney’s retirement 
on 20 April 2016 and Meinie Oldersma 
resigned from the Board on 22 August 
2016. As announced today, an additional 
non-executive director, Lloyd Pitchford, 
will join the Board on 1 March 2017 and 
David Sleath, who has been a non-executive 
director since September 2007, will retire 
from the Board following the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2017. 
Brief biographical details of the directors 
are given on page 48. None of the 
Company’s non-executive directors had 
any previous connection with the Company 
or its executive directors on appointment 
to the Board and all of them are considered 
by both the Board and the criteria set out in 
the Code to be independent. The Chairman 
and each of the non-executive directors 
have a breadth of strategic, management 
and financial experience gained in each of 
their own fields in a range of multinational 
businesses. In accordance with the terms 
of the Code each of the directors, with the 
exception of David Sleath who retires at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, 
will be subject to re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The role of the Board
To ensure directors maintain overall control 
over strategic, financial and operational 
and compliance issues, the Board meets 
regularly throughout the year and has 
formally adopted a schedule of matters 
which are required to be brought to it 
for decision. Key aspects of the Board’s 
role include:
• setting the Group’s strategic aims and 
ensuring that the Company has the 
necessary capabilities to deliver the 
Group’s strategy;
• reviewing the Group’s operating 
performance and approving the Group’s 
financial results;
• reviewing and approving larger capital 
expenditure and acquisition/divestment 
proposals and material increases in 
borrowing and loan facilities; and
• overseeing the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls processes and 
procedures.
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive which is set out in writing and has 
been agreed by the Board and encompasses 
the following parameters:
• the primary job of the Chairman is to be 
responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role while the Chief 
Executive is responsible for the 
leadership and the operational and 
performance management of the 
Company within the strategy agreed by 
the Board.
• the Chairman is viewed by investors as 
the ultimate steward of the business and 
the guardian of the interests of all the 
shareholders. 
• the Chairman:
 − takes overall responsibility for the 
composition and capability of the 
Board and its Committees;
 − consults regularly with the Chief 
Executive and is available on a flexible 
basis to provide advice, counsel and 
support to the Chief Executive; and 
 − ensures corporate governance is 
conducted in accordance with current 
best practice, as appropriate to the 
Group.
• the Chief Executive:
 − manages the executive directors and 
the Group’s management and day-to-
day activities;
 − prepares and presents to the Board the 
strategy for growth in shareholder 
value;
50
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report  − sets the operating plans and budgets 
required to deliver the agreed strategy;
 − ensures that the Group has in place 
appropriate risk management and 
control mechanisms; and
 − communicates with the Company’s 
shareholders and analysts on a 
day-to-day basis as necessary (subject 
to an overview of such matters by the 
Chairman).
The Chief Executive is also the designated 
member of the Board responsible for 
environmental, social and governance 
matters and reports to the Board in relation 
to such matters.
Following David Sleath’s retirement, Vanda 
Murray will become the Senior Independent 
Director. A key role of the Senior 
Independent Director is to be available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director has failed to resolve or for which 
such contact is inappropriate. The Senior 
Independent Director is also available to the 
other directors should they have any 
concerns which are not appropriate to raise 
with the Chairman or which have not been 
satisfactorily resolved by the Chairman.
The non-executive directors play a key role 
in corporate governance and accountability 
through both their attendance at Board 
meetings and their membership of the 
various Board Committees. The non-
executive directors bring a broad and 
diverse range of business and financial 
expertise and experience to the Board 
which complements and supplements the 
experience of the executive directors. 
This enables them to evaluate information 
provided and constructively challenge 
management’s viewpoints, assumptions 
and performance.
The Board has appointed Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees, 
all of which comply with the provisions of 
the Code and play an important governance 
role through the detailed work they carry 
out to fulfil the responsibilities delegated 
to them. Briefing papers are prepared 
and circulated to Committee members in 
advance of each meeting and, in respect 
of the Audit Committee, made available 
to the other directors. Further information 
relating to the Board Committees is set 
out below.
Information and support
Board agendas are set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the Chief Executive and 
with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary, who maintains a rolling 
programme of items for discussion by the 
Board to ensure that all matters reserved 
for the Board and other key issues are 
considered at the appropriate time. 
The Board is supplied with full and timely 
information, including detailed financial 
information, to enable the directors to 
discharge their responsibilities. To enable 
informed decision making, briefing papers 
are prepared and circulated to directors 
approximately one week before the 
scheduled Board meeting. All directors 
have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary who is tasked 
with ensuring that Board procedures are 
complied with and the Board is fully 
briefed on relevant legislative, regulatory 
and corporate governance developments. 
Directors may also take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they judge this to be 
necessary in the furtherance of their 
duties to discharge their responsibilities 
as directors. 
The Board meets formally at least seven 
times a year and the Board calendar is 
planned to ensure that the directors discuss 
a wide range of topics throughout the year. 
Normally at least two Board meetings a 
year are held at or near Group locations in 
the UK and overseas where the directors 
have the opportunity to meet and interact 
with senior executives from different 
businesses within the Group’s portfolio as 
well as observe the operations in situ. 
During 2016 a number of the Group’s senior 
executives made presentations to the Board 
about a variety of different and diverse 
topics including reviews of potential 
acquisition opportunities, the post-
acquisition performance of businesses 
acquired in prior years, the Group’s 
financing facilities and treasury policies, 
cybersecurity risks and controls, supplier 
audits carried out and health and safety 
performance metrics. 
In addition to regular Board meetings, the 
directors meet annually to review and 
discuss the Group’s overall strategy. As part 
of this process, presentations are made by 
the Chief Executive and the heads of the 
business areas together with the Director of 
Corporate Development. 
All new directors receive a tailored 
induction on joining the Board, including 
meetings with senior management and 
visits to some of the Group’s locations. They 
also receive a detailed information pack 
which includes details of directors’ duties 
and responsibilities, procedures for dealing 
in Bunzl’s shares and a number of other 
governance related issues. Directors are 
continually updated on the Group’s 
businesses and their markets and the 
changes to the competitive and regulatory 
environments in which they operate.
Training and development needs of the 
Board are kept under review and directors 
attend external courses where it is 
considered appropriate for them to do so.
Conflicts of interest
The directors are required to avoid 
situations where they have, or could have, a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with the Company’s 
interests. In accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
and to impose such limits or conditions as it 
thinks fit.
Directors are required to give notice of any 
potential situational and/or transactional 
conflicts which are then considered by the 
Board and, if deemed appropriate, 
authorised accordingly. A director is not 
however permitted to participate in such 
considerations or to vote in relation to their 
own conflicts.
The Board has considered and authorised a 
number of potential situational conflicts all 
of which relate to the holding of external 
directorships and have been entered on the 
Company’s conflicts register. No actual 
conflicts have been identified during the 
year. The Board considers that these 
procedures operate effectively.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all of the 
independent non-executive directors and is 
currently chaired by David Sleath who, as 
Chief Executive and formerly Group Finance 
Director of SEGRO plc and as a fellow of the 
ICAEW, is considered by the Board to have 
recent and relevant financial experience as 
required by the Code. Following David 
Sleath’s retirement, Lloyd Pitchford, who, 
as mentioned above, is joining the Board as 
a non-executive director on 1 March 2017, 
will become the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. He is the Chief Financial Officer 
of Experian plc and, as such, also has recent 
and relevant financial experience. While the 
other directors are not members of the 
Committee, they normally attend meetings 
of the Committee by invitation together with 
the Head of Internal Audit and 
representatives from the external auditors. 
The Secretary to the Committee is Paul 
Hussey, Company Secretary. Further details 
about the Audit Committee and the work 
undertaken by it during the year and prior 
to the publication of the Group’s results for 
2016 are set out in the Audit Committee 
report on pages 56 to 59. Members’ 
attendance at the Committee meetings 
held during the year is set out in the table 
on page 52. The terms of reference of 
the Committee, which were reviewed 
and revised by the Board during the year 
following a recommendation made by the 
Committee, are available on the Company’s 
website, www.bunzl.com

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
all of the independent non-executive 
directors and is currently chaired by Vanda 
Murray. While neither the Chairman of the 
Company nor the Chief Executive are 
members of the Committee, they normally 
attend meetings by invitation except when 
the Committee is considering matters 
concerning themselves. The Secretary to 
the Committee is Julie Welch, Director of 
Group Human Resources. Further details 
of the Remuneration Committee, the 
Company’s remuneration policy and how 
it is applied are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 60 to 87. 
Members’ attendance at the Committee 
meetings held during the year is set out in 
the table below. The terms of reference of 
the Committee, which were reviewed by the 
Board during the year, are available on the 
Company’s website.
Nomination Committee
Composition
The Nomination Committee comprises 
the Chairman of the Company, who chairs 
the Committee (unless the Committee is 
dealing with the matter of succession of 
the Chairman of the Company), the Chief 
Executive and all of the independent non-
executive directors. In accordance with 
the provisions of the Code, the majority of 
the members are independent non-executive 
directors. The Secretary to the Committee 
is Paul Hussey, Company Secretary.
Role
The Committee’s principal role is to 
consider, and make recommendations to the 
Board concerning, the composition of the 
Board and its Committees including 
proposed appointees to the Board, whether 
to fill any vacancies that may arise or to 
change the number of Board members. It is 
the Committee’s role to ensure that the 
Board and its Committees maintain the 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity to ensure their 
continued effectiveness. 
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
• reviewing the structure, size and 
composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of 
the Board and making recommendations 
to the Board with regard to any proposed 
changes;
• nominating, for the approval of the Board, 
appropriate individuals to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise having 
considered candidates with relevant 
experience from a wide range of 
backgrounds; and
• succession planning, taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company and the background, skills 
and expertise that will be required on the 
Board in the future, and reviewing 
annually management succession 
planning processes in relation to the 
Company’s senior executives.
The Committee meets as necessary 
throughout the year to discharge its 
responsibilities. An external search 
consultancy which does not have any other 
connection with the Company is retained by 
the Company to assess potential candidates 
to be considered as prospective non-
executive directors and, when appropriate, 
executive directors. This process was 
adopted both in relation to the appointment 
of Frank van Zanten on 1 February 2016 to 
succeed Michael Roney as Chief Executive 
with effect from 20 April 2016 and the 
appointment of Lloyd Pitchford as a 
non-executive director with effect from 
1 March 2017. Details of the process 
followed in relation to Frank van Zanten’s 
appointment are set out in the Corporate 
governance report included in the 2015 
Annual Report and further information 
relating to the appointment of Lloyd 
Pitchford is set out below.
Activities
The Committee met on three occasions 
during 2016. Members’ attendance at those 
meetings is set out in the table below.
One of the Committee’s main 
responsibilities during the year related to 
the process of identifying and selecting a 
new non-executive director. Having taken 
account of the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company currently and in the 
future and after identifying the background, 
skills, knowledge and experience that will 
be required of non-executive directors in 
the future, the Committee prepared and 
agreed a detailed specification for the 
role and appointed an external search 
consultancy, The Zygos Partnership, to 
assist them in the recruitment process. 
The Zygos Partnership does not provide any 
other services to, or have any connection 
with, the Company. In particular the 
Committee was keen to find a successful 
senior business executive with extensive 
international management experience. 
As a potential non-executive director, it was 
important that the chosen candidate was 
able to play a supportive role to the 
executive management team, while at the 
same time provide the strategic input into 
the Company’s direction and development. 
It was also a requirement that the 
prospective director could provide wise 
counsel and independence of mind and to 
challenge management constructively by 
offering impartial, independent and 
objective advice. The Committee carried out

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report an extensive search and selection process, 
overseen by a sub-committee of the 
Committee, and a number of candidates 
were considered. All members of the 
Committee had the opportunity to meet the 
shortlisted candidates following which the 
recommendation was made to the Board in 
February 2017, which was subsequently 
unanimously approved, that Lloyd Pitchford 
be appointed as a non-executive director 
with effect from 1 March 2017. The Board 
also accepted the Committee’s 
recommendation that he be appointed to 
each of the three Board Committees and 
that he should assume the role of Chairman 
of the Audit Committee upon David Sleath’s 
retirement in April 2017.
During the year the Committee also 
reviewed and took account of the balance 
of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity of the Board, the time commitment 
expected of the non-executive directors and 
the conclusions of the formal evaluation 
process which was carried out when 
considering and recommending the 
nomination of directors for re-election 
at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. In 
particular the Committee reviewed the 
performance of David Sleath, who was 
appointed to the Board in September 2007. 
The Committee believed that he continued 
to be effective and to demonstrate strong 
independence in character and judgement 
in the manner in which he was discharging 
his responsibilities as a director. 
Consequently the Committee was satisfied 
that, despite his length of tenure, he 
remained independent. As mentioned 
above, David Sleath is due to retire following 
the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 19 April 2017 and 
accordingly he will not be subject to 
re-election at the meeting.
The Chief Executive presented his annual 
management succession plan to the 
Committee. The Company recognises that 
having the right directors and senior 
management is crucial for the Group’s 
success and it is a key task of the Committee 
to ensure that the Company has a robust 
and continuous succession planning 
process over both the medium to long term 
to ensure that there is the right mix and 
skills available as the Company evolves. 
As part of the review of the composition 
of the Board and the succession planning 
process, both the Board and the Committee 
recognise the importance of gender 
diversity throughout the Group. As at the 
date of this report, two of the eight Board 
members and one of the five Executive 
Committee members are female. The 
Committee aims to have a Board with a 
broad range of skills, backgrounds, 
experience and diversity and, while the 
Committee will continue to follow a policy of 
ensuring that the best people are appointed 
for the relevant roles, the Committee 
recognises the benefits of greater diversity 
and will continue to take account of this 
when considering any particular 
appointment. However, the primary 
responsibility of the Committee in selecting 
and recommending candidates to the Board 
when making new appointments is to 
ensure the strength of the Board’s 
composition and the overriding aim is to 
always select and recommend the best 
candidate for the position. Further 
information about the Company’s workforce 
diversity is set out on page 43.
The terms of reference of the Committee, 
which were reviewed and amended by 
the Board in 2016, are set out on the 
Company’s website. 
Performance evaluation
The Company has a formal performance 
evaluation process for the Board, its 
Committees and individual directors 
overseen by the Chairman. This includes 
individual discussions between the 
Chairman and each director when their 
individual training and development needs 
are reviewed. Led by the Senior Independent 
Director, the non-executive directors also 
meet without the Chairman present at least 
annually to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance including a review of his other 
commitments to ensure that he is able to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to 
discharge his responsibilities effectively. 
The Chairman also periodically holds 
meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors present. All 
of these processes were carried out 
satisfactorily during the year. 
In accordance with the requirements of the 
Code an external performance evaluation 
was first carried out in 2012 and the results 
were subsequently presented to the Board. 
The facilitator of the external evaluation, 
Lintstock, does not provide any other 
services to, or have any other connection 
with, the Company. Although the Code only 
requires that the evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees should be externally 
facilitated at least every three years, the 
Board has decided to appoint Lintstock to 
carry out an annual performance evaluation 
and accordingly external evaluations have 
been completed each year since 2012. By 
doing so, the Board is able to ensure that 
there is consistency and continuity in the 
evaluation process and the presentation 
of the results from one year to the next. 
Following the evaluation which was carried 
out in 2016, the Board once again identified 
a number of key priorities in order to improve 
the Board’s performance, including:
• continuing to keep the key strategic 
issues facing the Group under review both 
as part of the Board’s annual strategy 
meeting and at other times of the year 
as appropriate;
• providing ongoing support to the new 
Chief Executive as appropriate;
• continuing the focus of the Nomination 
Committee on the management 
succession plans for the Group, including 
in particular maintaining the Board’s 
exposure to the Group’s senior 
management below Board level; and 
• the successful recruitment and 
subsequent appointment of an additional 
non-executive director and overseeing the 
induction and integration of such director.
As a result of the overall performance 
evaluation process carried out in 2016, 
the Board concluded that both it and its 
Committees are operating effectively. 
Financial and business reporting
The responsibilities of the directors in 
respect of the preparation of the Group and 
parent company financial statements are 
set out on page 139 and the auditors’ report 
on pages 140 to 145 includes a statement by 
the external auditors about their reporting 
responsibilities. As set out on page 97, the 
directors are of the opinion that it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. 
The process of preparing the Annual Report 
has included the following:
• comprehensive reviews undertaken at 
different levels in the Group in order to 
ensure the accuracy, consistency and 
overall balance of the Annual Report; and
• procedures to verify the factual accuracy 
of the Annual Report.
From the information and assurance 
provided by the ongoing work of the internal 
audit department, the reviews conducted by 
the external auditors in relation to both the 
half year and full year results, the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s business and 
the information provided by the senior 
executive management team, the Board 
considers that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Corporate governance report continued
Risk management and 
internal control
The directors acknowledge that they have 
overall responsibility for identifying, 
evaluating, managing and mitigating the 
principal risks faced by the Group and for 
monitoring the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems. However, such 
systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. In 
accordance with Principle C.2 of the Code 
and the related guidance, the Company has 
established the procedures necessary to 
ensure that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating the principal risks faced by the 
Group and for determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to 
take to achieve its strategic objectives. 
The directors confirm that such procedures 
have been in place for the year ended 
31 December 2016 and up to the date of 
approval of these financial statements and 
that the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems have been 
monitored during the year.
A summary of the principal control 
structures and processes in place across 
the Group is set out below and further 
information relating to how the directors 
maintain overall control over all significant 
strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues is set out in ‘The role of 
the Board’ section on pages 50 and 51.
The Board has delegated to an Executive 
Committee, consisting of the Chief 
Executive, Finance Director and other 
functional managers, the initial 
responsibility for identifying, evaluating, 
managing and mitigating the risks facing 
the Group and for deciding how these are 
best managed and to establish a system of 
internal control appropriate to the business 
environments in which the Group operates. 
The principal features of this system 
include:
• a procedure for monitoring the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
system through a tiered management 
structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority;
• clearly defined authorisation procedures 
for capital investment and acquisitions;
• strategic plans and comprehensive 
budgets which are prepared annually 
by the business areas and approved by 
the Board;
• formal standards of business conduct 
(including a code of ethics and 
whistleblowing procedure) based 
on honesty, integrity, fair dealing and 
compliance with the local laws and 
regulations of the countries in which 
the Group operates;
• a well-established consolidation and 
reporting system for the statutory 
accounts and monthly management 
accounts;
• continual investment in IT systems 
to ensure the production of timely 
and accurate management information 
relating to the operation of the 
Group’s businesses; and
• detailed manuals covering Group 
accounting policies and policies and 
procedures for the Group’s treasury 
operations supplemented by internal 
control procedures at a business 
area level.
Some of the procedures carried out in order 
to monitor the effectiveness of the internal 
control system and to identify, manage and 
mitigate business risk are listed below:
• central management holds regular 
meetings with business area 
management to discuss strategic, 
operational and financial issues including 
a review of the principal risks affecting 
each of the business areas and the 
policies and procedures by which these 
risks are managed; 
• the Executive Committee meets twice per 
month and also reviews the outcome of 
the discussions held at business area 
meetings on internal control and risk 
management issues;
• the Board in turn reviews the outcome of 
the Executive Committee discussions on 
internal control and risk management 
issues which ensures a documented and 
auditable trail of accountability;
• each business area, the Executive 
Committee and the Board carry out an 
annual fraud risk assessment;
• actual results are reviewed monthly 
against budget, forecasts and the 
previous year and explanations obtained 
for all significant variances;
• all treasury activities, including in relation 
to the management of foreign exchange 
exposures and Group borrowings, are 
reported and reviewed monthly;
• the Group’s bank balances around the 
world are monitored on a weekly basis 
and significant movements are reviewed 
centrally;
• the internal audit department periodically 
reviews individual businesses and 
procedures, makes recommendations to 
improve controls and follows up to ensure 
that management implements the 
recommendations made. The internal 
audit department’s work is determined on 
a risk assessment basis and their findings 
are reported to Group and business area 
management as well as to the Audit 
Committee and the external auditors;
• an annual self-assessment of the status 
of internal controls measured against a 
prescribed list of minimum standards is 
performed by every business and action 
plans are agreed where remedial action is 
required; 
• the Audit Committee, which comprises all 
of the independent non-executive 
directors of the Company, meets 
regularly throughout the year. Further 
details of the work of the Committee, 
which includes a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls and the assurance 
procedures relating to the Company’s risk 
management system, are set out in the 
Audit Committee report on pages 56 to 59;
• regular meetings are held with insurance 
and risk advisers to assess the risks 
throughout the Group;
• a management committee, which 
oversees issues relating principally to 
environment, health & safety, insurance 
and business continuity planning matters, 
sets relevant policies and practices and 
monitors their implementation;
• risk assessments, safety audits and a 
regular review of progress against 
objectives established by each business 
area are periodically carried out; and
• developments in tax, treasury and 
accounting are continually monitored by 
Group management in association with 
external advisers.
The directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems in operation during 2016.
The external auditors are engaged to 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements. The audit includes a review and 
evaluation of the system of internal financial 
control and the data contained in the 
financial statements to the extent necessary 
for expressing an audit opinion on the truth 
and fairness of the financial statements.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report Assessment of the prospects of the 
Company and its viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the directors set out below how they 
have assessed the prospects of the 
Company, over what period the prospects 
have been assessed and the Company’s 
formal viability statement. 
The context for and period over 
which the prospects of the Company 
have been assessed
To consider the prospects of the Company 
and determine an appropriate time frame 
for the purpose of making a statement on 
the Company’s longer term viability, the 
directors have taken into account various 
factors including the nature of the 
Company’s business, its business model 
and strategy and the existing planning 
periods. In particular: 
• Bunzl has a geographically balanced and 
diversified business portfolio operating in 
30 countries; 
• the Company operates across six core, 
fragmented market sectors, many of 
which are growing and resilient to 
challenging economic conditions; and
• the business model and strategy 
minimise the volatility of the Company’s 
results, enabling Bunzl to deliver 
consistently good results with high 
returns on capital and cash conversion.
With regard to the time frame specifically, 
the directors considered the above factors 
as well as the Group’s strategic planning 
process. Comprehensive budgets are 
prepared annually by the business areas 
and approved by the Board. Strategic plans 
covering a period of two years beyond the 
forecast for the current year are also 
prepared annually and reviewed by the 
Board. While the directors have no reason 
to believe the Company will not be viable 
over a longer period, given the inherent 
uncertainty involved, the period over which 
the directors consider it possible to form a 
reasonable expectation as to the Group’s 
longer term viability is the three year period 
to 31 December 2019.
How the prospects of the Company 
and its longer term viability have 
been assessed
In making a viability statement, the 
directors are required to consider the 
Company’s ability to meet its liabilities in 
full as they fall due, taking into account the 
Company’s current position and principal 
risks. The Company has significant financial 
resources including committed and 
uncommitted banking facilities and US 
private placement notes, further details of 
which are set out in Note 13 to the 
consolidated financial statements.  
As a result, the directors believe that the 
Company is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully. 
The resilience of the Group to a range of 
possible scenarios, in particular the impact 
on key financial ratios and its ongoing 
compliance with financial covenants, was 
factored into the directors’ considerations 
through stress testing current financial 
projections. These included the following: 
• an adverse but plausible deterioration in 
revenue and operating profit combined 
with the adverse impact of a number of 
acquisitions underperforming and a 
significant increase in working capital;
• the impact that the materialisation of the 
market, operational and tax related 
principal risks may have on the 
Company’s longer term viability, in 
particular on its financial liquidity and 
debt covenants risk, both with and without 
mitigating actions; and 
• a reverse stress test scenario which 
identified what would need to happen to 
cause the Company to fail, which for this 
purpose is taken to mean an unavoidable 
breach of financial covenants. The 
conditions required to create this situation 
were so severe that it was considered to 
be implausible.
In all scenarios it has been assumed, based 
on past experience and all current 
indicators, that the Company will be able to 
refinance its banking facilities and US 
private placement notes as and when they 
mature. The directors consider that the 
stress testing based assessment of the 
Company’s prospects, building on the 
results of the robust assessment of the 
principal risks to the business and the 
financial implications of them materialising, 
confirms the resilience of the Group to 
severe but plausible scenarios and provides 
a reasonable basis on which to conclude on 
its longer term viability. 
Confirmation of longer term viability 
Taking into account the Company’s current 
position and principal risks and the 
assessment performed of the prospects of 
the Company, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three year period to 31 December 2019. 
Relations with shareholders
As required by the relevant law and 
regulations, the Company reports formally 
to shareholders twice a year with the half 
year results announced normally at the end 
of August and the annual results announced 
normally at the end of February. In addition, 
during the year, the Company has published, 
on a voluntary basis, two quarterly trading 
statements and two other trading 
statements prior to entering its close 
periods at the end of June and the end of 
December in order to keep the Company’s 
shareholders and the financial markets 
periodically updated on the Company’s 
trading performance outside of the 
regulatory announcements made in relation 
to the half year and annual results.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
have regular meetings with representatives 
of institutional shareholders and report to 
the Board the views of major shareholders. 
Additional forms of communication include 
presentations of the half year and annual 
results. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director and the other non-
executive directors are available to meet 
with major shareholders on request. The 
Board also periodically reviews and 
discusses analysts’ and brokers’ reports 
and surveys of shareholder opinions 
conducted by the Company’s own brokers.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. All shareholders are 
encouraged to participate in the Annual 
General Meeting, are invited to ask 
questions at the meeting and are given the 
opportunity to meet all of the directors 
informally. Shareholders unable to attend 
are encouraged to vote using the proxy card 
mailed to them or electronically as detailed 
in the Notice of Meeting. Shareholders are 
given the option to withhold their vote on the 
proxy form. As in previous years, at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting each 
of the resolutions put to the meeting will be 
taken on a poll rather than on a show of 
hands as directors believe that a poll is 
more representative of shareholders’ voting 
intentions because shareholder votes are 
counted according to the number of shares 
held and all votes tendered are taken into 
account. The results of the poll will be 
publicly announced and made available 
on the Company’s website as soon as 
practicable following the Annual 
General Meeting.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Audit Committee report
Statement from David 
Sleath, Chairman of the 
Audit Committee
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Audit Committee report for 
2016, the purpose of which is to give 
shareholders an overview of the role of 
the Committee and to report on the work 
it has carried out during the past year. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council includes a number of provisions 
relating to the role and reporting 
requirements of audit committees and 
accordingly this report has been prepared in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of 
the 2014 edition of the Code which applied to 
the financial year ended 31 December 2016.
As in previous years, the Committee’s 
primary focus has been centred on the 
integrity of the Company’s financial 
reporting together with the related internal 
controls. The Committee has a clearly 
defined role in the corporate governance 
framework of listed companies and acts 
independently of management to ensure 
that the interests of our shareholders are 
properly protected through the Committee’s 
oversight of the Company’s financial 
management and its reporting processes 
and procedures. There are a number of key 
aspects to this including the use of 
appropriate accounting policies and 
practices, supported by the implementation 
of a robust assurance framework in which 
the risk management and internal control 
systems, the internal and external audit 
functions and the regular internal reporting 
of the Company’s performance against 
budgets, forecasts and prior year results 
are all very important. In particular this year 
the Committee has considered the impact of 
the EU Audit Directive and Regulation that 
came into effect on 17 June 2016 which has 
resulted in changes to the audit regime for 
EU public interest entities such as the 
Company. The new legislation introduces 
mandatory rotation of auditors and tighter 
restrictions on the provision of non-audit 
services, as well as setting out 
requirements in relation to the 
responsibilities and composition of 
audit committees.
The significant accounting matters 
considered by the Committee in relation 
to the 2016 financial statements were the 
accounting for business combinations, the 
carrying value of goodwill and customer 
relationships intangible assets, defined 
benefit pension schemes, taxation and 
supplier rebates. These are discussed in 
detail in the report that follows and the 
Committee is satisfied that these matters 
have been properly recorded in the 
Company’s books and records and 
accounted for appropriately.
As a Committee we will continue to keep 
our activities under review and focused on 
the audit, assurance and risk processes 
within the business. By doing so we will 
ensure that we are able to maintain high 
standards of financial governance in line 
with the regulatory framework as well as 
market practice for audit committees 
going forward.
Role
The Committee’s principal role is to ensure 
that the Company has effective governance 
over the Group’s financial reporting, 
including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the 
internal and external audit functions and the 
David Sleath 
Chairman of 
the Audit 
Committee
The Committee has a key role to play in 
overseeing the interests of shareholders 
by focusing on the integrity of our financial 
reporting and ensuring that the Company 
maintains clearly defined and established 
risk management and internal control 
processes and procedures.

Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.
In the performance of its duties, the 
Committee has independent access to the 
services of the Company’s internal audit 
function and to the external auditors and 
may obtain outside professional advice as 
necessary. Both the Head of Internal Audit 
and the external auditors have direct access 
to me as the Chairman of the Committee 
and I held a number of meetings with each 
of them during the year outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Activities
As Chairman of the Committee, I hold 
preparatory discussions with the Company’s 
senior management, the Head of Internal 
Audit and the external auditors prior to 
Committee meetings to discuss the items to 
be considered at the Committee meetings. 
In addition, separate discussions are held 
between the Committee and the Head of 
Internal Audit and the external auditors 
without management present. I also attend 
the Annual General Meeting to respond to 
any shareholder questions that might be 
raised on the Committee’s activities. The 
Committee met on four occasions during 
the year and members’ attendance at those 
meetings is set out in the table on page 52. 
The Committee’s activities in 2016 included:

staff may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or other matters and 
receiving periodic reports relating to the 
matters raised through such 
arrangements;
• reviewing the Committee’s terms of 
reference;
• reviewing the Committee’s effectiveness 
following an externally facilitated 
performance evaluation;
• reviewing the effectiveness of both the 
external auditors and the internal audit 
function following completion of detailed 
questionnaires by both the Board and 
senior management within the Company;
• reviewing and approving the level and 
nature of non-audit work which the 
external auditors performed during the 
year, including the fees paid for such 
work; 
• reviewing and amending the policy for the 
provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditors;
• reviewing the principal tax risks 
applicable to the Company and the steps 
taken to manage such risks; and

internal audit charter in accordance with 
international internal auditing standards.
Following each Committee meeting, I report 
any significant findings to the Board and 
copies of the minutes of the Committee 
meetings are circulated to all of the 
directors and to the external auditors.
During the year the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Corporate Reporting Review Team 
(‘CRRT’) carried out a review of the Annual 
Report for the year ended 31 December 
2015. The response by the Company to the 
request for information was discussed with 
me in my capacity as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee prior to responding to the CRRT. 
Details of both the enquiries raised by the 
CRRT and the Company’s response thereto 
were also considered by the Committee. 
The CRRT have closed their enquiries with 
no requirements to restate any disclosures. 
However, undertakings were given 
to enhance certain disclosures in the 
future in response to the CRRT review. 
The Committee is satisfied that the 
enhancements proposed to, and agreed 
with, the CRRT have been appropriately 
incorporated in the 2016 Annual Report.
Financial statements and significant 
accounting matters
During the year and prior to the publication 
of the Group’s results for 2016, the 
Committee reviewed the 2016 half yearly 
financial report and related news release, 
the 2016 Annual Report (including the 
financial statements), the 2016 annual 
results news release and the reports from 
the external auditors on the outcomes of 
their half year review and the audit relating 
to 2016. 
57
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Audit Committee report continued
As part of its work, the Committee 
considered the following significant 
accounting matters in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements:
Accounting for business 
combinations
For business combinations, the Group has a 
long-standing process for the identification 
of the fair values of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed including separate 
identification of intangible assets using 
external valuation specialists where 
required. The Committee reviewed this 
process and discussed with management 
and the external auditors the methodology 
and assumptions used to value the assets 
and liabilities of the acquisitions completed 
in 2016. The Committee concluded that it 
was satisfied with management’s valuations 
of these assets and liabilities, including the 
degree to which such valuations are 
supported by professional advice from 
external advisers.
The carrying value of goodwill and 
other customer relationships 
intangible assets
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating 
units (‘CGUs’) and is tested annually for 
impairment. During the year the Committee 
reviewed an assessment prepared by 
management of the composition of the 
Group’s CGUs, which were last formally 
reviewed in 2010. Having done so, the 
Committee was satisfied with the proposed 
revisions to the CGUs as they reflected 
adjustments required from the addition 
of approximately 100 businesses and 
consequential changes to management 
oversight and responsibility. The Committee 
critically reviewed and discussed 
management’s report on the impairment 
testing of the carrying value of goodwill and 
customer relationships intangible assets 
of each of the existing and revised CGUs 
(including the sensitivity of the outcome of 
impairment testing to the use of different 
discount rates) and considered the external 
auditors’ testing thereof. After due 
consideration, the Committee concluded 
that it was satisfied with the assumptions 
and judgements applied in relation to such 
testing and agreed that there was no 
impairment to goodwill or customer 
relationships intangible assets based 
on either CGU allocation. Details of the 
key assumptions and judgements used 
are set out in Note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Committee considered reports from 
management and the external auditors in 
relation to the valuation of the defined 
benefit pension schemes and reviewed the 
key actuarial assumptions used in 
calculating the defined benefit pension 
liabilities, especially in relation to discount 
rates, inflation rates and mortality/life 
expectancy. The Committee discussed the 
reasons for the increase in the net pension 
deficit and was satisfied that the 
assumptions used were appropriate and 
were supported by independent actuarial 
experts. Details of the key assumptions 
used are set out in Note 20 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Taxation
The Committee reviewed a report and 
received a presentation from the Head of 
Tax highlighting the principal tax risks that 
the Group faces and a detailed risk 
assessment relating to the tax risks 
identified including the judgements 
underpinning the provisions for potential tax 
liabilities. The Committee also reviewed the 
results of the external auditors’ assessment 
of provisions for income taxes and, having 
done so, was satisfied with the key 
judgements and proposed disclosures 
related to tax made by management.
Supplier rebates
The Group has various rebate arrangements 
with a number of suppliers. Some of these 
arrangements are based on the volume of 
products purchased and others are based 
on the volume of products sold. The 
recognition of supplier rebate income from 
the arrangements which are based on the 
volume of products purchased may, for a 
limited number of arrangements, involve 
the requirement for some estimates to be 
made about whether certain conditions 
related to such rebate income have been, or 
will be, met. In reviewing the consolidated 
financial statements, the Committee 
considered a report from management in 
relation to the value of the different types of 
rebates in the income statement for the year 
and the value of supplier rebate income 
receivables at the year end. This report 
showed that substantially all of the supplier 
rebates were unconditional and non-
judgemental. The Committee discussed the 
findings of the external auditors in this area 
and, having done so, concluded that it was 
satisfied with the accounting for the Group’s 
supplier rebates for the year including the 
value of rebate income recognised. 
External auditors’ independence 
and effectiveness
The Committee ensures that the external 
auditors remain independent of the 
Company and receives written confirmation 
from the external auditors as to whether 
they consider themselves independent 
within the meaning of their own internal 
and the relevant regulatory and 
professional requirements. Key members 
of the audit team rotate off the Company’s 
audit after a specific period of time.
In order to ensure that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors is not 
compromised, the Company has a detailed 
policy relating to the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors which is 
overseen by the Committee. As mentioned 
in my introduction, following the 
implementation of the EU Audit Directive 
and Regulation with effect from 17 June 
2016 the rules relating to non-audit services 
have been changed. The new rules 
introduce a statutory cap on the level of 
non-audit fees which may be billed by the 
external auditors and include a ‘blacklist’ 
of prohibited services that the external 
auditors are not allowed to provide. As a 
result, as part of the 2016 review of both 
its terms of reference and the Company’s 
policy for the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors, the Committee 
approved appropriate amendments to 
ensure that such terms of reference and 
policy are fully compliant with the new 
regulations. Under the revised policy the 
only non-audit services that have been 
pre-approved by the Committee are those 
which are not prohibited or otherwise 
restricted and which are considered to be 
trivial due to the value of the services. 
Apart from such pre-approved services, 
a permitted service requires specific 
authorisation from the Committee or myself 
as the Committee Chairman. It is the 
Company’s policy to assess the non-audit 
services to be performed by the Company’s 
auditors on a case-by-case basis to ensure 
adherence to the prevailing ethical 
standards and regulations. In the main, 
other firms are used by the Company to 
provide non-audit services. However, if the 
provision of a service by the Company’s 
auditors is not prohibited and adequate 
safeguards are in place, it is sometimes 
appropriate for this additional work to be 
carried out by the Company’s auditors. 
Details of the fees paid to the external 
auditors in 2016 in respect of the audit and 
for non-audit services are set out in Note 4 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
58
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Audit Committee report The ratio of the fees relating to non-audit 
services to audit services in 2016 was 17%.
During 2016 the Committee carried out a 
review of the effectiveness of the external 
audit process carried out in relation to the 
audit of the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. As part 
of this review, the Committee considered 
feedback on the audit gathered through 
a detailed survey which was completed 
by each of the directors and members of 
the Company’s senior management team 
at both Group and business area levels. 
The survey covered a total of 24 different 
aspects of the audit process grouped under 
four separate headings: the robustness of 
the audit process; the quality of delivery; 
the quality of people and service; and the 
quality of reporting. Each respondent was 
asked to award a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 
for each aspect reviewed and to provide any 
additional comments they wished to make 
in relation to the questions raised. 
The Committee discussed the findings 
of the survey and their overall assessment 
of the work of the auditors. Having done 
so, the Committee confirmed that it 
was satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
external audit process. The Committee 
will carry out a similar effectiveness 
review in 2017 in relation to the audit 
of the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016.
Auditors’ re-appointment
In considering whether to recommend to the 
Board the appointment or re-appointment 
of the external auditors, the Committee 
takes into account the tenure of the auditors 
in addition to the results of its review of the 
effectiveness of the external auditors and 
considers whether there should be a full 
tender process either as a result of that 
review or as may be required by the relevant 
regulations. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Committee’s 
choice of external auditors.
As previously reported, following a detailed 
tender process, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’) were first appointed as the 
Company’s external auditors in 2014 to 
replace KPMG Audit Plc who, together with 
their predecessor firms, had been the 
external auditors since 1986. 
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the 
results of its review of the external auditors’ 
activities during the year, the Committee 
has again recommended to the Board that a 
resolution proposing the re-appointment of 
PwC as external auditors for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 be put to 
shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Internal control and 
risk management
As mentioned above, the Committee is 
responsible for reviewing on behalf of the 
Board the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal financial controls and the 
assurance procedures relating to the 
Company’s risk management system. These 
controls and procedures are designed to 
manage, but not eliminate, the risk of failure 
of the Company to meet its business 
objectives and, as such, provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. During the 
year, the Committee monitored the 
effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls framework through reports from 
the Finance Director, the Head of Internal 
Audit and the external auditors. In 
particular the Committee considered the 
scope and results of work of the internal 
audit function, the findings of the external 
auditors in relation to the year end audit, 
the assessment of fraud risk carried out 
by management, the controls over the 
Company’s financial consolidation and 
reporting system, the treasury controls, 
the tax risks and the processes for 
setting strategic plans and budgets and 
for monitoring the ongoing performance 
of the Company. 
In relation to the risk management system, 
the Committee reviewed the process by 
which significant risks had been identified 
by management and the Board, the key 
controls and other processes designed 
to manage and mitigate such risks and the 
assurance provided by the internal audit 
function, the external auditors and other 
oversight from management and the Board.
Internal audit
The Company has an internal audit 
department which comprises nine in-house 
auditors, including the Head of Internal 
Audit who reports jointly to me, in my 
capacity as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, and the Finance Director. The 
scope of work of the internal audit function 
covers all systems and activities of the 
Group. Work is prioritised according to the 
Company’s risk profile with the annual audit 
plan being approved by the Committee each 
year. Internal audit reports are regularly 
provided to the Committee which include 
details of the audit findings, and the relevant 
management actions required in order to 
address any issues arising therefrom, as 
well as updates on the progress made by 
management in addressing any outstanding 
recommendations from previously reported 
findings. In addition, the internal audit 
function reports on any significant issues 
relating to the processes for controlling the 
activities of the Group and the adequacy and 
effectiveness of such processes. Overall 
the work of the internal audit function 
provides the Committee with a further 
means of monitoring the processes and 
actions to manage and mitigate those 
risks identified as posing the greatest 
threat to the Company.
A review by the Committee of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function 
was carried out during the year. The 
Committee considered the results of a 
detailed questionnaire completed by each 
of the directors and those members of the 
senior management team who interact with 
the internal audit department and discussed 
generally the work of the internal audit 
department, the adequacy of resources 
and the skills and capabilities of the internal 
audit team. In order to benchmark the 
internal audit department against best 
practice, during 2016 the quality and 
effectiveness of the function was also 
externally assessed by the Chartered 
Institute of Internal Auditors. Following 
both of these assessments, the Committee 
concluded that the internal audit function 
continued to be effective, efficient and 
appropriately resourced.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Directors’ remuneration report
Statement from Vanda 
Murray, Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2016. 
Role of the Remuneration 
Committee
The Committee proposes the directors’ 
remuneration policy for shareholder 
approval. It also governs the implementation 
of the policy ensuring that the remuneration 
for our executive directors and senior 
management supports the sustainable 
performance of the business and that it is 
aligned with shareholders’ interests. The 
Committee considers both market practice 
and stakeholders’ views when setting the 
Group’s performance-related incentives to 
ensure that they are based on challenging 
and robust performance targets which are 
aligned to the Group’s strategic goals and 
which drive profitable growth, while 
complying with UK corporate governance 
good practice.
Performance and remuneration 
for 2016
Michael Roney retired as Chief Executive 
in April 2016 after a long and successful 
tenure of more than 10 years, during 
which time the Group achieved strong 
and sustainable performance. Michael’s 
successor as Chief Executive is Frank van 
Zanten, an internal appointment made 
after an extensive internal and external 
search process. 
The business strategy has remained constant 
during 2016 with the Group continuing to grow 
both organically and by acquisition while 
continuously improving the quality of our 
operating model.
The key performance metrics for the annual 
bonus are the Group’s adjusted earnings per 
share and return on average operating 
capital and for Patrick Larmon there are 
two additional measures related to the 
operating profit and return on average 
operating capital of the business area 
for which he has responsibility (North 
America). Performance against these 
metrics has resulted in an annual bonus for 
Frank van Zanten of 65% of the maximum 
opportunity, which equates to 75% of his 
annual salary for 2016, initially as a director 
from 1 February until 19 April 2016 and then 
as Chief Executive from 20 April to the end 
of the financial year.  
Vanda Murray 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration 
Committee
Our remuneration policy is 
a key element in enabling 
us to continue to drive our 
high performance culture 
which focuses on building 
shareholder value. 
This report has been prepared on 
behalf of, and has been approved 
by, the Board. It complies with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(the ‘Regulations’), the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the Financial 
Conduct Authority Listing Rules and 
takes into account the accompanying 
Directors’ Remuneration Reporting 
Guidance and the relevant 
policies of shareholder 
representative bodies. 
The report is presented in 
three main sections: an annual 
statement from the Chairman 
of the Committee; the directors’ 
remuneration policy to be approved 
by shareholders at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’); 
and the annual report on 
remuneration for 2016. 
In accordance with the Regulations, 
at the 2017 AGM we will be 
asking shareholders to vote on two 
separate remuneration resolutions 
as follows:
• the binding triennial vote on the 
directors’ remuneration policy 
which describes the Company’s 
forward looking directors’ 
remuneration policy which will, 
subject to shareholder approval, 
become formally effective as at 
the date of the 2017 AGM (and is 
set out on pages 62 to 74); and 
• an advisory vote on the annual 
report on remuneration as set 
out on pages 74 to 87 which 
provides details of 
the remuneration earned 
by directors for performance 
in the year ended 
31 December 2016.
60
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report The annual bonuses for Brian May and 
Patrick Larmon are 77% and 66% of their 
annual salaries respectively. In line with the 
remuneration policy, 50% of the annual 
bonuses will be delivered in shares, subject 
to a three year deferral. In addition, 100% of 
the executive share options and 82% of the 
performance shares vested under the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’) for the performance periods that 
ended in 2016. 
Review of remuneration policy and 
shareholder consultation 
As we approach our 2017 AGM and the 
triennial binding vote on our directors’ 
remuneration policy, we have undertaken a 
thorough review of the policy and have 
consulted on the proposed changes with our 
largest shareholders and with proxy voting 
advisers. The existing policy was strongly 
supported by shareholders when voted on in 
2014 and the key elements of that policy 
remain at the core of our proposed 
remuneration policy.
Over recent years, the Group has grown and 
expanded internationally through a series of 
acquisitions, extending our geographic 
footprint across 30 countries. Our 
remuneration framework is a crucial 
element in enabling us to compete for key 
talent internationally and in continuing to 
drive our high performance culture which 
focuses on building shareholder value. 
The current remuneration policy has not 
been changed in the last three years and 
the annual bonus opportunity has remained 
unchanged for eight years. In light of the 
Group’s expansion and its development 
over many years, the Committee has 
reviewed whether the current remuneration 
arrangements remain appropriate. Having 
completed this review, we are proposing 
some amendments to the policy to bring 
it in line with current best practice and to 
drive performance for the Company’s next 
stage of development.
Remuneration arrangements for 
the 2017 financial year and beyond
Executive directors’ base salaries have 
been increased by 2%, effective 1 January 
2017, below that of the workforce average of 
2.8%. Frank van Zanten’s base salary was 
set at £800,000 on his appointment as Chief 
Executive compared to £922,000 for his 
predecessor. Similarly, his pension 
contribution of 25% of base salary is lower 
than the 30% paid to Michael Roney. 
The proposed directors’ remuneration 
policy sets the annual bonus maximum level 
at the FTSE 100 market median of 180% of 
base salary. However, for the 2017 financial 
year, the Chief Executive’s maximum annual 
bonus opportunity will be set at 150% of 
base salary, 30 percentage points below the 
FTSE 100 median and the proposed policy 
maximum (currently set at 115% of base 
salary). For the other executive directors, 
the 2017 maximum annual bonus will be 
limited to 125% of base salary, currently 
115% for Brian May and 110% for Patrick 
Larmon also significantly below the relevant 
FTSE 100 market median. The on-target 
bonus for the Chief Executive for 2017 will 
be 75% of base salary, currently 70%, and 
70% for the other executive directors, which 
is unchanged. The threshold and target 
bonus as a percentage of the maximum 
will reduce as these will remain fixed as 
a percentage of salary. 
Annual bonus awards will continue to be 
based on growth in adjusted earnings per 
share and return on average operating 
capital. These metrics remain key to the 
business strategy and the target levels are 
stretching without encouraging 
inappropriate levels of risk. Threshold, 
target and stretch performance levels will 
be disclosed in the remuneration report for 
the relevant year.
Despite the absolute maximum levels of 
LTIP awards permitted under the policy 
falling below the FTSE 100 median, we 
are not proposing to increase these. 
We are proposing to set the normal award 
limits for the performance share element 
of the LTIP at 150% of base salary and leave 
the limits for share option awards under 
the LTIP unchanged. The resulting LTIP 
award limits are materially lower than 
the FTSE 100 median. 
• Recognising the feedback received from 
shareholders in 2016, going forward the 
Committee will apply time proration to 
performance shares in the event that an 
executive director retires.
• Increased Chief Executive’s 
shareholding requirement to 250% of 
base salary (currently 200%).
• Introduction of a two year post-vesting 
holding requirement on LTIP awards 
from the 2017 AGM onwards.
• The annual bonus maximum level set 
at 180% of base salary with the 2017 
maximum capped at 150% of base 
salary for Frank van Zanten (currently 
115%) and 125% for other executive 
directors (currently 115% and 110% 
of base salary for Brian May and 
Patrick Larmon).
• Annual bonus performance 
targets disclosures enhanced.
• Pension contributions or cash 
allowances for new executive director 
appointments capped at 25% of base 
salary (currently 30%).
• Notice periods for new executive director 
service contracts equalised to 12 months 
from both the Company and employee 
(previously six months from employee 
and 12 months from employer).
• Malus and clawback provisions 
strengthened for both the annual 
bonus, including the cash element, and 
the LTIP.
• The existing variable pay structure 
maintained but with an increased focus 
on above target performance.
The absolute maximum LTIP awards 
permitted under the current policy are 
not increasing, despite being below the 
market median, and actual LTIP award 
levels for 2017 will remain at the same 
level as 2016, significantly below the 
policy maximum.
The total remuneration for Frank 
van Zanten with these changes will 
remain below that of his predecessor 
(excluding the value of the transitional 
relocation package).
We will continue to set robust and 
challenging performance conditions for 
the LTIP awards. These awards are subject 
to earnings per share growth targets and, 
in addition, in the case of the performance 
shares, a relative total shareholder return 
condition. We propose to use the capacity 
in the LTIP policy conservatively, with the 
award levels for 2017 held at 2016 levels. 
For LTIP awards made after the 2017 AGM 
and subsequently, a post-vesting holding 
period will be introduced for executive 
directors. This holding period will continue 
if they leave employment during the holding 
period. The remuneration policy will also 
increase the Chief Executive’s shareholding 
requirement to 250% of base salary in 
line with the FTSE 100 median. Excluding 
the value of his transitional international 
relocation package, following these 
proposed changes the 2017 total on-
target remuneration for Frank van Zanten 
will remain below that of the previous 
Chief Executive.
Conclusions
As a result of these policy changes there 
will be a greater emphasis on performance 
related remuneration for all of the executive 
directors. I very much hope that you will 
support the remuneration resolutions at 
the AGM. This balanced and prudent set 
of proposals is intended to ensure that 
we continue to drive and reward 
performance and maintain alignment 
with shareholders’ interests.

Directors’ 
remuneration policy 
We continue to pursue our well defined 
strategy of developing the business through 
profitable organic growth, consolidating our 
position in the markets in which we compete 
through focused acquisitions in both 
existing and new geographies and 
continuously improving our operating 
model. Bunzl’s business model relies on 
excellent customer and supplier 
relationships and the skills, knowledge and 
experience of its directors and employees. 
The Company’s remuneration policy 
supports this strategy by ensuring that the 
overall remuneration package is set at 
a competitive level while ensuring that 
additional reward is paid for high 
performance over a sustained period. 
This policy is designed to ensure the 
recruitment, retention and motivation 
of the executive directors and other senior 
executives over the long term.
The performance-related elements of the 
remuneration package are designed to 
incentivise executives to meet key 
performance metrics which align their 
interests and remuneration with those of 
shareholders, for example targets relating 
to earnings per share and total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’). In setting such targets the 
Committee takes due account of the 
potential effect such targets could have on 
the attitude and behaviour of executives to 
risk within the business. In addition the 
Committee has the discretion to take into 
account performance on environmental, 
social and governance matters.
Overview
Our directors’ remuneration policy has been 
reviewed during the year and is submitted 
for approval in the required triennial vote at 
the 2017 AGM. The overall approach to 
remuneration adopted by the Company has 
been in place for many years and the key 
elements of this policy are very little 
changed from those approved by 
shareholders in 2014. 
Our current directors’ remuneration policy, 
which is effective subject to our new policy 
being approved by shareholders at our 2017 
AGM, is set out in our 2014 and 2015 Annual 
Reports and is also available on our website 
at www.bunzl.com. 
The proposed policy set out below is 
submitted to be approved by shareholders 
at our 2017 AGM and will formally take effect 
from the date of the AGM with the exception 
of the annual bonus where the policy will 
apply for the full financial year in 2017. 
The proposed policy is designed to meet the 
following objectives:
• to support the next phase of the Group’s 
growth and development;
• to bring the policy in line with current best 
practice principles;
• to provide flexibility to take better account 
of market remuneration levels;
• to ensure remuneration reflects the 
performance of the Group in the relevant 
year and the longer term; and 
• to align pay with the strategic objectives 
of the Company and the interests of our 
shareholders.
In setting the remuneration policy for the 
executive directors, the Committee also 
takes into consideration a number of 
different factors:
• the Committee applies the principles set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and also takes into account best practice 
guidance issued by the major UK 
institutional investor bodies, the Financial 
Conduct Authority (including the 
provisions of any applicable remuneration 
codes) and other relevant organisations;
• the Committee has overall responsibility 
for the remuneration policies and 
structures for employees of the Group as 
a whole and it reviews remuneration 
policy on a Group wide basis. When the 
Committee determines and reviews the 
remuneration policy for the executive 
directors it considers and compares it 
against the pay, policy and employment 
conditions of the rest of the Group to 
ensure that there is alignment between 
the two; and
• the Committee considers the external 
market in which the Group operates and 
uses comparator remuneration data from 
time to time to inform its decisions. 
However, the Committee recognises that 
such data should be used as a guide only 
(recognising that data can be volatile and 
may not be directly relevant) and that 
there is often a need to phase-in changes 
over a period of time.
62
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report The Committee’s overall policy, having had due regard to the factors above, continues to be for a substantial proportion of total 
remuneration to be based on variable pay. This is achieved by setting base pay and benefits up to mid-market levels, with annual bonus and 
long term incentive opportunities linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets which will be disclosed. In this way the 
Committee facilitates alignment between the interests of shareholders and the total remuneration paid to the executive directors. 
The table below summarises how the proposed policy compares with the current policy: 
Summary of key features of current policy Summary of key features of proposed policy
Pension Defined contribution to pension or cash allowance

that provide for 12 months’ notice from the Company and 
six months’ notice from the executive.
Contracts for new executive directors will provide for an 
equal notice period from the Company and the executive 
of a maximum of 12 months’ notice.

Engagement with shareholders
The Committee engages with, and seeks the 
views of, its major investors and investor 
representative bodies on any significant 
changes to the Company’s remuneration 
policy. The Committee also engages from 
time to time with shareholders when 
considering important questions about the 
implementation of the policy. Views 
expressed by shareholders are considered 
by the Committee as part of any review of 
remuneration policy or sooner if 
appropriate. 
Remuneration policy for 
executive directors
The following table summarises each 
element of the proposed remuneration 
policy for the executive directors, explaining 
how each element operates and links to the 
corporate strategy. The policy will be 
formally effective following shareholder 
approval at the 2017 AGM with the annual 
bonus policy applying for the full financial 
year. If approved, this policy supersedes 
that approved by shareholders in 2014.

Maximum 
potential value
• the annual bonus policy maximum is 180% of base salary
• the annual target bonus opportunity is capped at 50% of the maximum, where the maximum exceeds 140% 
of base salary 
• for the 2017 performance year for Frank van Zanten the maximum annual bonus will be limited to 150% of 
base salary with the on-target award at 50% of the maximum, equating to an on-target bonus of 75% of 
base salary

to 125% of base salary with the on-target bonus remaining at the current 70% of base salary
• the current threshold levels of bonus for Frank van Zanten and Brian May are 49% of base salary and 31% of 
base salary for Patrick Larmon. As the maximum bonus percentage increases, these threshold levels will 
remain fixed as a percentage of base salary and thereby reduce as a percentage of the maximum
• any further increase during the policy period, within the policy maximum, will be subject to Company 
performance
Performance 
metrics
• metrics will be set each year by the Committee aligned to the Company’s key strategic objectives
For the 2017 performance year, the principal metrics are as follows:
• growth at constant exchange rates in the Company’s earnings per share adjusted to exclude items which do 
not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance (‘eps’) against the relevant target
• the bonus derived from constant exchange rate eps performance will be increased or decreased according 
to the Company’s performance against the target return on average operating capital (‘RAOC’), referred to 
as the RAOC modifier 
• the use of eps and RAOC measures are seen as appropriate as they are two of the Company’s Key 
Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’). The use of eps growth aligns the executive directors’ interests with those 
of the shareholders and the RAOC modifier ensures the continued focus on the management of capital 
employed together with profit growth 
• bonus awards are at the Committee’s discretion and may take into account performance on environmental, 
social and governance matters as appropriate 
• Patrick Larmon has additional measures based on the profit before interest, tax, customer relationships 
amortisation and acquisition related costs (‘PBITA’) and RAOC of the business area for which he has direct 
responsibility (North America) and both are measured on a constant exchange rate basis. The additional 
measures relating to PBITA and RAOC are relevant for Patrick Larmon as these are both KPIs of the 
business area he is responsible for running and these measures, together with other performance 
measures, are used to incentivise the management team in North America
• the performance metrics and targets are reviewed annually to ensure they remain appropriate. The 
Committee retains the discretion to set alternative metrics as appropriate
• the current relevant performance metrics are: threshold (which must be exceeded to attract any payment of 
bonus); target; and maximum amount (the level at which the bonus is capped). These performance metrics 
are determined at the start of the year by reference to the Group’s annual budget. No elements of the bonus 
are guaranteed. As in previous years, the specific targets will not be disclosed while still commercially 
sensitive 
Long term incentives
Purpose • incentivise growth in longer term eps and TSR
• align with shareholders’ interests
• recruit and retain senior employees
Operation • discretionary biannual grants of executive share option awards and performance share awards which vest 
subject to performance conditions measured over three years and subject to continuous Company service
• a malus and clawback facility is in operation under which part or the full amount of a vested award may be 
recovered, by a reduction in the amount of any future bonus, subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting 
award or future share awards and/or a requirement to make a cash payment, for a period of three years 
from the relevant performance year, to the extent that the value of a vested award is subsequently found to 
have been overstated as a result of a material misstatement of performance or there has been a significant 
failure of risk control or serious misconduct
• two year post-vesting holding requirement for shares that vest, net of sales to settle tax or other withholding 
due on vesting or exercise of awards

period of either three or five years (currently £500 per month) 
• in the US, the ESPP allows the purchase in the market of shares within IRS limits (currently up to an annual 
maximum of 10% of remuneration or US$25,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower)

Note
A description of how the Company will operate the policy in 2017 is detailed within the remuneration policy summary as set out on pages 64 to 68. 
Performance measures and targets
The key measures used by the Committee for incentivising the executive directors are eps modified by RAOC for the annual bonus and eps 
and relative TSR for the 2014 LTIP. The Committee considers that all of these measures are appropriate for incentive purposes. 
• Eps is one of the Company’s KPIs. The use of eps aligns the executive directors’ interests with those of shareholders. In addition, one of 
the executive directors, Patrick Larmon, President and Chief Executive Officer of North America, also has part of his annual bonus 
determined by additional measures relating to PBITA and RAOC which are relevant as these are two of the KPIs of the business area he 
is responsible for managing.
• RAOC is another of the Company’s KPIs. The RAOC modifier ensures continued focus on management of capital employed and profit 
growth by rewarding efficient profit generation, taking into account acquisitions once they are established, and uses average capital 
employed rather than only capital employed at the end of the period.
• Relative TSR provides an external assessment of the Company’s performance against similar sized companies listed in the UK. It also 
aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
This combination of performance measures provides an important balance relevant to the Group’s business and market conditions as well 
as providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior management and shareholders. The Committee does not feel that the 
introduction of non-financial measures for the executive directors is appropriate at this time.
The Committee reviews performance targets on an annual basis taking into account the Company’s annual budgeting process, the 
economic environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and external expectations.
Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors and employees in general
The main difference in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees in general is the split of fixed and performance 
related pay such as bonus and long term incentives. Overall the percentage of performance related pay, in particular longer term incentive 
pay, is greater for the executive directors. This reflects that executive directors have more freedom to act and the consequences of their 
decisions are likely to have a broader and more far reaching time span of effect than those decisions made by employees with more limited 
responsibility. As a consequence only executive directors, Executive Committee members and other key employees (currently 29 people) 
are granted both executive share option and performance share awards. Approximately 414 senior managers are granted executive share 
option awards on an annual basis, which helps to provide a common focus for management in the Company’s decentralised organisation 
structure, whereas the annual bonuses are related to the performance of individual operating units.
Bonus arrangements vary throughout the Group and are related to the specific role and the country in which the employee operates. The 
majority of bonus plans have quantitative targets but the performance measures and targets vary according to each specific role. Sales 
representatives often have high levels of annual bonus payments which may be commission based.
When there is a critical mass of employees within a country to make it cost-effective to do so, to encourage wider employee share 
ownership, an all employee share plan may be offered. Currently plans are offered to all employees based in Australia, Canada, Germany, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, US and UK. In France employees take part in profit sharing arrangements in accordance with local regulations. 
Retirement and other benefits offered to employees across the Group differ according to the country in which the job is based and the 
function and seniority of the relevant role.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is provided annually with information on the salaries and proposed increases for the Executive Committee members and 
other senior direct reports of the Chief Executive, as well as data on the average salary increases within each geographical region within 
the Group. In addition the Committee reviews and agrees all grants of executive share option and performance share awards.
In 2017 the majority of employees across the Group have received salary increases in the range of 2.2%–3.4%, dependent on geographical 
location with the principal exception being those employees based in Brazil, Latin America and China where, due to inflation, current 
market salary increases are much higher. The actual increases received by employees have been based on each individual’s contribution 
and performance as well as the market competitiveness of the salary.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase within the geographical regions for the broader employee population when 
determining the annual salary increases for the executive directors and is cognisant of the Group’s overall employment arrangements 
when reviewing and implementing the executive directors’ remuneration policy. Although the Committee did not consult with employees 
with regard to the remuneration policy of the executive directors, the Company does monitor employees’ views through a regular  
employee survey.
Recruitment of executive directors – approach to remuneration
For the ongoing stability and growth of the Group, it is important to secure, as necessary, the appointment of high calibre executives 
to the Board by either external recruitment or internal promotion. The overarching principles applied by the Committee in developing 
the remuneration package will be to set an appropriate base salary together with benefits and short and long term incentives taking into 
consideration the skills and experience of the individual, the complexity and breadth of the role, the particular needs and situation of the 
Group, internal relativities, the marketplace in which the executive will operate and an individual’s current remuneration package and 
location. In addition, the Committee recognises that it may need to meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate. 
To ensure consistency across the Board, any variable pay awards for new executive director appointments will not exceed the maximum 
limits set out in the policy table above. However, in addition, for an external appointment the Committee may consider offering additional 
cash and/or share based elements to replace deferred awards forfeited by the individual on leaving their existing employment when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Such elements, as appropriate, would be made under 
Section 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules and would take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to the 
awards forfeited. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element or benefit awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to remain in place 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the new appointment. 
Executive directors’ service contracts
Frank van Zanten’s service contract provides for an equal notice period from the Company and the executive of a maximum 12 months’ 
notice and any contracts for newly appointed executive directors will provide for equal notice in the future. The other executive directors 
are employed on contracts that provide for 12 months’ notice from the Company and six months’ notice from the executive. For Brian May 
there is no predetermined compensation for termination of his contract. Patrick Larmon’s contract provides that on termination by the 
Company without cause he is entitled to receive payment of 12 months’ base salary plus health insurance coverage, reduced by any interim 
earnings. The date of each service contract is noted in the table below.
Date of service contract
Frank van Zanten 13 January 2016 
Brian May 9 December 2005
Patrick Larmon 1 January 2005

Policy on payment for departure from office
On termination of an executive director’s service contract, the Committee will take into account the departing director’s duty to mitigate his 
loss when determining the amount of compensation. The Committee’s policy in respect of the treatment of executive directors leaving the 
Group is described below and is designed to support a smooth transition from the Company taking into account the interests of 
shareholders:
Component 
of pay
Voluntary resignation 
or termination for 
cause
Death, ill health, disability (excluding redundancy) Departure on 
agreed terms
Base salary, 
pension and 
benefits
Paid for the proportion of 
the notice period worked 
and any untaken holidays 
pro-rated to the leaving date
Paid up to the date of death or leaving, including any untaken 
holidays pro-rated to such date. In the case of ill health, 
a payment in lieu of notice may be made and, according to 
the circumstances, may be subject to mitigation. In such 
circumstances some benefits such as company car or 
medical insurance may be retained until the end of the 
notice period
Treatment will 
normally fall 
between the two 
treatments 
described in the 
previous columns, 
subject to the 
discretion of the 
Committee and 
the terms of 
any termination 
agreement. 
However in the 
case of retirement 
of an executive 
director unvested 
performance 
shares will 
normally be 
subject to time 
proration

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC and IRS 
rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions. 
These include the following:
• selecting the participants in the plans;
• determining the timing of grants and/or payments;
• determining the quantum of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• adjusting the constituents of the TSR comparator group;
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
• determining ‘good leaver’ status and the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans;
• determining the extent of vesting of awards under share based plans in the event of a change of control;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation 
of capital and special dividends); and
• under the annual review of weighting of performance measures, setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 2014 LTIP from year 
to year.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applying to share based awards if an event occurs which causes the Committee to 
consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are 
fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.

2017 Remuneration overview
The remuneration package comprises both core fixed elements (base salary, pension and other benefits) and performance based variable 
elements (cash bonus, the DASBS and the LTIP). The Committee has set a guideline that for on-target performance approximately half of 
the remuneration package should be performance related. The structure of the remuneration packages for on-target and stretch 
performance for each of the executive directors for 2017, in line with the new remuneration policy, is illustrated in the bar charts below.

Notes
a)  Salary represents annual salary for 2017. Benefits such as a car or car allowance and private medical insurance have been included based on 2016 figures. In the case of Frank 
van Zanten, benefits also include the transitional international relocation package including accommodation, which are gross amounts before taxes, referred to on page 75. 
Patrick Larmon’s salary is paid in US dollars and has been translated at the 2016 year end closing exchange rate of £1: US$1.24.
b)  Pension represents the cost of pension accrued in 2016 in the Defined Benefit Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan for Brian May, the value of the annual pension allowance for 
Frank van Zanten and Brian May and the total of the Company’s contributions to Patrick Larmon’s 401K Plan and Retirement Savings Benefit (the ‘RSB’). No further 
contributions were made through the Defined Contribution Senior Executive Retirement Agreement (‘SERA’), further details of which are shown on page 79. 
c) Below threshold performance comprises salary, benefits and pension only with no bonus awarded and no LTIP awards vested.
d)  Target performance comprises annual bonus awarded at target level (i.e. for 2017 an on-target bonus of 75% of base salary for Frank van Zanten and 70% of base salary for 
Brian May and Patrick Larmon comprised of half cash and half deferred shares under the DASBS) and, for the LTIP, an assumption that 50% of performance shares will vest 
and that 50% of the share options will vest and deliver 30% of their face value in gain to the executives.
e)  Stretch performance comprises annual bonus awarded at maximum level (i.e for 2017, the maximum annual bonus will be limited to 150% of base salary for Frank van Zanten 
and 125% of base salary for Brian May and Patrick Larmon comprised of half cash and half deferred shares under the DASBS) and, for the LTIP, an assumption that 100% of 
performance shares will vest delivering 100% of their face value in gain to the executive directors and 100% of share options will vest which will deliver 30% of their face value 
in gain to the executives.
Legacy arrangements
The directors’ remuneration policy first approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM gave authority to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors (that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports) 
or internally promoted future directors (in each case, such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share plans). Details of any 
payments to former directors will be set out in the remuneration report as they arise.

Vanda Murray 1 February 2015 4 4
*Meinie Oldersma retired from the Board on 22 August 2016.
The Secretary to the Committee is Julie Welch, Director of Group Human Resources. No director plays any part in determining his or her 
remuneration. During the year ended 31 December 2016, both the Chief Executive and the Chairman were consulted and invited to attend 
meetings of the Committee but were not present during any part of the meeting when their own remuneration was under consideration.
The terms of reference of the Committee have been formally adopted by the Board and are available for inspection in the Investor Centre 
section of the Company’s website, www.bunzl.com. The key responsibilities of the Committee include:
• ensuring that executive directors and senior executives are properly incentivised to attract, retain and fairly reward them for their 
individual contribution to the Company and having due regard to the policies and practices applied to the rest of the employees within the 
Group;
• determining the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors of the Board including 
setting their individual remuneration packages as well as their level of remuneration and overseeing all the Company’s long term 
incentive plans;
• ensuring that remuneration is aligned with and supports the Company’s strategy and performance, having due regard to the 
shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Company, while at the same time not encouraging undue risk taking; and
• communicating and discussing any remuneration issues with the Company’s stakeholders as and when appropriate.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In carrying out these responsibilities, the Committee seeks external remuneration advice as necessary. During the year the Committee 
received advice from PwC and Aon Hewitt. PwC provided external survey data on directors’ remuneration and benefit levels. Aon Hewitt 
provided information to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the performance conditions attached to existing share option and 
performance share awards under the LTIP had been satisfied and in addition advised the Committee on the changes to the remuneration 
policy. The fees payable to each adviser, based on hourly rates, were: £12,700 (PwC) and £34,170 (Aon Hewitt) respectively for such work 
undertaken in 2016. In addition to the work undertaken on behalf of the Committee, PwC, who are the Company’s external auditors, also 
provided a limited amount of non-audit services to the Company as set out in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Looking 
forward, any other non-audit services required by the Company will, in the main, be provided by other firms to ensure the independence 
of PwC’s work as auditors. 
Statement of voting at the 2016 AGM for the remuneration report and at the 2014 AGM for the remuneration policy

Performance against annual bonus targets (audited information) 
The annual bonus plan and DASBS currently operate as set out in the policy section on pages 61 and 62 of the 2015 Annual Report. For Frank 
van Zanten, the bonus opportunity for 2016 was split between performance in terms of PBITA and RAOC based on the Continental Europe 
(’CE’) business area from 1 February 2016 to 19 April 2016 and the performance of the Group from 20 April 2016 on his appointment to Chief 
Executive. His bonus opportunity as Chief Executive was based on growth in the Company’s constant exchange rate eps relative to budget 
which was modified by the achievement of the Group’s RAOC relative to budget. All of Brian May’s and 25% of Patrick Larmon’s bonus potential 
in 2016 related to growth in the Company’s constant exchange rate eps relative to budget which was modified by the achievement of the 
Group’s RAOC relative to budget. For Patrick Larmon, a further 75% of his bonus potential related to the PBITA performance of North America 
(‘NA’) which was modified by the achievement of NA’s RAOC relative to the target set and measured on a constant exchange rate basis. The 
results for 2016 against the targets set were as follows:

Executive share option awards – LTIP Part A
Executive share options may vest based solely on the Company’s eps growth (adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s 
underlying financial performance) over three years, based on the following sliding scale:
Absolute annual growth in the Company’s eps over a three year period Proportion of share option awards exercisable
Below 5% Nil
5% 25%
Between 5% and 8% Pro rata between 25%–100%
8% or above 100%
79
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Directors’ remuneration report continued
Performance share awards – LTIP Part B
The extent to which half of the awards may vest is subject to a performance condition based on the Company’s eps growth (adjusted to 
exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance) over three years, based on the following sliding scale:
Absolute annual growth in the Company’s eps over a three year period Proportion of performance share awards exercisable
Below 6% Nil
6% 25%
Between 6% and 12% Pro rata between 25%–100%
12% or above 100%
The extent to which the other half of the performance share awards may vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance, a combination 
of both the Company’s share price and dividend performance during the three year performance period, relative to the TSR performance of 
a specified comparator group of similarly sized companies with large international presence. These performance share awards may vest 
based on the following sliding scale:
TSR Proportion of performance share awards exercisable
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25%–100%
Upper quartile or above 100%
The applicable comparator group for the 2016 awards were those companies in the FTSE 50 – 150 with significant international operations, 
excluding companies in the financial services, oil & gas and natural resources sectors.
Shareholder dilution
In accordance with The Investment Association Principles of Remuneration, the Company can satisfy awards to employees under all 
its share plans with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital (adjusted 
for share issuance and cancellation) in a rolling 10 year period. Within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue (as newly issued 
shares or from treasury), 5% of its issued share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) to satisfy awards under executive 
(discretionary) plans.
As well as the LTIP, the Company operates various all employee share schemes as described on page 67. Newly issued shares are 
currently used to satisfy the exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme and the International and Irish Sharesave Plans. Awards 
under the LTIP of executive options and performance shares are principally satisfied by shares delivered from the Employee Benefit Trust 
which buys shares on the market, unless security laws in relevant jurisdictions prevent this.
Limit on awards

2017 bonus targets
The structure for Frank van Zanten’s, Brian May’s and 25% of Patrick Larmon’s annual bonus for 2017 is described on pages 64 and 65. 
The threshold for bonus payments on growth in constant exchange rate eps has been set at the actual result achieved in 2016 on a constant 
exchange rate basis. For Patrick Larmon the other 75% of his bonus will relate to the attainment of PBITA performance of NA relative to 
budget which will be modified, positively or negatively, by the achievement of NA’s RAOC relative to the target set. The relevant 
performance points are: threshold (which must be exceeded to attract any payment of bonus); target; and maximum amount (the level at 
which the bonus for that measure is capped). These performance points are determined at the start of the year by reference to the Group’s 
annual budget. No elements of the bonus are guaranteed. As in previous years, the specific performance points are not disclosed while 
still commercially sensitive, but are disclosed the following year.
Performance measures for long term incentives to be awarded in 2017
Grants of executive share options and performance shares awarded to executive directors and senior executives in 2017 will be subject to 
the same performance conditions as those executive share options and performance share awards granted in 2016 as detailed on pages 
79 and 80.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 
The Park Suite, The Dorchester, Park Lane, 
London W1K 1QA on Wednesday 19 April 
2017 at 11.00 am. The Notice convening the 
Annual General Meeting is set out in a 
separate letter from the Chairman to 
shareholders which explains the items of 
business which are not of a routine nature.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 13.00p was paid on 
3 January 2017 in respect of 2016 and the 
directors recommend a final dividend of  
29.0p, making a total for the year of 42.0p 
per share (2015: 38.0p). Dividend details are 
given in Note 17 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Subject to approval by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 April 2016, the final dividend will be 
paid on 3 July 2017 to those shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
26 May 2017.
Share Capital
The Company has a single class of share 
capital which is divided into ordinary shares 
of 32
1
⁄
7
p each which rank pari passu in 
respect of participation and voting rights. 
The shares are in registered form, are fully 
paid up and are quoted on the London Stock 
Exchange. In addition, the Company 
operates a Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt programme with Citibank N.A. 
under which the Company’s shares are 
traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) 
market in the form of American Depositary 
Receipts.
Details of changes to the issued share 
capital during the year are set out in Note 16 
to the consolidated financial statements.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2016 the directors had 
been notified by the following shareholders 
that they were each interested in 3% or 
more of the issued share capital of the 
Company.
As at 27 February 2017 no further 
notifications have been received since the 
year end.
Bunzl Group General  
Employee Benefit Trust
Bunzl Employee Trustees Limited is trustee 
of the Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust (‘the EBT’) which holds shares 
in respect of employee share options and 
awards that have not been exercised or 
vested. The current position is that the EBT 
abstains from voting in respect of these 
shares. The trustee has agreed to waive the 
right to dividend payments on shares held 
within the EBT. Details of the shares so held 
are set out in Note 16 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Rights and obligations  
attaching to shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and without prejudice to any rights 
attached to any existing shares, the 
Company may resolve by ordinary 
resolution to issue shares with such rights 
and restrictions as set out in such 
resolution or (if there is no such resolution 
or so far as it does not make specific 
provision) as the Board may decide. Subject 
to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and of any resolution of the Company 
passed pursuant thereto and without 
prejudice to any rights attached to existing 
shares, the Board is duly authorised to issue 
and allot, grant options over or otherwise 
dispose of the Company’s shares on such 
terms and conditions and at such times as 
it thinks fit. If at any time the share capital 
of the Company is divided into different 
classes of shares, the rights attached to any 
class may be varied or abrogated by special 
resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of such holders. Subject to the 
rights attached to any existing shares, 
rights attached to shares will be deemed 
to be varied by the reduction of capital paid 
up on the shares and by the allotment of 
further shares ranking in priority in respect 
of dividend or capital or which confer on the 
holders more favourable voting rights than 
the first-mentioned shares, but will not 
otherwise be deemed to be varied by the 
creation or issue of further shares.
Power to issue and allot shares
The directors are generally and 
unconditionally authorised under the 
authorities granted at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting to allot shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for or to convert any 
security into shares of the Company up  
to a maximum nominal amount of £35.92 
million. At the same meeting authority was 
also granted to the directors to allot the 
Company’s shares for cash, up to a 
maximum nominal amount of approximately 
£5.39 million, without regard to the  
pre-emption provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. No such shares were issued or 
allotted under these authorities in 2016, 
nor is there any current intention to do so, 
other than to satisfy share options under 
the Company’s share option schemes and, 
if necessary, to satisfy the consideration 
payable for businesses to be acquired.
These authorities are valid until the 
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The directors again 
propose to seek equivalent authorities at 
such Annual General Meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary shares 
by its directors, persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities, certain 
employees of the Company and, in each 
case, any persons closely associated with 
them, are subject to the Company’s 
Dealing Code.
Certain restrictions, which are customary 
for a listed company, apply to transfers of 
shares in the Company. The Board may 
refuse to register an instrument of transfer 
of any share which is not a fully paid share 
and of a certificated share at its discretion 
unless it is:
• lodged, duly stamped or duly certified, at 
the offices of the Company’s registrar or 
such other place as the Board may specify 
and is accompanied by the certificate for 
the shares to which it relates and such 
other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer;
• in respect of only one class of shares; and
• in favour of not more than four 
transferees.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Directors’ report | Other statutory information Registration of a transfer of an 
uncertificated share may be refused in the 
circumstances set out in the uncertificated 
securities rules, and where, in the case of a 
transfer to joint holders, the number of joint 
holders to whom the uncertificated share is 
to be transferred exceeds four.
In addition, no instrument of transfer for 
certificated shares shall be registered if the 
transferor has been served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (the 
‘Articles’)) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning 
certain interests in the Company’s shares 
required to be provided under the 
Companies Act 2006, unless the transfer 
is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an 
arm’s length sale. The Board has the power 
to procure that uncertificated shares are 
converted into certificated shares and kept 
in certificated form for as long as the 
Board requires.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
may result in any restriction of the transfer 
of shares or voting rights.
Restrictions on voting rights
A member shall not be entitled to vote, 
unless the Board otherwise decides, at any 
general meeting or class meeting in respect 
of any shares held by them if any call or 
other sums payable remain unpaid. 
Currently, all issued shares are fully paid. 
In addition, no member shall be entitled to 
vote if he has been served with a restriction 
notice after failure to provide the Company 
with information concerning certain 
interests in the Company’s shares required 
to be provided under the Companies Act 
2006. Votes may be exercised in person or 
by proxy. The Articles currently provide a 
deadline for submission of proxy forms of 
48 hours before the relevant meeting, 
24 hours before a poll is taken if such poll 
is taken more than 48 hours after it was 
demanded or during the meeting at which 
the poll was demanded if the poll is not 
taken straight away but is taken not more 
than 48 hours after it was demanded.
Purchase of own shares
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders gave the Company authority 
to purchase a maximum of 33,520,000 
ordinary shares. During the year ended 
31 December 2016 the Company did not 
purchase any of its own shares pursuant to 
this authority or the authority granted at the 
2015 Annual General Meeting and no shares 
have been purchased between 31 December 
2016 and 27 February 2017. The Company is 
therefore currently authorised to buy back 
33,520,000 of its own shares pursuant to the 
existing shareholders’ authority which is 
due to expire at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The directors again propose to seek the 
equivalent authority at such Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors
Directors may be elected by ordinary 
resolution at a duly convened general 
meeting or appointed by the Board. Under 
the Articles, the minimum number of 
directors shall be two and the maximum 
shall be 15. In accordance with the Articles, 
each director is required to retire at the 
Annual General Meeting held in the third 
calendar year after which he or she was 
appointed or last appointed and any director 
who has held office with the Company, other 
than employment or executive office, for a 
continuous period of nine years or more 
at the date of the Annual General Meeting 
is subject to annual re-appointment. 
The Board may also appoint a person willing 
to act as a director during the year either 
to fill a vacancy or as an additional director 
but so that the total number of directors 
shall not at any time exceed 15. However 
such appointee shall only hold office until 
the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company.
In addition to any power to remove a director 
from office conferred by company law, the 
Company may also by special resolution 
remove a director from office before the 
expiration of his or her period of office 
under the Articles.
The office of a director shall also be vacated 
pursuant to the Articles if the director:
• resigns by giving notice to the Company 
or is asked to resign by all of the other 
directors who are not less than three in 
number; or
• is or has been suffering from mental or 
physical ill health and the Board resolves 
that his or her office be vacated; or
• is absent without permission from Board 
meetings for six consecutive months and 
the Board resolves that his or her office 
be vacated; or
• becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
or her creditors generally; or
• is prohibited by law from being a director; 
or
• ceases to be a director by virtue of any 
provisions of company law or is removed 
from office pursuant to the Articles.
Biographical details of all the directors who 
served throughout the year are set out on 
page 48. Lloyd Pitchford has been appointed 
to the Board with effect from 1 March 2017. 
Notwithstanding the retirement by rotation 
provisions in the Articles, each of the 
directors will retire and offer themselves 
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code apart 
from David Sleath who retires from the 
Board at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors’ interests in ordinary shares are 
shown in Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements. None of the directors 
was materially interested in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings during or at the 
end of 2016. Information relating to the 
directors’ service agreements and their 
remuneration for the year and details of the 
directors’ share options under the 
Company’s share option schemes and 
awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
and Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme 
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 60 to 87.
Powers of the directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act 
2006 and any directions given by the 
Company by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board 
who may exercise all powers of the 
Company. The Board may, by power of 
attorney or otherwise, appoint any person 
or persons to be the agent or agents of the 
Company for such purposes and on such 
conditions as the Board determines.
Directors’ indemnities
Indemnities were in force throughout 2016 
and remain in force as at the date of this 
report under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the directors and the 
Company Secretary, in addition to other 
senior executives who are directors of 
subsidiaries of the Company, to the extent 
permitted by law and the Articles in respect 
of all losses arising out of, or in connection 
with, the execution of their powers, duties 
and responsibilities as a director or officer 
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

issues. Further information relating to the 
Company’s approach to these matters is set 
out in the Corporate responsibility report on 
pages 38 to 47.
Employment policies
The employment policies of the Group have 
been developed to meet the needs of its 
different business areas and the locations in 
which they operate worldwide, embodying 
the principles of equal opportunity. The 
Group has standards of business conduct 
with which it expects all its employees to 
comply. Bunzl encourages involvement of 
its employees in the performance of the 
business in which they are employed and 
aims to achieve a sense of shared 
commitment. In addition to a regular 
magazine and the Company’s intranet, 
which provide a variety of information on 
activities and developments within the 
Group and incorporate half year and annual 
financial reports, announcements are 
periodically circulated to give details of 
corporate and staff matters together with 
a number of subsidiary or business area 
publications dealing with activities in 
specific parts of the Group.
It is the Group’s policy that disabled 
applicants should be considered for 
employment and career development on 
the basis of their aptitudes and abilities. 
Employees who become disabled during 
their working life will be retained in 
employment wherever possible and given 
help with rehabilitation and training.
Significant agreements
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, 
Bunzl Finance plc, has a number of bilateral 
loan facilities with a range of different 
counterparties, all of which are guaranteed 
by the Company, are in substantially the 
same form and are prepayable at the option 
of the lender in the event of a change of 
control of the Company. Similar change of 
control provisions in relation to the 
Company are included in the US dollar, 
sterling and euro US private placement 
notes which have been entered into by Bunzl 
Finance plc and the Company and are also 
guaranteed by the Company.
Political donations
During 2016 no contributions were made 
for political purposes.
Disclosures required under UK 
listing rule 9.8.4
Apart from the dividend waiver which 
has been issued in respect of shares held 
by the Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust referred to in Note 16 to 
the consolidated financial statements on 
page 120, there are no disclosures required 
to be made under UK Listing Rule 9.8.4.
External auditors
Each of the directors at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make the director aware of any 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Resolutions are to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
for the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors 
of the Company at a rate of remuneration 
to be determined by the directors.
Strategic report and  
Directors’ report
Pages 1 to 47 inclusive consist of the 
Strategic report and pages 48 to 90 inclusive 
consist of the Directors’ report. These 
reports have been drawn up and presented 
in accordance with, and in reliance upon, 
applicable English company law and any 
liability of the directors in connection 
with these reports shall be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by 
such law.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe 
harbour limits the liability of directors in 
respect of statements in and omissions 
from a strategic report and a directors’ 
report. Under English law, the directors 
would be liable to the Company, but not to 
any third party, if the Strategic report or the 
Directors’ report contain errors as a result 
of recklessness or knowing misstatement 
or dishonest concealment of a material fact, 
but would not otherwise be liable.
The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report were approved by the Board on 
27 February 2017.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Financial	 statements
Consolidated	 cash	 flow	 statement
for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016 1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl	 plc	 (the	 ‘Company’)	 is	 a	 public	 limited	 company	 listed	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange	 incorporated	 and	 domiciled	 in	 the	 	
United	 Kingdom.
(i) Basis of accounting
The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 have	 been	 approved	 by	 the	 directors.	 They	 are	 prepared	
in	 accordance	 with	 (i)	 EU	 endorsed	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (‘IFRS’)	 and	 interpretations	 of	 the	 IFRS	 Interpretations	
Committee	 (‘IFRS	 IC’)	 and	 those	 parts	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 as	 applicable	 to	 companies	 using	 IFRS	 and	 (ii)	 IFRS	 as	 issued	 by	 the	
International	 Accounting	 Standards	 Board	 (‘IASB’).	 They	 are	 prepared	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 convention	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 certain	
items	 which	 are	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 as	 described	 in	 the	 accounting	 policies	 below.	 The	 directors	 consider	 that	 it	 is	 appropriate	 to	 adopt	
the	 going	 concern	 basis	 of	 accounting	 in	 preparing	 the	 financial	 statements.
In	 March	 2016	 an	 agenda	 decision	 of	 the	 IFRS	 IC	 was	 issued	 which	 provided	 clarity	 over	 the	 situations	 where	 cash	 pooling	 arrangements	
meet	 the	 requirements	 of	 IFRS	 to	 present	 cash	 and	 overdrafts	 on	 a	 net	 basis.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 31	 December	 2015	 comparative	 figures	 for	
Cash	 at	 bank	 and	 in	 hand	 and	 Bank	 overdrafts	 have	 been	 increased	 by	 £202.6m	 (31	 December	 2014:	 £216.2m).	 These	 balances	 were	
previously	 presented	 on	 a	 net	 basis	 in	 the	 Consolidated	 balance	 sheet	 and	 relevant	 Notes	 (see	 Note	 13	 and	 Note	 23).
In	 prior	 years	 software	 related	 assets	 were	 included	 as	 a	 part	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 in	 the	 Consolidated	 balance	 sheet.	 As	 the	
Group	 continues	 to	 upgrade	 its	 IT	 systems	 and	 invest	 in	 new	 e-commerce	 platforms,	 separate	 disclosure	 of	 the	 net	 book	 value	 of	 these	
assets	 is	 considered	 to	 enhance	 existing	 disclosures	 and	 increase	 transparency.	 The	 Group	 has	 therefore	 changed	 the	 presentation	 of	
software	 assets	 to	 show	 them	 as	 a	 separate	 component	 of	 intangible	 assets,	 increasing	 intangible	 assets	 and	 reducing	 property,	 plant	
and	 equipment	 by	 £14.1m	 at	 31	 December	 2015	 (31	 December	 2014:	 £11.5m)	 (see	 Note	 9).	
(ii) New accounting standards and interpretations
There	 are	 no	 new	 standards	 issued	 by	 the	 IASB	 that	 are	 applicable	 to	 the	 Group	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016.	 The	 Group	 has	
adopted	 all	 relevant	 amendments	 to	 existing	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 issued	 by	 the	 IASB	 that	 are	 effective	 from	 1	 January	 2016	 with	
no	 material	 impact	 on	 its	 consolidated	 results	 or	 financial	 position.
The	 Group	 is	 currently	 assessing	 the	 potential	 impact	 of	 new	 and	 revised	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 issued	 by	 the	 IASB	 that	 will	
be	 effective	 from	 1	 January	 2017	 and	 beyond,	 none	 of	 which	 have	 been	 adopted	 early.	 A	 summary	 of	 the	 Group’s	 current	 considerations	
with	 respect	 to	 three	 of	 the	 new	 accounting	 standards	 is	 included	 below.
IFRS	 15	 ‘Revenue	 from	 Contracts	 with	 Customers’	 will	 be	 effective	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ending	
31	 December	 2018,	 with	 comparatives	 restated	 from	 a	 transition	 date	 of	 1	 January	 2017.	 Revenue	 is	 currently	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	
statement	 at	 the	 point	 in	 time	 at	 which	 the	 significant	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership	 of	 the	 goods	 are	 transferred.	 IFRS	 15	 requires	
companies	 to	 apportion	 revenue	 from	 customer	 contracts	 to	 separate	 performance	 obligations	 and	 recognise	 revenue	 as	 these	
performance	 obligations	 are	 satisfied.	 The	 Group	 has	 reviewed	 its	 arrangements	 with	 customers	 and	 concluded	 that	 for	 substantially	 	
all	 of	 its	 customer	 contracts	 the	 performance	 obligation	 is	 the	 delivery	 of	 goods	 and	 it	 is	 therefore	 appropriate	 to	 recognise	 revenue	 	
at	 a	 single	 point	 of	 time,	 on	 delivery	 of	 goods,	 which	 is	 consistent	 with	 current	 accounting	 policies.	 Accordingly,	 based	 on	 the	 Group’s	
assessment,	 which	 is	 ongoing,	 the	 application	 of	 IFRS	 15	 is	 not	 anticipated	 to	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 timing	 of	 revenue	 recognition	
and	 consequently	 is	 not	 anticipated	 to	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	 operating	 profit	 or	 financial	 position.
IFRS	 9	 ‘Financial	 Instruments’	 will	 be	 effective	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ending	 31	 December	 2018	 with	 a	
transition	 date	 of	 1	 January	 2017.	 The	 Group	 has	 reviewed	 the	 differences	 between	 IFRS	 9	 and	 the	 current	 accounting	 policies	 which	
comply	 with	 International	 Accounting	 Standards	 (‘IAS’)	 39	 ‘Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement’.	 Based	 on	 this	 analysis	
the	 Group	 does	 not	 anticipate	 that	 there	 will	 be	 any	 material	 impact	 on	 its	 consolidated	 results	 or	 financial	 position.
IFRS	 16	 ‘Leases’	 will	 be	 effective	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ending	 31	 December	 2019,	 which	 the	 Group	 intends	
to	 adopt	 retrospectively	 with	 comparatives	 restated	 from	 a	 transition	 date	 of	 1	 January	 2018.	 To	 prepare	 for	 the	 transition	 to	 this	 new	
accounting	 standard,	 data	 has	 been	 collated	 on	 all	 of	 the	 Group’s	 leases	 which	 are	 principally	 for	 warehouses	 and	 vehicles.	 Based	 on	 the	
Group’s	 assessment,	 which	 is	 ongoing,	 the	 application	 of	 IFRS	 16	 will	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	
The	 new	 standard	 will	 require	 that	 the	 Group's	 leased	 assets	 are	 recorded	 within	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 as	 'right	 of	 use	 assets'	
with	 a	 corresponding	 lease	 liability	 which	 is	 based	 on	 the	 discounted	 value	 of	 the	 cash	 payments	 required	 under	 each	 lease.	 The	 existing	
operating	 lease	 expenses,	 currently	 recorded	 in	 operating	 costs,	 will	 be	 replaced	 with	 a	 depreciation	 charge,	 which	 will	 be	 lower	 than	
the	 current	 operating	 lease	 expense,	 and	 a	 separate	 financing	 expense,	 which	 will	 be	 recorded	 in	 finance	 expense.	 There	 will	 be	 no	 net	
cash	 flow	 impact	 arising	 from	 the	 new	 standard	 and	 the	 Group	 does	 not	 currently	 intend	 to	 alter	 its	 approach	 as	 to	 whether	 assets	 should	
be	 leased	 or	 bought	 going	 forward.	 Current	 banking	 covenants	 are	 unaffected.
Apart	 from	 these	 three	 standards	 the	 Group	 does	 not	 anticipate	 that	 any	 other	 new	 or	 revised	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 issued	 by	 the	
IASB	 that	 will	 be	 effective	 from	 1	 January	 2017	 and	 beyond	 will	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	 its	 consolidated	 results	 or	 financial	 position.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Notes 2 Accounting policies
The	 accounting	 policies	 set	 out	 below	 have,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated,	 been	 applied	 consistently	 to	 all	 periods	 presented	 in	 the	 consolidated	
financial	 statements.
a Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries	 are	 entities	 controlled	 by	 the	 Group.	 Control	 exists	 when	 the	 Group	 is	 either	 exposed	 or	 has	 rights	 to	 variable	 returns	 from	
its	 involvement	 with	 the	 entity	 and	 has	 the	 ability	 to	 affect	 those	 returns	 through	 its	 power	 over	 the	 entity.	 Subsidiaries	 are	 included	 in	
the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 from	 the	 date	 that	 control	 commences	 until	 the	 date	 that	 control	 ceases.	 A	 list	 of	 all	 of	 Bunzl	 plc’s	
subsidiary	 undertakings	 is	 included	 in	 the	 Related	 undertakings	 note	 in	 the	 Shareholder	 information	 section	 on	 pages	 146	 to	 148	 and	 is	
subject	 to	 audit.	 The	 results	 of	 all	 of	 the	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 are	 included	 in	 full	 in	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
(ii) Business combinations
The	 acquisition	 method	 of	 accounting	 is	 used	 to	 account	 for	 the	 acquisition	 of	 subsidiaries.	 Identifiable	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 and	
contingent	 liabilities	 assumed	 in	 a	 business	 combination	 are	 measured	 initially	 at	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 acquisition	 date.	 The	 consideration	 paid	
or	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 acquisitions	 comprises	 amounts	 paid	 on	 completion	 and	 deferred	 consideration,	 excluding	 payments	 which	 are	
contingent	 on	 the	 continued	 employment	 of	 former	 owners	 of	 businesses	 acquired.	 The	 excess	 of	 the	 consideration	 (excluding	 payments	
contingent	 on	 future	 employment)	 over	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 net	 assets	 acquired	 is	 recorded	 as	 goodwill.	 Payments	 that	 are	
contingent	 on	 future	 employment	 and	 transaction	 costs	 and	 expenses	 such	 as	 professional	 fees	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement.
When	 less	 than	 100%	 of	 a	 subsidiary	 is	 acquired,	 the	 Group	 measures	 the	 present	 ownership	 component	 of	 the	 non-controlling	
interest	 at	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 acquisition	 date	 which	 means	 that	 goodwill	 includes	 a	 portion	 attributable	 to	 the	 non-controlling	 interest.	
When	 an	 acquisition	 of	 less	 than	 100%	 of	 a	 subsidiary	 also	 includes	 an	 option	 to	 purchase	 the	 remaining	 share	 of	 the	 subsidiary,	
the	 anticipated	 acquisition	 method	 is	 applied,	 where	 judged	 appropriate	 to	 do	 so,	 meaning	 that	 no	 non-controlling	 interest	 is	 recognised.	
A	 liability	 is	 carried	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 equal	 to	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 option	 and	 this	 is	 revised	 to	 fair	 value	 at	 each	 reporting	 date	 with	
differences	 being	 recorded	 in	 acquisition	 related	 costs	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup	 balances	 and	 any	 unrealised	 gains	 and	 losses	 or	 income	 and	 expenses	 arising	 from	 intragroup	 transactions	 are	 eliminated	
in	 preparing	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
b Foreign currency
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 recorded	 at	 the	 rate	 of	 exchange	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	
denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 exchange	 rate	 prevailing	 at	 that	 date.	 Foreign	 exchange	
differences	 arising	 on	 translation	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement,	 unless	 they	 qualify	 for	 cash	 flow	 or	 net	 investment	 hedge	
accounting	 treatment,	 in	 which	 case	 the	 effective	 portion	 is	 recognised	 directly	 in	 other	 comprehensive	 income.
Assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 foreign	 operations	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 exchange	 rate	 prevailing	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Income	 and	 expenses	
of	 foreign	 operations	 are	 translated	 at	 average	 exchange	 rates.	 All	 resulting	 exchange	 differences,	 including	 exchange	 differences	 arising	
from	 the	 translation	 of	 borrowings	 and	 other	 financial	 instruments	 designated	 as	 hedges	 of	 such	 balances,	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	
other	 comprehensive	 income	 and	 accumulated	 in	 the	 translation	 reserve.	 Differences	 that	 have	 arisen	 since	 1	 January	 2004,	 the	 date	
of	 transition	 to	 IFRS,	 are	 presented	 in	 this	 separate	 component	 of	 equity.
c Revenue
The	 Group	 is	 engaged	 in	 the	 delivery	 of	 goods	 to	 customers.	 Revenue	 from	 a	 sale	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 upon	 delivery	 of	
the	 relevant	 goods	 which	 is	 the	 point	 in	 time	 at	 which	 the	 significant	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership	 of	 the	 goods	 are	 transferred.	 Revenue	
is	 not	 recognised	 if	 there	 is	 significant	 uncertainty	 regarding	 recovery	 of	 the	 consideration	 due.
Revenue	 is	 valued	 at	 invoiced	 amounts,	 excluding	 sales	 taxes,	 less	 estimated	 provisions	 for	 returns	 and	 trade	 discounts	 where	 relevant.	
Returns	 provisions	 and	 early	 settlement	 discounts	 are	 based	 on	 experience	 over	 an	 appropriate	 period	 whereas	 volume	 discounts	 are	
based	 on	 agreements	 with	 customers.
d Cost of goods sold 
Cost	 of	 goods	 sold	 consists	 of	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 inventories	 sold	 or	 disposed	 of	 in	 the	 period	 where	 the	 cost	 of	 inventories	 is	 net	 of	 supplier	
rebate	 income	 related	 to	 those	 inventories.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Financial	 statements
Notes	 continued 2 Accounting policies continued
e Supplier rebates
The	 Group	 has	 various	 rebate	 arrangements	 with	 a	 number	 of	 suppliers.	 Some	 of	 these	 arrangements	 are	 based	 on	 the	 volume	 of	
products	 purchased	 and	 others	 are	 based	 on	 the	 volume	 of	 products	 sold.	 Supplier	 rebate	 income	 is	 recognised	 in	 cost	 of	 goods	 sold	
concurrent	 with	 the	 sale	 of	 the	 inventories	 to	 which	 it	 relates	 and	 is	 calculated	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 expected	 consideration	 receivable	 from	
each	 rebate	 arrangement.	 Substantially	 all	 supplier	 rebate	 income	 is	 unconditional	 and	 non-judgemental.	 Supplier	 rebate	 income	 is	 not	
recognised	 if	 there	 is	 significant	 uncertainty	 regarding	 recovery	 of	 the	 amount	 due.	 Supplier	 rebate	 income	 accrued	 but	 not	 yet	 received	 	
is	 included	 in	 other	 receivables.	
f Share based payments
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 equity	 settled	 share	 based	 payment	 compensation	 plans.	 Details	 of	 these	 plans	 are	 outlined	 in	 Note	 16	
and	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report.	 The	 total	 expected	 expense	 is	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 options	 and	 other	 share	 based	 incentives	
on	 the	 grant	 date	 calculated	 using	 a	 valuation	 model	 which	 is	 spread	 over	 the	 expected	 vesting	 period	 with	 a	 corresponding	 credit	 to	 equity.	
g Leases
Operating	 lease	 rentals	 and	 any	 incentives	 receivable	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 term	 of	 the	
relevant	 lease.	 Leases	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 assumes	 substantially	 all	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership	 of	 the	 leased	 assets	 are	 classified	
as	 finance	 leases.	 Where	 land	 and	 buildings	 are	 held	 under	 leases,	 the	 accounting	 treatment	 of	 the	 land	 is	 considered	 separately	 from	 that	
of	 the	 buildings	 due	 to	 the	 indefinite	 life	 of	 land.	
h Income tax
Income	 tax	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 comprises	 current	 and	 deferred	 tax.	 Income	 tax	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 except	 to	 the	
extent	 that	 it	 relates	 to	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity	 or	 other	 comprehensive	 income.
Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 or	 recoverable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 or	 loss	 for	 the	 year	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	
enacted	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 and	 any	 adjustments	 in	 respect	 of	 prior	 years.	 Current	 tax	 payable	 is	 recognised	 when	 it	 is	 probable	 that	
the	 Group	 will	 be	 required	 to	 settle	 the	 obligation.	 The	 Group’s	 policy	 for	 accounting	 for	 current	 tax	 payable	 or	 receivable	 where	 it	 is	
uncertain	 is	 described	 in	 more	 detail	 in	 the	 Critical	 accounting	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions,	 section	 d	 –	 Taxation.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 provided	 using	 the	 balance	 sheet	 liability	 method	 providing	 for	 temporary	 differences	 arising	 between	 tax	 bases	 and	
carrying	 amounts	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 measured	 at	 the	 tax	 rates	 that	 are	 expected	 to	 be	 applied	 to	
temporary	 differences	 when	 they	 reverse,	 based	 on	 the	 laws	 that	 have	 been	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 not	 recognised	 for	 the	 following	 temporary	 differences:	 goodwill	 not	 deductible	 for	 tax	 purposes,	 the	 initial	 recognition	
of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 affect	 neither	 accounting	 nor	 taxable	 profits	 and	 differences	 relating	 to	 investments	 in	 subsidiaries	 to	 the	
extent	 that	 they	 will	 probably	 not	 reverse	 in	 the	 foreseeable	 future	 and	 where	 the	 Company	 controls	 the	 timing	 of	 the	 reversal.	 A	 deferred	
tax	 asset	 is	 recognised	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 taxable	 profit	 will	 be	 available	 against	 which	 the	 temporary	
difference	 can	 be	 utilised.	
i Property, plant and equipment
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 are	 stated	 at	 historical	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 any	 impairment	 losses.	 The	 carrying	 values	
of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 are	 periodically	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 when	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	 indicate	 that	 the	
carrying	 values	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.	 Where	 parts	 of	 an	 item	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 have	 different	 useful	 lives,	 they	 are	
accounted	 for	 as	 separate	 items.
j Depreciation
Depreciation	 is	 charged	 to	 profit	 or	 loss	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 to	 write	 off	 cost	 less	 estimated	 residual	 value	 over	 the	 assets’	 estimated	
remaining	 useful	 lives.	 The	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 are	 as	 follows:	
Buildings	 50	 years	 (or	 depreciated	 over	 life	 of	 lease	 if	 shorter	 than	 50	 years)
Plant	 and	 machinery	 3	 to	 12	 years
Fixtures,	 fittings	 and	 equipment	 3 	 to	 12	 years
Freehold	 land	 Not	 depreciated
Assets’	 residual	 values,	 useful	 lives	 and	 depreciation	 methods	 are	 reviewed,	 and	 adjusted	 if	 appropriate,	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.

k Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Acquisitions	 are	 accounted	 for	 using	 the	 acquisition	 method.	 As	 permitted	 by	 IFRS	 1	 ‘First-time	 Adoption	 of	 International	 Financial	
Reporting	 Standards’,	 the	 Group	 chose	 to	 apply	 IFRS	 3	 ‘Business	 Combinations’	 from	 1	 January	 2004	 and	 elected	 not	 to	 restate	 previous	
business	 combinations.	 For	 acquisitions	 made	 before	 1	 January	 2004,	 goodwill	 represents	 the	 amount	 previously	 recorded	 under	 UK	
Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice	 (‘UK	 GAAP’).	 For	 acquisitions	 that	 occurred	 between	 1	 January	 2004	 and	 31	 December	 2009,	
goodwill	 represents	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 business	 combination	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets,	 liabilities	 and	 contingent	
liabilities	 acquired.	 For	 acquisitions	 that	 have	 occurred	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2010,	 goodwill	 represents	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 business	
combination	 (excluding	 payments	 contingent	 on	 future	 employment	 and	 other	 acquisition	 related	 costs)	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	
identifiable	 assets,	 liabilities	 and	 contingent	 liabilities	 acquired.	 Goodwill	 is	 allocated	 to	 cash	 generating	 units	 and	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	
impairment.	 Negative	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 acquisition	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 acquired	 in	 a	 business	 combination	 are	 recognised	 on	 acquisition	 and	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value.	
Subsequent	 to	 initial	 recognition,	 customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation	 and	 any	
impairment	 losses.	 Amortisation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 lives	
of	 10	 to	 19	 years.
(iii) Software
Software	 is	 stated	 at	 historical	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation	 and	 any	 impairment	 losses.	 The	 carrying	 value	 of	 software	 is	
periodically	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 when	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	 indicate	 that	 the	 carrying	 values	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.	
Amortisation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 lives	 of	 three	 to	 seven	 years.
l Impairment
The	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 the	 Group’s	 assets	 are	 reviewed	 annually	 to	 determine	 if	 there	 is	 any	 indication	 of	 impairment.	 If	 any	 such	
indication	 exists,	 the	 assets’	 recoverable	 amounts	 are	 estimated.	 The	 recoverable	 amounts	 of	 assets	 carried	 at	 amortised	 cost	 are	
calculated	 as	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 appropriate	 pre-tax	 discount	 rates.	 The	 recoverable	 amounts	
of	 other	 assets	 are	 the	 greater	 of	 their	 fair	 value	 less	 the	 costs	 of	 disposal	 and	 the	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 the	 value	 in	 use,	 the	 estimated	
future	 cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 values	 using	 appropriate	 pre-tax	 discount	 rates.	 Impairment	 losses	 are	 recognised	 when	
the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 an	 asset	 or	 cash	 generating	 unit	 exceeds	 its	 recoverable	 amount,	 with	 impairment	 losses	 being	 recognised	 in	 the	
income	 statement.	
m Inventories
Inventories	 are	 valued	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value.	 The	 cost	 of	 inventories	 is	 based	 on	 the	 first-in	 first-out	 principle	 and	
comprises	 the	 purchase	 price,	 net	 of	 any	 related	 supplier	 volume	 rebates,	 plus	 import	 duties	 and	 other	 taxes,	 inbound	 freight	 and	 haulage	
costs	 and	 other	 related	 costs	 incurred	 to	 bring	 the	 product	 into	 its	 present	 location	 and	 condition.	 Net	 realisable	 value	 is	 the	 estimated	
selling	 price	 in	 the	 ordinary	 course	 of	 business,	 less	 the	 estimated	 cost	 of	 completion	 and	 estimated	 cost	 necessary	 to	 make	 the	 sale.	
Provision	 is	 made	 for	 obsolete,	 slow	 moving	 or	 defective	 items	 where	 appropriate.
n Trade and other receivables
Trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 are	 initially	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 plus	 any	 directly	 attributable	 transaction	 costs.	 Subsequent	 to	 initial	
recognition	 these	 assets	 are	 measured	 at	 amortised	 cost	 less	 any	 impairment	 losses.	 A	 provision	 for	 impairment	 is	 established	 when	
there	 is	 objective	 evidence	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 collect	 all	 amounts	 due	 according	 to	 the	 original	 terms	 of	 the	 receivables	
or	 uncertainty	 as	 to	 whether	 the	 Group	 will	 be	 able	 to	 collect	 all	 such	 amounts.	
o Trade and other payables
Trade	 and	 other	 payables	 are	 initially	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 including	 any	 directly	 attributable	 transaction	 costs.	 Subsequent	 to	 initial	
recognition	 these	 liabilities	 are	 measured	 at	 amortised	 cost.

p Financial instruments 
Under	 IAS	 39	 ‘Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement’,	 financial	 instruments	 are	 initially	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 with	
subsequent	 measurement	 depending	 upon	 the	 classification	 of	 the	 instrument.	 IFRS	 13	 ‘Fair	 Value	 Measurement’	 defines	 fair	 value	 as	
the	 price	 that	 would	 be	 received	 to	 sell	 an	 asset	 or	 paid	 to	 transfer	 a	 liability	 in	 an	 orderly	 transaction	 between	 market	 participants	 at	 the	
measurement	 date.	 Other	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 held	 at	 amortised	 cost	 unless	 they	 are	 in	 a	 fair	 value	 hedging	 relationship.	
Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 are	 used	 to	 hedge	 exposures	 to	 foreign	 exchange	 and	 interest	 rate	 risks.
(i) Fair value hedge
Where	 a	 derivative	 financial	 instrument	 is	 designated	 and	 qualifies	 as	 a	 hedge	 of	 a	 recognised	 asset	 or	 liability,	 all	 changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	
of	 the	 derivative	 are	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 The	 carrying	 value	 of	 the	 hedged	 item	 is	 adjusted	 by	 the	 change	 in	
fair	 value	 that	 is	 attributable	 to	 the	 risk	 being	 hedged	 with	 changes	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	
(ii) Cash flow hedge
Where	 a	 derivative	 is	 designated	 and	 qualifies	 as	 a	 hedge	 of	 a	 forecast	 transaction,	 any	 effective	 portion	 of	 the	 change	 in	 fair	 value	 is	
recognised	 in	 equity.	 The	 gain	 or	 loss	 relating	 to	 any	 ineffective	 portion	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 Amounts	
accumulated	 in	 equity	 are	 recycled	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 period	 when	 the	 hedged	 item	 affects	 profit	 or	 loss.
(iii) Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
Foreign	 currency	 differences	 arising	 on	 the	 retranslation	 of	 a	 financial	 liability	 designated	 as	 a	 hedge	 of	 a	 net	 investment	 in	 foreign	
operations	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity	 to	 the	 extent	 the	 hedge	 is	 effective.	 To	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 hedge	 is	 ineffective	 such	 differences	
are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
q Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents,	 as	 reported	 in	 the	 cash	 flow	 statement,	 comprises	 cash	 at	 bank	 and	 in	 hand	 and	 bank	 overdrafts.	 Cash	 at	 bank	
and	 in	 hand	 includes	 cash	 balances	 and	 short	 term	 deposits	 with	 maturities	 of	 three	 months	 or	 less	 from	 the	 date	 the	 deposit	 is	 made.	
r Net debt
Net	 debt	 is	 defined	 as	 interest	 bearing	 loans	 and	 borrowings	 adjusted	 for	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 on	 fixed	 interest	 rate	
borrowings	 and	 other	 derivatives	 managing	 the	 interest	 rate	 and	 currency	 profile	 less	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents.
s Provisions
A	 provision	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 a	 present	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 past	 event	 that	
can	 be	 reliably	 measured	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 an	 outflow	 of	 economic	 benefits	 will	 be	 required	 to	 settle	 the	 obligation.	 If	 the	 effect	 is	
material,	 provisions	 are	 determined	 by	 discounting	 the	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows	 at	 a	 pre-tax	 rate	 that	 reflects	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 liability.
A	 provision	 for	 onerous	 contracts	 is	 recognised	 when	 the	 expected	 benefits	 to	 be	 derived	 by	 the	 Group	 from	 a	 contract	 are	 lower	 than	 the	
unavoidable	 costs	 of	 meeting	 the	 Group’s	 obligations	 under	 the	 contract.
t Investment in own shares
The	 cost	 of	 shares	 held	 either	 directly	 (treasury	 shares)	 or	 indirectly	 (employee	 benefit	 trust	 shares)	 is	 deducted	 from	 equity.	 Repurchased	
shares	 are	 classified	 as	 treasury	 shares	 and	 are	 presented	 as	 a	 deduction	 from	 total	 equity.	 When	 treasury	 shares	 are	 subsequently	 sold	
or	 reissued,	 the	 amount	 received	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 increase	 in	 equity	 and	 the	 resulting	 surplus	 or	 deficit	 on	 the	 transaction	 is	 recognised	
in	 retained	 earnings.	
At	 each	 reporting	 date	 the	 Group	 remeasures	 the	 value	 of	 the	 shares	 held	 in	 the	 employee	 benefit	 trust	 to	 present	 them	 in	 the	 own	 shares	
reserve	 at	 the	 market	 value	 of	 those	 shares	 at	 the	 reporting	 date.	 This	 is	 done	 through	 a	 reclassification	 from	 retained	 earnings	 to	 the	 own	
shares	 reserve.	 This	 movement	 has	 no	 effect	 on	 the	 actual	 numbers	 of	 shares	 held	 by	 the	 employee	 benefit	 trust.

u Retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes
A	 defined	 contribution	 pension	 scheme	 is	 a	 post-employment	 benefit	 scheme	 under	 which	 the	 Company	 pays	 fixed	 contributions	 into	 a	
separate	 fund	 and	 will	 have	 no	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 to	 pay	 further	 contributions	 if	 the	 fund	 does	 not	 hold	 sufficient	 assets	 to	 pay	
all	 employee	 benefits	 relating	 to	 employee	 service	 in	 the	 current	 and	 prior	 periods.	 Obligations	 for	 contributions	 to	 defined	 contribution	
pension	 schemes	 are	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 periods	 during	 which	 services	 are	 rendered	 by	 employees.
(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes
A	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 is	 a	 post-employment	 benefit	 plan	 other	 than	 a	 defined	 contribution	 pension	 scheme.	 Defined	 benefit	
pension	 schemes	 are	 recognised	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 as	 a	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 asset	 or	 a	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 liability	 based	 on	 	
the	 difference	 between	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 pension	 scheme	 assets	 and	 the	 present	 value	 of	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities.
The	 present	 value	 of	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities	 are	 calculated	 by	 a	 qualified	 actuary	 using	 the	 projected	 unit	 method	 by	 estimating	 the	
amount	 of	 future	 benefit	 that	 employees	 have	 earned	 in	 return	 for	 their	 service	 in	 the	 current	 and	 prior	 periods,	 discounted	 using	 the	 rate	
applicable	 to	 AA	 rated	 corporate	 bonds	 that	 have	 a	 similar	 maturity	 and	 currency	 to	 the	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 any	
pension	 scheme	 assets	 (at	 bid	 price)	 are	 deducted	 from	 the	 present	 value	 of	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities	 to	 determine	 the	 net	 deficit	 or	
surplus	 of	 each	 scheme.	 Remeasurements	 arising	 from	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes	 comprise	 actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses	 of	 pension	
scheme	 liabilities	 and	 the	 actual	 return	 on	 pension	 scheme	 assets	 excluding	 amounts	 already	 included	 in	 net	 interest.	 The	 net	 actuarial	
gain	 or	 loss	 for	 the	 year	 is	 recorded	 in	 full	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 comprehensive	 income.
Current	 service	 cost,	 past	 service	 cost	 or	 gain	 and	 gains	 and	 losses	 on	 any	 settlements	 and	 curtailments	 are	 credited	 or	 charged	 to	 the	
income	 statement.	 Past	 service	 cost	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 to	 the	 extent	 benefits	 are	 already	 vested.	 Net	 interest	 on	 the	 net	 defined	
benefit	 pension	 liability	 or	 asset	 is	 calculated	 by	 applying	 the	 discount	 rate	 used	 to	 measure	 the	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 deficit	 or	
surplus	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year	 to	 the	 net	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 liability	 or	 asset	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year.	 Net	 interest	 is	 recorded	
within	 finance	 expense	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
When	 the	 valuation	 of	 a	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 results	 in	 a	 surplus,	 the	 recognised	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 asset	 is	 limited	 to	 the	
present	 value	 of	 benefits	 available	 in	 the	 form	 of	 any	 future	 refunds	 from	 the	 pension	 scheme	 or	 reductions	 in	 future	 contributions	 and	
takes	 into	 account	 the	 adverse	 effect	 of	 any	 minimum	 funding	 requirements.
v Dividends
The	 interim	 dividend	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 changes	 in	 equity	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 it	 is	 paid	 and	 the	 final	 dividend	 in	 the	 period	
in	 which	 it	 is	 approved	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.
w Non-GAAP measures
Further	 to	 the	 various	 performance	 measures	 defined	 under	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 reports	 a	 number	 of	 alternative	 performance	 measures	
that	 are	 designed	 to	 assist	 with	 the	 understanding	 of	 the	 underlying	 performance	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 its	 businesses.	 These	 measures	 are	
not	 defined	 under	 IFRS	 and,	 as	 a	 result,	 do	 not	 comply	 with	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice	 (known	 as	 ‘non-GAAP	 measures’)	
and	 may	 not	 be	 directly	 comparable	 with	 other	 companies’	 non-GAAP	 measures.	 They	 are	 not	 designed	 to	 be	 a	 substitute	 for	 any	 of	
the	 IFRS	 measures	 of	 performance.	 The	 principal	 alternative	 performance	 measures	 used	 within	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	
and	 the	 location	 of	 the	 reconciliations	 to	 equivalent	 IFRS	 measures	 are:	
•	 ad justed	 operating	 profit	 and	 adjusted	 profit	 before	 income	 tax	 (as	 reconciled	 on	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 on	 page	 92);
•	 adjusted 	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 (as	 reconciled	 on	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 on	 page	 92);	 and	
•	 ad justed	 earnings	 per	 share	 and	 adjusted	 diluted	 earnings	 per	 share	 (as	 reconciled	 in	 Note	 7).	
These	 measures	 exclude	 the	 charge	 for	 customer	 relationships	 amortisation,	 acquisition	 related	 costs	 and	 any	 associated	 tax,	 where	
relevant.	 Acquisition	 related	 costs	 comprise	 transaction	 costs	 and	 expenses,	 deferred	 consideration	 payments	 relating	 to	 the	 retention	
of	 former	 owners	 of	 businesses	 acquired	 and	 adjustments	 to	 previously	 estimated	 earn	 outs.	 Customer	 relationships	 amortisation,	
acquisition	 related	 costs	 and	 any	 associated	 tax	 are	 not	 items	 which	 are	 taken	 into	 account	 by	 management	 when	 assessing	 the	 results	
of	 the	 business	 as	 they	 do	 not	 relate	 to	 the	 underlying	 operating	 performance	 and	 distort	 comparability	 between	 businesses	 and	 between	
reporting	 periods.	 Accordingly,	 these	 items	 are	 removed	 in	 calculating	 the	 profitability	 measures	 by	 which	 management	 assess	 the	
performance	 of	 the	 Group.	
Other	 non-GAAP	 measures,	 including	 the	 Group’s	 key	 performance	 indicators	 which	 are	 set	 out	 and	 defined	 on	 pages	 16	 and	 17,	 are	 used	
to	 monitor	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 a	 number	 of	 these	 are	 based	 on,	 or	 derived	 from,	 the	 non-GAAP	 measures	 noted	 above.	
All	 non-GAAP	 measures	 have	 been	 calculated	 consistently	 with	 the	 methods	 applied	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	
ended	 31	 December	 2015.	 Growth	 rates	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates	 are	 calculated	 by	 retranslating	 the	 results	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31	 December	 2015	 at	 the	 average	 rates	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 so	 that	 they	 can	 be	 compared	 without	 the	 distorting	 impact	
of	 changes	 caused	 by	 foreign	 exchange	 translation.

Financial	 statements
Notes	 continued 2 Accounting policies continued
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In	 preparing	 these	 financial	 statements,	 management	 has	 made	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 choice	 and	
application	 of	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies	 and	 the	 reported	 amounts	 of	 assets,	 liabilities,	 income	 and	 expenses.	 Actual	 results	
may	 differ	 from	 those	 derived	 from	 the	 application	 of	 such	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions,	 in	 particular	 those	 which	 involve	
anticipating	 future	 events.	 Accordingly,	 the	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis,	 with	 the	 impact	
of	 any	 revisions	 considered	 necessary	 being	 recognised	 prospectively	 thereafter.
The	 key	 assumptions	 and	 sources	 of	 estimation	 uncertainty	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 that	 have	 most	 risk	 of	 causing	 material	 adjustment	 to	
the	 carrying	 values	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 are	 noted	 below	
and	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 referenced	 Notes.	 The	 directors	 believe	 that	 the	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 applied	 in	 the	
preparation	 of	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 are	 appropriate.	 Where	 relevant	 and	 practicable,	 sensitivity	 analyses	 are	 disclosed	
in	 the	 relevant	 Notes	 to	 demonstrate	 the	 impact	 of	 changes	 in	 estimates	 or	 assumptions	 used.
a Accounting for business combinations
Part	 of	 the	 Company’s	 strategy	 is	 to	 grow	 through	 acquisitions.	 Acquisitions	 are	 accounted	 for	 using	 the	 acquisition	 method	 as	 described	
in	 the	 business	 combinations	 accounting	 policy,	 Note	 2	 a(ii),	 and	 the	 goodwill	 accounting	 policy,	 Note	 2	 k(i).	 This	 includes	 the	 determination	
of	 fair	 values	 for	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 acquired,	 including	 the	 separate	 identification	 of	 intangible	 assets,	 which	 use	 assumptions	 and	
estimates	 and	 are	 therefore	 subjective.	 The	 Group	 has	 developed	 a	 process	 to	 meet	 the	 requirements	 of	 IFRS	 3,	 including	 the	 separate	
identification	 of	 customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 based	 on	 estimated	 future	 performance	 and	 customer	 attrition	 rates.	 External	
valuation	 specialists	 are	 used	 where	 appropriate.	 The	 process	 applied	 is	 described	 in	 Note	 24.
b Recoverability of goodwill and customer relationships intangible assets
As	 noted	 above,	 part	 of	 the	 Company’s	 strategy	 is	 to	 grow	 through	 acquisitions	 which	 has	 led	 to	 material	 goodwill	 and	 customer	
relationships	 intangible	 assets	 being	 recognised	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 Goodwill	 is	 tested	 annually	 to	 determine	 if	 there	 is	 any	 indication	
of	 impairment.	 The	 allocation	 of	 goodwill	 to	 cash	 generating	 units	 (‘CGUs’)	 is	 a	 judgement	 made	 by	 management.	 Assumptions	 are	 then	
used	 to	 determine	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 each	 CGU,	 principally	 based	 on	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows.	 Actual	
performance	 may	 differ	 from	 management’s	 expectations.	 The	 judgements	 made	 and	 assumptions	 used	 in	 performing	 impairment	
testing	 are	 described	 in	 Note	 9.	 The	 useful	 economic	 lives	 of	 customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 are	 also	 reviewed	 at	 least	 annually,	
with	 any	 revisions	 to	 the	 original	 estimated	 useful	 economic	 lives	 accounted	 for	 prospectively.
c Defined benefit pension schemes
The	 measurement	 of	 the	 present	 value	 of	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities	 involves	 the	 use	 of	 various	 actuarial	 assumptions,	
the	 selection	 of	 which	 is	 judgemental.	 The	 Group	 uses	 independent	 actuarial	 experts	 to	 assist	 with	 the	 estimation	 of	 the	 discount	 rates,	
inflation	 rates	 and	 longevity	 assumptions	 used	 for	 the	 measurement	 of	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 liabilities	 but	 the	 actual	 liabilities	
could	 be	 materially	 different.	 The	 main	 risks	 to	 which	 the	 Group	 is	 exposed	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 valuation	 of	 the	 defined	 benefit	 pension	
schemes	 are	 described	 in	 Note	 20.	 The	 judgement	 made	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 application	 of	 IFRS	 IC	 Interpretation	 14	 ('IFRIC	 14')	 ‘The	 Limit	 	
on	 a	 Defined	 Benefit	 Asset,	 Minimum	 Funding	 Requirements	 and	 their	 Interaction’,	 is	 also	 described	 in	 Note	 20.
d Taxation
The	 Group	 operates	 in	 many	 countries	 and	 is	 therefore	 subject	 to	 tax	 laws	 in	 a	 number	 of	 different	 tax	 jurisdictions.	 The	 amount	 of	 tax	
payable	 or	 receivable	 on	 profits	 or	 losses	 for	 any	 period	 is	 subject	 to	 the	 agreement	 of	 the	 tax	 authority	 in	 each	 respective	 jurisdiction	
and	 the	 tax	 liability	 or	 asset	 position	 is	 open	 to	 review	 for	 several	 years	 after	 the	 relevant	 accounting	 period	 ends.	 In	 determining	 the	
provisions	 for	 income	 taxes,	 management	 is	 required	 to	 make	 judgements	 and	 estimates	 based	 on	 interpretations	 of	 tax	 statute	 and	 	
case	 law,	 which	 it	 does	 after	 taking	 account	 of	 professional	 advice	 and	 prior	 experience.	
Uncertainties	 in	 respect	 of	 enquiries	 and	 additional	 tax	 assessments	 raised	 by	 tax	 authorities	 are	 measured	 using	 management’s	
single	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	 likely	 outcome,	 which	 includes	 interest	 and	 penalties	 where	 relevant.	 The	 amounts	 ultimately	 payable	 or	
receivable	 may	 differ	 from	 the	 amounts	 of	 any	 provisions	 recognised	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 estimates	
and	 assumptions	 used.	 While	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 tax	 payable	 balance	 relates	 to	 uncertain	 tax	 provisions,	 management	 does	 not	 consider	
there	 to	 exist	 a	 significant	 risk	 of	 material	 adjustment	 within	 the	 next	 financial	 year	 because	 the	 tax	 provisions	 cover	 a	 range	 of	 matters	
across	 multiple	 tax	 jurisdictions	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 timescales	 before	 such	 matters	 are	 expected	 to	 be	 concluded.

*		 The	 segment	 analysis	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2015	 previously	 included,	 within	 Continental	 Europe,	 the	 results	 of	 a	 business	
based	 in	 Europe	 that	 also	 had	 operations	 in	 the	 US.	 That	 part	 of	 the	 business	 is	 now	 managed	 and	 reported	 as	 part	 of	 the	 North	 America	
operating	 segment.	 Accordingly,	 the	 Group	 has	 restated	 the	 operating	 segment	 information	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2015	 to	
include	 the	 business	 within	 the	 North	 America	 segment.	 For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2015	 additional	 revenue	 of	 £32.4m	 and	 adjusted	
operating	 profit	 of	 £5.0m	 are	 now	 being	 reported	 in	 North	 America	 with	 a	 corresponding	 reduction	 in	 revenue	 and	 adjusted	 operating	
profit	 in	 Continental	 Europe.	 Customer	 relationships	 amortisation,	 purchase	 of	 property	 plant	 and	 equipment	 and	 software	 and	
depreciation	 and	 software	 amortisation	 have	 also	 been	 restated.
Acquisition	 related	 costs	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 comprise	 transaction	 costs	 and	 expenses	 of	 £6.8m	 (2015:	 £7.9m),	 deferred	
consideration	 payments	 of	 £29.6m	 (2015:	 £24.3m)	 relating	 to	 the	 retention	 of	 former	 owners	 of	 businesses	 acquired	 and	 a	 credit	 of	 £2.4m	
(2015:	 £10.5m	 credit)	 from	 adjustments	 to	 previously	 estimated	 earn	 outs.
The	 Group	 results	 are	 reported	 as	 four	 business	 areas	 based	 on	 geographic	 regions,	 which	 are	 reviewed	 regularly	 by	 the	 Company’s	 	
chief	 operating	 decision	 maker,	 the	 Board	 of	 Directors.	 The	 principal	 results	 reviewed	 for	 each	 business	 area	 are	 revenue	 and	 adjusted	
operating	 profit.	
Reportable	 segments	 are	 determined	 based	 on	 quantitative	 thresholds	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 8	 ‘Operating	 Segments’.	 The	 three	 business	
areas	 of	 North	 America,	 Continental	 Europe	 and	 UK	 &	 Ireland	 are	 operating	 segments	 that	 meet	 the	 quantitative	 thresholds	 for	 reportable	
segments	 and	 are	 therefore	 disclosed	 separately	 above.	 The	 Rest	 of	 the	 World	 business	 area	 contains	 Latin	 America	 and	 Australasia	
which	 individually	 do	 not	 meet	 the	 quantitative	 thresholds	 for	 separate	 disclosure	 as	 reportable	 segments.	 Rest	 of	 the	 World	 is	 therefore	
an	 ‘other’	 segment	 that	 is	 disclosed	 above	 as	 a	 reportable	 segment	 as	 this	 information	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 useful	 to	 users	 of	 the	 financial	
statements	 and	 it	 also	 helps	 to	 reconcile	 the	 results	 of	 the	 reportable	 segments	 to	 the	 Group’s	 consolidated	 and	 business	 area	 results.

Information	 related	 to	 each	 reportable	 segment	 is	 set	 out	 above.	 The	 revenue	 presented	 relates	 to	 external	 customers.	 Sales	 between	
the	 business	 areas	 are	 not	 material.	 Each	 of	 the	 business	 areas	 supplies	 a	 range	 of	 products	 to	 customers	 operating	 primarily	 in	 the	
foodservice,	 grocery,	 cleaning	 &	 hygiene,	 safety,	 retail	 and	 healthcare	 market	 sectors	 but	 results	 are	 not	 monitored	 on	 this	 basis.	
The	 performance	 of	 the	 four	 business	 areas	 is	 assessed	 by	 reference	 to	 adjusted	 operating	 profit	 and	 this	 measure	 also	 represents	 the	
segment	 results	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 reporting	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 8.	 Debt	 and	 associated	 interest	 is	 managed	 at	 a	 Group	 level	 and	
therefore	 has	 not	 been	 allocated	 across	 the	 business	 areas.	
There	 are	 no	 customers	 who	 account	 for	 more	 than	 10%	 of	 Group	 revenue.	 Customer	 dependencies	 are	 regularly	 monitored.	
Revenue	 generated	 in	 the	 parent	 company’s	 country	 of	 domicile,	 the	 UK,	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 was	 £1,003.7m	
(2015:	 £1,031.4m).
As	 noted	 above,	 the	 businesses	 within	 each	 operating	 segment	 operate	 in	 a	 number	 of	 different	 countries	 and	 sell	 products	 across	 a

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The	 Group	 operates	 in	 many	 countries	 and	 is	 subject	 to	 different	 rates	 of	 income	 tax	 in	 those	 countries.	 The	 expected	 tax	 rate	 is	 calculated	
as	 a	 weighted	 average	 of	 the	 tax	 rates	 in	 the	 tax	 jurisdictions	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 operates,	 most	 of	 which	 are	 higher	 than	 the	 UK	 statutory	
rate	 of	 20.0%	 (2015:	 20.25%).	 The	 adjustments	 to	 the	 tax	 charge	 at	 the	 weighted	 average	 rate	 to	 determine	 the	 income	 tax	 on	 profit	 are

Impairment tests
The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 is	 allocated	 across	 cash	 generating	 units	 (‘CGUs’)	 and	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	 impairment.
A	 description	 of	 the	 Group’s	 principal	 activities	 is	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Chief	 Executive’s	 review.	 There	 is	 no	 significant	 difference	 in	 the	 nature	
of	 activities	 across	 different	 geographies.	 The	 identification	 of	 CGUs	 reflects	 the	 way	 in	 which	 the	 business	 is	 managed	 on	 a	 geographical	
basis.	 Given	 the	 similar	 nature	 of	 the	 activities	 of	 each	 CGU,	 a	 consistent	 methodology	 is	 applied	 across	 the	 Group	 in	 assessing	 CGU	
recoverable	 amounts.	 The	 recoverable	 amount	 is	 the	 higher	 of	 the	 value	 in	 use	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 less	 the	 costs	 of	 disposal.	 The	 value	 in	
use	 is	 the	 present	 value	 of	 the	 cash	 flows	 expected	 to	 be	 generated	 by	 the	 CGU	 over	 a	 projection	 period	 together	 with	 a	 terminal	 value.	
The	 projection	 period	 is	 the	 time	 period	 over	 which	 future	 cash	 flows	 are	 predicted.	 The	 Group’s	 methodology	 is	 to	 use	 a	 projection	 period	
of	 five	 years	 consisting	 of	 detailed	 cash	 flow	 forecasts	 for	 the	 first	 two	 years	 and	 CGU	 specific	 growth	 assumptions	 for	 years	 three,	 four	
and	 five.	 For	 periods	 after	 this	 five	 year	 period,	 the	 methodology	 applies	 a	 long	 term	 growth	 rate	 specific	 to	 the	 CGU	 to	 derive	 a	 terminal	
value.	 Cash	 flow	 expectations	 exclude	 any	 future	 cash	 flows	 that	 may	 arise	 from	 restructuring	 or	 other	 enhancements	 to	 the	 cash	 generating	
activities	 of	 the	 CGU	 and	 reflect	 management’s	 expectations	 of	 the	 range	 of	 economic	 conditions	 that	 may	 exist	 over	 the	 projection	 period.	
The	 value	 in	 use	 calculations	 are	 principally	 sensitive	 to	 revenue	 growth,	 including	 any	 significant	 changes	 to	 the	 customer	 base,	
achievability	 of	 future	 profit	 margins	 and	 the	 discount	 rates	 used	 in	 the	 present	 value	 calculation.	 The	 information	 used	 for	 valuation	
purposes	 takes	 into	 consideration	 past	 experience	 and	 the	 current	 economic	 environment	 with	 regard	 to	 customer	 attrition	 rates	 and	
additions	 to	 the	 customer	 base,	 the	 ability	 to	 introduce	 price	 increases	 and	 new	 products	 and	 experience	 in	 controlling	 the	 underlying	
cost	 base.	 This	 provides	 a	 long	 term	 growth	 rate	 which	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 geographic	 segments	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 operates	 and	
management’s	 assessment	 of	 future	 operating	 performance	 and	 market	 share	 movements.	 The	 discount	 rates	 used	 are	 determined	
with	 assistance	 provided	 by	 external	 valuation	 specialists.
The	 Group	 has	 acquired	 approximately	 100	 businesses	 and	 entered	 into	 six	 new	 countries	 since	 the	 beginning	 of	 2010	 which	 is	 when	 the	
composition	 of	 the	 Group’s	 CGUs	 was	 last	 updated.	 To	 reflect	 more	 appropriately	 the	 way	 that	 the	 Group	 is	 now	 structured,	 including	
recent	 changes	 to	 management	 oversight	 and	 responsibility,	 the	 allocation	 of	 goodwill	 to	 CGUs	 for	 impairment	 testing	 purposes	 was	
updated	 for	 the	 2016	 impairment	 testing	 exercise.	 Impairment	 testing	 was	 also	 performed	 in	 2016	 based	 on	 the	 existing	 CGUs	 to	 ensure	
that	 no	 potential	 impairments	 were	 avoided	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 change	 to	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 CGUs.	 Based	 on	 impairment	 testing	 using	
both	 the	 existing	 and	 updated	 CGUs,	 no	 impairments	 were	 identified	 to	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 within	 the	 Group.	
At	 31	 December	 2016	 North	 America,	 Rest	 of	 Continental	 Europe	 and	 France	 carried	 a	 significant	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 in	 comparison	 with	
the	 total	 value	 of	 the	 Group’s	 goodwill.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 in	 respect	 of	 North	 America	 was	 £365.7m	
(2015:	 £300.7m),	 Rest	 of	 Continental	 Europe	 was	 £156.9m	 (2015:	 £117.5m)	 and	 France	 was	 £133.9m	 (2015:	 £118.6m).	 At	 31	 December	 2016	
the	 aggregate	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 attributable	 to	 the	 Group’s	 CGUs,	 excluding	 North	 America,	 Rest	 of	 Continental	 Europe	 and	 France,	 was	 	
£535.0m	 (2015:	 £462.5m),	 none	 of	 which	 is	 individually	 significant.	 The	 comparatives	 in	 this	 paragraph	 have	 been	 restated	 to	 reflect	 the	
updated	 CGUs.
For	 North	 America,	 Rest	 of	 Continental	 Europe	 and	 France,	 the	 weighted	 average	 long	 term	 growth	 rate	 used	 in	 2016	 was	 2.5%–3.5%	
(2015:	 2.5%–3.5%)	 reflecting	 anticipated	 revenue	 and	 profit	 growth.	 A	 pre-tax	 discount	 rate	 in	 the	 range	 of	 7%	 –	 8%	 (2015:	 8%)	 has	 been	
applied	 to	 the	 value	 in	 use	 calculations	 reflecting	 market	 assessments	 of	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Similar	
assumptions	 have	 been	 applied	 to	 the	 other	 CGUs	 but	 where	 appropriate	 the	 directors	 have	 considered	 alternative	 market	 risk	
assumptions	 to	 reflect	 the	 specific	 conditions	 arising	 in	 individual	 CGUs	 with	 long	 term	 growth	 rates	 ranging	 from	 2.5%–7.0%	 	
(2015:	 2.5%–6.9%)	 and	 discount	 rates	 ranging	 from	 7%–15%	 (2015:	 8%–19%).
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment	 testing	 is	 dependent	 on	 management’s	 estimates	 and	 judgements,	 particularly	 as	 they	 relate	 to	 the	 forecasting	 of	 future	
cash	 flows,	 the	 discount	 rates	 selected	 and	 expected	 long	 term	 growth	 rates.	 A	 key	 assumption	 on	 which	 value	 in	 use	 calculations	 are	
dependent	 relates	 to	 revenue	 growth	 including	 the	 impact	 of	 changes	 to	 the	 underlying	 customer	 base.	 This	 assumption	 is	 sensitive	
to	 customer	 attrition	 and	 the	 rate	 at	 which	 new	 customer	 relationships	 are	 introduced	 and	 established.	
Based	 on	 past	 experience	 and	 taking	 into	 account	 current	 market	 conditions,	 management	 has	 concluded	 that	 it	 is	 reasonable	 to	 assume	
that	 there	 will	 be	 no	 material	 deterioration	 in	 the	 customer	 base	 over	 the	 projection	 period	 which	 will	 significantly	 impact	 future	 cash	 flows	
and	 that	 no	 reasonably	 possible	 change	 in	 key	 assumptions	 would	 result	 in	 impairment	 in	 any	 of	 the	 Group’s	 CGUs.	 Should	 such	 a	 change	
occur,	 this	 would	 represent	 a	 triggering	 event	 to	 indicate	 that	 an	 impairment	 review	 may	 be	 necessary.	 In	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36	
‘Impairment	 of	 Assets’,	 a	 full	 impairment	 review	 would	 then	 be	 undertaken	 on	 the	 relevant	 assets	 within	 the	 CGU.	 Any	 such	 changes	
are	 monitored	 through	 normal	 monthly	 procedures.

Capital management
The	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 maintain	 a	 strong	 capital	 base	 so	 as	 to	 maintain	 investor,	 creditor	 and	 market	 confidence	 and	 to	 sustain	 future	
development	 of	 the	 business.	 The	 Group	 monitors	 the	 return	 on	 average	 operating	 capital	 employed	 and	 the	 return	 on	 invested	 capital	
(as	 defined	 on	 page	 16	 and	 17	 respectively)	 as	 well	 as	 the	 level	 of	 total	 shareholders’	 equity	 and	 the	 amount	 of	 dividends	 paid	 to	 ordinary	
shareholders.	 For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016,	 the	 return	 on	 average	 operating	 capital	 employed	 was	 55.9%	 (2015:	 55.5%),	 the	 return	
on	 invested	 capital	 was	 16.7%	 (2015:	 17.1%),	 the	 level	 of	 total	 shareholders’	 equity	 at	 31	 December	 2016	 was	 £1,312.5m	 (2015:	 £1,016.3m)	
and	 the	 amount	 of	 dividends	 paid	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 was	 £125.4m	 (2015:	 £116.1m).
The	 Group	 funds	 its	 operations	 through	 a	 mixture	 of	 shareholders’	 equity	 and	 bank	 and	 capital	 market	 borrowings.	 All	 of	 the	 borrowings	
are	 managed	 by	 a	 central	 treasury	 function	 and	 funds	 raised	 are	 lent	 onward	 to	 operating	 subsidiaries	 as	 required.	 The	 overall	 objective	
is	 to	 manage	 the	 funding	 to	 ensure	 the	 Group	 has	 a	 portfolio	 of	 competitively	 priced	 borrowing	 facilities	 to	 meet	 the	 demands	 of	 the	 business	
over	 time	 and,	 in	 order	 to	 do	 so,	 the	 Group	 arranges	 a	 mixture	 of	 borrowings	 from	 different	 sources	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 maturity	 dates.
The	 Group’s	 businesses	 provide	 a	 high	 and	 consistent	 level	 of	 cash	 generation	 which	 helps	 fund	 future	 development	 and	 growth.	 The	 Group	
seeks	 to	 maintain	 an	 appropriate	 balance	 between	 the	 higher	 returns	 that	 might	 be	 possible	 with	 higher	 levels	 of	 borrowings	 and	 the	
advantages	 and	 security	 afforded	 by	 a	 sound	 capital	 position.
There	 were	 no	 changes	 to	 the	 Group’s	 approach	 to	 capital	 management	 during	 the	 year	 and	 the	 Group	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 any	 externally	
imposed	 capital	 requirements.
Treasury policies and controls
The	 Group	 has	 a	 centralised	 treasury	 department	 to	 control	 external	 borrowings	 and	 manage	 liquidity,	 interest	 rate	 and	 foreign	 currency	
risks.	 Treasury	 policies	 have	 been	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 and	 cover	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 exposure	 to	 be	 hedged,	 the	 types	 of	 financial	
instruments	 that	 may	 be	 employed	 and	 the	 criteria	 for	 investing	 and	 borrowing	 cash.	 The	 Group	 uses	 derivatives	 to	 manage	 its	 foreign	
currency	 and	 interest	 rate	 risks	 arising	 from	 underlying	 business	 activities.	 No	 transactions	 of	 a	 speculative	 nature	 are	 undertaken.	
The	 treasury	 department	 is	 subject	 to	 periodic	 independent	 review	 by	 the	 internal	 audit	 department.	 Underlying	 policy	 assumptions	 and	
activities	 are	 periodically	 reviewed	 by	 the	 executive	 directors	 and	 the	 Board.	 Controls	 over	 exposure	 changes	 and	 transaction	 authenticity	
are	 in	 place.
Hedge accounting
The	 Group	 designates	 derivatives	 which	 qualify	 as	 hedges	 for	 accounting	 purposes	 as	 either	 (a)	 a	 hedge	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 a	 recognised	
asset	 or	 liability;	 (b)	 a	 hedge	 of	 the	 cash	 flow	 risk	 resulting	 from	 changes	 in	 interest	 rates	 or	 foreign	 exchange	 rates;	 or	 (c)	 a	 hedge	 of	 a	 net	
investment	 in	 a	 foreign	 operation.	 The	 accounting	 treatment	 for	 hedges	 is	 set	 out	 in	 the	 financial	 instruments’	 accounting	 policy	 in	 Note	 2p.	
The	 Group	 tests	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 hedges	 on	 a	 prospective	 and	 retrospective	 basis	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 with	 IAS	 39.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 meet	 its	 financial	 obligations	 as	 they	 fall	 due.	 The	 Group	 continually	 monitors	 net	
debt	 and	 forecast	 cash	 flows	 to	 ensure	 that	 sufficient	 facilities	 are	 in	 place	 to	 meet	 the	 Group’s	 requirements	 in	 the	 short,	 medium	 and	
long	 term	 and,	 in	 order	 to	 do	 so,	 arranges	 borrowings	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 sources.	 Additionally,	 compliance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 biannual	 debt	
covenants	 is	 monitored	 on	 a	 monthly	 basis	 and	 formally	 tested	 at	 30	 June	 and	 31	 December.	 The	 principal	 covenant	 limits	 are	 net	 debt,	
calculated	 at	 average	 exchange	 rates,	 to	 operating	 profit	 before	 depreciation,	 amortisation	 and	 acquisition	 related	 costs	 (‘EBITDA’)	 of	 no	
more	 than	 3.5	 times	 and	 interest	 cover	 of	 no	 less	 than	 3.0	 times.	 Sensitivity	 analyses	 using	 various	 scenarios	 are	 applied	 to	 forecasts	 to	
assess	 their	 impact	 on	 covenants	 and	 net	 debt.	 During	 2016	 all	 covenants	 have	 been	 complied	 with	 and	 based	 on	 current	 forecasts	 it	 is	
expected	 that	 such	 covenants	 will	 continue	 to	 be	 complied	 with	 for	 the	 foreseeable	 future.	
The	 Group	 has	 substantial	 borrowing	 facilities	 available	 comprising	 multi-currency	 credit	 facilities	 from	 the	 Group’s	 banks	 and	 US	 private	
placement	 notes	 denominated	 in	 US	 dollars,	 sterling	 and	 euros.	 An	 issue	 of	 fixed	 interest	 US	 private	 placements	 of	€133m	 and	 £97m,	
agreed	 in	 2015,	 was	 drawn	 down	 in	 March	 2016.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 nominal	 total	 of	 US	 private	 placement	 notes	 outstanding	 was	
£1,251.1m	 (2015:	 £1,001.9m)	 with	 maturities	 ranging	 from	 2017	 to	 2028.	 During	 the	 year	 the	 Group	 also	 refinanced	 or	 agreed	 new	 banking	
facilities	 totalling	 £107.7m.	 The	 Group’s	 committed	 bank	 facilities	 mature	 between	 2017	 and	 2022.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 available	
committed	 bank	 facilities	 totalled	 £954.2m	 (2015:	 £969.0m)	 of	 which	 £101.3m	 (2015:	 £154.9m)	 was	 drawn	 down.

In	 addition	 the	 Group	 maintains	 overdraft	 and	 uncommitted	 facilities	 to	 provide	 short	 term	 flexibility.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 there	 were	 no	
loans	 secured	 by	 fixed	 charges	 on	 property	 (2015:	 none).
Interest rate risk
The	 Group	 is	 funded	 by	 a	 mixture	 of	 fixed	 and	 floating	 rate	 debt.	 In	 addition,	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 and	 interest	 rate	 caps	 are	 used	 to	 manage	
the	 interest	 rate	 risk	 profile.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 fixed	 rate	 debt	 of	 £867.5m	 (2015:	 £679.4m),	 being	 fixed	 rate	 US	 private	 placement	 notes	
denominated	 in	 US	 dollars,	 sterling	 and	 euros,	 was	 stated	 at	 amortised	 cost	 with	 maturities	 ranging	 from	 2017	 to	 2025.
At	 31	 December	 2016	 floating	 rate	 debt	 was	 comprised	 of	 £101.3m	 (2015:	 £160.0m)	 floating	 rate	 bank	 loans	 and	 £396.8m	 (2015:	 £339.5m)	 of	
fixed	 rate	 US	 private	 placement	 notes	 with	 maturities	 ranging	 from	 2025	 to	 2028	 which	 have	 been	 swapped	 to	 floating	 rates	 using	 interest	
rate	 swaps.	 Bank	 loans	 are	 drawn	 for	 various	 periods	 of	 up	 to	 three	 months	 at	 interest	 rates	 linked	 to	 LIBOR.	 The	 interest	 rate	 swaps	
reprice	 every	 three	 or	 six	 months.
The	 interest	 rate	 risk	 on	 the	 floating	 rate	 debt	 is	 managed	 using	 interest	 rate	 options.	 Borrowings	 with	 a	 notional	 principal	 of	 £101.3m	 were	
capped	 at	 31	 December	 2016	 (capped	 at	 31	 December	 2015:	 £154.9m).	 Hedge	 accounting	 is	 not	 applied	 to	 the	 interest	 rate	 caps	 since	 the	
majority	 of	 their	 value	 is	 related	 to	 time	 value.	 The	 strike	 rates	 of	 these	 options	 are	 based	 on	 LIBOR	 repricing	 every	 three	 months.
After	 taking	 account	 of	 hedge	 relationships,	 a	 change	 of	 1%	 in	 the	 interest	 rate	 forward	 curves	 on	 31	 December	 would	 have	 affected	 profit	
before	 tax	 and	 equity	 for	 the	 year	 by	 the	 amounts	 shown	 below	 as	 a	 result	 of	 changes	 in	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 derivative	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 at

Contractual maturity profile
The	 contractual	 maturity	 profile	 of	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 at	 31	 December	 is	 set	 out	 in	 the	 tables	 below.	 The	 amounts	
disclosed	 are	 the	 contractual	 undiscounted	 cash	 flows	 and	 therefore	 include	 interest	 cash	 flows	 (forecast	 using	 LIBOR	 interest	 rates	 at	
31	 December	 in	 the	 case	 of	 floating	 rate	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities).	 Derivative	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 have	 been	 included	 within	 the	
tables	 since	 they	 predominantly	 relate	 to	 derivatives	 which	 are	 used	 to	 manage	 the	 interest	 cash	 flows	 on	 the	 Group’s	 debt.	 Bank	 loans	
have	 been	 drawn	 under	 committed	 facilities	 and	 can	 be	 refinanced	 on	 maturity	 from	 these	 same	 facilities.	 Accordingly	 they	 have	 been	 aged	
based	 on	 the	 maturity	 dates	 of	 the	 underlying	 facilities.

have	 carrying	 amounts	 where	 the	 fair	 value	 is,	 and	 has	 been	 throughout	 the	 year,	 a	 level	 two	 fair	 value	 measurement.	 Level	 two	 fair	 value	
measurements	 use	 inputs	 other	 than	 quoted	 prices	 that	 are	 observable	 for	 the	 relevant	 asset	 or	 liability,	 either	 directly	 or	 indirectly.	 The	
fair	 values	 of	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 stated	 at	 fair	 value	 have	 been	 determined	 by	 discounting	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows,	 translated	
at	 the	 appropriate	 balance	 sheet	 date	 exchange	 rates	 and	 adjusted	 for	 counterparty	 or	 own	 credit	 risk	 as	 applicable.
For	 financial	 assets	 and	 financial	 liabilities	 not	 measured	 at	 fair	 value,	 including	 trade	 receivables,	 other	 receivables,	 trade	 and	 other	
payables	 and	 non-current	 payables,	 their	 carrying	 amount	 is	 a	 reasonable	 approximation	 of	 fair	 value	 due	 to	 their	 short	 term	 nature.	
However,	 within	 other	 payables	 there	 is	 £7.1m	 (2015:	 £3.8m)	 related	 to	 earn	 outs	 on	 businesses	 acquired	 which	 are	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value.	
This	 is	 a	 level	 three	 fair	 value	 which	 is	 initially	 measured	 based	 on	 the	 expected	 future	 profitability	 of	 the	 businesses	 acquired	 at	 the	
acquisition	 date	 and	 subsequently	 reassessed	 at	 each	 reporting	 date	 based	 on	 the	 most	 recent	 data	 available	 on	 the	 expected	 profitability	
of	 the	 businesses	 acquired.

Foreign currency risk
The	 majority	 of	 the	 Group’s	 sales	 are	 made	 and	 income	 is	 earned	 in	 US	 dollars,	 euros	 and	 other	 foreign	 currencies.	 The	 Group	 does	 not	
hedge	 the	 impact	 of	 exchange	 rate	 movements	 arising	 on	 translation	 of	 earnings	 into	 sterling	 at	 average	 exchange	 rates.
The	 following	 significant	 exchange	 rates	 applied	 during	 the	 year:
Average rate Closing rate
 2016 2015 2016 2015
US	 dollar 1.36 1.53 1.24 1.47
Euro 1.22 1.38 1.17 1.36
For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016,	 a	 movement	 of	 one	 cent	 in	 the	 US	 dollar	 and	 euro	 average	 exchange	 rates	 would	 have	 changed	
profit	 before	 income	 tax	 by	 £1.4m	 and	 £0.4m	 respectively	 (2015:	 £1.1m	 and	 £0.3m)	 and	 adjusted	 profit	 before	 income	 tax	 by	 £1.5m	 and	
£0.7m	 respectively	 (2015:	 £1.2m	 and	 £0.5m).
The	 majority	 of	 the	 Group’s	 transactions	 are	 carried	 out	 in	 the	 respective	 functional	 currencies	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations	 and	 so	
transaction	 exposures	 are	 usually	 relatively	 limited.	 Where	 they	 do	 occur	 the	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 hedge	 significant	 exposures	 of	 firm	
commitments	 for	 a	 period	 of	 up	 to	 one	 year	 as	 soon	 as	 they	 are	 committed	 using	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 and	 these	 are	
designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges.	 However,	 the	 economic	 impact	 of	 foreign	 exchange	 on	 the	 value	 of	 uncommitted	 future	 purchases	 and	
sales	 is	 not	 hedged.	 As	 a	 result,	 sudden	 and	 significant	 movements	 in	 foreign	 exchange	 rates	 can	 impact	 profit	 margins	 where	 there	 is	
a	 delay	 in	 passing	 on	 to	 customers	 the	 resulting	 price	 increases.	 For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016,	 all	 foreign	 exchange	 cash	 flow	
hedges	 were	 effective	 with	 a	 gain	 of	 £3.0m	 recognised	 in	 equity	 (2015:	 gain	 of	 £2.0m)	 which	 will	 affect	 the	 income	 statement	 during	 2017.
The	 majority	 of	 the	 Group’s	 borrowings	 are	 effectively	 denominated	 in	 US	 dollars,	 sterling	 and	 euros,	 aligning	 them	 to	 the	 respective	
functional	 currencies	 of	 the	 component	 parts	 of	 the	 Group’s	 EBITDA.	 This	 currency	 profile	 is	 achieved	 using	 short	 term	 foreign	 exchange	
contracts	 and	 foreign	 currency	 debt.	 This	 currency	 composition	 minimises	 the	 impact	 of	 movements	 in	 foreign	 exchange	 rates	 on	 the	 ratio	
of	 net	 debt	 to	 EBITDA.
The	 currency	 profile	 of	 the	 Group’s	 net	 debt	 at	 31	 December	 is	 set	 out	 in	 the	 table	 below:

If	 a	 10%	 strengthening	 or	 weakening	 of	 sterling	 had	 taken	 place	 on	 31	 December	 it	 would	 have	 increased/(decreased)	 profit	 before	 tax	
and	 equity	 for	 the	 year	 by	 the	 amounts	 shown	 below.	 The	 impact	 of	 this	 translation	 is	 much	 greater	 on	 equity	 than	 it	 is	 on	 profit	 before	 tax	
since	 equity	 is	 translated	 using	 the	 closing	 exchange	 rates	 at	 the	 year	 end	 and	 profit	 before	 tax	 is	 translated	 using	 the	 average	 exchange	
rates	 for	 the	 year.	 As	 a	 result	 the	 value	 of	 equity	 is	 more	 sensitive	 than	 the	 value	 of	 profit	 before	 tax	 to	 a	 movement	 in	 exchange	 rates	
on	 31	 December	 and	 the	 resulting	 movement	 in	 profit	 before	 tax	 is	 due	 solely	 to	 the	 translation	 effect	 on	 monetary	 items.	 This	 analysis	
assumes	 that	 all	 other	 variables,	 and	 in	 particular	 interest	 rates,	 remain	 constant.

Credit risk
Credit	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 of	 loss	 in	 relation	 to	 a	 financial	 asset	 due	 to	 non-payment	 by	 the	 relevant	 counterparty.	 The	 Group’s	 objective	 is	 to	
reduce	 its	 exposure	 to	 counterparty	 default	 by	 restricting	 the	 type	 of	 counterparty	 it	 deals	 with	 and	 by	 employing	 an	 appropriate	 policy	
in	 relation	 to	 the	 collection	 of	 financial	 assets.
The	 Group’s	 principal	 financial	 assets	 are	 cash	 at	 bank	 and	 in	 hand,	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 and	 trade	 receivables	 which	
represent	 the	 Group’s	 maximum	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	 in	 relation	 to	 financial	 assets.	 The	 maximum	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	 for	 cash	
at	 bank	 and	 in	 hand	 (see	 Note	 23),	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 (see	 page	 115)	 and	 trade	 receivables	 and	 other	 receivables	 (see	 Note	 11)	 	
is	 their	 respective	 carrying	 amounts.	
Dealings	 are	 restricted	 to	 those	 banks	 with	 the	 relevant	 combination	 of	 geographic	 presence	 and	 suitable	 credit	 rating.	 The	 Group	
continually	 monitors	 the	 credit	 ratings	 of	 its	 counterparties	 and	 the	 credit	 exposure	 to	 each	 counterparty.
For	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables,	 the	 amounts	 represented	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 are	 net	 of	 allowances	 for	 doubtful	 receivables,	 estimated	
by	 the	 Group’s	 management	 based	 on	 prior	 experience	 and	 their	 assessment	 of	 the	 current	 economic	 environment.	 Note	 11	 sets	 out	 an	
analysis	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 and	 the	 provision	 for	 doubtful	 debts	 in	 respect	 of	 trade	 receivables.
At	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 there	 were	 no	 significant	 concentrations	 of	 credit	 risk.

The	 properties	 provision	 includes	 provisions	 for	 vacant	 properties	 where	 amounts	 are	 held	 against	 liabilities	 for	 onerous	 lease	
commitments,	 repairs	 and	 dilapidations.	 These	 provisions	 cover	 the	 relevant	 periods	 of	 the	 lease	 agreements,	 which	 typically	 extend	 from	
one	 to	 10	 years,	 up	 to	 the	 earliest	 possible	 termination	 date.	
The	 Group	 has	 provisions	 for	 expected	 legal,	 environmental	 and	 other	 claims	 based	 on	 management’s	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	 liability	 at	 the	
balance	 sheet	 date.	 It	 expects	 that	 these	 amounts,	 which	 are	 based	 on	 detailed	 plans	 or	 other	 known	 factors	 and	 take	 account	 of	 past	
experience	 for	 similar	 items,	 will	 be	 settled	 within	 the	 next	 one	 to	 five	 years.
The	 Group	 is	 a	 defendant	 in	 a	 number	 of	 legal	 proceedings	 incidental	 to	 its	 operations.	 While	 any	 litigation	 has	 an	 element	 of	 uncertainty,	
management	 does	 not	 expect	 that	 the	 actual	 outcome	 of	 any	 such	 proceedings,	 either	 individually	 or	 in	 the	 aggregate,	 will	 be	 materially	
different	 to	 the	 amounts	 provided.

Except	 as	 noted	 below,	 deferred	 tax	 is	 calculated	 in	 full	 on	 temporary	 differences	 under	 the	 liability	 method	 using	 the	 tax	 rate	 of	 the	
country	 of	 operation.
The	 Company	 is	 able	 to	 control	 the	 dividend	 policy	 of	 its	 subsidiaries	 and,	 therefore,	 the	 timing	 of	 the	 remittance	 of	 the	 undistributed	
earnings	 of	 overseas	 subsidiaries.	 In	 general,	 the	 Company	 has	 determined	 either	 that	 such	 earnings	 will	 not	 be	 distributed	 in	 the	
foreseeable	 future	 or,	 where	 there	 are	 plans	 to	 remit	 those	 earnings,	 no	 tax	 liability	 is	 expected	 to	 arise.	 A	 deferred	 tax	 liability	 of	 	
£3.5m	 (2015:	 £3.3m)	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 exceptional	 cases	 where	 distribution	 of	 earnings	 is	 both	 planned	 and	 expected	 to	 result	 	
in	 a	 tax	 liability.	
Deferred	 tax	 assets	 in	 respect	 of	 temporary	 differences	 have	 only	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 tax	 losses	 and	 other	 temporary	
differences	 where	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 these	 assets	 will	 be	 realised.	 No	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 unutilised	 tax	
losses	 of	 £13.1m	 (2015:	 £9.1m).
No	 deferred	 tax	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 unutilised	 capital	 losses	 of	 £96.2m	 (2015:	 £96.2m)	 as	 it	 is	 not	 considered	 probable	 that	
there	 will	 be	 suitable	 future	 taxable	 profits	 against	 which	 they	 can	 be	 utilised.

The	 Company	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 share	 plans	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 employees	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 relating	 to	 the	 acquisition

Sharesave Scheme, International Sharesave Plan and Irish Sharesave Plan 
The	 Sharesave	 Scheme,	 International	 Sharesave	 Plan	 and	 Irish	 Sharesave	 Plan	 operate	 on	 a	 similar	 basis	 with	 options	 granted	 to	
participating	 employees	 who	 have	 completed	 at	 least	 three	 months	 of	 continuous	 service	 at	 a	 discount	 of	 up	 to	 20%	 of	 the	 market	 price	
prevailing	 shortly	 before	 the	 invitation	 to	 apply	 for	 the	 option.	 Depending	 on	 the	 scheme,	 options	 are	 normally	 exercisable	 either	 three	 or	
five	 years	 after	 they	 have	 been	 granted	 with	 employees	 saving	 up	 to	 £500	 (2015:	 £500)	 per	 month	 (or	 the	 equivalent	 value	 in	 other	
currencies	 for	 the	 International	 Sharesave	 Plan)	 or	 €500	 (2015:	 €500)	 per	 month	 for	 the	 Irish	 Sharesave	 Plan.
The	 Sharesave	 Scheme	 (2011),	 which	 replaced	 the	 Sharesave	 Scheme	 (2001),	 was	 approved	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	 2011	 Annual	 General	
Meeting,	 is	 an	 HM	 Revenue	 &	 Customs	 (‘HMRC’)	 tax	 advantaged	 scheme	 in	 the	 UK	 and	 is	 open	 to	 all	 UK	 employees,	 including	 UK	 based	
executive	 directors.	 All	 options	 outstanding	 under	 the	 Sharesave	 Scheme	 (2001)	 were	 exercised	 during	 2016.	 The	 International	 Sharesave	
Plan	 and	 Irish	 Sharesave	 Plan,	 which	 is	 approved	 by	 the	 Irish	 Revenue	 Commissioners,	 were	 introduced	 following	 the	 approval	 of	 the	
Sharesave	 Scheme	 (2001)	 and	 were	 extended	 following	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 Sharesave	 Scheme	 (2011).
Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 (‘2004 LTIP’) and 2014 (‘2014 LTIP’) 
The	 2004	 LTIP	 was	 approved	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	 2004	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 and	 expired	 in	 May	 2014.	 No	 further	 share	 options	 or	
performance	 share	 awards	 have	 been	 granted	 under	 the	 2004	 LTIP	 since	 that	 date.	 The	 2014	 LTIP	 was	 approved	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	
2014	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 and	 replaced	 the	 2004	 LTIP.	 Both	 the	 2004	 LTIP	 and	 the	 2014	 LTIP,	 the	 operation	 of	 which	 is	 overseen	 by	 the	
Remuneration	 Committee	 of	 the	 Board,	 are	 divided	 into	 two	 parts.
Part	 A	 of	 the	 LTIPs	 relates	 to	 the	 grant	 of	 market	 priced	 executive	 share	 options.	 In	 normal	 circumstances	 options	 granted	 are	 only	
exercisable	 if	 the	 relevant	 performance	 condition	 has	 been	 satisfied.	 The	 performance	 conditions	 are	 based	 on	 the	 Company’s	 adjusted	
earnings	 per	 share	 growth	 exceeding	 UK	 RPI	 inflation	 over	 three	 financial	 years	 by	 a	 specified	 margin	 (for	 the	 2004	 LTIP)	 or	 meeting	
certain	 specified	 targets	 (for	 the	 2014	 LTIP).
Part	 B	 of	 the	 2004	 and	 2014	 LTIPs	 relate	 to	 the	 grant	 of	 performance	 share	 awards	 which	 are	 conditional	 rights	 to	 receive	 shares	 in	 the	
Company	 for	 nil	 consideration.	 A	 performance	 share	 award	 will	 normally	 vest	 (i.e.	 become	 exercisable)	 on	 the	 third	 anniversary	 of	 its	 grant	
to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 applicable	 performance	 condition	 has	 been	 satisfied.	 The	 extent	 to	 which	 performance	 share	 awards	 granted	 will	
vest	 is	 normally	 partly	 subject	 to	 the	 Company’s	 total	 shareholder	 return	 performance	 relative	 to	 a	 comparator	 group	 of	 companies	 over	
a	 three	 year	 period	 and	 partly	 subject	 to	 the	 Company’s	 adjusted	 earnings	 per	 share	 growth	 exceeding	 UK	 RPI	 inflation	 over	 three	 years	
by	 a	 specified	 margin	 (for	 the	 2004	 LTIP)	 or	 meeting	 certain	 specified	 targets	 (for	 the	 2014	 LTIP).
Investment in own shares
The	 Company	 holds	 a	 number	 of	 its	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 an	 employee	 benefit	 trust.	 The	 principal	 purpose	 of	 this	 trust	 is	 to	 hold	 shares	 in	
the	 Company	 for	 subsequent	 transfer	 to	 certain	 senior	 employees	 and	 executive	 directors	 relating	 to	 options	 granted	 and	 awards	 made	
in	 respect	 of	 market	 purchase	 shares	 under	 the	 2004	 LTIP,	 the	 2014	 LTIP	 and	 the	 Deferred	 Annual	 Share	 Bonus	 Scheme	 (‘DASBS’).	 Details	
of	 such	 plans	 are	 set	 out	 above	 and	 in	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report.	 The	 assets,	 liabilities	 and	 expenditure	 of	 the	 trust	 have	 been	
incorporated	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	 Finance	 expenses	 and	 administration	 charges	 are	 included	 in	 the	 income	 statement	
on	 an	 accruals	 basis.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 trust	 held	 6,280,158	 (2015:	 6,307,153)	 shares,	 upon	 which	 dividends	 have	 been	 waived,	
with	 an	 aggregate	 nominal	 value	 of	 £2.0m	 (2015:	 £2.0m)	 and	 market	 value	 of	 £132.4m	 (2015:	 £118.9m).

Notes	 continued 20 Retirement benefits 
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 defined	 benefit	 and	 defined	 contribution	 retirement	 benefit	 schemes	 in	 the	 US,	 the	 UK	 and	 elsewhere	
in	 Europe	 (including	 France,	 the	 Netherlands	 and	 the	 Republic	 of	 Ireland).	 The	 funds	 of	 the	 principal	 defined	 benefit	 schemes	 are	
administered	 by	 trustees	 and	 are	 held	 independently	 from	 the	 Group.	 Pension	 costs	 of	 defined	 benefit	 schemes	 are	 assessed	 in	
accordance	 with	 the	 advice	 of	 independent	 professionally	 qualified	 actuaries.	 Contributions	 to	 all	 schemes	 are	 determined	 in	 line	 with	
actuarial	 advice	 and	 local	 conditions	 and	 practices.	 Scheme	 assets	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 IAS	 19	 ‘Employee	 Benefits’	 are	 stated	 at	 their	
bid	 value.
Characteristics of defined benefit pension schemes
UK
The	 UK	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 is	 a	 contributory	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 providing	 benefits	 based	 on	 final	 pensionable	 pay.	
The	 scheme	 has	 been	 closed	 to	 new	 members	 since	 2003.	 The	 valuation	 of	 the	 UK	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 has	 been	 updated	
to	 31	 December	 2016	 by	 the	 Group’s	 actuaries.	
The	 UK	 scheme	 is	 an	 HMRC	 registered	 pension	 scheme	 and	 is	 subject	 to	 standard	 UK	 pensions	 and	 tax	 law.	 This	 means	 that	 the	 payment	
of	 contributions	 and	 benefits	 are	 subject	 to	 the	 appropriate	 tax	 treatments	 and	 restrictions	 and	 the	 scheme	 is	 subject	 to	 the	 scheme	
funding	 requirements	 outlined	 in	 section	 224	 of	 the	 Pensions	 Act	 2004.
In	 accordance	 with	 UK	 trust	 and	 pensions	 law,	 the	 pension	 scheme	 has	 a	 corporate	 trustee.	 Although	 the	 Company	 bears	 the	 financial	
cost	 of	 the	 scheme,	 the	 responsibility	 for	 the	 management	 and	 governance	 of	 the	 scheme	 lies	 with	 the	 trustee,	 which	 has	 a	 duty	 to	 act	
in	 the	 best	 interest	 of	 members	 at	 all	 times.	 The	 assets	 of	 the	 scheme	 are	 held	 in	 trust	 by	 the	 trustee	 who	 consults	 with	 the	 Company	
on	 investment	 strategy	 decisions.	
The	 trustees,	 in	 agreement	 with	 the	 Company,	 have	 hedging	 in	 place	 to	 reduce	 the	 impact	 of	 inflation	 and	 interest	 rate	 movements	 on	
the	 funding	 of	 the	 plan.	
The	 last	 full	 triennial	 valuation	 on	 the	 UK	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 was	 carried	 out	 by	 a	 qualified	 actuary	 as	 at	 5	 April	 2015	 and	
showed	 that	 there	 was	 a	 deficit	 on	 the	 agreed	 funding	 basis.	 To	 address	 the	 deficit,	 the	 Company	 has	 agreed	 to	 contribute	 an	 additional	
£5.5m	 per	 year	 from	 April	 2016	 to	 30	 June	 2022.
US
The	 principal	 US	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 is	 a	 non-contributory	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 providing	 benefits	 based	 on	 	
final	 pensionable	 pay.	 The	 scheme	 has	 been	 closed	 to	 new	 members	 since	 2003.	 The	 valuation	 of	 the	 US	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	
has	 been	 updated	 to	 31	 December	 2016	 by	 the	 Group’s	 actuaries.	
The	 US	 scheme	 is	 a	 qualified	 pension	 scheme	 and	 is	 subject	 to	 standard	 regulations	 under	 the	 Employee	 Retirement	 Income	 Security	 Act	
1974,	 the	 Pension	 Protection	 Act	 2006	 and	 the	 Department	 of	 Labor	 and	 Internal	 Revenue	 reporting	 requirements.	 The	 scheme	 pays	
annual	 premiums	 to	 the	 Pension	 Benefit	 Guaranty	 Corporation	 to	 insure	 the	 benefits	 of	 the	 scheme.
The	 assets	 of	 the	 scheme	 are	 held	 in	 trust	 by	 an	 independent	 custodian.	 The	 Company	 has	 established	 a	 Retirement	 Scheme	 Investment	
Committee.	 The	 members	 of	 the	 Committee	 are	 the	 scheme	 fiduciaries	 and,	 as	 such,	 are	 ultimately	 responsible	 for	 the	 management	 of	 the	
scheme	 assets.	 The	 Committee	 performs	 the	 oversight	 function	 and	 delegates	 the	 day-to-day	 management	 process	 to	 appropriate	 staff.	
A	 registered	 investment	 adviser	 advises	 the	 Committee	 regarding	 the	 investment	 of	 scheme	 assets.	
A	 de-risking	 strategy	 has	 been	 agreed	 for	 the	 scheme	 to	 reduce	 the	 mismatch	 between	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 whereby	 investments	
are	 switched	 from	 return	 seeking	 assets	 to	 liability	 matching	 assets	 as	 the	 funding	 improves,	 based	 on	 pre-agreed	 triggers.
Annual	 actuarial	 valuations	 are	 performed	 on	 the	 US	 defined	 benefit	 scheme.	 The	 last	 annual	 review	 was	 carried	 out	 by	 a	 qualified	 actuary	
as	 at	 1	 January	 2016	 and	 showed	 that	 there	 was	 a	 required	 annual	 contribution	 of	 $5.2m.	 In	 2017,	 the	 Group	 plans	 to	 contribute	 $8.0m	 for	
the	 2016	 plan	 year	 to	 cover	 prudently	 this	 required	 contribution	 and	 anticipate	 future	 funding	 needs.	 In	 2016,	 the	 Group	 also	 paid	 a

Risks
The	 main	 risks	 to	 which	 the	 Group	 is	 exposed	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes	 are	 described	 below:
•	 In flation	 risk	 —	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 UK	 scheme’s	 liabilities	 increase	 in	 line	 with	 inflation	 and,	 as	 a	 result,	 if	 inflation	 is	 greater	 than	
expected	 the	 liabilities	 will	 increase.	 The	 impact	 of	 high	 inflation	 is	 capped	 each	 year	 for	 the	 UK	 scheme’s	 benefits.	 The	 US	 scheme‘s	
liabilities	 are	 not	 directly	 tied	 to	 inflationary	 increases.
•	 Interest 	 rate	 risk	 —	 a	 fall	 in	 bond	 yields	 will	 increase	 the	 value	 of	 the	 schemes’	 liabilities.	 A	 proportion	 of	 both	 the	 UK	 and	 US	 schemes’	
assets	 are	 invested	 in	 liability	 matching	 assets	 to	 mitigate	 the	 interest	 rate	 and	 also	 the	 inflation	 risk.
•	 Mortality 	 risk	 —	 the	 assumptions	 adopted	 by	 the	 Group	 make	 allowance	 for	 future	 improvements	 in	 life	 expectancy.	 However,	 if	 life	
expectancy	 improves	 at	 a	 faster	 rate	 than	 assumed,	 this	 would	 result	 in	 greater	 payments	 from	 the	 schemes	 and	 consequently	 increases	 	
in	 the	 schemes’	 liabilities.	 The	 mortality	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 to	 minimise	 the	 risk	 of	 using	 an	 inappropriate	
assumption.
•	 Investment 	 risk	 —	 the	 schemes	 invest	 in	 a	 diversified	 range	 of	 asset	 classes	 to	 mitigate	 the	 risk	 of	 falls	 in	 any	 one	 area	 of	 the	
investments.	 In	 the	 UK,	 the	 trustee	 implements	 partial	 currency	 hedging	 on	 the	 overseas	 assets	 to	 mitigate	 currency	 risk.
The	 risks	 mentioned	 above	 could	 lead	 to	 a	 material	 change	 to	 the	 deficit	 or	 surplus	 of	 the	 pension	 schemes.	 Given	 the	 long	 term	 time	
horizon	 of	 the	 schemes’	 cash	 flows,	 the	 assumptions	 used	 can	 lead	 to	 volatility	 in	 the	 scheme	 valuations	 from	 year	 to	 year.	 The	 Company	
and	 the	 trustees	 seek	 to	 mitigate	 actively	 the	 risks	 associated	 with	 the	 schemes.
A	 higher	 defined	 benefit	 obligation	 could	 lead	 to	 additional	 funding	 requirements	 in	 future	 years.	 Any	 deficit	 measured	 on	 a	 funding	
valuation	 basis,	 which	 may	 differ	 from	 the	 actuarial	 valuation	 under	 IAS	 19,	 will	 generally	 be	 financed	 over	 a	 period	 that	 ensures	 the	
contributions	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 Group	 and	 in	 line	 with	 the	 relevant	 regulations.

Notes	 continued 24 Acquisitions 
Acquisitions	 involving	 the	 purchase	 of	 the	 acquiree’s	 share	 capital	 or,	 as	 the	 case	 may	 be,	 the	 relevant	 assets	 of	 the	 businesses	 acquired,	
have	 been	 accounted	 for	 under	 the	 acquisition	 method	 of	 accounting.	 Part	 of	 the	 Group’s	 strategy	 is	 to	 grow	 through	 acquisition.	 The	 Group	
has	 developed	 a	 process	 to	 assist	 with	 the	 identification	 of	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 the	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 assumed,	 including	 the	
separate	 identification	 of	 intangible	 assets	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 3	 ‘Business	 Combinations’.	 This	 formal	 process	 is	 applied	 to	 each	
acquisition	 and	 involves	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 assumed	 with	 assistance	 provided	 by	 external	 valuation	
specialists	 where	 appropriate.	 Until	 this	 assessment	 is	 complete,	 the	 allocation	 period	 remains	 open	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 12	 months	 from	
the	 relevant	 acquisition	 date.	 At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 allocation	 period	 for	 all	 acquisitions	 completed	 since	 1	 January	 2016	 remained	 open	
and	 accordingly	 the	 fair	 values	 presented	 are	 provisional.	
Adjustments	 are	 made	 to	 the	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 assumed	 during	 the	 allocation	 period	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 further	 information	 and	
knowledge	 come	 to	 light	 that	 more	 accurately	 reflect	 conditions	 at	 the	 acquisition	 date.	 To	 date	 the	 adjustments	 made	 have	 impacted	 assets	
acquired	 to	 reflect	 more	 accurately	 the	 estimated	 realisable	 or	 settlement	 value.	 Similarly,	 adjustments	 have	 been	 made	 to	 acquired	
liabilities	 to	 record	 onerous	 commitments	 or	 other	 commitments	 existing	 at	 the	 acquisition	 date	 but	 not	 recognised	 by	 the	 acquiree.	
Adjustments	 have	 also	 been	 made	 to	 reflect	 the	 associated	 tax	 effects.	 There	 were	 no	 material	 measurement	 period	 adjustments	 recorded	
during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 related	 to	 acquisitions	 completed	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2015.
The	 consideration	 paid	 or	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 acquisitions	 comprises	 amounts	 paid	 on	 completion,	 deferred	 consideration	 and	 payments	
which	 are	 contingent	 on	 the	 retention	 of	 former	 owners	 of	 businesses	 acquired.	 IFRS	 3	 requires	 that	 any	 payments	 that	 are	 contingent	 on	
future	 employment,	 including	 payments	 which	 are	 contingent	 on	 the	 retention	 of	 former	 owners	 of	 businesses	 acquired,	 are	 charged	 to	
the	 income	 statement.	 All	 other	 consideration	 has	 been	 allocated	 against	 the	 identified	 net	 assets,	 with	 the	 balance	 recorded	 as	 goodwill.	
Transaction	 costs	 and	 expenses	 such	 as	 professional	 fees	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement.	 The	 acquisitions	 provide	 opportunities	
for	 further	 development	 of	 the	 Group’s	 activities	 and	 create	 enhanced	 returns.	 Such	 opportunities	 and	 the	 workforces	 inherent	 in	 each	
of	 the	 acquired	 businesses	 do	 not	 translate	 to	 separately	 identifiable	 intangible	 assets	 but	 do	 represent	 much	 of	 the	 assessed	 value	 that	
supports	 the	 recognised	 goodwill.	
For	 each	 of	 the	 businesses	 acquired	 during	 the	 year,	 the	 name	 of	 the	 business,	 the	 market	 sector	 served,	 its	 location	 and	 date	 of	
acquisition,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 estimated	 annualised	 revenue	 it	 would	 have	 contributed	 to	 the	 Group	 for	 the	 year	 if	 such	 acquisitions	 had	 been	
made	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year,	 are	 separately	 disclosed.	 The	 remaining	 disclosures	 required	 by	 IFRS	 3	 are	 provided	 separately	 for	 those	
individual	 acquisitions	 that	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 material	 and	 in	 aggregate	 for	 individually	 immaterial	 acquisitions.	 An	 acquisition	 would	
generally	 be	 considered	 individually	 material	 if	 the	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	 revenue	 or	 profit	 measures	 (on	 an	 annualised	 basis)	 or	 the	
relevant	 amounts	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 is	 greater	 than	 5%.	 Management	 also	 applies	 judgement	 in	 considering	 whether	 there	 are	 any	
material	 qualitative	 differences	 from	 other	 acquisitions	 made.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Company	 statement	 of	 changes	 in	 equity	
at	 31	 December	 2016 1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl	 plc	 (the	 'Company')	 is	 a	 company	 incorporated	 and	 domiciled	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom.	 These	 financial	 statements	 present	 information	
about	 the	 Company	 as	 an	 individual	 undertaking	 and	 not	 about	 its	 Group.	 The	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 have	 been	 prepared	
on	 a	 going	 concern	 basis	 and	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 convention	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 certain	 items	 which	 are	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 as	
described	 in	 the	 accounting	 policies	 below.
These	 financial	 statements	 were	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standard	 101	 Reduced	 Disclosure	 Framework	 (‘FRS	 101’)	
and	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 as	 applicable	 to	 companies	 using	 FRS	 101.	 There	 are	 no	 new	 standards,	 amendments	 or	 interpretations	 that	
are	 applicable	 to	 the	 Company	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016.	 In	 preparing	 these	 financial	 statements	 the	 Company	 has	 applied	 the	
exemptions	 available	 under	 FRS	 101	 in	 respect	 of:
•	 a 	 cash	 flow	 statement	 and	 related	 notes;
•	 comparative 	 period	 reconciliations	 for	 share	 capital	 and	 tangible	 fixed	 assets;
•	 disclosures 	 relating	 to	 transactions	 with	 wholly	 owned	 subsidiaries	 and	 capital	 management;
•	 the 	 effects	 of	 new	 but	 not	 yet	 effective	 IFRSs;	 and
•	 disclosures 	 relating	 to	 the	 compensation	 of	 key	 management	 personnel.
As	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 include	 the	 equivalent	 disclosures,	 the	 Company	 has	 also	 applied	 the	 exemptions	
available	 under	 FRS	 101	 in	 respect	 of:
•	 certain 	 disclosures	 required	 by	 IFRS	 2	 ‘Share	 Based	 Payments’	 in	 respect	 of	 Group	 settled	 share	 based	 payments;	 and
•	 certain 	 disclosures	 required	 by	 IFRS	 13	 ‘Fair	 Value	 Measurement’	 and	 disclosures	 required	 by	 IFRS	 7	 ‘Financial	 Instruments’.
2 Accounting policies
The	 accounting	 policies	 of	 the	 Company	 have,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated,	 been	 applied	 consistently	 to	 all	 periods	 presented	 in	 these	 financial	
statements.	 The	 Company	 has	 changed	 the	 presentation	 of	 software	 assets	 to	 show	 them	 separately	 as	 intangible	 assets,	 reducing	
tangible	 assets	 by	 £0.7m	 at	 31	 December	 2015.	 This	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 reclassification	 for	 the	 Group	 explained	 in	 Note	 1(i)	 to	 the	
consolidated	 financial	 statements.	 In	 most	 cases	 the	 accounting	 policies	 for	 the	 Company	 are	 fully	 aligned	 with	 the	 equivalent	 accounting	
policy	 for	 the	 Group	 as	 stated	 on	 pages	 98	 to	 102	 in	 Note	 2	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	 The	 accounting	 policies	 of	 the	 Company	
which	 are	 aligned	 with	 those	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 the	 policies	 for	 tangible	 assets,	 intangible	 assets,	 income	 tax,	 provisions,	 retirement	
benefits,	 investment	 in	 own	 shares,	 dividends	 and	 leases.	 The	 accounting	 policies	 that	 are	 specific	 to	 the	 Company	 are	 set	 out	 below.
a Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments	 in	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 are	 held	 at	 cost	 less	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment.	 The	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 which	 the	 Company	
held	 at	 31	 December	 2016	 are	 disclosed	 in	 the	 Related	 undertakings	 note	 in	 the	 Shareholder	 information	 section	 on	 pages	 146	 to	 148.	
b Share based payments
The	 Company	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 equity	 settled	 share	 based	 payment	 compensation	 plans.	 Details	 of	 these	 plans	 are	 outlined	 in	 Note	 16	
to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report.	 The	 total	 expected	 expense	 is	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 of	
options	 and	 other	 share	 based	 incentives	 on	 the	 grant	 date	 calculated	 using	 a	 valuation	 model	 which	 is	 spread	 over	 the	 expected	 vesting	
period	 with	 a	 corresponding	 credit	 to	 equity.
Where	 the	 Company	 grants	 options	 over	 its	 own	 shares	 to	 the	 employees	 of	 its	 subsidiaries	 and	 it	 has	 not	 recharged	 the	 cost	 to	 the	
relevant	 subsidiaries,	 it	 recognises,	 in	 its	 individual	 financial	 statements,	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 cost	 of	 investment	 in	 its	 subsidiaries	 equivalent	
to	 the	 equity	 settled	 share	 based	 payment	 charge	 recognised	 in	 its	 consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 with	 the	 corresponding	 credit	 being	
recognised	 directly	 in	 equity.	
c Financial guarantee contracts
Where	 the	 Company	 enters	 into	 financial	 guarantee	 contracts	 to	 guarantee	 the	 indebtedness	 of	 other	 companies	 within	 its	 Group,	
the	 Company	 considers	 these	 to	 be	 insurance	 arrangements	 and	 accounts	 for	 them	 as	 such.	 In	 this	 respect	 the	 Company	 treats	 the	
guarantee	 contract	 as	 a	 contingent	 liability	 until	 such	 time	 as	 it	 becomes	 probable	 that	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 required	 to	 make	 a	 payment	
under	 the	 guarantee.
d Defined benefit pension schemes
The	 Company	 is	 the	 sponsoring	 company	 of	 the	 UK	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme.	 As	 there	 is	 no	 contractual	 agreement	 or	 stated	 Group	
policy	 for	 charging	 the	 net	 defined	 benefit	 cost	 of	 the	 scheme	 to	 participating	 subsidiaries,	 the	 net	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 cost	 or	 benefit	
is	 recognised	 fully	 by	 the	 Company.	 The	 contributions	 paid	 by	 the	 participating	 subsidiaries	 other	 than	 the	 Company	 are	 credited	 to	 profit	 or	
loss	 of	 the	 Company	 where	 the	 amounts	 relate	 to	 service	 and	 are	 independent	 of	 the	 number	 of	 years	 of	 service	 or	 to	 other	 comprehensive	
income	 if	 not	 linked	 to	 service.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Financial	 statements
Notes	 to	 the	 Company	 financial	 statements 2 Accounting policies continued 
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In	 preparing	 these	 financial	 statements,	 management	 has	 made	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 choice	 and	
application	 of	 the	 Company’s	 accounting	 policies	 and	 the	 reported	 amounts	 of	 assets,	 liabilities	 and	 profit	 or	 loss.	 Actual	 results	 may	 differ	
from	 those	 derived	 from	 the	 application	 of	 such	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions,	 in	 particular	 those	 which	 involve	 anticipating	
future	 events.	 Accordingly,	 the	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis,	 with	 the	 impact	 of	 any	 revisions	
considered	 necessary	 being	 recognised	 prospectively	 thereafter.
The	 key	 assumptions	 and	 sources	 of	 estimation	 uncertainty	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 that	 have	 most	 risk	 of	 causing	 material	 adjustment	
to	 the	 carrying	 values	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2016	 are	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	
investments,	 as	 explained	 below,	 and	 the	 measurement	 of	 the	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 liability	 which	 is	 explained	 in	 Note	 2	 to	 the	
consolidated	 financial	 statements.	 The	 directors	 believe	 that	 the	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 applied	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	
these	 financial	 statements	 are	 appropriate.	 Where	 relevant	 and	 practicable,	 sensitivity	 analysis	 is	 disclosed	 in	 the	 relevant	 Notes	 to	 the	
consolidated	 financial	 statements	 to	 demonstrate	 the	 impact	 of	 changes	 in	 estimates	 or	 assumptions	 used.
Recoverability of investments
The	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 the	 Company’s	 non-financial	 assets,	 in	 particular	 the	 investments	 in	 subsidiary	 undertakings,	 are	 reviewed	
annually	 to	 determine	 if	 there	 is	 any	 indication	 of	 impairment.	 If	 any	 such	 indication	 exists,	 the	 assets’	 recoverable	 amounts	 are	 estimated.	
The	 recoverable	 amounts	 of	 assets	 are	 the	 greater	 of	 their	 fair	 value	 less	 the	 costs	 of	 disposal	 and	 their	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 the	 value	 	
in	 use,	 the	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 values	 using	 appropriate	 pre-tax	 discount	 rates.	 Impairment	 losses	
are	 recognised	 when	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 an	 asset	 exceeds	 its	 estimated	 recoverable	 amount	 with	 impairment	 losses	 being	 recognised	 	
in	 profit	 or	 loss.

Deferred	 tax	 is	 calculated	 in	 full	 on	 temporary	 differences	 under	 the	 liability	 method.	 Following	 the	 enactment	 of	 legislation	 in	 the	 UK,	
the	 corporation	 tax	 rate	 will	 be	 reduced	 from	 20%	 to	 19%	 with	 effect	 from	 1	 April	 2017	 and	 from	 19%	 to	 17%	 from	 1	 April	 2020.	 Accordingly,	
the	 UK	 tax	 rate	 used	 for	 measuring	 deferred	 tax	 reflects	 the	 rate	 expected	 to	 be	 applied	 when	 the	 temporary	 differences	 reverse.	 It	 is	
probable	 that	 the	 deferred	 tax	 assets	 recognised	 will	 be	 realised.	 The	 recovery	 of	 the	 net	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 will	 be	 over	 more	 than	 one	
year.	 No	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 unutilised	 capital	 losses	 of	 £70.6m	 (2015:	 £70.6m).

Financial	 statements
Notes	 to	 the	 Company	 financial	 statements	 continued The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 the	 Annual	 Report,	
which	 includes	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report	 and	 the	 financial	
statements,	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations.
Company	 law	 requires	 the	 directors	 to	 prepare	 financial	 statements	
for	 each	 financial	 year.	 Under	 that	 law	 the	 directors	 have	 prepared	
the	 Group	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 as	
adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union	 and	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	
Accounting	 Practice	 (UK	 accounting	 standards	 and	 applicable	 law).	
In	 preparing	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements,	 the	 directors	 have	 also	
elected	 to	 comply	 with	 IFRS	 issued	 by	 the	 IASB.	 Under	 company	 law	
the	 directors	 must	 not	 approve	 the	 financial	 statements	 unless	 they	
are	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 affairs	
of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group	 and	 of	 the	 profit	 or	 loss	 of	 the	
Company	 and	 Group	 for	 that	 period.	 In	 preparing	 these	 financial	
statements,	 the	 directors	 are	 required	 to:
•	 select 	 suitable	 accounting	 policies	 and	 then	 apply	 them	
consistently;
•	 make 	 judgements	 and	 accounting	 estimates	 that	 are	 reasonable	
and	 prudent;
•	 state 	 whether	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union,	 IFRS	
issued	 by	 the	 IASB	 and	 applicable	 UK	 accounting	 standards	
have	 been	 followed,	 subject	 to	 any	 material	 departures	 disclosed	
and	 explained	 in	 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 financial	
statements	 respectively;	 and
•	 prepare 	 the	 financial	 statements	 on	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	
unless	 it	 is	 inappropriate	 to	 presume	 that	 the	 Company	 will	
continue	 in	 business.
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 keeping	 adequate	 accounting	
records	 that	 are	 sufficient	 to	 show	 and	 explain	 the	 Company’s	
transactions	 and	 disclose	 with	 reasonable	 accuracy	 at	 any	 time	
the	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group	 and	 enable	
them	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 Directors’	
remuneration	 report	 comply	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and,	
as	 regards	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements,	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	
Regulation.	 They	 are	 also	 responsible	 for	 safeguarding	 the	
assets	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group	 and	 hence	 for	 taking	
reasonable	 steps	 for	 the	 prevention	 and	 detection	 of	 fraud	
and	 other	 irregularities.
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 maintenance	 and	 integrity	
of	 the	 Company’s	 website.	 Legislation	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom	
governing	 the	 preparation	 and	 dissemination	 of	 financial	
statements	 may	 differ	 from	 legislation	 in	 other	 jurisdictions.
The	 directors	 consider	 that	 the	 Annual	 Report,	 taken	 as	 a	 whole,	
is	 fair,	 balanced	 and	 understandable	 and	 provides	 the	 information	
necessary	 for	 shareholders	 to	 assess	 the	 Company’s	 performance,	
business	 model	 and	 strategy.	
Each	 of	 the	 directors,	 whose	 names	 and	 functions	 are	 set	 out	
on	 page	 48	 of	 the	 Annual	 Report,	 confirm	 that	 to	 the	 best	
of	 their	 knowledge:
•		 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	
prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 applicable	 set	 of	 accounting	
standards	 and	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 assets,	 liabilities,	
financial	 position	 and	 profit	 or	 loss	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	
undertakings	 included	 in	 the	 consolidation	 taken	 as	 a	 whole;	 and
•	 the 	 Annual	 Report	 includes	 a	 fair	 review	 of	 the	 development	 and	
performance	 of	 the	 business	 and	 the	 position	 of	 the	 Company	 and	
the	 undertakings	 included	 in	 the	 consolidation	 taken	 as	 a	 whole,

Financial	 statements The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We	 conducted	 our	 audit	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland)	 ('ISAs	 (UK	 &	 Ireland)').
We	 designed	 our	 audit	 by	 determining	 materiality	 and	 assessing	 the	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.	 In	 particular,	
we	 looked	 at	 where	 the	 directors	 made	 subjective	 judgements,	 for	 example	 in	 respect	 of	 significant	 accounting	 estimates	 that	 involved	
making	 assumptions	 and	 considering	 future	 events	 that	 are	 inherently	 uncertain.	 As	 in	 all	 of	 our	 audits,	 we	 also	 addressed	 the	 risk	 of	
management	 override	 of	 internal	 controls	 and	 the	 risk	 of	 fraud	 in	 revenue	 recognition,	 including	 evaluating	 whether	 there	 was	 evidence	
of	 bias	 by	 the	 directors	 that	 represented	 a	 risk	 of	 material	 misstatement	 due	 to	 fraud.
The	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 that	 had	 the	 greatest	 effect	 on	 our	 audit,	 including	 the	 allocation	 of	 our	 resources	 and	 effort,	 are	
identified	 as	 'areas	 of	 focus'	 in	 the	 table	 below.	 We	 have	 also	 set	 out	 how	 we	 tailored	 our	 audit	 to	 address	 these	 specific	 areas	 in	 order	
to	 provide	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 whole,	 and	 any	 comments	 we	 make	 on	 the	 results	 of	 our	 procedures	 should	 be	 read	
in	 this	 context.	 This	 is	 not	 a	 complete	 list	 of	 all	 risks	 identified	 by	 our	 audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment of goodwill and customer relationships intangible assets 
Refer	 to	 page	 58	 (Audit	 Committee	 report),	 page	 100	 (Accounting	 policies)	 and	 pages	 110	 and	 111	 (Note	 9).
The	 Group	 has	 material	 goodwill	 balances	 of	 £1,191.5m	
(2015:	 £999.3m)	 and	 customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 of	
£737.7m	 (2015:	 £632.7m)	 spread	 across	 multiple	 geographies	 and	
relating	 to	 multiple	 cash	 generating	 units	 ('CGUs').	
In	 assessing	 whether	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 these	 assets	 has	
been	 impaired,	 management	 considers	 forecast	 cash	 flows	 of	
the	 individual	 CGUs	 which	 are	 identified	 on	 a	 market	 sector	 or	
geographical	 basis.
We	 focused	 on	 the	 CGUs	 with	 the	 highest	 goodwill	 and	
customer	 relationships	 intangible	 assets	 (the	 most	 material	
being	 North	 America,	 Rest	 of	 Continental	 Europe	 and	 France)	
as	 well	 as	 the	 CGUs	 where	 there	 were	 smaller	 goodwill	 and	
customer	 relationships	 intangible	 asset	 balances	 but	 lower	
levels	 of	 headroom.
Management’s	 impairment	 assessment	 involves	 significant	
estimation,	 principally	 relating	 to	 short	 and	 long	 term	 revenue	
growth,	 future	 profitability	 and	 discount	 rates.	 Due	 to	 the	
acquisitive	 nature	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 magnitude	 of	 the	
aggregated	 related	 goodwill	 and	 customer	 relationships	
intangible	 assets,	 together	 with	 the	 subjectivity	 of	 the	 principal	
assumptions,	 a	 significant	 amount	 of	 audit	 effort	 was	 required,	
particularly	 as	 some	 of	 these	 assumptions	 are	 dependent	
on	 economic	 factors	 and	 trading	 conditions	 specific	 to	
overseas	 territories.	
In	 our	 testing	 of	 management’s	 annual	 goodwill	 and	 customer	
relationships	 intangible	 assets	 impairment	 calculations,	 we	 used	
valuation	 experts	 to	 assist	 our	 evaluation	 of	 the	 key	 assumptions	
used	 by	 management.
We	 evaluated	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 the	 directors’	 cash	 flow	
forecasts	 by	 comparing	 the	 assumptions	 made	 to	 internal	 and	
external	 data.
In	 particular:
•	 we 	 compared	 short	 term	 revenue	 growth	 rates	 to	 the	 latest	
strategic	 plans	 and	 found	 them	 to	 be	 consistent;
•	 we 	 determined	 that	 long	 term	 growth	 rates	 are	 generally	
consistent	 when	 compared	 to	 third	 party	 nominal	 GDP	 rates;
•	 we 	 found	 the	 achievability	 of	 future	 margins	 to	 be	 plausible	 based	
on	 past	 and	 current	 performance	 and	 consistent	 with	 budgets;	
•	 we 	 challenged	 the	 discount	 rate	 used	 to	 determine	 the	
present	 value	 by	 assessing	 the	 cost	 of	 capital	 for	 the	 Company	
and	 comparable	 organisations	 and	 considered	 them	 to	 be	
reasonable;	 and
•	 we 	 evaluated	 the	 reduction	 in	 the	 number	 of	 CGUs	 and	 reviewed	
the	 results	 of	 management's	 'gateway'	 test,	 being	 the	 impairment	
review	 performed	 under	 the	 previous	 CGU	 definitions	 and	 noted	
no	 indicators	 of	 impairment.
Furthermore,	 we	 obtained	 evidence	 to	 assess	 adequate	 historical	
accuracy	 in	 management’s	 forecasting	 process.	
As	 described	 in	 Note	 9	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements,	
management	 concluded	 that,	 based	 on	 their	 own	 sensitivity	
calculations,	 no	 reasonable	 change	 in	 assumptions	 would	 lead	 to	
an	 impairment	 of	 goodwill	 or	 other	 intangible	 assets.
Having	 ascertained	 the	 extent	 of	 changes	 in	 key	 assumptions	 either	
individually	 or	 collectively	 that	 would	 be	 required	 for	 goodwill	 and	
other	 intangible	 assets	 to	 be	 materially	 impaired,	 we	 considered	
such	 a	 change	 in	 those	 key	 assumptions	 to	 be	 unlikely.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Business combinations
Refer	 to	 page	 58	 (Audit	 Committee	 report),	 page	 98	 (Accounting	 policies)	 and	 pages	 129	 to	 131	 (Note	 24).
Given	 that	 the	 Group	 continues	 to	 make	 significant	 investment	
in	 acquisitions,	 accounting	 for	 business	 combinations	 is	 an	 area	
of	 focus	 due	 to	 the	 level	 of	 judgement	 involved.
Business	 combinations	 can	 involve	 judgements	 in	 relation	 to	 the	
value	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 are	 recognised	 on	 acquisition,	
particularly	 the	 allocation	 of	 purchase	 consideration	 to	 goodwill	
and	 separately	 identified	 intangible	 assets.	 Any	 misstatement	
made	 in	 the	 identification	 and/or	 valuation	 of	 acquired	 intangibles	
gives	 rise	 to	 an	 equal,	 compensating	 misstatement	 in	 goodwill.
Management	 relies	 on	 external	 valuation	 specialists	 to	 value	
significant	 intangibles	 acquired	 in	 business	 combinations.	 Where	
management	 has	 relied	 on	 such	 specialists,	 we	 assessed	 their	
independence	 and	 competency	 and	 tested	 the	 results	 of	 their	
work	 and	 found	 no	 material	 issues.
We	 used	 our	 own	 valuation	 experts	 to	 challenge	 the	 methodology	
and	 key	 assumptions	 used	 in	 determining	 the	 value	 of	 the	 customer	
relationships	 assets	 for	 the	 more	 significant	 acquisitions.	 We	
determined	 that	 the	 cash	 flows	 applied	 within	 the	 valuation	 models	
and	 the	 key	 assumptions	 such	 as	 the	 discount	 rates,	 growth	 rates,	
customer	 attrition	 and	 period	 for	 amortisation,	 were	 appropriate.
Defined benefit pension schemes 
Refer	 to	 page	 58	 (Audit	 Committee	 report),	 page	 102	 (Accounting	 policies)	 and	 pages	 123	 to	 126	 (Note	 20).
The	 Group	 has	 defined	 benefits	 pension	 schemes	 (with	 material	
schemes	 in	 the	 US	 and	 the	 UK)	 with	 a	 net	 deficit	 of	 £84.1m	 at	 the	
current	 year	 end	 (2015:	 £40.0m),	 which	 is	 material	 in	 the	 context	
of	 the	 Consolidated	 balance	 sheet.
Management	 estimation	 is	 required	 in	 relation	 to	 the	
measurement	 of	 pension	 scheme	 obligations,	 and	 management	
employs	 independent	 actuarial	 experts	 to	 assist	 it	 in	 determining	
appropriate	 assumptions	 such	 as	 inflation	 levels,	 discount	 rates,	
salary	 increases	 and	 mortality	 rates.
Movements	 in	 these	 assumptions	 can	 have	 a	 material	 impact	 on	
the	 determination	 of	 the	 liability	 and,	 therefore,	 the	 extent	 of	 any	
surplus	 or	 deficit.
We	 used	 our	 own	 actuarial	 experts	 to	 satisfy	 ourselves	 that	 the	
assumptions	 used	 in	 calculating	 the	 US	 and	 UK	 pension	 scheme	
liabilities	 are	 appropriate,	 including	 confirming	 that	 salary	
increases	 and	 mortality	 rate	 assumptions	 were	 consistent	 with	
relevant	 national	 and	 industry	 benchmarks.	 We	 determined	 that	
the	 discount	 and	 inflation	 rates	 used	 in	 the	 valuation	 of	 the	
pension	 scheme	 liabilities	 were	 consistent	 with	 our	 internally	
developed	 benchmarks	 and,	 where	 available,	 with	 those	 disclosed	
in	 the	 published	 financial	 statements	 of	 other	 companies	 as	 at	
31	 December	 2016.	 In	 each	 case	 we	 considered	 the	 assumptions	
made	 by	 management	 to	 be	 reasonable	 in	 light	 of	 the	 available	
evidence.
Corporate tax exposures 
Refer	 to	 page	 58	 (Audit	 Committee	 report),	 page	 99	 (Accounting	 policies)	 and	 pages	 107	 and	 108	 (Note	 6).
The	 Group	 operates	 in	 a	 number	 of	 international	 territories	 with	
complex	 taxation	 rules	 and	 regulations.	 The	 interpretation	 of	
these	 complex	 regulations	 and	 the	 unknown	 future	 outcome	 of	
pending	 judgements	 by	 the	 tax	 authorities	 result	 in	 the	 need	 to	
provide	 against	 a	 number	 of	 uncertain	 tax	 positions.
We	 focused	 on	 this	 area	 because	 of	 the	 risk	 surrounding	 the	 level	
of	 estimation	 and	 judgement	 that	 is	 necessary	 in	 determining	 the	
provisions	 required,	 together	 with	 the	 importance	 of	 achieving	
adequate	 and	 clear	 disclosure	 related	 to	 judgemental	 tax	 matters.
We	 discussed	 with	 management	 their	 assessment	 of	 uncertain	
tax	 positions	 and	 used	 our	 taxation	 specialists	 to	 assist	 us	 in	
challenging	 the	 appropriateness	 of	 management’s	 judgements	
in	 relation	 to	 these	 positions.	 These	 procedures	 assisted	 in	 our	
corroboration	 of	 management’s	 position	 on	 the	 amount	 of	
significant	 tax	 exposures	 and	 the	 provisions	 and	 disclosures	 made	
in	 the	 financial	 statements.
In	 assessing	 the	 adequacy	 of	 the	 tax	 provisions,	 we	 also	 considered	
factors	 such	 as	 possible	 penalties	 and	 interest.	 Furthermore,	 we	
determined	 that	 the	 calculations	 were	 in	 line	 with	 the	 accounting	
standards	 and	 that	 the	 methodology	 and	 principles	 had	 been	
applied	 consistently.
We	 consider	 the	 current	 level	 of	 tax	 provision	 to	 be	 reasonable.	
Supplier rebate accounting – purchase volume based rebates 
Refer	 to	 page	 58	 (Audit	 Committee	 report)	 and	 page	 99	 (Accounting	 policies).
We	 focused	 on	 this	 area	 as	 purchase	 volume	 based	 rebate	 income	
from	 suppliers	 is	 material	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
Given	 a	 degree	 of	 estimation	 is	 involved	 in	 accounting	 for	 purchase	
volume	 based	 supplier	 rebates,	 we	 focused	 our	 audit	 procedures	
on	 the	 accuracy,	 occurrence	 and	 cut-off	 of	 these	 transactions	
and	 the	 valuation	 of	 amounts	 held	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet.
We	 evaluated	 the	 processes	 in	 place	 across	 the	 Group	 for	 the	
recognition	 of	 purchase	 volume	 based	 supplier	 rebates	 and	 found	
these	 to	 be	 consistently	 applied.	 We	 agreed	 the	 nature	 of	 a	 sample	
of	 rebate	 arrangements	 to	 contracts	 or	 other	 supporting	 agreements	
and	 agreed	 the	 rates	 indicated	 in	 the	 agreements	 with	 those	 used	
in	 the	 calculations.	 We	 also	 reperformed	 a	 sample	 of	 rebate	
calculations	 and	 assessed	 management’s	 estimates	 of	 purchases.	
No	 material	 exceptions	 were	 noted	 from	 this	 testing.
Where	 appropriate,	 we	 also	 agreed	 the	 post	 year	 end	 settlement

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016
Financial	 statements How we tailored the audit scope
We	 tailored	 the	 scope	 of	 our	 audit	 to	 ensure	 that	 we	 performed	 enough	 work	 to	 be	 able	 to	 give	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	
a	 whole,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 geographic	 structure	 of	 the	 Group,	 the	 accounting	 processes	 and	 controls,	 and	 the	 industry	 in	 which	 the	
Group	 operates.
The	 Group	 is	 organised	 geographically	 into	 four	 business	 areas,	 being	 North	 America,	 Continental	 Europe,	 UK	 &	 Ireland	 and	 Rest	 of	
the	 World.
We	 identified	 one	 financially	 significant	 component,	 being	 North	 America,	 where	 a	 full	 scope	 audit	 has	 been	 performed.	 In	 addition	 to	 this,	
we	 identified	 four	 components	 across	 Continental	 Europe,	 UK	 &	 Ireland	 and	 Rest	 of	 the	 World	 for	 which	 a	 full	 scope	 audit	 of	 their	 financial	
information	 was	 required.	 In	 order	 to	 satisfy	 the	 request	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 and	 management,	 we	 performed	 full	 scope	 audits	 on	 a	
further	 72	 components.	 The	 components	 where	 we	 performed	 audit	 procedures	 covered	 over	 95%	 of	 Group	 revenue,	 profit	 before	 taxation	
and	 total	 assets.
Component	 audits	 were	 performed	 to	 respective	 statutory	 materiality	 levels	 of	 the	 individual	 components	 and,	 for	 component	 teams	 with	
no	 statutory	 requirements,	 a	 materiality	 was	 allocated	 by	 the	 Group	 team.	 These	 local	 materiality	 levels	 were	 set	 individually	 for	 each	
component	 and	 ranged	 up	 to	 £15.0m.
Where	 work	 was	 performed	 by	 component	 auditors,	 detailed	 instructions	 were	 issued	 by	 the	 Group	 audit	 team,	 who	 visited	 North	 America,	
UK,	 France	 and	 Australia.	 Telephone	 discussions	 were	 also	 held	 with	 component	 auditors	 at	 these	 locations	 and	 with	 the	 majority	 of	 the	
components	 that	 the	 Group	 audit	 team	 did	 not	 visit	 in	 person.	 In	 addition,	 specific	 audit	 procedures	 over	 central	 functions	 and	 areas	 of	
significant	 judgement,	 including	 taxation,	 pensions,	 acquisitions	 and	 the	 impairment	 of	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets,	 were	 performed	
by	 the	 Group	 audit	 team	 centrally.	
Materiality
The	 scope	 of	 our	 audit	 was	 influenced	 by	 our	 application	 of	 materiality.	 We	 set	 certain	 quantitative	 thresholds	 for	 materiality.	 These,	
together	 with	 qualitative	 considerations,	 helped	 us	 to	 determine	 the	 scope	 of	 our	 audit	 and	 the	 nature,	 timing	 and	 extent	 of	 our	 audit	
procedures	 on	 the	 individual	 financial	 statement	 line	 items	 and	 disclosures	 and	 in	 evaluating	 the	 effect	 of	 misstatements,	 both	 individually	
and	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 whole.
Based	 on	 our	 professional	 judgement,	 we	 determined	 materiality	 for	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 whole	 as	 follows:
Overall Group materiality £16	 million	 (2015:	 £15m)
How we determined it Approximately	 5%	 of	 profit	 before	 taxation
Rationale for benchmark applied Given	 that	 the	 Group’s	 businesses	 are	 profit	 orientated	 and	 the	 directors	 use	 profit	 measures	
to	 assess	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 business,	 we	 believe	 that	 profit	 before	 taxation	 provides	 us	
with	 a	 consistent	 year-on-year	 basis	 for	 determining	 materiality
We	 agreed	 with	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 that	 we	 would	 report	 to	 them	 misstatements	 identified	 during	 our	 audit	 above	 £800,000	 (2015:	 £750,000)	
as	 well	 as	 misstatements	 below	 that	 amount	 that,	 in	 our	 view,	 warranted	 reporting	 for	 qualitative	 reasons.
Going concern
Under	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 we	 are	 required	 to	 review	 the	 directors’	 statement,	 set	 out	 on	 page	 97	 in	 relation	 to	 going	 concern.	 We	 have	 nothing	
to	 report	 having	 performed	 our	 review.
Under	 ISAs	 (UK	 &	 Ireland)	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if	 we	 have	 anything	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	 attention	 to	 in	 relation	 to	 the	
directors’	 statement	 about	 whether	 they	 considered	 it	 appropriate	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 in	 preparing	 the	 financial	 statements.	
We	 have	 nothing	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	 attention	 to.
As	 noted	 in	 the	 directors’	 statement,	 the	 directors	 have	 concluded	 that	 it	 is	 appropriate	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 in	 preparing	 the	
financial	 statements.	 The	 going	 concern	 basis	 presumes	 that	 the	 Group	 and	 Company	 have	 adequate	 resources	 to	 remain	 in	 operation,	
and	 that	 the	 directors	 intend	 them	 to	 do	 so,	 for	 at	 least	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 the	 financial	 statements	 were	 signed.	 As	 part	 of	 our	 audit	
we	 have	 concluded	 that	 the	 directors’	 use	 of	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 is	 appropriate.	 However,	 because	 not	 all	 future	 events	 or	 conditions	
can	 be	 predicted,	 these	 statements	 are	 not	 a	 guarantee	 as	 to	 the	 Group	 and	 Company’s	 ability	 to	 continue	 as	 a	 going	 concern.

ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under	 ISAs	 (UK	 &	 Ireland)	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion:

	 − apparently	 materially	 incorrect	 based	 on,	 or	 materially	 inconsistent	 with,	 our	
knowledge	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 Company	 acquired	 in	 the	 course	 of	 performing	 our

We	 have	 no	 exceptions	 to	 report.
•	 the 	 statement	 given	 by	 the	 directors	 on	 page	 53,	 in	 accordance	 with	 provision	 C.1.1	 of	
the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 (the	 ‘Code’),	 that	 they	 consider	 the	 Annual	 Report

necessary	 for	 members	 to	 assess	 the	 Group	 and	 Company’s	 position	 and	 performance,	
business	 model	 and	 strategy,	 is	 materially	 inconsistent	 with	 our	 knowledge	 of	 the	
Group	 and	 Company	 acquired	 in	 the	 course	 of	 performing	 our	 audit.
We	 have	 no	 exceptions	 to	 report.
•	 the 	 section	 of	 the	 Annual	 Report	 on	 page	 57,	 as	 required	 by	 provision	 C.3.8	 of	 the	 Code,

The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
Under	 ISAs	 (UK	 &	 Ireland)	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if	 we	 have	 anything	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	 attention	 to	 in	 relation	 to:
•	 the 	 directors’	 confirmation	 on	 page	 35	 of	 the	 Annual	 Report,	 in	 accordance	 with	
provision	 C.2.1	 of	 the	 Code,	 that	 they	 have	 carried	 out	 a	 robust	 assessment	 of	 the	
principal	 risks	 facing	 the	 Group,	 including	 those	 that	 would	 threaten	 its	 business	
model,	 future	 performance,	 solvency	 or	 liquidity.
We	 have	 nothing	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	
attention	 to.
•	 the 	 disclosures	 in	 the	 Annual	 Report	 that	 describe	 those	 risks	 and	 explain	 how	 they	
are	 being	 managed	 or	 mitigated.
We	 have	 nothing	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	
attention	 to.
•	 the 	 directors’	 explanation	 on	 page	 55	 of	 the	 Annual	 Report,	 in	 accordance	 with	
provision	 C.2.2	 of	 the	 Code,	 as	 to	 how	 they	 have	 assessed	 the	 prospects	 of	 the	 Group,	
over	 what	 period	 they	 have	 done	 so	 and	 why	 they	 consider	 that	 period	 to	 be	
appropriate,	 and	 their	 statement	 as	 to	 whether	 they	 have	 a	 reasonable	 expectation	
that	 the	 Group	 will	 be	 able	 to	 continue	 in	 operation	 and	 meet	 its	 liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	
due	 over	 the	 period	 of	 their	 assessment,	 including	 any	 related	 disclosures	 drawing	
attention	 to	 any	 necessary	 qualifications	 or	 assumptions.
We	 have	 nothing	 material	 to	 add	 or	 to	 draw	
attention	 to.
Under	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 we	 are	 required	 to	 review	 the	 directors’	 statement	 that	 they	 have	 carried	 out	 a	 robust	 assessment	 of	 the	 principal	
risks	 facing	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 directors’	 statement	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 longer	 term	 viability	 of	 the	 Group.	 Our	 review	 was	 substantially	 less	
in	 scope	 than	 an	 audit	 and	 only	 consisted	 of	 making	 enquiries	 and	 considering	 the	 directors’	 process	 supporting	 their	 statements;	 checking	
that	 the	 statements	 are	 in	 alignment	 with	 the	 relevant	 provisions	 of	 the	 Code;	 and	 considering	 whether	 the	 statements	 are	 consistent	 with

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Statement	 of	 directors’	 responsibilities	 set	 out	 on	 page	 139,	 the	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 preparation	
of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 for	 being	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view.
Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 and	 express	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 ISAs	 (UK	 &	 Ireland).	
Those	 standards	 require	 us	 to	 comply	 with	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board’s	 Ethical	 Standards	 for	 Auditors.
This	 report,	 including	 the	 opinions,	 has	 been	 prepared	 for	 and	 only	 for	 the	 Company’s	 members	 as	 a	 body	 in	 accordance	 with	 Chapter	 3	 of	 Part	 16	
of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 We	 do	 not,	 in	 giving	 these	 opinions,	 accept	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 for	 any	 other	 purpose	 or	
to	 any	 other	 person	 to	 whom	 this	 report	 is	 shown	 or	 into	 whose	 hands	 it	 may	 come	 save	 where	 expressly	 agreed	 by	 our	 prior	 consent	 in	 writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An	 audit	 involves	 obtaining	 evidence	 about	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 sufficient	 to	 give	 reasonable	 assurance	
that	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 error.	 This	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of:
•	 whether 	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 Group’s	 and	 the	 Company’s	 circumstances	 and	 have	 been	 consistently	 applied	
and	 adequately	 disclosed;
•	 the 	 reasonableness	 of	 significant	 accounting	 estimates	 made	 by	 the	 directors;	 and
•	 the 	 overall	 presentation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements.
We	 primarily	 focus	 our	 work	 in	 these	 areas	 by	 assessing	 the	 directors’	 judgements	 against	 available	 evidence,	 forming	 our	 own	
judgements,	 and	 evaluating	 the	 disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.
We	 test	 and	 examine	 information,	 using	 sampling	 and	 other	 auditing	 techniques,	 to	 the	 extent	 we	 consider	 necessary	 to	 provide	 a	 reasonable	
basis	 for	 us	 to	 draw	 conclusions.	 We	 obtain	 audit	 evidence	 through	 testing	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 controls,	 substantive	 procedures	 or	 a	
combination	 of	 both.
In	 addition,	 we	 read	 all	 the	 financial	 and	 non-financial	 information	 in	 the	 Annual	 Report	 to	 identify	 material	 inconsistencies	 with	 the	
audited	 financial	 statements	 and	 to	 identify	 any	 information	 that	 is	 apparently	 materially	 incorrect	 based	 on,	 or	 materially	 inconsistent	
with,	 the	 knowledge	 acquired	 by	 us	 in	 the	 course	 of	 performing	 the	 audit.	 If	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	 material	 misstatements	
or	 inconsistencies	 we	 consider	 the	 implications	 for	 our	 report.	 With	 respect	 to	 the	 Strategic	 report	 and	 Directors'	 report,	 we	 consider	
whether	 those	 reports	 include	 the	 disclosures	 required	 by	 applicable	 legal	 requirements.

Analysis of ordinary shareholders
At	 31	 December	 2016	 the	 Company	 had	 4,587*	 (2015:	 5,225)	
registered	 shareholders	 who	 held	 335.6	 million	 (2015:	 335.2	 million)	
ordinary	 shares	 between	 them,	 analysed	 as	 follows:
Size of holding
Number of 
shareholders
% of issued
 share capital
0	 –	 10,000 3,964 1
10,001	 –	 100,000 380 4

4,587 100	
*		 The	 decrease	 in	 the	 number	 of	 registered	 shareholders	 during	
2016	 was	 principally	 due	 to	 a	 wealth	 manager	 consolidating	 the	
beneficial	 holdings	 of	 its	 clients	 and	 operating	 a	 reduced	 number	
of	 pooled	 accounts	 rather	 than	 a	 large	 number	 of	 individual	
segregated	 accounts.

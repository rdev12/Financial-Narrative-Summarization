HIGHLIGHTS
Equiniti provides 
the right support  
to give you a  
clear run
Having successfully completed the sale

the retained pension administration 
and software businesses transferred 
to One Equiniti - strengthening 
our market recognition as a leading 
business process services provider.
One Equiniti
The acquisition of Killik Employee 
Services - a market leading provider 
of employee and executive share 
plan administration, has expanded 
Equini t i ’ s 	 e m plo y e e 	 b e nefi t s 	 se r v ic es . 	
With share plans covering 61 countries,  
this acquisition strengthens  
Equiniti’s global offering.
Acquisition
Equiniti won the contract to provide 
services to support one of the 
h i ghe s t -pro file 	 IPO ’ s 	 t o 	 c ome 	 t o 	
market in recent years, the Royal Mail 
Group. Equiniti acted as receiving 
a g en t, 	 del iv ered 	 emp l o y ee 	 benefits, 	
managed the issue and allocation of 
shares, ran the associated dealing 
services and acts as the ongoing share 
registrar. Equiniti managed record 
volumes of investor queries and 
trades, including a 90% increase in 
call volumes and the sale of 14 million 
shares. The IPO culminated in the 
creation of a new FTSE 100 business 
with over 400,000 shareholders. It 
was a huge success and demonstrated 
Equiniti’s capabilities for complex and 
demanding projects.

brands and public sector organisations in the UK. In 2013 the Group delivered revenues 
of £274.7m up 3% and an EBITDA before exceptional items of £76.3m down 5.9% on the 
previous year as a result of a reduction of interest income and the impact of the Lloyds

leverage our expertise in providing complex administration solutions in regulated or highly controlled environment to FTSE 350

We have placed resources behind these growth plans and expect to make good progress over the medium term as we help clients 
respond to market and regulatory challenges. Our aim is to be the partner of choice in complex environments, creating lasting value for 
clients and improving service outcomes for end-users.
With continued market pressure to find efficiencies, 
companies and public sector institutions are increasingly 
looking for more effective solutions to non-core processes. 
Legislative changes are further increasing the administrative 
burden and complexity for organisations, particularly in the 
pensions, banking and financial services sectors.
We are focussed on unlocking the 
growth potential of the Group.
Building from a strong base, we have successfully expanded

The strong recurring contracted revenues which underpin our 
core operations have allowed us to invest in further service 
improvements, in new products and in value-added acquisitions. 
We will continue to actively extend our service range and market 
footprint organically and through strategic acquisitions. We also 
have a tight focus on cash conversion and on maintaining the 
quality of our recurring contract revenues.

Pancredit in March 2014 which strengthens our capabilities in loan 
servicing. Additionally, work is underway to identify and integrate 
businesses with complementary capabilities and it is anticipated 
that acquisitions will further support our underlying growth.
A business succeeds through the strength of its people and I offer

W o r k i n g	o n	a	p r o j e c t	a s	h i g h	p r o fi l e	
as this was very rewarding. When the 
p r o j e c t	s t a r t e d ,	a	l o t	o f	t h e	fi n e r	d e t a i l s	
needed to be established, including 
around the Employee Priority Offer and 
exactly how Royal Mail employees would 
be awarded 10% of the business in shares. 
So we had to work simultaneously on 
four different scenarios, until our client, 
the Government, chose to use the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP). Following this, I was 
the lead on the employee share plan 
dealing, so I worked closely with different 
Royal Mail work streams to coordinate 
the process. 
In addition to written communications, we 
participated in drop-in clinics over a three-
week period at 109 Royal Mail sites. To 
accommodate employees’ shift patterns, 
we worked with Royal Mail representatives 
to hold these clinics from early in the 
morning until late in the evening. In total 
we saw around 8,000 people.
This project went really well and we have 
had some great feedback from our client. 
This was the biggest IPO we have worked 
on in a very long time and the success of 
it is sure to open doors for us.
Claire Vaughan, Senior IT 
Project Manager 
The IT team was made up of a number 
of workstreams to deliver the systems 
supporting this project. It was vital that 
milestones were met in each area to 
provide an integrated system solution 
for each stage of the offer. This meant 
working closely with many internal 
and external workstreams, as well as 
multiple third-party suppliers to establish 
timelines, implement infrastructure, 
coordinate data exchanges and align 
delivery of various components.
We provided the marketing and 
application websites, which needed to 
cater to high volumes of users and surges 
in demand. As well as the websites that 
the public and Royal Mail employees 
used, there was also a great deal of work 
going on to provide back-end systems. 
We needed to deliver solutions to scan 
paper applications received and capture 
the PDF applications downloaded from 
the website. We also had to make sure 
our systems provided the functionality 
to reconcile the applications and online 
payments, apply the correct allocations

CASE STUDY: ROYAL MAIL GROUP
Equiniti did more than successfully handle 
the privatisation of Royal Mail. It also opened 
doors for the future.
STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2013 one of the most recognisable 
British brands – the Royal Mail Group – 
fl o a t e d .	I t	w a s	o n e	o f	t h e	h i g h e s t - p r o fi l e	
initial public offerings (IPO) to come to 
market in recent years and was supported 
by services from Equiniti. 
Equiniti was selected by Royal Mail 
Group and the Department for Business, 
Innovation & Skills, following a competitive 
tender process, to provide services 
above and beyond share registration in 
support of the IPO. These covered acting 
a s 	 r ec e i v ing 	 age nt , 	 e m plo y e e 	 b e nefi t s 	
including the allocation of free shares and 
the Employee Priority Offer, the issue 
and allocation of shares following the IPO, 
associated dealing services and ongoing 
share registration.
Drop-in clinics were 
held at 109 Royal  
Mail sites covering 
8,000 employees to 
support the Employee  
Priority Offer
Here are five different Equiniti perspectives on the project and 
what it meant for them to be involved.
Answered an additional 
140,000 calls in a single 
month – an increase 
of nearly 90% on the 
monthly call level
This was the biggest 
online share offer that 
we have ever done and 
great teamwork and 
dedication ensured  
its success.

Manager, Investment 
Services
On the back of the Royal Mail IPO, we 
provided a number of different share 
dealing services for shareholders, one of 
which was a new facility: an automated 
telephone instruction (ATI) channel. This 
service allowed shareholders to sell their 
shares by placing an instruction through 
an automated telephone service. 
Royal Mail were keen to offer 
shareholders a range of ways to place 
their share instructions. We responded 
with ATI, which as well as helping with 
the huge volume of calls we anticipated, 
was also designed to be easy to use, 
especially for people who had little 
experience in share dealing services. By 
the end of the task we had successfully 
processed over 56,000 sale instructions, 
selling over 14 million shares.
We are renowned for our customer 
service. To make sure that our service levels 
remained high, we reviewed our operational 
structure and took on additional resource 
to support us throughout this project. ATI 
also helped minimise the impact on business 
as usual activity. 
This was a really exciting project and 
there was a lot of thinking on your feet 
and responding quickly as the client’s 
requirements evolved. As a team, we 
w e r e 	 fl ex ible 	 a nd 	 ada pt a ble 	 a nd 	 I 	 w a s 	 v e r y 	
proud of how committed my team was.
Gavin Lane, Senior 
Manager, Corporate 
Actions
After 17 years of working within the 
Corporate Actions team, it was a 
fantastic opportunity to be responsible 
for the operational design and delivery of 
the Royal Mail IPO. Our team’s combined 
experience of delivering a number of 
l a r g e	c o r p o r a t e	e v e n t s	o v e r	t h e	p a s t	fi v e	
years meant that we had the expertise to 
successfully manage this project.
With no major online IPO precedence to 
assist with forecasting application volumes, 
we needed to take full advantage of our 
online capabilities to be operationally 
effective. Our dynamic web system resulted 
in thousands of online applications per 
sec ond 	 with 	 real- time 	 2 4 / 7 	 appl ication 	 dat a	
being available. We also applied scanning 
technology with character recognition 
software to record new shareholder 
registration details for all paper applications.
We welcomed a very strong team of 
individuals from a number of different 
areas of our business and around 130 
agency staff members joined us. This 
ensured we were adequately resourced 
to successfully deliver this task.
This IPO culminated in the creation of 
a new FTSE 100 share register. Being 
involved in such a large task and seeing the 
great partnerships formed was incredibly 
rewarding. The exceptional teamwork and 
our technology offering were what made 
this project such a great success.
A bright future lies ahead
Winning the Royal Mail IPO allowed 
Equiniti to demonstrate that it could 
handle a task on such a grand scale. Not 
only did it meet the demands of a high-
p r o fi l e	c l i e n t ,	b u t	E q u i n i t i	a l s o	s h ow e d	
that it could balance a very demanding 
project and still deliver the levels of 
service that its customers have come to 
expect. Teamwork, commitment and 
Equiniti’s expertise has resulted in the 
Royal Mail IPO being a huge success 
and will undoubtedly create further 
opportunities of this scale in the future.

Darren Charles, Contact 
Centre Manager
The Contact Centre was involved in the 
Royal Mail IPO process from tender right 
through to completion of the project. 
Given the size of the task, we didn’t have 
a point of reference in the marketplace 
when planning for potential call volumes. 
As a result we had to use the expertise 
we have at Equiniti to build models and 
work with our client, the Government, to 
make reasonable assumptions as to what 
the interest and call volumes would be 
f o l l ow i n g	t h e	fl o t a t i o n .
This task provided us with the 
opportunity to implement new ways of 
customer contact. Royal Mail were keen 
to have a web chat feature, which was 
implemented and staffed from 6am until 
11pm to accommodate Royal Mail staff’s 
working hours. We also created a social 
media presence via Twitter, open for 
eligible employees wanting information on 
the ESO (employee share offering) and 
fi e l d e d	v i t a l	e n q u i r i e s	v i a	t h i s	c h a n n e l .
Naturally, our call volumes increased 
sig ni fi c a nt ly . 	 W e 	 nor mally 	 ha ndle 	 1 6 0 , 0 0 0 	
calls a month, but when the IPO was 
in progress, we answered an additional 
140,000. Even so we still retained our 
excellent customer satisfaction rate of 93%. 
That was a tribute to the commitment of 
staff across the Contact Centre.

Growing efficiencies
Equiniti’s solutions addressed the need 
to update the rating software which was 
outdated, heavily customised and unable to 
meet requirements for regulatory reform. 
Our solution included assessment and 
collection software, a sophisticated accounts 
p ac k ag e, 	 wor k flow , 	 business 	 int el l i g enc e 	
software, security administration, disaster 
recovery and on-going technical and 
application support. As part of the system, 
Equiniti also provided a solution to help LPS 
deal with the task of tracing unpaid debtors.
Equiniti’s managed service includes the 
provision of 400,000 documents per 
annum with rate bills, reminders and 
enforcements printed through a  
secure facility.
Generating new revenues
As part of the project, LPS needed to 
trace a large number of records on its 
database for which it had incomplete or 
missing personal information. Equiniti 
v e r i fi e d	a n d	t r a c e d	8 4 . 5 %	o f	a c c o u n t s	
with outstanding debt, helping LPS to 
generate new rate demands to 27,478 
properties equating to £13.5 million in 
additional cash for them.
The project enabled LPS to meet its debt 
reduction targets.
A satisfied customer with 
a market leading service
This project brought together the 
capabilities from across the Group

managed services to deliver a fantastic

and cost savings.
Addressing legacy issues
As part of the contract, Equiniti took 
over the operation and administration 
o f	l e g a c y	D e fi n e d	C o n t r i b u t i o n	( D C )	
closed book pension schemes, upgrading 
the outmoded administration system to 
achieve operational resilience. This was in 
addition to providing continuous servicing 
a n d	s e t t l e m e n t	o f	b e n e fi t s	f o r	a r o u n d	
35,000 account holders.
The transition was achieved by ‘lifting 
and shifting’ the supporting systems from 
the legacy platform to Equiniti’s modern 
technology and by introducing a new, 
highly motivated team of administrators. 
Equiniti administers the portfolio of closed 
book pension schemes using experienced

Compendia platform, which provides the 
complete range of pensions administration, 
reporting and communication services to 
meet the needs of trustees, employers  
and members.
Equiniti has introduced a technically 
resilient system capable of supporting 
change in the future. The switch to a 
new, modern fund series has helped 
reduce operating costs and enhances 
member choice and engagement. 
This may lead to future business for 
Prudential as scheme members embark 
on their retirement journey. By providing 
great service during the accumulation 
period, Prudential will be viewed in a 
positive light by those members seeking 
to purchase an annuity.
Land and Property Services (LPS) collects rates on 785,000 
properties in Northern Ireland and collects cash totalling 
around £1 billion per annum. It also administers many benefits 
and reliefs. Equiniti provides rate collection and managed 
services to LPS.
Equiniti announced a 10 year renewal to its contract  
with Prudential for the administration of pension schemes. 
Prudential has a longstanding relationship with the Group  
and is a trusted partner. This partnership cultivates deeper 
commercial relationships and delivers greater value to  
both Prudential and Equiniti.

in 2012). This was driven by a good 
performance from Hazell Carr which 
responded to market requirements 
for specialist complaints handling and 
placed graduates into contract roles. 
Our international payments business, 
Paymaster International Payments 
grew its client base by 150%. Growing 
opportunities in the insurance market also 
contributed to new revenues.
EBITDA pre exceptional items was down 
to £22.2m (£24.6m in 2012) the result

operational costs.
Client retention remains strong with

to leading businesses, delivering solutions in share 
registration, employee benefits and investment services.
The Shareholder Solutions business 
delivered increased revenue to £118.0m 
(£115.8m in 2012). This was driven by 
higher share dealing activity and increased 
revenue from corporate actions in the 
latter part of the year which enabled the 
business to successfully offset the ongoing 
impact of lower interest rates.
EBITDA pre exceptional items was down

and amortisation and exceptional items. In 2013 EBITDA pre-
exceptional items was £76.3m, a decrease of £4.8m (5.9%) 
compared with the prior year (£81.1m). A step down in the 
interest rate hedges led to a reduction in income received which 
combined with a loss in revenue from a Lloyds TSB stock broking 
contract resulted in most of the decline. Additional costs were 
also incurred to increase service levels within Pension Solutions 
who also saw a decline in project revenue. These impacts were 
offset in part by an increase in corporate actions and share dealing 
transactions in Shareholder Solutions.

The Group focuses on improving working capital through 
automating the invoice generation and improving payment terms. 
Capital expenditure has increased since 2012 mainly due to an 
upgrade of the share dealing platform and investment in the Indian 
base to create a Centre of Excellence for IT development and 
offshore BPO capabilities.

The existing “payment in kind” facilities were extended until 2019 
with the interest accruing at the current rate of 9.5% over LIBOR 
until 2017, and then at 12.5% thereafter.

The Group complied with its covenants in respect of the old 
banking facilities during the year.
At the end of December 2013, net debt was £427.1m (2012: 
£476.2m). Leverage is a key performance indicator and on a

derivative which runs to October 2016 at 0.7%.

During 2013 the Group also put in place forward foreign 
exchange derivatives against 2014 expected project and 
operational exposures in India as a result of the establishment 
of its share service centre in Chennai. These derivatives are 
equivalent to £2.6m of spend in 2014.

Our people are at the heart 
of the quality of service  
and market innovations  
we deliver. 
OUR PEOPLE
Our people are central to our success. We share common values which underpin 
the focus on delivering excellent customer service and driving growth. Equiniti is 
a special place to work as demonstrated by high levels of employee retention and 
strong and increasing engagement scores. We continue to invest in training and 
personal development at all levels.
The approach to our people is to embed in a culture of “Customers Come First”. 
We have done this by ensuring that our people understand how important the 
services we provide are to the millions of people whose lives we touch.
The work we have done in recent years to ensure that our people are well 
supported, are able to develop, and understand the importance of their roles 
in the future success of our clients and Equiniti, means that we are proud of our 
people proposition.  And our people tell us they are proud too. 
• “I am proud to work at Equiniti because no day is ever the same. Each day I 
am presented with new challenges and situations, which really helps me to stay 
focused and interested.”
• “I am proud to work at Equiniti because the culture is great. The environment

• “I am proud to work at Equiniti because it’s a dynamic business founded on 
excellent relationships internally and with clients.”
• “I am proud to work at Equiniti because of the people I work with, they are 
hard-working and dedicated, and respect one another. It’s great working with a 
team of talented people who genuinely enjoy what they do.”
Acquisitions are important to developing the depth and breadth of Equiniti’s 
capabilities. As a result of the acquisition of Kililk in 2013, we were joined by 
over 50 new colleagues in a number of centres across the UK. These teams 
have been welcomed into our existing operations and support teams, enhancing 
expertise in key areas such as software development and executive share 
programmes.
We work hard to ensure that new teams understand Equiniti’s culture and 
approach to people, as well as looking closely at what we can learn from the 
culture of the businesses we have acquired. As we grow, our culture continues 
to evolve – with people at the heart of all we do.

VALUES
30  »  Equiniti Group annual report 2013 Equiniti Group annual report 2013  «  31 At Equiniti  we are continually developing our approach and 
framework for CSR. Equiniti is based on sound business ethics and 
ou r 	 C S R 	 a ppr oach 	 is 	 t he 	 s a me . 		 W e 	 d efi ne 	 ou r 	 r es ponsibili t ies 	
around four pillars, each supported by our business policies, and 
each one active in every area of our operation.
The four pillars are:
People 
Environment 
Charity 
Communities
The CSR Committee is chaired by Clancy Murphy, our People 
and Change Director. Clancy has been actively involved in both 
establishing and supporting all CSR activity at Equiniti for the

committee, with representation from across the Group in all 
pillars, there is a clear CSR agenda to ensure we maintain our 
focus as a business on this important activity. Our commitment 
to CSR is now a clear part of our culture, and we encourage all 
our people to act on our promises and build CSR activities into 
the day to day operations.
Environment
Equiniti recognises the importance of protecting the environment 
and the impact of commerce on environmental issues. It is an 
area which requires a sustainable and proactive strategy to 
ensure we protect the environment for future generations and

and avoidance of waste.
Equiniti continually assesses its premises needs and these have 
been optimised by a series of measures, including space planning,

review of run-times as part of our drive to reduce energy 
consumption, installation of energy saving control systems 
and a comprehensive planned maintenance programme on 
all of our plant and machinery. Space planning has enabled us 
to maximise the use of buildings across the portfolio and has

Equiniti is committed to being a responsible Group and 
is supportive of the communities in which it operates.  
We align our behaviour with the expectations and needs 
of our customers and investors, employees, suppliers, 
communities, regulators, special interest groups and 
society as a whole. A core part of our approach as a 
business is how we impact on the world and people 
around us – and the work of our CSR committee and 
champions is something we are passionate about.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Equiniti uses state of the art printers which duplex print and use 
environmentally friendly paper and toner. This has halved the 
quantity of paper used and further reduced our environmental 
impact. We recycle all toner cartridges. We also run a recycling 
programme and have implemented a policy of removing waste 
bins at each desk and installing recycling bins in our premises, 
helping to ensure that our people sort and recycle right across 
the business. Through the use of modern video conferencing 
technology, we have reduced the number of business miles 
travelled and thereby reduced our carbon footprint by an 
impressive 14.7% in 2013.

ABF The Soldiers Charity is a lifetime support to serving and 
retired soldiers and their families and Equiniti has raised over 
£45,000 for ABF during the three years we have supported 
them.  After a three year relationship as our national charity 
partner, we took the step of asking our people to vote for who 
they would like to support from 2014.  From 1 January 2014 we 
have chosen Winstons Wish as our national charity partner.
To support our culture of team working we have signed up to 
the UK Challenge. The UK Challenge is one of the UK’s leading

and physically”.  From 3-6 July we’ll be taking 18 volunteers to 
Snowdonia to compete against 67 other corporate teams. The 
Challenge combines physical adventure with strategic decision-
making and problem solving where Equiniti staff will learn new 
skills whilst developing new relationships with people from across 
the business, outside the usual workplace environment.  All money 
raised will go to our national charity partner Winstons Wish.
BBC Children in Need is a cause that is well recognised by our 
colleagues and clients. Its aim is to make a positive difference to 
children and young people, so that every child in the UK has a safe, 
happy and secure childhood and the chance to reach their potential. 
Thanks to our colleagues we are able to help make a difference 
to the lives of children across the UK and 2013 and saw Equiniti 
raise over £17,000.
As well as supporting national charity partnerships, our people also 
raise money for a wide range of organisations that have personal 
relevance to them or their communities. Efforts from staff include 
inte r nal 	 ev e nt s 	 such 	 a s 	 c a k e 	 s ales , 	 r a f fl es , 	 c om pe t i t ions , 	 s ponsor ed

raise over £15,000 for their local charities.
Community
We are active in supporting local community projects and 
initiatives, including supporting a number of local schools.
2013 saw management staff from Equiniti going to local schools 
to introduce profession and career choices to students and give 
t h e m	o p p o r t u n i t i e s	t o	r e fl e c t	o n	w h a t	t h e y	m i g h t	b e c o m e .
We are continually committed to working with young people  
to engage in business principles and functional expertise, with  
a focus on developing and investing in young talent, such as 
Young Enterprise.
We have provided work experience placements to a number 
of young people at our site in Worthing through our links with 
local schools and colleges, and have a growing apprenticeships 
programme across Equiniti, drawing on links with local colleges.
Working together on joint projects outside of work is a great 
way to encourage team working.  A number of teams across 
our locations have taken time out in 2013 to work together to 
provide practical support to local charities and support groups  
– with work ranging from painting to gardening.  These initiatives

We continue to invest both in our business and in our people to 
support a strong focus on sales growth. We anticipate the market’s

40  »  Equiniti Group annual report 2013 Equiniti Group annual report 2013  «  41 Risk management
Various aspects of the Equiniti Group’s activities are regulated 
directly or indirectly. As such, the Equiniti Group’s risk 
management systems are longstanding, standardised and 
robust. The Equiniti Group has a strong risk management 
framework where it utilises a “three lines of defence” model, 
namely: operational management’s application of systems and 
controls, the development and deployment of business conduct 
rules and regulatory policies, and the independent assessment 
of these two defences by the Equiniti Group’s independent 
Internal Audit and Compliance Monitoring functions. The 
b u s i n e s s 	 a s s e s s e s 	 i t s 	 r i s k 	 a n d 	 r i s k 	 p r o fi l e 	 u s i n g 	 a n 	 e n t e r p r i s e 	
wide risk management model which covers strategy, change, 
c u s t o m e r 	 t r e a t m e n t , 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 s o u n d n e s s , 	 m a r k e t 	 a n d 	 c r e d i t 	
exposure, legal and regulatory compliance, internal and external 
fraud exposure, change and operations. It is a combination 
of these risk assessments that support the formulation of the 
Equiniti Group’s risk assessment.
In addition, the Equiniti Group has a well established business 
continuity management (BCM) framework which determines 
how business critical each activity is to clients, customers, other 
external stakeholders and the Equiniti Group. Once assessed and 
independently challenged, each business unit is required to apply 
a range of business continuity tests which increase in line with the 
level of critical activity undertaken. The Equiniti Group actively 
tracks its compliance with its BCM testing programme. 
Financial risk management 
The Equiniti Group has established risk management policies 
and the Equiniti Group Audit Committee oversees how 
management monitors compliance. With these policies and 
procedures we review the adequacy of the risk management 
framework in relation to the risks faced by the Equiniti Group. 
T h e 	 C E O 	 a n d 	 C F O 	 f o r m 	 p a r t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G r o u p’s 	 fi r s t 	 l i n e 	 o f 	
defence and attend Audit Committee meetings in order to 
respond to relevant matters that arise. They are responsible 
for taking forward actions that are delegated to them by the 
Committee and the Compliance & Risk Director provides 
oversight on the closure of these actions. The Equiniti 
Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by 
Internal Audit and Compliance Monitoring functions. Internal 
Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures whilst Compliance 
Monitoring undertakes themed regulatory reviews the results 
of which are reported to the Group Audit Committee. 
The Equiniti Group’s operations expose it to a variety of 
fi n a n c i a l	r i s k s ,	i n c l u d i n g	c r e d i t	r i s k ,	l i q u i d i t y	r i s k	a n d	t h e	e f f e c t s

established a risk management programme that seeks to limit the

sterling cash and bank deposits, bank loan and overdrafts, other 
loans together with trade debtors and trade creditors that arise 
directly from its operations.
Cash flow interest rate risk  
The Equiniti Group is exposed to interest rate risk in three main

The Equiniti Group has strict controls around and regularly 
monitors the credit ratings of institutions with which it enters 
into transactions on its own behalf and for its clients. The Equiniti

fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the 
Equiniti Group’s receivables from customers. Losses have occurred 
infrequently over previous years. Due to the nature of the business 
the majority of the trade receivables are with FTSE 350 companies 
and public sector organisations. The amounts presented in the 
c on s o l i dat ed 	 s tat emen t 	 o f 	 fin an c i al 	 p o siti on 	 are 	 net 	 o f 	 al l owan c e s 	 f or 	
doubtful debts, estimated by management based on prior experience 
and an assessment of the current economic environment.
Foreign currency risk 
The Equiniti Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily 
arising from its IT business partnering arrangement. It is our 
p o l i c y	t o	h e d g e	a g a i n s t	m a t e r i a l	c u r r e n c y	fl u c t u a t i o n s	w h e r e	t h i s	
is felt to be advantageous.
Price risk 
Price risks are the changes in market prices such as interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates and equity dealing prices which impact the 
E q u i n i t i	G r o u p ’ s	i n c o m e	o r	t h e	v a l u e	o f	i t s	fi n a n c i a l	i n s t r u m e n t s .

hence foreign exchange movements do not have a material effect 
on the Equiniti Group’s performance. The Equiniti Group does 
not hold its own position in traded securities, being involved in 
receiving and transmitting transactions on behalf of its clients. 
The Equiniti Group earns income in relation to client and investor 
deposits as well as interest on its own deposits. The Equiniti 
Group’s senior debt and PIK loan rates are linked to Libor. 
The Equiniti Group is exposed to movements in the interest

Intermediary fee revenue is linked to bank base rate, whilst

The Equiniti Group continually reviews these risks and will

Capital risk management  
The Equiniti Group’s objectives when managing capital is to 
maximise shareholder value while safeguarding the Equiniti 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. We will continue 
to proactively manage our capital structure whilst maintaining 
fl e x i b i l i t y	t o	t a k e	a d v a n t a g e	o f	o p p o r t u n i t i e s	w h i c h	a r i s e	t o	
grow our business. One element of our strategy is to make 
targeted, value-enhancing acquisitions. The availability of suitable 
acquisitions, at acceptable prices is, however, unpredictable. 
In common with other private equity portfolio companies, the 
Equiniti Group carries a high level of net debt compared to 
equity. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the 
c o n s o l i d a t e d	s t a t e m e n t	o f	fi n a n c i a l	p o s i t i o n ,	p l u s	n e t	d e b t .	N e t

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Equiniti Group will not be able to

liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Equiniti Group’s three year business plan has been used

outcomes on cash availability and bank covenant test points. The 
Equiniti Group has a very high level of client retention giving a 
high degree of comfort on certainty of revenue income. 
The principal uncertainties which the Equiniti Group faces relate 
t o	c e r t a i n	r e v e n u e	a c t i v i t i e s	t h a t	a r e	m o r e	d i f fi c u l t	t o	p r e d i c t ,

During this period the Equiniti Group is not forecast to require 
drawing down the revolving credit facility and we expect to 
remain compliant with all covenants. As such, the Directors are 
s a t i s fi e d	t h a t	t h e	G r o u p	h a s	a d e q u a t e	r e s o u r c e s	t o	c o n t i n u e	i n	
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
the going concern basis has been adopted in the preparation of 
these accounts.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Legislative risks 
The Equiniti Group trades within regulated sectors of the UK 
economy and is required to comply with all relevant regulations, 
which it manages through ongoing regulatory assessment, robust 
s y s t e m s	a n d	c o n t r o l s ,	q u a l i fi e d	s t a f f	a n d	i n d e p e n d e n t	c o m p l i a n c e	
personnel. The Equiniti Group complies with its FCA ICAAP and 
CASS obligations.
Operational risks 
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or 
from external events arising from day-to-day operating activities. 
The Equiniti Group has put in place and tested mitigation plans 
to minimise the impact of these risks crystallising. It has invested 
in training and implemented processes and procedures to reduce 
the likelihood of occurrence. Coupled with this, the Equiniti 
Group maintains a comprehensive insurance programme tailored 
to the demands of the business.
Contractual arrangements 
The Equiniti Group has contractual arrangements with all of its 
c lie nt s . 	 T hese 	 c ont r ac t s 	 r a nge 	 b e t w e e n 	 one 	 a nd 	 fi v e 	 y ea r s , 	 a nd 	 a r e 	
essential to the business. However, the details of these contracts 
a r e 	 also 	 c om me r c ially 	 c onfid e nt ial , 	 a nd 	 c onse qu e nt ly 	 ha v e 	 no t 	
been reported in this review. The Equiniti Group continues to 
develop key supplier partnerships to support the long term aims 
of its customers and the business. The Equiniti Group’s policy is to 
establish trading arrangements which are made following an open 
non-discriminatory competitive bidding process.
Other risks and uncertainties 
The nature of the company’s services means that occasionally a 
claim for professional service shortcomings can arise which could 
result in compensation payable. To mitigate this risk the company 
maintains professional indemnity insurance, which is in place 
across the Equiniti Group.

policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.  
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly 
a t t r i b u t a b l e 	 t o 	 t h e 	 a c q u i s i t i o n . 	 I d e n t i fi a b l e 	 a s s e t s 	 a c q u i r e d 	 a n d 	 l i a b i l i t i e s 	 a n d 	 co n t i n g e n t 	 l i a b i l i t i e s 	 a s s u m e d 	 i n 	 a 	 b u s i n e s s 	 co m b i n a t i o n 	 a r e 	
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of 
a c q u i s i t i o n 	 o v e r 	 t h e 	 f a i r 	 v a l u e 	 of 	 t h e 	 g r o u p’ s 	 s h a r e 	 of 	 t h e 	 i d e n t i fi a b l e 	 n e t 	 a s s e t s 	 a c q u i r e d 	 i s 	 r e co r d e d 	 a s 	 g o o d w i l l . 	 I f 	 t h e 	 co s t 	 of 	 a c q u i s i t i o n 	 i s 	
less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provisions for impairment.  
Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  For items acquired as part of 
a business combination, cost comprises the deemed fair value of those items at the date of acquisition.  Depreciation on those items is 
charged over their estimated remaining useful lives from that date.
 Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
■ Leasehold improvements 2 – 50 years

statement of comprehensive income. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs 
are expensed.
 Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the

regardless of whether those rights are separable.
 Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of 
impairment testing and is not amortised. It is tested annually for impairment.
 Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

■ the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
 Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
 Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
■ Shareholder registration system 15 years
■ Other software 3 – 10 years
■ Customer relationships 4 – 20 years
■ Order book 1 year
■ Brand 5 - 10  years

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and

bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement

Share-based payment transactions
 The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The 
liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel 
expense in statement of comprehensive income.

 Dilapidations provisions relate to estimated cost to put leased premises back to required condition expected under the terms of the lease. 
These include provisions for wear and tear along with provisions where leasehold improvements have been made that would require 
reinstatement back to original status on exit. These are uncertain in timing as leases may be terminated early or extended. To the extent 
that exits of premises are expected within 12 months of the end of the year they are shown as current.

 Periodic administration fees are recognised evenly over the contract period.  Transaction based fees are recognised at the time of processing 
the related transactions. Revenues from corporate actions are recognised in line with the stage of completion and fees in relation to 
administration of client funds are recognised as they accrue.
Revenues includes variable margin fee income earned on funds under administration of the Group.
 Out of pocket expenses recharged to clients are recognised in revenue when they are recoverable from the client, net of the related expense.

capitalisation and amortisation over the useful life of the asset.
Expenses
Operating lease payments
 Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease expense.

 Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the date the entity’s right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
 Tax on the loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
 Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the

in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full 
impact. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board.
 There are no other IFRSs or IFRS - IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Accounting estimates and judgements
Cash-settled share based payments
 Measured as the higher of amount subscribed plus the attributable share or the fair value of the business on an exit event, over the 
expected vesting period. The valuation at the date of grant and the probability of an exit event are therefore key judgements.
 The value is based on an estimate of a multiple of adjusted EBITDA, based on an equivalent market value for a “debt free” private company. 
Fair values of intangible assets
 Fair values of intangibles have been calculated by estimating the net present value of future revenues generated by the assets over their 
estimated useful lives.
 Third party valuations are used to fair value the Group’s derivatives. The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Provisions
 Dilapidations provisions have been made for properties which the Group currently lease based upon the cost to make good the property 
in accordance with lease terms where applicable, if we were to vacate at 31 December 2013 as assessed by a chartered surveyor with 
reference to current market rates. 
 The constructive compliance provision is management’s best estimate of the cost of meeting the change in requirement of payment systems of 
which the Group is contractually required. The exact requirements are uncertain as to the timing and so could require additional or less cost.
 Provisions for deferred consideration has been made in relation to acquisitions the Group has made. There are various criteria that need to

- credit risk
- liquidity risk
- market risk
 Risk management policies are established for the Equiniti Group Limited group of companies (the “Group”) and the Group Audit 
Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with these policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk 
management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by 
Internal Audit and Compliance Monitoring. Internal Audit and Compliance Monitoring undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Group Audit Committee.

 Due to the nature of the business the majority of the trade receivables are with large institutions, including many FTSE 350 companies and 
losses have occurred infrequently over previous years.

Impairment testing    
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions of the Lloyds TSB Registrars business, Prosearch Asset Solutions Limited, David Venus & Company 
Limited, ICS Computing Limited, 360 Clinical Limited,  Peter Evans Limited, Peter Evans & Associates Limited, Prism Communication & 
Management Limited and NatWest Stockbrokers in prior years.  For goodwill on the acquisition of Killik Employee Share Services and Killik 
& CO LLP, see note 4. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, the recoverable amount of cash-generating units for the above periods

15 Intangible assets (continued)
     
 The outcome of the impairment assessment has been that the directors do not consider that the goodwill has been impaired, given that the 
fair value less costs to sell is greater than the carrying value of goodwill.

 In the opinion of the Directors there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions which would cause the carrying value to exceed

 The units will only vest on the occurrence of a return of capital to the entire business and the value of each unit will be determined in 
relation to the value of the ordinary shares and preference shares at that time. The proportion of ordinary shares and preference shares is 
5% and 95% respectively.  Unpaid dividends on preference shares accrue at 8% per annum and compounded annually.  
 
 A unit shall lapse on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the scheme, an exit, the cessation of a persons employment, a participants 
bankruptcy or on notice of a voluntary winding up of the Company. Unless there has been an occurrence of a return of capital and the value 
of a unit has been determined to have increased, the repayment will be the grant price.

 To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on 
risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the 
portfolio is invested and the expectations of future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted 
based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. This resulted in 
the selection of a 5.87% assumption for the overall expected rate of return on assets.

There were no transfers between Levels during the year.   
 
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values   
 
Level 2 hedging derivatives comprise solely interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in 
circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.

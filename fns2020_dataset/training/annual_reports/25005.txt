Group Profile
ICAP is an interdealer broker in the over-the-counter (OTC)
markets for derivatives, fixed income securities, money
market products, foreign exchange, energy, credit and
equity derivatives.
The strong growth exhibited in the
credit and the interest rate markets
clearly underscores the benefits
these markets provide as financial
risk management tools. The credit
default swap market, for example,
has been effective at redistributing
risk away from the banking system to
other institutions such as insurance
companies and pension funds,
facilitating a transfer of credit risk out
of the banking system.
There are two types of derivative
markets, which operate in parallel:
the OTC market and the exchange-
traded futures market. Significant
trading opportunities exist between
these closely related markets.
Global markets
With over 3,000 staff, ICAP has a
strong presence in each of the three
major financial markets, London, New
York and Tokyo, together with a local
presence in 20 other financial centres.
complements voice broking and in
most markets combines voice and/or
electronic access to a common pool
of liquidity. This combined solution
provides customers with both voice
support and electronic execution.
The wholesale financial markets 
ICAP is an interdealer broker in 
the OTC markets for derivatives, 
fixed income securities, money
market products, foreign exchange,
energy, credit and equity derivatives.
These markets are used by financial
institutions and others to manage
their exposure to risk, including
credit, interest rate and exchange
rate risks, and they have grown
significantly in recent years driven by:
•
volatility in medium term interest
rates;
•
increased allocation of capital for
trading and position taking by the
banks and hedge funds;
•
demand for significant deficit
financing in many of the 
G7 countries;
•
increased issuance in the
corporate bond and mortgage
backed securities markets;
•
shifts in foreign exchange rates;
and
•
changes in the demand for
commodities such as oil, coal 
and gas.
The role of the interdealer broker 
ICAP provides a specialist
intermediary broking service to
commercial banks and investment
banks in the wholesale financial
markets. An interdealer broker works
in these markets to draw together
liquidity and to match buyers and
sellers so that deals can be executed
at best prices by its banking
customers.
Banks pay a commission when they
use a broker to complete a deal.
ICAP offers banks significant
economies of scale in price discovery
by having a number of staff covering
each product and is in constant
contact with a range of counterparties.
Access to a broker therefore allows 
a bank to increase market coverage
in busy times without incurring
additional overheads. In many
markets ICAP operates as an agent
or matched principal broker providing
banks with the opportunity to deal
anonymously through a neutral party
at the most attractive price available.
There is growing demand for
electronic broking of liquid products,
which is complementary to voice
broking of more bespoke, less liquid
products. The majority of the markets
in which ICAP operates rely on, and
will continue to rely on, voice broking
skills. Electronic broking naturally Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 1

Profit before tax on a statutory basis
was £193.0 million, an increase of
£26.2 million. 
These results are the first full-year
results we have produced in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are
fully described in the Operating and
Financial Review (OFR). While the
format of the presentation of the
IFRS Financial Statements may be
unfamiliar, the changes in
presentation have no impact on the
cash and economic performance of
the business or its strategic
direction.
It is with great pleasure that we
present the 2006 annual results. 
The Group continues to deliver 
strong growth in earnings, has made
significant progress in executing its
strategy, possesses a very strong
management team and has extended
further its market leading position. 
The Group’s profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items was 
£204.3 million for the year to 
31 March 2006 compared with
£176.7 million for the previous year.
Net assets at 31 March 2006 were
£619.8 million, up £99.8 million.

Chairman’s Statement Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 5
David Gelber will be completing 
his year as a non-executive director
at the Annual General Meeting. 
We have continued to benefit from his
knowledge and broad experience of
the business since he retired from
his role as Group Chief Operating
Officer a year ago. He has made a
tremendous contribution to the
business that is now ICAP, having
been involved with the Intercapital
business since 1994. He became the
Chief Operating Officer of Intercapital
plc, following the Exco/Intercapital
merger in 1999. He will continue to
work as a consultant with the Group.
Our Group Finance Director, Jim
Pettigrew, has decided, after seven
years in this role, to pursue his
career outside ICAP. His commitment
to ICAP’s success has been
outstanding and I am sure that his
move to a new challenge will be
equally successful. He will leave the
Group on 2 June 2006.
The board has agreed to appoint
Matthew Lester as Group Finance
Director after a full and thorough
search process. We hope he will be
available to join the Group within six
months. Mark Yallop, ICAP’s Chief
Operating Officer, will take over the
Group Finance Director’s
responsibilities until Matthew Lester
is available to take up his position.
We believe the key to long-term value
is growth: growth in customer
revenue; growth in earnings; this 
will allow us to generate superior
returns on capital for our shareholders.
Our current results and the
acquisition of EBS will provide us
with a solid base for future growth. 
To succeed, we need to constantly
adapt to changing markets.
The Group’s lead regulator, the UK
Financial Services Authority (FSA), will
implement the EU Capital
Requirements Directive (CRD) on 
1 January 2007. The CRD will create
a modern capital framework for
companies across the EU. After
extensive discussions with the FSA
we believe that, following some
changes to two of our smaller
businesses, ICAP will comply with the
requirements of the new directive.
ICAP continues to be a highly cash
generative business which has
allowed us to invest in the
development of the business and has
enabled the Group to maintain a
progressive approach to the dividend
paid to shareholders: the directors
recommend a final dividend of 7.5p
per share to be paid on 25 August
2006 to shareholders on the register
on 28 July 2006 making a total
dividend of 10.0p per share for the
year. We announced in May 2005
that, in the normal course of events,
future interim dividends will be
calculated at 30% of the previous
year’s full-year dividend.
All businesses are expected to take
their social responsibilities seriously;
some do so as a part of their
operations, others actively seek ways
to give something back to society.
Our Charity Day has been a part of
ICAP’s culture for 13 years, raising 
an incredible global total of 
£5.2 million in December 2005 (up
from £4.2 million the previous year)
as a result of the outstanding
support of our staff and customers.
This is a wonderful achievement and
over 70 charities have benefited 
from the money raised in our offices
around the world. Since Charity Day
began, the total raised by ICAP staff
and customers is over £26 million.
These results reflect a strongly
performing business. It wasn’t easy,
given the challenges and the stiff
competition we face in the market. 
It was achieved with contributions
from every segment of the business
and was the result of dedicated
teamwork at every level in the
business. For that I thank every single
member of staff, the management
team and my fellow directors.

ensure ongoing growth of our voice
business. We believe strongly that
our voice broking activities have
material room for further expansion.
We have had a consistent strategy
for several years which can be
summarised as:
•
providing customers with more
efficient electronic trade execution,
reduced integration costs, improved
post-trade feeds and liquidity
across a wide product range; 
•
maintaining close long-term
relationships with our customers;
•
developing the business through
the combination of people and
technology; 
•
extending product and service
innovation; and
•
growing our voice and electronic
businesses, both organically and
by selective acquisition.
A key component of the execution of
our strategy is the milestone
agreement we reached in April 2006
to acquire EBS for US$517 million
and 36.1 million new ICAP shares.
This company enjoys a leading 
global position in electronic spot
foreign exchange with a very broad
customer base, excellent technology
and average transaction volumes of
over US$145 billion per day. 
In addition, we will benefit from
EBS’s well qualified and 
experienced management and staff.
The acquisition of EBS is expected 
to be completed by 5 June 2006.
This acquisition will more than double
ICAP’s annual electronic broking
revenue to more than US$375 million
per year and will raise ICAP’s
estimated overall commission market
share from 28% to approximately
32%. The proportion of Group profits
from electronic broking is estimated
to rise to 33%.
ICAP’s strategic goals remain
constant and very clear: to be the
leading global intermediary in the
wholesale OTC markets by a clear
margin with at least a 35% share of
overall market revenue and with 50%
of our profit derived from electronic
broking. As the more commoditised
products migrate to electronic broking
we aim to develop the leading global
franchise in structured and exotic
products, energy, credit, equity
derivatives and less liquid markets to

Information Officer. A dedicated
project management office will
oversee the process of integration,
reporting to Steve McDermott,
Executive Director, ICAP plc. 
ICAP operates as a global business
in markets that are truly global. 
Our vision is to create the global
exchange for OTC financial 
products and to build a global brand
in wholesale financial services. 
We believe that we can best provide
the service our customers need by
combining the strengths of our
people together with technology –
and that by doing so we set the
standard for our industry.
Looking ahead, in the short term we
have to complete the integration of
EBS, to extend further our electronic
broking business into an increasing
number of markets with highly liquid,
commoditised products and to extend
our voice broking business into more
structured products. Activity in our
markets is driven by the volatility
generated from a broad range of
influences, over which we have no
control. We aim to achieve secular
growth from increasing market share 
and expanding product coverage. 
Our operating profit margin growth
depends on our cost control and our
ability to extract the scale economies
that make these businesses so
sustainable. I am pleased to say the
firm has never been in such good
shape and with so many opportunities.
Michael Spencer
Group Chief Executive Officer
We plan to combine EBS’s strengths
in electronic spot foreign exchange
with ICAP’s other electronic broking
businesses and create a global 
multi-product platform with further
major growth potential and significant
economies of scale through combining
and leveraging technology networks
and platforms. The combined global
network will cover more than 1,500
customer installations in 45 countries
plus a further 470 users that have
secure internet access.
In parallel with the continuing
development of our voice broking
business and the development of
new markets, this acquisition takes
us further towards our goal of offering
comprehensive electronic execution
and post-trade services for liquid,
commoditised markets. It moves
ICAP a step closer to offering full
multi-asset electronic trading with
liquidity in foreign exchange, cash
bonds and repo, as well as derivatives
in many currencies. In future we want
to provide the ability to cross trade
spreads and products and take
market efficiency to a new level. 
We hope to make it possible soon 
to trade in a 10-year government
bond in a local currency and then,
through a chain of other linked 
deals, produce a hedged transaction
in an interest rate derivative in a
different currency.
As a part of the integration of EBS 
we are reorganising our reporting
structure so that ICAP’s electronic
broking operations will be integrated
in a single, new, global electronic
division. This division will be run by
Jack Jeffery, CEO of EBS and David
Rutter, CEO of ICAP Electronic Broking
North America, will be deputy CEO.

Financial highlights
•
Overall Group revenue rose by 
13% from £812.7 million to
£919.2 million, with electronic
broking revenue increasing 
by 17%. 
•
The Group continues to exercise
tight control over its cost base.
Excluding broker bonuses,
underlying cost growth (at constant
exchange rates, excluding impact of
acquisitions) was restricted to 4%. 
•
The Group’s operating profit*
margin remained at 21% reflecting
the Group’s continuing investment in
people and technology, particularly
the upgrade of the Group’s
electronic broking platform. The
Group’s electronic broking margin
now exceeds 30% for the first time.
•
Profit, EPS and dividend all
advanced in the year.
•
The Group remains highly cash
generative with a strong 
balance sheet.
Results
The Group reported profit of 
£204.3 million before taxation,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items; this
represents a 16% increase over 
the prior year. On a statutory basis
profit before taxation was £193.0
million for the year ended 31 March
2006 (2004/05 – £166.8 million).
We continue to believe that profit
before taxation, amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising 
on consolidation and exceptional
items better reflects the Group’s
underlying year-on-year performance.
This measure is reconciled to profit
before taxation on the face of the
consolidated income statement. 
Business drivers 
ICAP is a growth business in a
growing market. Many factors
continue to support this growth
including:
•
macro-economic imbalances in
currencies, interest rate and credit
markets leading to continuing price
volatility and the basis for further
growth in interest rate and credit
derivatives, FX, energy and listed
futures markets;
•
the search for yield among global
investors underpinning the growth
in structured credit and equity
products and reinforcing the
attractions of efficient (electronic)
execution;
•
commoditisation of “flow” markets
and the increasing focus on
electronic trading and increasing
commitment of capital to
proprietary and algorithmic trading
strategies by dealers and their
customers;
•
rapid growth in equity derivatives
driven by rising stock markets and
the search for yield;
•
continuing liberalisation of
emerging markets and the growth
in onshore and local currency fixed
income, derivatives and credit
markets; and
•
increasing regulatory and
prudential pressure for best
execution and price transparency,
which favour electronic trading
venues.
Historically, the underlying interdealer
broking market has grown at rates of
3–5% per annum. With the positive
impact of the factors noted above as
well as the continuing very high
levels of innovation and product
development occurring in the
wholesale financial markets today, we
believe that (notwithstanding
commission compression) somewhat
higher growth rates should be seen in
the next 12–24 months. 
The principal areas in which we
expect to see faster growth are FX,
energy, credit derivatives, equity
derivatives and financing, emerging
markets and structured products
generally.
In addition to the factors noted
above, the growth of electronic
broking in the more liquid and
commoditised markets itself feeds
additional growth through: 
•
driving lower transaction costs
which increase trading volumes by
encouraging the development of
algorithmic and other highly price
sensitive trading strategies;
•
concentrating volumes among
fewer, electronic, venues;
•
enabling lower post-trade
transaction costs through
automated confirmation and
straight-through-processing (STP),
thereby increasing customer
efficiency and attracting extra
marginal volumes.

Impact of EBS
The acquisition of EBS will more 
than double ICAP’s annual electronic
broking revenue. In 2005, EBS’s
revenue was £114 million (up 10%
on 2004) and operating profit before
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation was £20 million. 
At 31 December 2005, the gross
assets of EBS were £128 million 
(net assets – £83 million) including
cash of £32 million. EBS has budgeted
for revenue in 2006 to increase 
by 10% to £132 million and operating
profit to increase by 54% to 
£33 million. During the first three
months of 2006, EBS’s operating profit
was significantly ahead of budget.
EBS’s market is driven by continuing
global macro-economic imbalances,
the liberalisation of emerging
markets and increasing proprietary
risk taking at banks. Its growth is
helped by the expansion of prime
broking and algorithmic trading
engines and the growth of leveraged
investors/hedge funds.
Further expansion of the EBS
platform is expected to come from the
development of the algorithmic trading
business. The addition to the platform
of non-deliverable FX and the merger
of the EBS and ICAP’s iForwards
platforms will continue to move ICAP’s
forward FX business electronic.
We have demonstrated in our previous
mergers and acquisitions that there
are significant economies of scale
available by effectively combining
those businesses. We expect that
the combination of EBS with ICAP’s
electronic broking businesses will
generate annual cost synergies of at
least £19 million which can be
achieved by 2008/09. These
synergies include network
infrastructure, IT and property costs.
To achieve these synergies, ICAP
expects to incur exceptional costs of
£14 million in the first two years
following the acquisition. The margin
from EBS’s business, combined with
the additional cost synergies, will
increase ICAP’s overall margin.

Using technology to increase 
trading efficiency
ICAP uses a number of different
technology platforms to deliver
electronic broking to the different
markets we serve. We continue to
invest so that in the future the
majority of ICAP’s services, apart
from a few very illiquid or structured
products, are available electronically
as well as through voice brokers. 
To reduce support costs we are
migrating from some of our existing
platforms to newer, more efficient
technologies. In addition, we are
building a sophisticated capability 
to provide access across these
platforms so that we can satisfy
future customer demands for 
cross-market trading.
The main benefits offered to our
customers by electronic broking are
lower costs, increased speed and
ease of execution. However, the
positive impact on a bank’s costs 
is not only limited to the execution 
of trades, but more importantly to
the potential cost savings in the
middle and back office functions. 
The majority of the costs and
inefficiencies in the OTC market
usually occur post trade, where
transactions need to be manually
confirmed and input into the banks’
systems for both settlement of the
trade and position management.
For ICAP a fundamental business
requirement is the integration of our
networks and systems with those of
our customers’ post-trade systems.
Establishing these links can be
difficult and slow, involving the banks
in investing time and money to
complete this integration, but once
established they provide a significant
competitive advantage. 
Electronic broking, together with 
post-trade feeds, provides STP, which
allows the trade to be confirmed,
cleared (where the market has
clearing) and settled upon the
execution of the trade. Voice-brokered
trades are also confirmed
electronically through the same
process. This streamlined process
reduces costs significantly, but also
enables many more trades to be
executed and processed within a day,
thereby increasing the velocity of
trading in these markets.
Geographic analysis
ICAP’s businesses are broadly
distributed with 23 offices worldwide;
with Europe and the Americas the
two largest regions.
The Americas
The Americas were the most profitable
region in 2005/06 with an operating
profit* of £103.9 million (2004/05
£88.2 million) and revenue of
£428.2 million resulting in an
operating profit* margin of 24.3%. 
Voice broking, electronic broking and
information sales were all significant
contributors to the profitability of this
business. Overall activity in securities
was unchanged on the previous year
as flat yield curves and tight credit
spread subdued revenues and
reduced overall profitability in
securities broking. In contrast,
mortgage backed securities and
credit derivatives grew significantly.
Increased activity in the energy
markets, plus the acquisition of
United Fuels, resulted in a significant
improvement in revenue and
operating profit*. Our emerging
markets business in Latin American
products has expanded strongly this
year and we are working to extend
our activities further.
Europe
Revenue in Europe increased by 
11% to £394.9 million, generating
operating profit* of £85.3 million
(2004/05 – £76.4 million). Most
markets performed in line with the
previous year. There was continuing
growth in the credit derivatives
market although demand for bonds in
the credit markets was discouraged
by tight credit spreads. Overall there
was more activity in the sterling
markets. The emerging markets
business had a good year,
particularly in eastern Europe foreign
exchange. In the energy markets we
saw strong growth across oil,
electricity, coal and gas.
Asia Pacific
Following the turmoil last year when
there were significant staff movements
between brokers as competitors
attempted to establish themselves 
in the region, a very competitive
environment has emerged. 
Operating profit* fell in the year to
31 March 2006 to £7.1 million
(2004/05 – £9.4 million) on revenue
of £96.1 million. During the year we
strengthened the business with newly
recruited staff. In Australia we
acquired an interest rate swaps team
by agreement with a competitor. 
The team has proved to be very
successful.

Business performance
ICAP segments its Group revenue
and operating profit* into five
divisions: electronic broking,
derivatives and money broking,
securities broking, energy broking
and information services. 
Electronic broking
ICAP’s voice and electronic broking
businesses operate as two strong
parallel businesses. ICAP is the
leading electronic interdealer broker
in the fixed income markets. 
By combining with EBS in foreign
exchange, ICAP will be the largest
global electronic broker in liquid,
commoditised OTC markets providing
customers with the broadest product
range, the widest electronic footprint
and strong post-trade support. 
There was a 17% increase in revenue
in electronic broking to £98.3 million
in 2005/06. The operating profit*
margin improved to 30% from 28% 
in the previous year, despite the
additional costs of running two
platforms in parallel in the second
half of the financial year as we
migrate to our new electronic broking
platform. This demonstrates the
substantial operational leverage in
these businesses. 
Despite flatter and at times inverted
yield curves, issuance to fund rising
deficits and the growth of “black-box”
automated trading systems
maintained volumes in the
government bond markets. Overall
average daily US Treasury volume
was $561 billion per day in the first
quarter of 2006, virtually unchanged
from the same period in the previous
year. Electronic volumes in the US
Treasury products on the BrokerTec
platform increased by 23% over 
the previous year, to an average of
US$126 billion per day. We estimate 
that our average combined voice and
electronic market share overall in 
US Treasury products continued to
exceed 58% during the same period.
ICAP is also firmly established as
market leader in the European and
US$ repo markets. Average electronic
broking volumes in the last quarter of
2005/06 had increased by 18% to
reach US$211 billion per day in
Europe. In the US$ repo market
overall volumes were down 7%,
ICAP’s electronic volumes were down
just 1% at US$180 billion per day. 
We continue to make some progress
in accessing the Italian government
bond markets following the
agreement with Monte Titoli S.p.A. to
give ICAP Electronic Broking direct
access to their systems for the
clearing and settlement of Italian
government bonds and repo. We
have recently gained access to both
the central counterparties (Cassa di
Compensazione e Garanzia and 
LCH-Clearnet). To complete the
process we are hopeful that the
Dipartimento del Tesoro may revise
the current primary dealer assessment
process and give equal weight to
volumes traded on any platform. 
Investment in our technology platforms
continues. Migrating the BrokerTec
platform to new technology is underway
and will incur additional costs in the
short term but will deliver lower costs
and greater scalability in the longer
term. To prepare for the longer-term
potential of cross-market trading we
are continuing to invest in i-Connect
which will interconnect several broking
platforms and customer interfaces.
As a part of the integration of EBS
with our electronic broking business
we are significantly reorganising our
reporting structure so that all ICAP’s
electronic broking operations (with
some small exceptions) will be
integrated in a single, new, global
electronic division. 
ICAP’s electronic broking footprint 
is already much more extensive 
than any other broker and currently
includes active and off-the-run 
US Treasuries, bills, notes, bonds,
strips, TIPS and basis trading as 
well as agencies and mortgages;
European, UK, Australian, Japanese
and South African government 
bonds; US$ and euro repurchase
agreements; Eurobonds and credit
derivatives; EONIAS and forward
foreign exchange. Electronic broking
of credit default swaps and indices in
London has established a good
market position; customers have
access to bonds and credit repo on
the same display. In the Americas,
mortgage backed securities have
established liquidity and electronic
volumes are growing. Credit default
indices have recently been launched.
On the other platforms:
•
i-Forwards – ICAP’s electronic
broking system for forward foreign
exchange is now being used by 
71 banks in Europe, the US 
and Asia;
•
i-Swap – since we launched
electronic broking in euro interest
rate swaps has been disappointing
as our customers focus on
automating their customer facing
systems. We believe that the banks
will turn their attention to electronic
broking in the interdealer market
once their customer systems are
completed. The lengthy process of
installation and integration has 
15 banks live for trading medium
term euro interest rate swaps and a
further four in process. For trading
in euro overnight indexed swaps, 
33 banks are live on the platform.

Derivatives and money broking
Although yield curves have flattened,
interest rate markets have remained
reasonably active and revenue has
shown steady improvement. The
Group’s broad market coverage of
the emerging markets meant that we
benefited from increased flows and
volatility, particularly in Latin
American derivatives and foreign
exchange. As a result, ICAP’s
revenue in derivatives and money
markets grew from £328.4 million 
to £368.6 million, increasing
operating profit* to £83.4 million
(2004/05 – £75.7 million). 
Securities broking 
The overall effect of changes in
market activity was increased
revenue of £350.5 million, up 8%,
generating operating profit* of 
£54.0 million (2004/05 – 
£52.0 million). Credit default
derivatives continued to grow and 
the introduction of trading in credit
default indices spurred electronic
broking in this market. 
In the past year we continued to
broaden ICAP’s futures business and
are now clearing members of
Euronext, Liffe, Eurex, Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board
of Trade, NYMEX and the
International Petroleum Exchange. 
An agency clearing agreement allows
ICAP to clear on all other principal
exchanges. The global clearing
platform is based on the London hub
allowing ICAP to offer a highly
competitive service. The execution
business has been similarly
expanded and integrated with desks
in New York and Sydney added to
London. ICAP now offers its clients
access to all electronic exchanges 
in the three time zones via a 
single platform. 
The OTC equity derivatives markets
have grown significantly and we have
benefited from this increased activity.
We believe that there are significant
opportunities to grow further in this
highly fragmented market.
Energy broking
Our energy businesses have
experienced a substantial increase in
activity, particularly in the oil markets
and ICAP Energy’s revenue rose to
£75.9 million from £50.9 million in
2004/05. Operating profit* rose by
101% to £15.1 million. In early
October we completed the acquisition
of the majority of the assets of
United Fuels. United Fuels has a
strong presence in US oil, oil related
markets, emissions and coal which is
a great addition to our core strength
in US power and gas. It has
continued to be an excellent fit with
ICAP’s leading position in the energy
markets in Europe and Asia
particularly the London and 
Singapore based businesses in oil
and refined products.
For the second year running ICAP
Energy was named Broker of the Year
by Energy RISK magazine in a poll of
market participants.
Information services
ICAP produces a broad array of
prices and information covering most
OTC financial markets. As markets
move to electronic broking there is
increased concentration of market
share and information from these
markets becomes more valuable.
ICAP distributes its information
mainly through professional data
vendors including Reuters, Bloomberg,
Telerate and Thomson. In the highly
competitive environment among
these data vendors, the market for
financial information remains tight. 
However, several multi-year contracts
with these vendors have been agreed
this year. Revenue increased slightly
to £25.9 million in 2005/06 and
operating profit* was £14.2 million. 
A key resource – our staff
• ICAP has more than 3,000 staff
worldwide, with more than 1,900
broking staff, including trainees.
• 2,300 of our staff are
concentrated in New York
• More than 300 are involved in the
development and delivery of our
electronic systems.
It is essential that we invest in a
regular flow of quality staff into our
growing business and a key goal for
ICAP is to be the “employer of choice”
for graduates entering our industry.  18 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
Competitive landscape
ICAP remains the global leader in 
our sector with an overall market
share estimated at between 28–29%,
slightly higher than a year ago.
In the voice broking markets, the
major interdealer broker firms
continue to consolidate market share
as banks seek to rationalise their
broking relationships and achieve
economies of scale. While this
process of consolidation has already
run a long way in certain products, 
it is still in the early stages in others
(e.g equity derivatives, energy) and
we therefore believe the trend will
continue for some time.
The acquisition of EBS is a significant
step forward in this process of market
consolidation and will transform the
electronic competitive landscape,
more than doubling ICAP’s share of
OTC electronic broking and widening
product coverage.
The customer footprint that the
combined ICAP electronic broking 
and EBS networks, together with the
opportunities for functional
enhancement and delivery of
additional products and services over
that network, place ICAP in a strong
position as the inevitable evolution
towards electronic trading takes place. 
The derivatives exchanges have
shown rapid volume growth,
particularly in North America, as they
benefit from the uplift from taking
their markets electronic. The launch
of new futures or options contracts 
is a risky and often disappointing
business. In contrast we have found 
that innovation in the OTC markets is
much more frequent and has a much
greater chance of success. Recent
examples include credit derivatives,
emissions credits and inflation swaps. 
Liquid futures contracts are natural
hedging tools in many of our markets
and each type of instrument helps
the development of the other. As 
the exchanges seek to expand their
businesses there is the potential 
for more competition between the
institutional or wholesale financial
markets serviced by ICAP and the
exchanges which are open to a much
wider variety of users.
Regulatory capital changes
The Group has historically been
subject to “Consolidated Supervision”
by the FSA, under which it has been
required to maintain consolidated
regulatory capital in excess of
regulatory capital requirements. 
For this purpose, consolidated
regulatory capital is computed net 
of intangible assets. The practical
implication of this has been that, like
many firms subject to Consolidated
Supervision, ICAP has been required
to fund all the goodwill arising on
material acquisitions with equity. 
Based on undertakings given by the
Group and the Group’s low risk
profile, the FSA has been able to
grant ICAP a waiver from
Consolidated Supervision, which
effectively removes this requirement
to deduct goodwill from consolidated
regulatory capital. However, the
regulatory landscape is changing and
this waiver will need to be reaffirmed
in light of new requirements.
On 1 January 2007 the Group will
become subject to the new Capital
Requirements Directive (CRD). Under
the CRD, the circumstances in which
a group may avoid deducting goodwill
from regulatory capital are more
restrictively defined; nevertheless it
will still be possible provided that
such a group has no exposure to
market risk in its activities.
Following extensive discussions with
the FSA, the Group believes that it
will be able to meet the tougher tests
in the CRD and continue to calculate
its consolidated regulatory capital
requirement on this more
advantageous basis. 
This decision has very significant
implications for the business strategy
and future capital structure of the
Group. Provided that the Group can
continue to meet the CRD’s “zero
market risk” test, a much higher
proportion of current and future goodwill
can be financed with senior debt rather
than equity or subordinated debt. 
Funding the acquisition of EBS
To finance the acquisition of EBS the
Group arranged an underwritten debt
facility from JP Morgan for up to
£400 million which provides, together
with our own internal cash resources,
the funds required to close the deal. 
A combination of five-year bullet term
and revolving syndicated senior debt
facilities are being finalised to take
out this underwritten facility and
provide term funding for the Group.
These facilities total £300 million in
aggregate, a level that reflects the
full take up of the equity alternative.
The margin, covenants, and other
terms of these facilities reflect the
competitive nature of the banking 
Operating and Financial Review continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 19
markets, the improving nature of the
Group’s credit and the highly cash
generative nature of our business.
Accordingly, these new facilities have
also been used to refinance other,
more expensive, working capital
facilities.
The new facilities will be repaid from
the substantial cash flow generated
by the Group. 
Risk management
The identification, monitoring and
control of the risks our business
faces remains a key management
priority and the Group has taken a
number of steps to further strengthen
our risk management procedures
including the creation of a global risk
management organisation, worldwide
standardisation of risk measurement,
and a more detailed approach to
measuring credit and operational
risk. Further details of our approach
to risk management are provided in
the Corporate Governance statement
on pages 32 to 37.
IFRS
The 2005/06 Financial Statements
are the first to be prepared in
accordance with IFRS. The 2004/05
comparatives have been restated
accordingly. The transition to IFRS
has been relatively straightforward
for ICAP, but inevitably there are a
number of changes which should be
commented upon.
Presentation of income statement
The Group has continued with its
“columnar” approach to the
consolidated income statement, with
separate columns for ‘amortisation
and impairment of intangibles arising
on consolidation’ and ‘exceptional 
items’. This assists in the
understanding of the underlying
financial performance of the
business.
Financial impact on profit
As a consequence of the introduction
of IFRS, there is limited financial
impact on ICAP’s profit for the 
year (before amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising on
consolidation and exceptional items).
The main changes relate to an
incremental non-cash charge for
share options of £1.6 million and the
inclusion in the Group’s share of
profits/losses of associates of a tax
charge of £2.3 million. 
Dividend
Under IFRS the Group’s proposed
final dividend of 7.5p is not accrued
in the Financial Statements until it is
formally approved by shareholders.
Consequently it will be reflected in
the 2006/07 Financial Statements.
Disclosures 
Under IFRS a number of new
disclosures is required. The most
significant is the requirement to
gross up unsettled matched principal
transactions. The standards which
require this disclosure were adopted
prospectively by the Group on 1 April
2005 and result in a large number
being included in the balance sheet
as at 31 March 2006 under current
assets (£142.7 billion, which is
matched by £142.7 billion in current
liabilities). Previously, the Group was
required only to gross up for
transactions which had gone beyond
their normal settlement date. This
presentational change has no overall
economic or risk impact on the Group
or its overall net asset position.
Additionally there are many new
disclosures in the notes to the
Financial Statements, in particular
relating to financial instruments.
Cost management
The effective and efficient
management of the Group’s cost
base remains a key component of
operational strategy.
During the financial year the Group
continued to invest for the future 
in terms of people and technology.
Additionally, employment markets
remained highly competitive in a
number of areas of the Group’s
operations. Against this backdrop it
is encouraging to note that the Group
has maintained its industry leading
cost ratios. 
The profile of the Group’s cost base
is summarised in the panel above.
On an IFRS basis, broker
remuneration is 51% of Group
revenue, and is the largest
component of the Group’s cost base.
This is a slight increase on last
year’s 50% ratio reflecting the points
mentioned in the paragraph above.
The variable component of broker
remuneration cost, which is linked to
revenue and profit growth, is now
58% of total broker employment
costs and this compares with 55% in
the prior year. 
In overall terms, it is estimated that
some 50% of the Group’s cost base
is of a variable nature.

Operating profit* margins
The Group maintained its industry
leading market position, with an
unchanged operating profit margin 
of 21% in the financial year ended 
31 March 2006. Since the Garban
Intercapital merger in 1999 the
Group has made significant strides
forward in terms of margin
performance. Although this year’s
margin has remained static,
reflecting investment in people and
technology for the future, it is
important to note that the Group’s
electronic broking margin is now over
30%. Consequently, with the EBS
acquisition increasing the Group’s
electronic broking capabilities, this
should be a positive dynamic for the
Group’s overall margin going forward.
Most margins reflect the overall
static margin of the Group. However
it is worth highlighting the continuing
growth in the electronic broking
margin and the strong margin
performance in energy broking. 
The rounding of margins to one
percentage point masks a 0.7%
improvement in the Americas margin
from 23.6% to 24.3%, the increase
being driven mainly by electronic
broking. The Asia Pacific margin 
continues to underperform as the
business transition process 
remains ongoing. 
Cash generation
The effective management of 
cash resources remains a key
management objective. Regular
reviews of cash retained in operating
subsidiaries are undertaken and,
where appropriate, surplus cash is
repatriated to the centre. Capital
expenditure is rigorously controlled
and monitored through the annual
budgeting and regular forecasting
cycles. All acquisition opportunities
are the subject of detailed due
diligence and financial evaluation,
including the use of discounted cash
flow and return on investment criteria.
The Group remains highly cash
generative.
Operating profit/cash conversion
The Group’s consolidated cash flow is
set out on page 54 of the Financial
Statements.
Net cash and cash equivalents, as
defined in note 32 to the Financial
Statements, increased during the year
by £109.1 million to £339.8 million 
(2004/05 – £230.7 million).
The movement in net cash and cash
equivalents is summarised in the
table above and this clearly
demonstrates the continuing
operating cash generative nature 
of the business.
Taxation
The overall objective of the Group tax
function continues to be to plan and
manage the tax affairs of the Group
efficiently within the various local tax
jurisdictions of the world so as to
achieve the lowest tax cash cost
consistent with compliance with the
local tax regulations. 
The net taxation charge and the net
cash tax cost for the years to 
31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005
are shown in the panel on page 21.
The Group’s effective tax rate, 
which excludes amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising on
consolidation and exceptional items,
has increased to 35% (2004/05 –
33%), reflecting in part the higher
profit contribution from the Group’s
operations in the US which is a
relatively high tax rate jurisdiction.

Generally the charge for taxation is
affected by the varying tax rates in
different jurisdictions applied to
taxable profits and the mix of those
profits, by the rules impacting
deductibility of certain costs, such 
as finance costs, and by the rules
relating to double taxation relief.
Although we have been successful 
in minimising the cash tax cost of 
the Group, the success of the US
operations results in further upward
pressure on the Group’s tax rate as
the US is a relatively high tax rate
jurisdiction. Consequently, the
Group’s budget for the financial year
to 31 March 2007 anticipates an
effective tax rate in the range of
37–38%.
The Group takes a prudent approach
to the management of its tax affairs
and provisions are set to cover 
any tax exposures the Group 
may have.
Earnings and earnings per share (EPS)
We continue to believe that the most
appropriate EPS measurement ratio
for the Group is adjusted EPS, which
better reflects the Group’s underlying
cash earnings. Adjusted EPS
excludes amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising on
consolidation and exceptional items,
but includes share capital which is
contingently issuable in respect of
ICAP Energy. The calculation of EPS
is set out in note 12 to the Financial
Statements. 
Adjusted EPS increased by 11% to
21.5p. The Group’s basic EPS
increased from 18.3p to 19.6p.
Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, 
a 7.5p final dividend is proposed. 
This compares with 6.4p in the prior
year and would result in a full-year
dividend of 10p, which represents 
a 21% increase over the prior year. 
This is the sixth consecutive year
that we have been able to increase
the dividend and reflects the underlying
earnings performance in the year and
the Group’s current financial
position. The full-year dividend
remains more than twice covered by
the profit before tax, amortisation
and impairment of intangibles 
arising on consolidation and
exceptional items.

5 Includes dividends to minority interests of £1.3 million. 22 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
During the year the board
implemented its earlier decision 
that future interim dividends will 
be calculated as 30% of the 
previous year’s full-year dividend.
This approach will continue in the
2006/07 financial year.
Balance sheet and capital
Net assets increased by £99.8 million
during the year and, as at 31 March
2006, were £619.8 million. 
A significant proportion (c. 67%) 
of the Group’s cash balances of
£339.9 million as at 31 March 2006
is of a restricted nature required for
regulatory capital, clearing house
deposits, commercial and other
working capital requirements.
The Group’s balance sheet profile
will change following the completion
of the EBS transaction. Intangible
assets will increase, leverage will be
introduced and 36.1 million new
shares issued. A more detailed
discussion on EBS is given earlier in
the Group Chief Executive Officer’s
Review.
Foreign exchange 
As a multinational business the
Group transacts its business in many
currencies and, consequently, its
sterling reported results are
impacted by the effects of exchange
rate movements. The Group faces
two main risks associated with
foreign exchange rate markets. 
First, the translation of the results
and underlying net assets of its
subsidiaries and, second, the Group
has transactional foreign exchange
exposures in its UK business which
has underlying US dollar and euro
revenue streams. 
Currency movements had a net 
£3.9 million favourable impact on 
the Group’s operating profit in the
financial year to 31 March 2006
when compared with the prior
financial year. During the financial
year, the US dollar appreciated in
value against sterling (the average
US dollar/sterling rate in the
financial year was $1.79/£1
compared with $1.85/£1 in the
previous financial year). With the
Group’s substantial US operations, in
terms of both profit and net assets,
this has had a number of
ramifications for the financial year
ended 31 March 2006. The
translation of the Group’s US dollar
profits into sterling had an £3.5
million positive impact on pre-tax
profit and the transactional exposure
to the US dollar in the UK business
had a £1.6 million positive impact 
on pre-tax profit. This has been
offset by a £1.3 million reduction on
year-on-year hedging gains arising
from the Group’s transactional hedging
programme which is in place to
manage its transactional exposure to
the US dollar in the UK business.
Other currencies had a £0.1 million
positive impact.
The Group’s overall pre-tax profit
(pre-hedging) sensitivities to
movements in exchange rates in
respect of its transactional and
translational exposures are as
follows; a 10 cent movement in the
US dollar equates to £10 million: a
10 cent movement in the euro
equates to £7.0 million.
Treasury policy
The Group policy, determined by 
the Treasury Committee, is to hedge
its transactional foreign exchange
exposures by the use of foreign
exchange contracts and options. 
The Group’s major transactional
exposures are to US dollar and 
euro inflows into the UK. A 10 cent
movement in the US dollar before
hedging, at current exposure 
levels and exchange rates, has a 
£4.0 million impact on pre-tax profit.
A 10 cent movement in the euro
before hedging has a £7.0 million
impact. As at the date of this report
the Group has 100% of its remaining
US dollar exposure for the year to 
31 March 2007 hedged at $1.79/£1
and 25% of its exposure to 31 March
2008 hedged at $1.82/£1. As at the
date of this report the Group had
19% of its euro exposure for the year
to 31 March 2007 hedged at a euro
rate of €1.38–€1.44/£1.
The Group does not hedge its
translational profit and loss foreign
exchange exposures. The impact of
foreign exchange movements on the
translation of the Group’s overseas
subsidiaries’ profits into sterling is
mitigated by the Group’s policy of
translating overseas profits at
average exchange rates. Where
appropriate, structural hedges via
inter-company debt are put in place
to further mitigate translational
foreign exchange exposures. The only
major profit and loss translational
foreign exchange exposure is to 
the US dollar, where a 10 cent
movement would have a £6 million
impact on pre-tax profit. 
Operating and Financial Review continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 23
The Group’s only significant balance
sheet translational foreign exchange
exposure is to the US dollar. This
exposure, after structural hedging, is
some $240 million represented by
US dollar net assets excluding
goodwill. (In June 2005 $200 million
of the subordinated debt private
placement was used as a hedge
against the Group’s US dollar net
assets.)
Credit and interest rate risk
We continue to ensure that strict
investment criteria apply to the
management of the Group’s cash
balances. Investments must be AA
rated or better and for a duration of
no longer than two years. Limits are
also in place to restrict the amount
of funds that can be invested in any
one institution. Compliance with
policy and criteria is subject to
regular review by the Treasury
Committee and is formally reviewed
by the Group Risk Committee. 
The overall Group philosophy is one
of capital preservation, liquidity
management and then yield
enhancement.
The Group’s investment income
performance improved in the year as
rising interest rates in the UK and US
improved yields in the Group’s
underlying cash and investment
portfolio. Net financing income,
predominantly interest, increased to
£4.8 million from £4.6 million in the
previous year. 
It is anticipated that the Group’s
exposure to interest rate movements
post the EBS transaction will be
limited as debt will largely act as a
hedge against the Group’s cash
balances.
The new financial year
The Group has delivered on the three
key priorities which it set itself for
the 2005/06 financial year; revenue
growth, expansion of electronic
broking and the maintenance of cost
disciplines. These remain the key
priorities for the new financial year
with a particular emphasis on the
satisfactory execution and integration
of EBS. Another important feature of
the 2006/07 financial year will be
the Group’s investment for the future
in selected high potential revenue
growth market sectors and in
continuing to enhance its information
technology capabilities.

Corporate Social Responsibility 
As an international business
operating in 23 countries with over
3,000 staff worldwide, ICAP aims to
conduct its business in a socially
responsible manner, to contribute to
the communities in which it operates
and to respect the needs of customers,
shareholders, staff and suppliers.
ICAP endeavours to comply with the
laws, regulations and rules applicable
to its business and to conduct its
business in accordance with
established best practice in each of
the countries in which it operates.
The Group aims to be a responsible
employer and adopt values and
standards designed to help guide our
staff in their conduct and business
relationships.
Employee involvement and
employment practices 
The Group is committed to achieving
the highest standards in its
workplace. The policies and practices
in place within the Group to deter
acts of harassment and discrimination
are regularly monitored. The Group
maintains a zero tolerance policy
concerning sexual harassment,
discrimination and retaliation against
individuals who report problems 
in the Group’s workplace. 
The Group recognises the value of
communication with employees at all
levels and incentive schemes and
share ownership schemes are run for
the benefit of employees. Information
on these schemes is set out in the
Report on Directors’ Remuneration
on pages 38 to 47. 
Intranet sites are available in both
the UK and the US allowing
employees easy access to the
Group’s website for information on
current developments. The intranet
brings together information on
employment opportunities, the staff
handbook, including policies and
procedures, and compliance
procedures and manuals.
Charity Day and charitable donations 
During the year the Group donated
£5.2 million (2004/05 – £4.2 million)
to charitable organisations globally,
of which £2.6 million (2004/05 – 
£2.1 million) was donated to
charitable organisations in the UK.
For the past 13 years ICAP has held
an annual Charity Day and the
Group’s offices around the world
have raised over £26 million. Many
charities have received significant
donations enabling them to continue
their valuable work without incurring
the costs of fundraising. ICAP’s
offices around the world choose their
own charities and those that have
benefited include medical research,
third world, cancer and childrens’
charities. Among these were CLIC
Sargent, the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center and the
Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Further
information can be found on the
Group’s website

Equal opportunities 
The Group is committed to
employment policies that follow best
practice and offers opportunities 
for employment, training and career
development and promotion based
on individual abilities, regardless 
of gender, race, national origin,
disability, age, sexual orientation, or
religious or political beliefs. 
Health and safety 
The Group has a health and safety
policy approved by the board and a
Health and Safety Committee, chaired
by the Group Company Secretary,
which meets quarterly. The board is
committed to providing for the 
health, safety and welfare of all its
employees and to maintaining high
standards. 
Environment 
Recognising that the Group’s
operations are themselves of minimal
environmental impact, ICAP’s policy
is to operate, as far as practicable,
environmentally friendly policies and
meet the statutory requirements
placed on the Group. 
Various control measures have been
implemented and, in the UK
Broadgate building where 1,200
employees are based, an
environmental management system
is in place for lighting and air-
conditioning controlled by a
supervisory PC utilising the latest
software. Time programmes within
the software allow for all units to be
switched off when not required,
typically evenings and weekends. 
The use of presence detectors for
light fittings ensures an energy
efficient method of control. Regular
planned maintenance is carried out
to ensure that all units are working at
their optimum efficiency. The Group
promotes a paper recycling regime
with a collection being made weekly
in the UK.
The landlords of the UK Broadgate
building are responsible for heating,
energy consumption and ventilation.
The heating system is operational
during the winter months and
controlled according to outside
temperature. Gas consumption is
minimal and electricity usage is
monitored through an energy
consumption meter.
In the US Harborside office where
more than 1,100 employees are
based, the landlords are responsible
for heating and ventilation which are
monitored by a building management
system which controls the supply to
each area. Lighting is controlled by 
a centralised low voltage relay
system allowing each lighting zone 
to be programmed specifically to 
its corresponding area’s hours of
operation. 
Creditor payment policy 
The Group’s policy with regard to the
payment of its suppliers is to agree
the terms of payment at the start of
business with each supplier, ensure
that the suppliers are made aware of
the terms of payments and pay in
accordance with its contractual and
legal obligations. The Company does
not have any trade creditors.
Political donations 
There were no political donations
made during the year (2004/05 –
£11,684 to Vote No).
Share capital
All changes in share capital are
detailed in note 24 to the Financial
Statements. As at 31 March 2006,
options existed over 22,878,313 of
the Company’s ordinary shares of 
10 pence each in relation to employee
share option schemes. Of this figure
8,022,955 are options over existing
shares which are held in employee
benefit trusts and the remainder are
expected to be satisfied by new
issues of shares. Changes in options
under the various schemes are
detailed in note 25 to the Financial
Statements.
The Company did not repurchase 
any shares during the year. As at 
the date of this report, the Company
had an unexpired authority to
repurchase shares up to a maximum
of 60,553,006 ordinary shares of 
10 pence each. 30 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
Annual General Meeting
The eighth Annual General Meeting 
of the Company will be held on
Wednesday, 19 July 2006. The Notice
of Meeting is set out on pages 120 
to 123.
In addition to the ordinary business
of voting upon receiving the Financial
Statements, declaring a dividend, 
the re-election and re-appointment 
of directors, the re-appointment of
auditors and the setting of the
auditors’ remuneration, the following
special business will be considered:
Resolution 7 will be proposed as an
Ordinary Resolution to approve the
Report on Directors’ Remuneration.
Resolution 8 will be proposed as an
Ordinary Resolution. It is to authorise
the directors to allot ordinary shares
of the Company to an amount equal
to approximately one third of the
existing issued share capital. 
Resolution 9 will be proposed as a
Special Resolution. It is to empower
the directors to allot ordinary shares,
otherwise than on a pro-rata basis to
existing shareholders in connection
with any future rights issue or grant
rights over shares or sell treasury
shares for cash, up to an aggregate
nominal amount of £3,032,582
(being approximately 5% in value of
the existing issued share capital at
31 March 2006 and 4.99% of the
issued share capital at 2 May 2006).
The authorities in Resolutions 8 and
9 last for a period of one year each, 
in accordance with institutional
guidelines. The directors have no
present intention of exercising these
authorities. It is normal for boards of
listed companies to have these
authorities in order to take advantage
of market opportunities as they arise.
Resolution 10 will be proposed as a
Special Resolution. It will empower
the Company to purchase its own
ordinary shares by market purchases
not exceeding approximately 10% of
the Company’s issued share capital
as at 2 May 2006. The maximum
and minimum prices are stated in the
resolution. The directors believe that
it is advantageous for the Company
to continue to have this flexibility to
make market purchases of its own
shares. In the event that shares 
are purchased, they would either 
be cancelled (and the number of
shares in issue would be reduced
accordingly) or retained as Treasury
Shares with a view to possible re-
sale at a future date. The Company
would consider holding repurchased
shares pursuant to the authority
conferred by this resolution as
Treasury Shares. This would give the
Company the ability to re-issue
Treasury Shares quickly and cost
effectively and would provide the
Company with additional flexibility in
the management of its capital base.
The directors would exercise this
authority only if they were satisfied
that a purchase would result in an
increase in expected EPS and would
be in the interests of shareholders
generally. There is no present
intention of exercising this authority
and the authority given in the
resolution will expire at the
conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2007.
Resolutions 11 and 12 will be
proposed as Ordinary Resolutions to
approve the making of political
donations and incurring of political
expenditure by the Company and 
its subsidiary ICAP Management
Services Limited of up to an
aggregate amount of £100,000 in
the period to the Company’s Annual
General Meeting to be held in 2007.

which their children are beneficiaries holds a further 50,000 shares and Michael Spencer holds 996,800 shares in his own name. Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 31
The Political Parties, Elections and

restrictions on companies making
donations to EU political organisations
or incurring EU political expenditure
without prior shareholder approval.
Details on electronic proxy voting can
be found in the Notice of the Annual
General Meeting on pages 120 to 123.
The directors consider that all the
resolutions of the Annual General
Meeting are in the best interests of
the Company and recommend that
shareholders vote in favour of them.
Auditors and the disclosure of
information to auditors
So far as each person who was a
director at the date of approving this
report is aware, there is no relevant
audit information, being information
needed by the auditors in connection
with preparing their report, of which
the auditors are unaware. Having
made enquiries of fellow directors
and the Company’s auditors, each
director has taken all the steps that
he is obliged to take as a director in
order to make him aware of any
relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditors are aware
of that information.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were 
re-appointed auditors to the Company
on 13 July 2005. Resolutions to re-
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
and to authorise the directors to set
their remuneration will be proposed.
Note 8 to the Financial Statements
sets out details of the auditors’
remuneration.
Statement of directors’
responsibilities for the Financial
Statements
The directors are required by the
Companies Act 1985 to prepare
Financial Statements for each
accounting period that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and Group as at the
end of the financial year and of the
profit or loss of the Group for the year.
The directors confirm that suitable
accounting policies have been 
used and applied consistently and
reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates have been made 
in the preparation of the Financial
Statements for the year ended 
31 March 2006. The directors also
confirm that the Financial Statements
comply with applicable International
Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable
accuracy the financial position of the
Company and of the Group, for taking
reasonable steps to safeguard the
assets of the Company and the
Group and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website is the
responsibility of the directors; the
work carried out by the auditors does
not involve consideration of these
matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to
the Financial Statements since they
were initially presented on the
website. Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of Financial
Statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the
Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue to
operate for the foreseeable future
and confirm that the Company and
the Group are going concerns. For
this reason they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing
these Financial Statements.

Corporate Governance statement
The revised Combined Code on
Corporate Governance, issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in 
July 2003, formally applied to the
Company for the first time for the

board level attend certain board
meetings and make presentations on
the results and strategies of their
businesses. All directors have access
to the advice and services of the
Group Company Secretary who is
responsible for ensuring that board
procedures and applicable rules are
observed. Procedures exist to enable
the directors to obtain independent
professional advice in respect of 
their duties.
There is a clear division of the roles
and the responsibilities of the
Chairman and Group Chief Executive
Officer, which are set out in writing,
the Chairman being responsible for
leadership of the board and ensuring
effective communication with
shareholders and the Group Chief
Executive Officer being responsible
for leading and managing the
business. Duncan Goldie-Morrison is
the Senior Independent Director.
Since the retirement of David Gelber
in July 2005 as Group Chief
Operating Officer and his subsequent
appointment as a non-executive
director, the composition of the board
is not in compliance with the
Combined Code in that the number of
independent non-executive directors
is less than the number of executive
directors. The directors considered
that the board worked effectively
within this structure. Going forward,
David Gelber will not be standing for
re-election at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting. With the exception
of David Gelber and the Chairman, 
all the non-executive directors are
independent of management and
considered by the board to be free from
any business or other relationships
which could interfere with the exercise
of their independence. Biographies of
each of the directors and details of
their membership of board committees
are given on pages 24 to 25.
Board nominations are recommended
to the board by the Nomination
Committee under its terms of
reference. 
The appointment of David Gelber as
a non-executive director was not
subject to an external search or open
advertising as the board considered
him to be the most appropriate
candidate for appointment following
his retirement as the Group Chief
Operating Officer. His appointment as
a non-executive director was for a
fixed period of one year from 13 July
2005.
In accordance with the Combined
Code and the Company’s Articles of
Association all directors are subject
to re-appointment by shareholders at
the first opportunity following their
appointment and, subsequently, must
seek re-election at least once every
three years.
New directors to the board are
provided with appropriate training and
briefings which take into account
their individual qualifications and
experience. All directors receive,
during their term of office, regular
briefings on changes and
developments in the Group’s

business and legislative and
regulatory changes which are
relevant to the Group. 
The removal and appointment of the
Group Company Secretary are
reserved to the board. On 9 January
2006, the board approved the
appointment of Deborah Abrehart as
Group Company Secretary following
the resignation of Helen Broomfield.
During the year the board evaluated
its performance and that of its
committees and individual directors.
This was done by way of a
questionnaire which was completed
by each director to evaluate
effectiveness and accountability. 
The results of this exercise were
then summarised to the board by 
the Chairman. The Chairman’s
performance was evaluated by the
non-executive directors led by the
Senior Independent Director who
then provided the Chairman with the
results of this evaluation. 
The board manages the Group
through board meetings and a
number of committees, each of
which has detailed terms of
reference and meets regularly. 
The minutes of each of the
committees are made available 
to all directors and the board
receives an oral update from each
committee’s Chairman.
(a) Audit Committee 
The committee comprises three
independent non-executive directors.
The directors who served on the
committee during the year are:
Nicholas Cosh FCA (Chairman)
Duncan Goldie-Morrison 
William Nabarro
The committee’s full terms of
reference are available on the
Group’s website, www.icap.com, or
from the Group Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee is responsible
for:
•
monitoring the integrity of the
Group’s Financial Statements and
any announcements relating to the
Group’s financial performance;
•
reviewing the Group’s internal
financial controls and risk
management systems;
•
assessing the independence,
objectivity and effectiveness of the
external auditors;
•
developing and implementing
policies on the engagement of the
external auditors for the supply of
non-audit services;
•
making recommendations for the
appointment, re-appointment and
removal of the external auditors
and approving their remuneration
and terms of engagement; 
•
monitoring and reviewing the
effectiveness of the Group’s
internal audit function; and
•
reviewing arrangements by which
staff may, in confidence, raise
concerns about possible
improprieties in matters of
financial reporting or other matters.
Appointments to the committee are
made by the board on the
recommendation of the Group’s
Nomination Committee following
consultation with the Chairman of the
Audit Committee. 34 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
The board has satisfied itself that
collectively the committee possesses
recent and relevant financial
experience to enable the committee
to function effectively and to
discharge its responsibilities.
The committee meets four times a
year with meetings coinciding with
the start of the external audit 
cycle, the financial year end and 
the publication of the annual and
interim Financial Statements. The
attendance record of committee
members is set out above. Also in
attendance at such meetings, by
invitation only, are the Chairman,
Group Chief Operating Officer, Group
Finance Director, Ernst & Young as
internal auditor and representatives
from the external auditors. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee
also maintains contact with those
attendees throughout the year. At the
end of each committee meeting
representatives from Ernst & Young
as internal auditor and the external
auditors are given the opportunity to
raise any issues, in private, without
management being present.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee
reports on the committee’s
deliberations and any significant
issues that may have arisen to the
board meeting following each
meeting of the committee. Minutes of
each committee meeting are provided
to all board members.
In the 2005/06 financial year, the
committee reviewed the Group’s
annual and interim Financial
Statements, prior to their approval by
the board. In doing this it ensured
that accounting policies adopted,
judgements and disclosures made in
the preparation of those Financial
Statements were the most appropriate
to the circumstances of the Group.
In the course of the year the
committee was kept up to date 
on developments in accounting
standards and their likely impact on
the Group’s Financial Statements.
This has also included receiving
regular updates on the Group’s
transition to IFRS, details of which
are given in the OFR.
During the year, the committee
received regular reports on the work
of the outsourced internal audit
department and reviewed the
authority, scope of work, resources
and effectiveness of the function.
The Ernst & Young representative has
direct access to the Audit Committee
and its Chairman. The committee
also considered the external
auditors’ Group management letter
on accounting procedures and
systems of internal financial control.
During the financial year, the
committee reviewed the effectiveness
of the external audit process and 
the qualification, expertise and
resources of the external auditors.
The committee also reviewed and
approved the proposed audit fee 
and terms of engagement for the
2005/06 audit and has
recommended to the board that it
propose to shareholders that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-
appointed as the Group’s external
auditors. It also monitored the
balance of audit and non-audit fees
to ensure that the independence and
objectivity of the external auditors is
maintained. 
The committee monitors the board’s
policy as to the types of non-audit
work that can and cannot be
undertaken by the external auditors
to ensure that the independence 
of the external auditors is not
compromised by any non-audit work 
performed. Any proposed non-audit
assignments, with fees in excess 
of £50,000, are subject to the
committee’s prior review and
approval. As part of its consideration
of the annual Financial Statements
the committee has reviewed and is
satisfied that the auditors have
remained independent of the Group
during the financial year and continue
to do so to the date of this report.
The committee also received details
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of
its own independence procedures
and confirmation that, in its opinion,
it remained independent throughout
the year.
Management is responsible for
maintaining an effective system of
internal controls with the board 
being responsible for reviewing its
effectiveness. To assist the board 
in this duty, the committee reviews
the Group’s internal financial controls
and risk management systems.
Details of the steps taken by the
committee to review the effectiveness
of the Group’s system of internal
control are set out below. 
The committee has previously
reviewed the whistleblowing
arrangements within the Group and is
satisfied that such arrangements are
still appropriate.
(b) Nomination Committee 
The committee comprises the
Chairman, four non-executive
directors and one executive director:
William Nabarro (Chairman)
Nicholas Cosh 
Duncan Goldie-Morrison 
Charles Gregson
James McNulty 
Michael Spencer 
Corporate Governance continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 35
The committee recommends to the
board appointments for the role of
Chairman, Group Chief Executive
Officer, executive and non-executive
directors. The procedure for
appointments is set out in its terms
of reference and the committee
meets as required. The committee’s
full terms of reference are available
on the Company’s website,
www.icap.com, or from the Group
Company Secretary. 
(c) Remuneration Committee 
The Report on Directors’ Remuneration
is set out on pages 38 to 47.
(d) Group Risk Committee 
The committee comprises:
Mark Yallop (appointed Chairman 
13 July 2005)
Bruce Collins (Chief Executive Asia
Pacific) (appointed 13 July 2005)
George Macdonald (Chief Executive
Officer, London and Europe)
Stephen McDermott
Philip Moyse (Group Chief Risk Officer)
Jim Pettigrew
David Gelber retired as Chairman and
a member of the committee on 
13 July 2005. Nicholas Cosh and
James McNulty served as members
until 17 November 2005.
The committee is responsible for
ensuring that the Group’s risk
management framework, risk
appetite, risk strategy and policies
are appropriate to the activities of
the Group. The committee reviews
the Group’s risk exposures and
ensures adherence to the Group’s
risk policy (particularly in relation to
credit, market and operational risk).
It also reviews major new business
initiatives to ensure that a proper
consideration of risks has been
undertaken at the outset.
It is the board’s responsibility to
determine the Group’s risk appetite
and identify, monitor and assess the
significant risks the Group may be
exposed to. The committee is
responsible for developing procedures
for managing risk in line with board
approved policies and limits. This
includes establishing and maintaining
an adequate, sound and appropriate
internal control structure, evaluating
its effectiveness and promptly
identifying material weaknesses and
taking corrective steps.
The Chairman of the Group Risk
Committee reports to the board.
(e) Treasury Committee 
The committee, which comprises
such persons as are appointed by
the board (who may or may not be
directors), is chaired by the Group
Finance Director. It meets
approximately monthly and is
responsible for developing,
implementing and monitoring Group
treasury policies as approved by 
the board. Further details on the
activities of the Treasury Committee
during 2005/06 are provided in 
the OFR.
Relations and dialogue with
shareholders
The board is accountable to the
Company’s shareholders for the
performance and activities of the
Group and is very much aware of the
importance of maintaining good
relations and communications with
all its shareholders. All annual and
interim Financial Statements and
Stock Exchange announcements are
posted on the investor relations
section of the Group’s website,
www.icap.com, as soon as they are
released and major shareholder
presentations are also available. 
The board recognises that the 
Annual General Meeting provides
shareholders with an opportunity to
receive information on the Group’s
business performance and to 
question senior management on any
business matters.
The Group has an established
programme of communication with its
institutional investors and analysts.
At the time of the announcement 
of the final and interim results,
presentations are made to analysts,
the press and institutional investors.
In addition, there are regular
meetings during the year (subject to
relevant regulatory constraints) with
analysts and investors to update
them on developments in the Group’s
strategy and performance. 
Accountability and audit
Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors' statement regarding
their responsibility for preparing the
Group's Financial Statements is set
out in the Directors' Report on page
31 and the Independent Auditors’
Report regarding their reporting
responsibility is detailed on page 48.
Risk management 
General 
As with all businesses the Group
faces and manages a number of
risks. The board is responsible for
setting the Group’s risk appetite and
for ensuring that the Group’s risk
management processes are appropriate
and operating effectively. It does this
through two board committees –
Group Risk and Treasury.
The board examines, on an ongoing
basis, the effectiveness of the
internal controls within the Group 
by way of an operational risk
assessment process. This process
involves senior business and support  36 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
management identifying the key
operational risks facing their
business/area and the controls 
in place to manage, monitor and 
mitigate those risks. At the end 
of the year a summary report is
produced confirming that those
controls have been in operation
throughout the year. 
Credit and market risk 
The Group transacts business on an
agency or matched principal basis. In
its role as an intermediary matching
buyers and sellers, its exposure to
credit and market risk is limited.
However, the Group has established
policies and procedures to mitigate
further its exposure to both credit
and market risk.
Credit risk arises from the potential
that a counterparty is unable to
perform on an obligation resulting 
in a loss to the Group. All
counterparties are subject to regular
review and assessment by regional
credit officers who then propose 
for approval, by the Group Risk
Committee, appropriate limits taking
into account the creditworthiness of
the counterparty and the nature of
the business they transact with the
Group. Limits set are based on
Group set parameters determining
the maximum loss that the Group can
suffer as a result of a counterparty
default. Where appropriate, country
limits are applied to limit the
exposure of a company within the
Group to that country. Regional credit
officers monitor the limits given and
their utilisation and are required to
approve all exceptions and report
these to the Group Risk Committee.
Typically, the Group’s counterparties
are highly credit rated, large financial
institutions.
Market risk can arise in those
instances where one or both
counterparties in a matched principal
transaction fail to fulfil their
obligations (i.e. an initially unsettled
transaction) or through trade
mismatches or other errors. The risk
in these situations is restricted to
short-term price movements in the
underlying stock held by the Group
and movements in foreign exchange
rates. Any such market risk arising is
identified, monitored and reported to
senior Group management on a daily
basis and the Group Risk Committee
on a monthly basis. Policies and
procedures exist to reduce the
likelihood of such trade mismatches
and, in the event that they arise, the
Group’s policy is to close out such
positions immediately or, with senior
management approval, to carry them
with an appropriate hedge in place
for the shortest possible period.
In some parts of its business the
Group, acting in its interdealer 
broker capacity, engages in complex
(and sometimes very substantial)
structured transactions developed by
its highly-rated counterparties. These
transactions are fully matched and
do not involve the Group taking
principal positions.
The Group does, in certain very
limited circumstances, take positions,
usually in highly illiquid markets,
primarily for customer facilitation
purposes and these can give rise to
market risk in the event of any price
movement. Such risks are monitored
and controlled by the setting of limits
and the use of hedging arrangements
where appropriate. These very 
limited activities will cease before 
31 December 2006 in order that 
the Group can comply with the new
CRD requirements.
Operational risk 
During the year the Group has
continued to review the results of the
risk and controls identification and
assessment processes and resulting
corrective actions required to
address the issues highlighted. 
The Group Risk Committee has
introduced a loss data collection
process for Europe and North
America to supplement the risk
identification process and to provide
validation of the probability and
impact of the risks identified and 
the effectiveness of the controls
environment in mitigating the probability
and impact of the risks. This process
will be rolled out on a global basis
during 2006. Process and work flow
mapping has also been introduced in
Europe and North America to ensure
that all significant processes in the
main business activities and support
areas are captured. 
Treasury risk 
The Group’s Treasury Committee
manages and monitors the Group’s
free cash resources to ensure, inter
alia, that any country or institutional
risk arising from the deposit of 
such funds is managed and that 
the rate of return on such funds is
maximised. In addition, the Treasury
Committee manages the Group’s
exposure to foreign currency and
interest rate risk. 
Internal control 
The board of directors is responsible
for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system of
internal control is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Corporate Governance continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 37
As referred to above there is an
ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group.
This has been in place throughout
the year under review and up to the
date of approval of these Financial
Statements. 
The key elements of the internal
control system are: 
•
a comprehensive budgetary
process, with both annual and
regular forecasts being considered
and approved by the board;
•
monthly monitoring of trading
results, balance sheet and cash
flow against budget and prior
periods with significant variances
being investigated and appropriate
action taken;
•
formulation and review of specific
policy covering credit, market,
operational and treasury risks
faced by the business;
•
regular visits to Group operating
companies by board members and
senior management;
•
all transactions authorised in
accordance with delegated
authority limits approved by the
board;
•
regular internal audit visits to
Group operating companies to
carry out reviews of systems and
procedures and compliance with
Group policies;
•
senior management within each
region have responsibility for the
establishment of appropriate
control frameworks within their
operations to ensure compliance
with Group policies, procedures
and standards. They are also
responsible for ensuring that risks
within their businesses are
identified, assessed, controlled
and monitored on an ongoing
basis; and
•
regular reports from both the
external and internal auditors on
the internal control systems
operating within the Group.
The board, through the Audit
Committee, has conducted an annual
review of the effectiveness of the
system of internal control covering 
all controls including financial,
operational and compliance controls
and risk management systems. 
The Group has investments in a
number of joint ventures and
associated companies. Where the
Group is not directly involved in the
management of the investment it 
can influence, through board
representation, but not control the
internal control systems present in
those entities. The board’s review of
the effectiveness of the system of
internal controls in those entities is
consequently less comprehensive
than in its directly owned
subsidiaries.
Regulation 
The Group is regulated on a
consolidated basis by the UK
Financial Services Authority (FSA)
with the Group’s UK businesses
being authorised by the FSA to carry
on regulated activities within the 
UK. The FSA adopts a risk-based
approach to supervision and does
this in various ways including the
review of prudential returns, visits 
to firms and meetings with senior
management. In the US, the 
Group’s activities are regulated by 
the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Group operates in
other countries and its operations
are subject to relevant local
regulatory requirements. Adherence 
to these regulations is monitored,
where applicable, by local compliance
officers who report regularly, via the
Group Compliance Officer – Europe,
to the board. 
By order of the board
Deborah Abrehart
Group Company Secretary 38 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
This report sets out the Group’s
remuneration policy and details the
remuneration of each of the directors
for the financial year ended 31 March
2006 and, as far as practicable, for
subsequent years.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee
consists of:
James McNulty (Chairman of 
the committee with effect from 
13 July 2005)
Nicholas Cosh
Duncan Goldie-Morrison
William Nabarro (Chairman of 
the committee to 13 July 2005)
All are independent non-executive
directors and were members of the
Remuneration Committee during the
year and at the year end.
The Remuneration Committee
consults the board’s Chairman and
the Group Chief Executive Officer
about its proposals relating to the
remuneration of the executive
directors.
The Remuneration Committee has
been assisted in its considerations
on executive directors’ remuneration
by Towers Perrin who were appointed
by the Remuneration Committee in
December 2003. Towers Perrin do
not have any other connection with
the Group. Advice was also sought
during the year from Ashurst on legal
issues. Ashurst have also provided
advice on a broad range of legal
issues for the Group during the year
to 31 March 2006.
The terms of reference of the
Remuneration Committee are
available on the Group’s website
www.icap.com or from the Group
Company Secretary.
Details of the number of meetings
and attendance at committee
meetings during the year are set out
in the table on page 33.
Remuneration policy
In determining remuneration policy
and the size of the awards the
Remuneration Committee takes
account of structures and levels of
remuneration for executive directors
in other substantial companies that it
regards as appropriate comparators
and of such companies’ stated
remuneration policies. The comparator
companies, selected because their and
the Group’s activities are in broadly
comparable areas of the financial
services sector, include Chicago
Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, Collins Stewart Tullett,
Deutsche Borse, eSpeed, Euronext,
GFI, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, London
Stock Exchange and Man Group.
The principles of the remuneration
policy have been developed over a
number of years to recognise and
reward the rapid and substantial
growth of the Group. The principles
are designed to ensure that the
structure and level of the executive
directors’ remuneration are:
(i) appropriate in light of
remuneration arrangements
among senior executives 
and managers employed by
competitors and other
participants in the markets in
which ICAP is active;
(ii) compatible with the remuneration
of senior brokers and managers
employed within the Group who
are not directors of ICAP plc;
(iii) structured directly to take
account of the absence of
committed future revenue in the
Group’s businesses, which
means that the major part of
revenue has to be secured in the
year in which it is earned; 
(iv) structured to reflect Group profit,
with low fixed-base salaries and
negligible pension and other
benefits; 
(v) simple, with the amounts to which
executive directors are entitled
capable of being calculated by
reference to the published
Financial Statements of the Group;
(vi) integrated so that executive
directors participate in a single
comprehensive bonus and
incentive structure rather than
participating in several different
schemes; 
(vii) structured rather than
discretionary: remuneration is
primarily determined
arithmetically by reference to the
published financial performance
of the Group, with the non-
arithmetic element (which 
will be smaller, other than in
exceptional circumstances)
determined by reference to
progress towards specific
management objectives agreed
at the start of the relevant year;
(viii) structured to maximise the
likelihood of retaining a proven
and stable senior management
team; and
(ix) structured to align executive
directors’ interests with those of
ICAP shareholders. 
While the remuneration strategy,
policy and approach is reviewed
annually for executive directors,
significant changes to the policy 
are not envisaged in the 
forthcoming year.
The executive directors’ remuneration
comprises basic salary, performance-
Report on Directors’ Remuneration Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 39
related bonus, participation in 
the Bonus Share Matching Plan
(BSMP), pension contribution, life
assurance, medical insurance and, 
in some cases, car allowance. 
The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for determining the
salaries and other remuneration of
the Chairman, the executive directors
and the Group Company Secretary. 
Directors are not involved in deciding
their own remuneration. The
Remuneration Committee does not
determine the fees payable to the
non-executive directors, which are
considered and approved by the
executive directors and the Chairman
of the board.
Salaries and benefits
The executive directors did not
receive a salary increase in 2005/06
and have not done so since 1999 
as the Remuneration Committee
believes that performance-related
pay should be the major component
of the package in order to align
executives’ interests with those of
shareholders.
Bonus and other entitlements under
the Company’s incentive schemes
are not pensionable.
Set out below are the salaries and
benefits received by the executive
directors in (or, in the case of
bonuses, in respect of) 2005/06.

medical insurance. He received a
performance-related cash bonus of
£200,000 for his services as an
executive director to 13 July 2005.
60% of total compensation for this
period was performance-related.
Remuneration of the non-executive
directors
The remuneration of the non-
executive directors is considered and
approved by the executive directors
within the limits set in the Articles of
Association. The basic remuneration
for Nicholas Cosh, Duncan Goldie-
Morrison, James McNulty and 40 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
William Nabarro was £50,000 
per annum. 
Nicholas Cosh as Chairman of the
Audit Committee, James McNulty
as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee and William Nabarro
as Chairman of the Nomination
Committee receive an additional
£20,000, £10,000 and £5,000 
per annum respectively for those
functions. 
The remuneration of David Gelber
following his appointment as a 
non-executive director on 
13 July 2005 was considered and
approved by the Remuneration
Committee. David Gelber received
fees of £160,714, a pension
contribution of 5% of the annual fee
being £8,036 for the year ended 
31 March 2006, life assurance, 
long-term disability insurance and
private medical insurance.
The Chairman, Charles Gregson,
received a fee of £110,000 per
annum which, with effect from 
1 November 2005, is paid directly 
to him. Prior to this, fees were paid
to a subsidiary of UBM.
Breakdown of remuneration
The fixed and performance-related
elements of directors’ remuneration
are illustrated in the tables on pages
44 to 46.
Performance graph
Value of £100 invested
The line graph shows, for the five
financial years ended 31 March
2006, the total shareholder return on
a holding of the Company’s ordinary
shares compared with the FTSE 250
index. ICAP plc has been a
constituent of the FTSE 250 
index since March 2001 and that 
index is considered to be an 
appropriate benchmark.
Calculation of the executive
directors’ variable remuneration
The structure put in place by the
Remuneration Committee, by which
executive directors’ variable
remuneration is determined,
comprises three elements. A bonus
pool is created representing a
percentage of profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items and after all
remuneration costs. Of this pool:
(i) half is paid in cash;
(ii) the other half is used to purchase
shares of the Company held by
the ICAP Trust and over which the
executive directors are granted
awards (“the basic award”) but
which are not released to the
respective executive directors
until the end of three years unless
they cease employment earlier; 
and
(iii)matching awards of shares 
equal in total to the number
purchased under (ii) above, to be
secured through market purchase.
An award will normally be
released after three years only if
the executive director to whom the
particular award was made is still
employed and has not disposed of
his basic award and, for matching
awards in respect of 2003/04
onwards, provided performance-
related criteria are met.
The performance-related criteria 
for the release of the matching
awards granted under the BSMP for
the year ended 31 March 2004 
and subsequent years is that
adjusted EPS must have grown by 
at least 9% over RPI over the 
three years from the date of grant. 
The structure is designed to result 
in two-thirds of each executive
director’s variable remuneration in
respect of each year being locked
into the Company’s shares for the
subsequent three years, its value
varying in direct relation to the price
of the Company’s shares. Half of this
award is then normally released after
three years if the executive director is
still employed and has not disposed
of his basic award and if the financial
performance of the Company is such
that the performance criteria have
been met during the subsequent
three-year period.
Under the structure adopted by the
Remuneration Committee which
establishes the pool from which
executive directors’ bonuses will be
paid, the bonus pool comprises:
(i) a fixed percentage of the Group’s
profit before tax, amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising
on consolidation and exceptional
items and after all remuneration
costs, subject to the achievement
of a minimum level of profit for
the year sent by the Remuneration
Committee at the beginning of the
year; and
(ii) a smaller, variable percentage set
by the Remuneration Committee
to reflect, first, the progress made
towards agreed specific priorities
and objectives and, second,
financial results outperforming the
minimum level in the 
relevant year.

The Remuneration Committee does
not consider it appropriate to put a
cap on the size of the bonus pool
that may be generated in light of
remuneration practices prevalent in
the financial services sector and
because the major part of the bonus
pool is set as a direct reflection of the
financial performance of the Group. 
Bonus arrangements for year ended
31 March 2006
The bonus arrangements in effect for
the executive directors’ bonuses for
the year ended 31 March 2006 were
set down in the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2005.
•
so long as profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items is greater
than £185 million (and provided
there is a year-on-year increase in
adjusted EPS), the executive
directors’ bonus pool will be 3% of
that profit;
•
an additional amount of up to
1.5% of that profit may be payable
as determined by the
Remuneration Committee based
on the actual financial
performance for the year and
progress made towards specified
agreed priorities and objectives for
the executive directors;
•
if adjusted profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items is below
£185 million the amount of the
executive directors’ bonus pool will
be at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee;
•
the Remuneration Committee will
retain the overriding discretion to
make such changes to the bonus
arrangements as it believes the
circumstances warrant. Such
changes may lead to either an
increase or a decrease in the
bonus pool; and
•
the matching award will be
released only if adjusted EPS has
grown by at least 9% above RPI
over the three financial years
beginning with the financial year in
which the matching award is
granted. If this performance-
related criteria is not met at the
end of the three years the
matching award will lapse.
Jim Pettigrew will not be eligible for
awards under the BSMP for the year
ended 31 March 2006.
Bonus arrangements for year 
ending 31 March 2007
The arrangements for the year ending
31 March 2007 are as follows:
•
so long as profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items is greater
than £255 million (and provided
there is a year-on-year increase in
adjusted EPS), the executive
directors’ bonus pool will be 3% of
that profit;
•
an additional amount of up to
1.5% of that profit may be payable
as determined by the
Remuneration Committee based
on the actual financial
performance for the year and
progress made towards specified
agreed priorities and objectives for
the executive directors;
•
if adjusted profit before tax,
amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation
and exceptional items is below
£255 million the amount of the
executive directors’ bonus pool will
be at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee;
•
the Remuneration Committee will
retain the overriding discretion to
make such changes to the bonus
arrangements as it believes the
circumstances warrant. Such
changes may lead to either an
increase or a decrease in the
bonus pool; and
•
the matching award will be
released only if adjusted EPS has
grown by at least 9% above RPI
over the three financial years
beginning with the financial year in
which the matching award is
granted. If this performance-
related criterion is not met at the
end of three years the matching
award will lapse.
Notwithstanding that Jim Pettigrew
will not be in the employment of the
Company on the relevant date for
payment of any bonus, he will be
eligible for a bonus in respect of
such portion of the year ending 
31 March 2007 during which he
carries out duties for the Company,
to be determined in the absolute
discretion of the Remuneration
Committee after consultation with 
the Group Chief Executive Officer.
Share schemes and long-term
incentive arrangements
The Company has a number of share
schemes:
•
ICAP 1998 Approved Share Option
Plan (ESOP)
•
ICAP 1998 Unapproved Share
Option Plan (UESOP)
•
ICAP 1998 Sharesave Scheme
(SAYE)
•
ICAP Senior Executive Equity
Participation Plan (SEEPP)
•
ICAP 2001 Unapproved Company
Share Option Plan (UCSOP)
These schemes are described in note
25 to the Financial Statements. 42 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
Following the approval of the BSMP,
executive directors no longer receive
awards under any of the above
schemes with the exception of the
SAYE scheme. Prior to Mark Yallop’s
appointment as an executive director,
he was granted options under the
UCSOP as a signing-on incentive.
These options over 1,000,000
shares vest in three equal tranches
on the third, fourth and fifth
anniversaries of the date of grant 
and are subject to the performance
conditions described on page 46.
The policy in respect of these share
schemes is that they will be
restricted and allocation made only 
to key executives and senior brokers.
Awards will be of a size, up to the
limits allowed by the schemes, to
provide a meaningful incentive and
an effective retention tool for this
particular group of employees. The
SAYE scheme is open to eligible
employees to encourage regular
saving linked to investing in the
shares of the Company.
Performance conditions
The table on page 46 shows the
share options and interests under
long-term incentive schemes held by
directors of the Company. Details of
the performance conditions
applicable to those options are
detailed in the notes to the table.
Where performance conditions are
attached to options, these were
selected to act as a mechanism to
safeguard the progress that has been
made in the performance of the Group
and to underpin continuing forward
movement in the Group’s earnings.
Directors’ service contracts
The Company’s policy is for executive directors to have service contracts with notice periods of no more than one
year as recommended by the Combined Code and to provide a reasonable balance between the need to retain the
services of key individuals and the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in the event of the termination of 
a contract.
No director received compensation for loss of office during the year.

Notes
1 The contract of Michael Spencer, dated 30 September 1998 as amended on 22 July 1999, may be terminated by the Company with no
notice in which case the Company is obliged to make a payment of salary and contractual benefits (excluding any bonus) for 12 months.
2 The contract of Mark Yallop, dated 23 May 2005, may be terminated by the Company with no notice in which case the Company is
obliged to make a payment of salary and contractual benefits (excluding bonus) for 12 months.
3 The contract of Stephen McDermott may be terminated by the Company with no notice in which case the Company is obliged to make a
payment of his base salary of $450,000 and his guaranteed bonus of $350,000.
4 The contract of Jim Pettigrew, dated 17 November 1998 as amended on 27 October 1999, 7 January 2000, 29 August 2000, 
20 November 2003 and by a Termination Agreement dated 21 November 2005 shall terminate automatically on 30 September 2006 or
such earlier date following 31 March 2006 on which the Remuneration Committee determines certain conditions have been satisfied. 
In the event of termination prior to 30 September 2006, the following shall apply:
(a) Jim Pettigrew will receive a payment in lieu of notice calculated by reference to the salary, car allowance and pension contribution
which would have been paid to him between the actual date of termination and 30 September 2006;
(b) Jim Pettigrew will be entitled to exercise in full his outstanding basic awards under the BSMP for 12 months following his 
termination date; 
(c) the Company will also procure that the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion in relation to the unvested matching awards
granted on 4 June 2004 and 10 June 2005 so that two-thirds and one-third respectively of each of these awards will vest at the
normal vesting date, subject to the applicable performance conditions being satisfied. In addition, Jim Pettigrew will be eligible for a
discretionary cash bonus in lieu of dividends on shares subject to his BSMP awards on a basis consistent with that for other
executive directors.
5 The Chairman, Charles Gregson, and the non-executive directors, Nicholas Cosh, Duncan Goldie-Morrison, James McNulty and William
Nabarro do not have contracts with the Company and no notice is required to be given by the Company on termination.
6 The Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion to allow David Gelber to exercise in full his outstanding basic awards under
the BSMP as they become exercisable on the normal vesting date. Where a matching award is performance related, the matching award
will vest only to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied at the relevant date of vesting.
Group pension arrangements
In the UK, the Group operates a Group Personal Pension Scheme (the Scheme), which is open to new non-broking
employees and administered by the Standard Life Assurance Company. The Group will match contributions paid by
members of the Scheme, up to a limit of 5% of basic salary. For new broking employees, or those not eligible for 
a Group contribution, a stakeholder scheme is available, administered by the Standard Life Assurance Company. 
In addition, the Group administers a number of historic pension arrangements for existing employees.
Various 401k plans are run in the US. These are retirement savings schemes with a choice of investment funds and
US federal tax law sets savings limits for employees.
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and the US. Further information can be found in
note 28 to the Financial Statements. 44 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006

Notes
The remuneration shown above represents amounts payable in respect of services provided by the directors to the Company and its
subsidiaries during the year in which they held office as directors of the Company. 
1 In addition to the basic award an equivalent matching award will be granted under the BSMP. Matching awards may, in normal
circumstances, be exercised only if the directors still hold office in three years’ time and retain their basic awards. Exercise of matching
awards is also subject to the performance criteria attached to the award being satisfied.
2 Benefits may include car allowance, premiums for private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and disability insurance, mobile
telephone and country club membership.
3 The remuneration of Stephen McDermott has been converted to sterling using the average exchange rate for the year of US$1.79
(2005 – US$1.85).
4 A bonus in lieu of dividend on the BSMP was received on the basic awards granted in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
5 The figures stated above exclude pension contributions to defined contribution schemes which are shown under salaries and benefits for
each executive director on pages 39 and 40.
Report on Directors’ Remuneration continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 45
Bonus Share Matching Plan (BSMP)
The BSMP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in 2003. One half of each director’s
bonus has been used to purchase ordinary shares (a basic award) which are held by the ICAP Trust. Matching award
options will normally be exercisable at the end of three years as long as the basic award options are still held and
only if the executive director remains in employment. No additional performance conditions are required to be met
on the grant made on 16 July 2003. The performance-related criteria for the release of the matching awards granted
under the BSMP for the year ended 31 March 2004 and subsequent years is that adjusted EPS must have grown 
by at least 9% above RPI over the three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the matching award
is granted. The exercise price for a basic award is £1 and the exercise price for a matching award is £1.
The table below sets out the shares awarded as part of the executive directors’ variable remuneration.

1 No options were exercised by directors during the year.
2 Options vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject, on each anniversary, to a
minimum requirement that the earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in RPI by an average of 3% per annum over the preceding
three years.
3 At the time of these grants in 1998 and 1999 it was not deemed appropriate to attach performance criteria.
4 Charles Gregson, as Chairman, and Nicholas Cosh, Duncan Goldie-Morrison, James McNulty and William Nabarro, as non-executive
directors, have no interest in ICAP shares under any of these schemes.
5 All option figures shown at 31 March 2006 remained unchanged at 17 May 2006.
6 At the close of business on Friday, 31 March 2006 the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares was 447.00p per share and

1 At 31 March 2006 the ICAP Trust, which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees (including directors) of the Group, held
8,007,954 ordinary shares (2005 – 5,481,792). At 31 March 2006 the Garban Trust, which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of
employees (including directors) of the Group, held 1,606,140 ordinary shares (2005 – 1,868,313). Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 
of the Companies Act, the executive directors are deemed to be interested in these shares.

By order of the board
James McNulty
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 48 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of ICAP plc
We have audited the Group and
Company Financial Statements (the
“Financial Statements”) of ICAP plc
for the year ended 31 March 2006
which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated
and company balance sheets, the
consolidated and company statements
of recognised income and expense,
the consolidated and company cash
flow statements and the related
notes. These Financial Statements
have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information
in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration that is described 
as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of
directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report, the
Report on Directors’ Remuneration
and the Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
included in the Directors’ Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the
Financial Statements and the part 
of the Report on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited in
accordance with the relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose
or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the Financial Statements
give a true and fair view and whether
the Financial Statements and the
part of the Report on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We
report to you whether in our opinion
the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the Financial
Statements and whether it is
consistent with specific information
presented in the Operating and
Financial Review that is cross
referred from the Activities, business
review and development section of
the Directors’ Report. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Company
or Group has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance statement reflects the
Company’s and Group’s compliance
with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our
review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the
board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s or Group’s
Corporate Governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained
in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the
audited Financial Statements. 
The other information comprises only 
the Group Profile, the Financial
Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement,
the Group Chief Executive Officer’s
Review, the Operating and Financial
Review, the Directors and Secretary,
Corporate Governance statement 
and the unaudited part of the Report
on Directors’ Remuneration. 
We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Financial
Statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the
Financial Statements and the part of
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration
to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made 
by the directors in the preparation 
of the Financial Statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s and
Group’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit
so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the
Financial Statements and the part of
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration
to be audited are free from material Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 49
misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the
Financial Statements and the part of
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration
to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the Group Financial Statements
give a true and fair view, in

by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 March 2006 and of its 
profit and cash flows for the year
then ended;
•
the Company Financial Statements

cash flows for the year ended;
•

part of the Report on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited have

(a) Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 are the Group’s first annual accounts to be prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The date of transition to IFRS is deemed to be 1 April 2004 and the results for the year
ended 31 March 2005 have been restated accordingly, except for changes relating to IAS32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation” and IAS39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” which have been adopted prospectively from 1 April 2005.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act
1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Financial Statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention,
as modified to include the fair value of certain financial instruments and in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and
therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Under IFRS the Group will maintain the columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement. This will enable the Group
to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items. This is the profit measure used in the adjusted EPS calculation and is considered
to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Group’s underlying cash earnings. Profit before amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items is reconciled to profit before taxation on the face of the income statement.
Items which are of a material and non-recurring nature have been disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Group’s results.
These items are shown as ‘exceptional items’ on the face of the income statement.
The Group has reclassified assets arising from development expenditure as intangible with effect from 1 April 2004. Previously such assets
had been included within property, plant and equipment. The consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been
restated to present intangible assets arising from development expenditure separately from property, plant and equipment. As a consequence,
intangible assets arising from development expenditure have increased by £15.7m, with property, plant and equipment decreasing by a
corresponding amount. The amortisation of assets arising from development expenditure remains in the income statement within the column
‘before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items’. There was no effect on the net assets of
the Group or on the profit before taxation for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation represent goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets on business combinations
since 1 April 2004. The amortisation and any impairment is included in the income statement within the column ‘amortisation and
impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation’.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated Financial Statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Group’s share of
joint ventures and associates accounted for under the equity method.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its operating and financial policies. An entity is regarded as a joint venture
if the Group has joint control of its operating and financial policies. An entity is regarded as an associate if the Group has significant
influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies. Details of the Group’s principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
are given in note 35.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Group’s income statement and balance sheet include the Group’s share of the
income and assets on a line by line basis. Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Group’s income statement
includes its share of their profits and losses and the Group’s balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
The accounts of certain subsidiaries incorporated outside the United Kingdom are drawn up initially to conform with local regulations and
adjusted subsequently to comply with IFRS and United Kingdom company law.
The Company has taken advantage of section 230 the Companies Act 1985 not to present its own income statement.
(c) First-time adoption of IFRS
Transitional arrangements for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS1 “First–time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards” and allow companies adopting IFRS for the first time to apply certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the year of
transition. The Group has applied the following key exemptions:
IAS32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” and IAS39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”
The Group has adopted IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively from 1 April 2005 and has not presented comparative information for the year ended
31 March 2005. For the year ended 31 March 2005, financial instruments continue to be valued using the accounting principles adopted in
the Group’s UK GAAP annual report for that year. A reconciliation of the adjustments required on adoption of IAS39 is given in note 36.
Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Basis of preparation and first time adoption of IFRS 58 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
IFRS3 “Business Combinations”
The Group has accounted for all acquisitions since 1 April 2004 in accordance with IFRS3 and has applied the requirements of IAS36
“Impairment of Assets” and IAS38 “Intangible Assets” since that date. Acquisitions and mergers prior to 31 March 2004 have not 
been restated and are included in the results at their book value as at 1 April 2004. No impairments were required as at 1 April 2004 
under IAS36. 
IAS21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”
Exchange differences on the retranslation of the balance sheets of subsidiaries at the balance sheet date are deemed to be nil as at the
date of adoption of IFRS as permitted by the transitional arrangements of IFRS1.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has not applied the requirements of IAS21 to goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 April
2004. Goodwill on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2004 continues to be recorded in sterling, the presentational currency of the Group.
Goodwill arising since 1 April 2004 is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired assets or entity.
IFRS2 “Share-based Payment”
The Group has adopted IFRS2 for all employee share options granted since 7 November 2002, as permitted by the transitional arrangements
of IFRS2. Other than employee share options, the Group has no share-based payments.
IAS19 “Employee Benefits”
The Group has chosen to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of transition to IFRS. The Group has taken
advantage of the option available in the amendment to IAS19 (issued in December 2004) for subsequent actuarial gains and losses to be
recognised immediately in equity.
(a) Revenue
Revenue comprises commission from the Group’s agency business, brokerage from matched principal transactions and fees received from
the sale of financial information to third parties.
Matched principal business
Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the simultaneous
commitment by the counterparties to sell and purchase the financial instrument. Following the prospective application of IAS39 from 
1 April 2005, the gross amounts due and receivable are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables (notes 
18 and 19).
Agency business
The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices monthly for the service
provided. The Group does not act as principal and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties. Revenue is stated net of
rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade. Amounts receivable at the
year end are reported as other trade debtors within trade and other receivables (note 18).
Information services
The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information to third parties. This is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes
and is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service. Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as
other trade debtors within trade and other receivables (note 18).
(b) Government grants
Revenue grants received are credited to the income statement in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.
(c) Intangible assets arising on consolidation
Intangible assets arising on consolidation include all goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets identified at the time of
acquisition of an entity. Amortisation or impairment of these assets is disclosed on the face of the income statement.
2 Principal accounting policies
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1 Basis of preparation and first time adoption of IFRS continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 59
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets acquired. Fair values are determined based upon an assessment of the value of the
individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices and by discounting expected future cash flows to present value.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves. The transitional arrangements of IFRS3 “Business
Combinations” allow this goodwill to remain eliminated.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill was capitalised and, until 31 March 2004, was amortised to the income statement on
a straight line basis over its useful life. Since transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 goodwill is no longer amortised, but is subject to an annual
impairment review. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 April 2004, separately identifiable intangible assets have been recognised where applicable and are amortised
on a straight line basis over their useful economic life. Any residual goodwill is capitalised on the balance sheet and is subject to an annual
impairment review. Any impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements of IFRS3, goodwill previously recognised under UK GAAP has been included in the Group’s
opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 at net book value as an equivalent to fair value.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within intangible fixed assets. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal,
except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
(ii) Other separately identifiable intangible assets
For acquisitions since 1 April 2004, the Group has applied the provisions of IFRS3 “Business Combinations” and has separately identified
intangible assets where appropriate. These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships. Intangible assets acquired by
the Group are initially stated at fair value and subsequently adjusted for amortisation and any impairment. Impairment charges are
recognised in the income statement.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the income statement on an appropriate basis over their estimated
useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships 2 – 5 years
Customer contracts Period of contract
(d) Intangible assets arising from development expenditure
Development expenditure on software for electronic trading platforms is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions
of IAS38 “Intangible Assets”. Amortisation of these assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected
useful economic life of the asset of 3 – 5 years.
Amortisation of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before amortisation
and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items. Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which
the asset becomes available for use.
(e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value. It is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows:
Short leasehold property Period of lease
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 – 5 years
Motor vehicles 3 – 4 years
The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances. These rates are determined upon
consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels. 
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Group’s foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for
the expected future net cost of the property.
2 Principal accounting policies continued 60 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
(f) Leased assets
Assets financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group (finance leases)
are capitalised in the balance sheet. Lease repayments comprise both a capital element and a finance element. The capital element of the
leasing commitment is shown as an obligation to the lessor in the balance sheet and the finance element is charged to the income
statement on a constant periodic rate of change basis.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(g) Investment in associates
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not
control, over its operating and financial policies. An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of
securing a contribution to the Group’s activities. Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than
50% of the shareholders’ voting rights.
The consolidated financial information includes investments in associates under the equity method of accounting. The income statement
includes the Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of those entities. The balance sheet shows the Group’s share of the net assets
or liabilities of those entities, together with any attributable goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets.
(h) Investment in joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating
and financial policies. An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the
Group’s activities.
The consolidated Financial Statements include investments in joint ventures under the proportional consolidation method of accounting. 
The income statement and balance sheet include the Group’s share of the entities’ results and net assets on a line-by-line basis.
(i) Classification of financial assets
On adoption of IAS32 and IAS39, financial assets are classified as ‘available-for-sale’, ‘held-to-maturity’, ‘loans and receivables’ or ‘financial
assets at fair value through the income statement’. The two sub-classes for ‘financial assets at fair value through the income statement’
assets are ‘held-for-trading’ and ‘assets designated at fair value through the income statement’. The Group has no assets classified as ‘held
to maturity’. The classification and accounting treatment for all other financial assets are explained in the appropriate accounting policy note.
(j) Available for sale investments
Available for sale investments are initially recognised at fair value and at subsequent reporting dates any movements in value are recognised
directly in equity. When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in
equity is transferred to the income statement. The fair value of available for sale investments is determined by reference to a quoted market
price. Where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment. 
(k) Matched principal business
Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled. Under IAS32, the gross amounts due and receivable are disclosed in
the balance sheet as matched principal trade debtors and matched principal trade creditors (notes 18 and 19). The comparatives which have
been presented in accordance with UK GAAP, only include outstanding transactions that have gone beyond settlement date on a gross basis
(initially unsettled transactions).
(l) Matched stock lending business
Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties. Such trades
are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned. Under IAS32, the gross amounts of
collateral due and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities
loaned (notes 18 and 19). The comparatives which have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP include the net amount in deposits
received for securities loaned (note 19).
(m) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. These can 
include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and cross currency and interest rate swaps. Under IAS39, which the Group
adopted prospectively from 1 April 2005, all derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value
adjusted for transaction costs. The comparatives which have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP, do not recognise derivatives on
the balance sheet at fair value when they are hedging a defined financial risk. 
2 Principal accounting policies continued
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 61
The fair value of financial instrument derivatives is determined by appropriate valuation techniques as permitted by IAS39, including
discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where, under IAS39, financial instrument derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, resultant gains and losses are recognised
immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses on financial instrument derivatives which do qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges,
cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Fair value hedges: Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in
the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. The hedging instrument and hedged item are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with
changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
Cash flow hedges: Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in
cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. Gains or losses on designated cash flow
hedges are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are determined to be effective. Any remaining portion of the gain or loss is
recognised immediately in the income statement. On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses that had previously been
recognised directly in equity are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability. 
Net investment hedges: Changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in
equity. The accounting treatment for a net investment hedge is generally consistent with the treatment for a cash flow hedge.
(n) Client money
The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the FSA. Since the Group is not beneficially entitled
to these amounts, they are excluded from the Group balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to clients. The amounts held on
behalf of clients at the balance sheet date are included in note 33.
(o) Long-term borrowings
Long-term borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. At subsequent
reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method with changes in value recognised
through the income statement.
(p) Pension costs
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. The pension scheme deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the
difference between the fair value of the assets of the plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, net
of the deferred tax impact. The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will
arise from the specific assets held within the pension plan.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
(q) Employee share-based payment and share ownership trusts
From time to time, the Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes. The Group has
applied IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002. The fair value of services acquired is measured
by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting, and is charged to staff costs over the period the service is
received on a straight-line basis. A reserve of an equivalent amount is held on the balance sheet as part of the retained earnings.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various
parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAP’s share price. The expected
lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
Investments in own shares held in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes are deducted from shareholders’ equity. Purchases,
sales and transfers of own shares are disclosed as changes in equity.
(r) Taxation
Taxation on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years. Taxation is
charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the
deferred tax is also included within equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date. 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 62 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes
and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity
or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.
The Group is able to control the timing of dividends from its overseas entities and hence does not expect to remit overseas earnings in 
the foreseeable future in a way which would result in a tax charge. As a consequence deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained
earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued or a binding agreement to
distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary. 
No provision is made in respect of any further taxation liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint
ventures and associates.
(s) Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are taken to operating profit, except for
exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are taken directly to reserves. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the
date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange
rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of transaction. Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are
translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences
arising are classified within equity and transferred to the Group’s retained earnings. Cumulative translation differences arising after the
transition to IFRS are taken to the income statement on disposal of the net investment. 
In accordance with IAS29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint
ventures that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit at the balance sheet date
before they are translated into the presentational currency of the Group.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
translated at the closing rate. Where applicable the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of
transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the
average exchange rate for the year.
(t) Accounting estimates and provisions
The Group makes various judgements in applying its accounting policies and various assumptions and estimates when determining the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. The estimates, assumptions and judgements that have a significant impact on the Group’s
results and financial position are discussed below:
The Group reviews intangible assets arising on consolidation at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances suggest that an
impairment may have taken place. The Group tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of assets with their recoverable amount.
The calculation of the recoverable amount is based on discounted cash flows from financial budgets. This requires the use of estimates and
judgements in determining the budgeted profit after taxation, discount rate, and growth rates.
The Group provides for impairment of other trade debtors to estimate existing bad debts and amendments to sales invoices. The provision 
is estimated based on historic trends. An increase or decrease in these trends of 1% would not have a material effect on the net assets of
the Group.
The Group determines estimated useful economic lives of its intangible assets arising on development expenditure based on projected
lifecycles. Technological advances and other factors could result in these estimates no longer being appropriate. If actual useful economic
lives were to differ from the Group’s estimate by 10%, the carrying value of intangible assets would be £0.5m lower or £0.6m higher
respectively.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Group’s foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for
the expected future net cost of the property.

On 30 May 2006 the board proposed a final dividend of 7.5p per share for the year ended 31 March 2006. This has not been recognised as
a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the number of shares in issue at the year
end, the total amount payable would be £44.9m.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee benefit trusts.
Under IFRS the Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement. The Group will continue to calculate
an adjusted EPS measurement ratio in the notes to the Financial Statements as it believes that it is the most appropriate measurement
since it better reflects the Group’s underlying cash earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent of £117.2m 
(2005 – £107.5m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 597.5m shares (2005 – 586.9m).
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held by trusts relating to
employee share schemes to which the participating employees are not unconditionally entitled, being 9.2m shares (2005 – 9.9m).

(c) Contingent deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions in prior years
In the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004, the Group completed a number of acquisitions, to be satisfied in part by contingent
deferred consideration. The Group has re-estimated the deferred contingent consideration, with corresponding adjustments being made 
to goodwill.
The deferred contingent consideration for both First Brokers and ICAP Energy includes amounts payable in either cash or shares at the
Group’s option. The Group elected to settle such amounts that fell due in the year ended 31 March 2006 in cash. At 31 March 2006 it is
estimated that a further 1,004,916 shares may be issued. All such outstanding amounts have been included within trade and other payables
in accordance with IAS32. Previously these amounts were classified as equity.
During the year a final payment of £6.0m (2005 – £9.5m) was made in respect of the First Brokers acquisition, and a further payment of
£3.8m (2005 – £2.5m) was made in respect of the ICAP Energy acquisition. The final payment with respect to the ICAP Energy acquisition 
is due in June 2006.
In the year ended 31 March 2005 the Group issued 33,720,495 shares with a market value of £74.3m to the vendors of ICAP Electronic
Broking (formerly BrokerTec).

(a) Intangible assets arising on consolidation
Intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships
and customer contacts that arose on business combinations since 1 April 2004. The amortisation and any impairment is included in the
income statement within the column ‘amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation’.
During the year the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £5.0m in respect of pre-acquisition tax losses of ICAP Electronic Broking that
previously did not meet the criteria to be recognised. In accordance with IFRS3, a corresponding reduction in the goodwill relating to ICAP
Electronic Broking of £5.0m has been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement within amortisation and impairment of
intangibles arising on consolidation.

(a) Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and treasury (liquidity) risk. The Group’s
overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on
the Group’s financial performance.
The overall financial risk management framework, strategy and policies of the Group are determined by the board. It does this through two
board committees, the Group Risk and Treasury Committees, and also by regional and market risk committees.
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to the US dollar and euro. Market risk
arising from movements in foreign exchange rates is identified and monitored on a daily basis. Such risks are managed by operating bank
accounts in foreign currencies and by using external forward currency contracts and options.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk is managed by the Treasury Committee by the use of a limited number of interest rate swaps and other
interest rate derivatives.
Credit risk
The Group transacts business on an agency or matched principal basis and therefore its exposure to credit risk, and significant
concentrations of credit risk, is limited. The Group has global policies and procedures in place to ensure that counterparties are of
appropriate credit worthiness and that limits are set and monitored at entity, parent and country level to restrict the exposure to potential
losses.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings
assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets.
Treasury risk
Prudent treasury risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and ensuring the availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit. The Group maintains sufficient resources to finance its operations as monitored by the
Treasury Committee.
The Group’s approach to managing financial risk is also described in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 32 to 37. 84 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006

Where these are designated and documented as hedging instruments in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be both effective and
efficient, mark to market gains and losses are recognised directly in equity and transferred to the income statement upon recognition of the
underlying revenue being hedged. The table below shows the unrecognised gains and losses in respect of these hedges at the beginning and
end of the year.
Prior to the completion of the $225m long term borrowing, the Group entered into a treasury lock-in derivative to partially hedge the interest
rate. The closing fair value of the derivative was taken directly to equity and is being transferred to the income statement upon recognition of
the underlying interest.

Group has designated the long-term borrowing of $225m as a hedging instrument against the underlying exposure. Gains and losses on
revaluation are recognised directly in equity to offset the revaluation of the net investment.

25 Share options continued
All share options granted since 7 November 2002 are subject to IFRS2 “Share-based Payment”. A charge to the income statement based on
the fair value of each option is made each year. The fair value of each option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
following assumptions have been used in calculating the fair value of the options:
All options over ICAP shares are issued at market price on the date of grant, except for those in the SEEPP and BSMP, where the exercise price is 
a nominal £1.00 for the basic award and £1.00 for the matching award, and the SAYE where the options are issued with a 20% discount on
market price.

Estimated share volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company’s shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option. 
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the share price over the last three years from the date of grant of the option.
(i) Unapproved Share Option Plan (UESOP)
The UESOP is not approved by HMRC and is open to all executives. The grants of options have a maximum overall grant of four times annual
salary including bonuses. Options do not vest unless the Group has achieved certain performance criteria (currently growth in earnings per
share in excess of growth in RPI by an average of 3% per annum over a three-year period).
UESOP options were outstanding over 3,870,560 (2005 – 4,885,560) ordinary shares at exercise prices ranging between 42.4p and 263.0p
per share. Subject to the Group's performance during the vesting period, these options are exercisable between December 2001 and
December 2014. A charge of £0.3m (2005 – £0.3m) has been made to the income statement in the year in respect of options granted 
since 7 November 2002.
(ii) Sharesave scheme (SAYE)
The SAYE scheme is approved by HMRC. The scheme enables directors and eligible employees to acquire options over ordinary shares of the
Company at a discount of up to 20% of their market price using the proceeds of a related SAYE contract. All UK employees who have worked
for the minimum qualifying period on an invitation date are eligible to join the scheme. Options granted under the SAYE scheme are not
subject to performance conditions.

(iii) Senior Executive Equity Participation Plans (SEEPP)
The SEEPP is not approved by HMRC. The SEEPP is a long-term incentive plan where senior executives are invited to waive part of their
potential cash bonus in return for rights over the number of shares that can be purchased with the foregone bonus at the market value 
of the Company’s shares on the date of grant (a basic award). Participants may also be granted a provisional allocation over additional
shares (a matching award). These shares are transferred to the executive on a sliding scale if they remain in the Company’s employment 
as follows: no shares for up to three years; 40% following completion of three years, but less than four years; and the remaining 60% on the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant. No performance criteria are attached to these options.
UK SEEPP
SEEPP options were outstanding over 672,790 (2005 – 490,168) ordinary shares at an exercise price of a nominal sum of 100.0p 
(2005 – 100.0p). Subject to the participants remaining in the employment of the Group during the vesting period, these options will normally
be exercisable between June 2002 and November 2015. Under UK GAAP, the Group charged the cost of these options to the income
statement. For options issued since 7 November 2002 the UK GAAP charges have been reversed. A charge of £0.2m (2005 – £0.1m) was
made to the income statement in respect of these options in the year.
US SEEPP
SEEPP options were outstanding over 457,825 (2005 – 902,625) ordinary shares at an exercise price of 25.6p per share (2005 – 23.6p 
per share). Subject to the participants remaining in the employment of the Group during the vesting period, these options will normally 
be exercisable between June 2002 and May 2009. Under UK GAAP, the Group charged the cost of these shares to the income statement. 
All these options were granted before 7 November 2002 and therefore no further charges have been made to the income statement in
respect of these options in the year.
(iv) Unapproved Company Share Option Plan (UCSOP)
The UCSOP is not approved by HMRC. Options may be granted to any eligible employee within the Group. No option may be granted to any
individual at any time if, as a result, the aggregate number of shares issued or issuable to the individual under the plan would exceed
1,250,000. Options vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that, on the date 
of vesting, earnings per share growth exceeds growth in RPI by an average of 3% per annum over the preceding three years.
UCSOP options were outstanding over 6,936,333 (2005 – 6,986,177) ordinary shares at exercise prices ranging between 84.2p and 297.0p
per share. Subject to the Company’s performance during the vesting period, these options will normally be exercisable between March 2004
and June 2015. A charge of £0.5m (2005 – £0.4m) has been made to the income statement in the year in respect of options granted since
7 November 2002.
(v) Bonus Share Matching Plan (BSMP)
The BSMP is not approved by HMRC. The BSMP is a long-term incentive plan where executive directors of the Company are invited to waive
50% of their potential cash bonus in return for rights over the number of shares that can be purchased with the foregone bonus at the
market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant (a basic award). Participants are also granted a provisional allocation over 
an equal amount of additional shares (a matching award). These shares are transferred to the director if they remain in the Company’s
employment for three years and the Group meets certain performance criteria – currently growth in earnings per share in excess of growth 
in RPI by at least 9% over the three years from the date of grant. The performance criteria apply to all grants since 1 April 2004.
BSMP options were outstanding over 6,892,340 (2005 – 4,734,576) ordinary shares. These shares will be exercisable between 28 May
2006 and a date twelve months from the date the Group announces its results for the year ending 31 March 2008. A promise to deliver 
a further 1,058,782 (2005 – 690,384) ordinary shares has also been made by the Company. Under UK GAAP the Group charged the cost 
of these options to the income statement: these charges have been reversed. A charge of £2.7m (2005 – £2.1m) has been made to the
income statement in respect of these options in the year.
Executive share options have not been offered at a discount (save as permitted by paragraph 9.4.4 and 9.5.4 of the Listing Rules).
The total charge to the income statement in respect of employee share options in the year was £4.4m (2005 – £3.3m).
The fair value of options granted during the year was £4.5m (2005 – £3.6m).
At the close of business on 31 March 2006, the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares was 447.5p per share and during the year
fluctuated in the range 256.0p and 484.25p per share.

The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Germany. In the case of the schemes operating in Germany, any future
obligations that the Group may incur in respect of benefits accrued to members in respect of past service are insured with local insurance
companies. The scheme in Germany is not significant in the context of the Group.
The US scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 July 1996 and no benefits have accrued to the members of the scheme in respect of their
service after that date. For the purposes of determining the Group’s pension cost, the scheme is valued on an annual basis by qualified
independent actuaries. The most recent valuation was as at 1 January 2005 with an update as at 31 March 2006 and used the projected
unit method. The Group expects to contribute £0.8m to its defined benefit pension plan in the year ended 31 March 2007. Details of the
scheme are provided below.
The actuarial assessment was based on the following principal assumptions: 
2006 2005

Group
(a) In July 2003, it was announced that two of the Group’s subsidiaries and the Company were among those being sued in connection with
an alleged infringement of patent number 6,560,580 (580 Patent) in the United States of America. The Group rejected the claim.
The jury trial commenced on 7 February 2005. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the claimants stated their damage claims against the
defendants, including the Group, to be an amount of up to $104m as at 30 September 2004. On the first day of trial, the Court dismissed
all of the monetary claims against the Group. The Court also dismissed all of the claims challenging use of the OM Click Exchange System
for ICAP Electronic Broking LLC (formerly BrokerTec USA LLC) (“IEB”).
The case then proceeded to trial on the limited issue of the claimants’ request for injunctive relief as to the use of a second computer
system, the ICAP Securities USA LLC (formerly Garban LLC) (“ICAP Securities”) GTN and on the Group’s counterclaim for judgment declaring
that the ICAP Securities GTN did not infringe the 580 Patent. On 22 February 2005, the jury found that the application for the 580 Patent
failed to provide an adequate written description in certain of the 580 Patent claims. In addition, the jury found that the ICAP Securities GTN
infringed certain claims of the 580 Patent, but that the claimed infringement had not been wilful.
On 4 April 2005, the claimants and the Group filed post-trial applications. On 12 December 2005, the Court ruled on the claimants’ and the
Group’s applications pertaining to the jury’s verdict and denied all applications, thus leaving the jury’s verdict undisturbed.
On 22 February 2006, the Court ruled on the Group’s application pertaining to claimants’ asserted inequitable conduct in the prosecution of
the 580 Patent. The Court ruled in favour of the Group and declared that the 580 Patent was procured by inequitable conduct and as a
result was unenforceable.
A final order as to all matters decided by the jury and the Court was entered on 3 April 2006. On 27 April 2006 a claimant filed a Notice of
Appeal seeking to appeal the jury’s decision and the Court’s ruling.
At this stage it is not possible to predict the outcome with certainty or to determine the extent of liability, if any, of the Group following 
any appeal, but based on current available information and after consultation with the Group’s lawyers the directors continue to expect 
a successful outcome for the Group. No provision has been made in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
(b) ICAP plc has received correspondence from National Australia Bank (NAB) alleging that revaluation data, supplied by an individual within
ICAP-Nittan Pte Limited (ICAP-Nittan), one of ICAP’s Singapore subsidiaries, and a member of the TFS-ICAP joint venture, helped mask trading
losses in NAB’s foreign exchange options business.
On 27 January 2004 NAB announced that it incurred foreign exchange option trading losses of A$360 million (£158 million). Detailed
reports following full investigations into these losses were published by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority in March 2004 and indicated that NAB incurred these foreign exchange trading losses between April 2003 and January
2004. The PwC report includes descriptions of how certain NAB dealers concealed losses by processing false spot foreign exchange and false
foreign exchange option transactions, booking one-sided internal foreign exchange option transactions and using incorrect dealing rates for
genuine transactions. The reports analyse the cause of these trading losses, including the methods of concealment allegedly employed by
the NAB dealers, repeated failures of NAB risk management, absence of NAB financial controls, gaps in NAB back office procedures,
inadequate NAB corporate governance and NAB corporate cultural weaknesses. NAB accepted the findings of the PwC report on 28 April 2004.
Neither ICAP-Nittan nor any other member of the ICAP Group or TFS-ICAP accept any responsibility for these NAB foreign exchange trading
losses and intend to vigorously contest any claim which may be made against them in this matter.
ICAP-Nittan has been informed that a similar allegation has been asserted by NAB against another inter-dealer broker, which is not a party to
the TFS-ICAP joint venture, in respect of these foreign exchange options trading losses.
It is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome with certainty nor to determine the extent of liability, if any, of ICAP plc or ICAP-Nittan.
No provision has been made in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
(c) From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation on employee related and other matters. It is not possible to quantify the extent of
such liabilities but they are not expected to have a material, adverse effect on the Group’s results or net assets.
(d) In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees to cover trading arrangements.
Company
The company has provided a guarantee in respect of the $225m subordinated debt private placement.

At 31 March 2006 the Group held client money of £36.3m (2005 – £5.6m). This amount, together with the corresponding liabilities to
clients, is not included in the Group’s balance sheet.
(a) EBS
On 21 April 2006, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire all of the share capital of EBS, a provider of foreign exchange trading
and market data solutions to the professional spot foreign exchange community. The acquisition of EBS is expected to be completed by 
5 June 2006.
The consideration for 100% of the share capital of EBS is payable in cash with a partial share alternative. Following the announcement 
on 16 May 2006 that the EBS shareholders have elected to receive the maximum number of shares on offer, the consideration is 
US$517 million in cash and the issue of 36.1 million new ICAP shares. Based on the closing ICAP share price of 529 pence on 15 May
2006, the day before the release of the announcement, the aggregate consideration would be $876 million. The new ICAP shares issued as
part of the transaction will be subject to lock-up arrangements for a period of six months.
The cash consideration to be paid to EBS shareholders will be financed by a combination of ICAP's internal cash resources and debt. 
ICAP has an underwritten commitment for the total amount of required debt finance.
(b) Electronic Traveller Limited 
Since the year end the Group has acquired the business of Electronic Traveller Limited (ETL), a company registered in the British Virgin
Islands, for initial cash consideration of £5.5m (US$9.7m). ETL is a provider of global electronic interest rate and currency derivatives
brokerage services.
The balance of the consideration payable in cash is dependant upon the performance of the company in the period from 3 April 2006 to 
31 December 2008. The total consideration is capped at £100m.
(c) ICAP Energy LLC 
On 25 May 2006, it was decided that ICAP would exercise its option to satisfy £4.5m of the final deferred contingent consideration payment
in respect of ICAP Energy LLC in cash rather than shares. These shares were included in the balance sheet as 31 March 2006 within trade
and other payables.

On 1 April 2005, the Group adopted IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively. The revaluation and reclassification of certain amounts to comply with
these standards resulted in a number of adjustments to the opening balance sheet. A reconciliation of these adjustments is detailed below:
(a) Matched principal transactions
Matched principal transactions, including collaterised stock lending transactions, are now shown gross in trade and other receivables and
trade and other payables. The adjustment required on 1 April 2005 was a gross-up to trade and other receivables and trade and other
payables of £175,310.8m. The net effect on the net assets of the Group was nil.
(b) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments were recognised on the balance sheet as at 1 April 2005. The fair value
of these hedging instruments was £4.7m which was credited to the hedging reserve. The fair value of other derivative financial instruments
of £2.7m, that did not meet the hedging criteria, were immediately recognised as a charge to equity within retained earnings. The net effect
on the net assets of the Group was an increase of £2.0m.
(c) Contingent share capital
The contingent share capital is considered to be a liability under IAS39, and therefore has been reclassified to trade and other payables from
equity. This results in a decrease in the net assets of the Group as at 1 April 2005 of £7.0m.
(d) Other adjustments
Other IAS32 and IAS39 adjustments as at 1 April 2005 represent:
(i) A credit to the revaluation reserve of £4.3m. This is due to the revaluation of available for sale investments to fair value of £2.8m 
(note 17), a revaluation to fair value of the net assets of an associate of £2.3m (note 16), offset by the recognition of a loss on a fair value
hedge of £0.8m.
(ii) Other investments of £4.1m have been reclassified to trading investments.
(iii) Trade and other receivables and retained earnings have been reduced by £0.2m due to a change in the Group’s policy for the impairment
of trade debtors.

The notes below provide a brief summary of the reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS. A detailed explanation of the reconciling items
was provided in the IFRS Transition Report published on 13 July 2005. A copy of the Transition Report is available at www.icap.com.
The reconciliations are provided in full, and the notes refer to the various adjustments shown in those tables.
(a) In accordance with IAS10 “Events after the Balance Sheet Date”, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised 
as liabilities.
(b) In accordance with IFRS3 “Business Combinations”, goodwill is no longer amortised on a systematic basis but is instead tested on 
a regular basis for impairment. UK GAAP amortisation since 1 April 2004 has been reversed.
(c) IAS1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be shown separately on the face of the
balance sheet.
(d) In accordance with IAS31 “Interests in Joint Ventures”, joint ventures are proportionately consolidated and the Group’s share of their
assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet.
(e) In accordance with IFRS3, the Group has recognised separately identifiable intangible assets on acquisitions since 1 April 2004.
(f) The pension fund deficit is required to be disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet. The deficit has been calculated in
accordance with the Group’s stated accounting policy under IAS19 “Employee Benefits”.
(g) IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” requires an expense to be recorded in the income statement for all forms of share-based payments.
(h) Short-term provisions include “holiday pay accruals” as required by IAS19.
(i) Trade and other receivables due after more than one year are shown separately on the face of the balance sheet. Under UK GAAP they
had been included within current assets, but disclosed separately in the notes.
(j) Short-term borrowings and overdrafts are now disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
(k) Tax payable is required to be disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
(l) Obligations under finance leases are required to be disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
(m) In accordance with IAS28 “Investments in Associates”, the Group will continue to account for associates on an equity basis, although its

Notes
1 Transfer
If you have sold or transferred all of your shares, you should pass this documentation and the form of proxy to the
person through whom the sale or transfer was effected for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
2 Appointment of proxies
A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint a proxy or proxies who need not be a member of the Company to
attend (and on a poll, to vote) instead of him or her. Forms of proxy must be returned so as to be received by the
Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex BN99 6LU, not later than
10.30am on Monday, 17 July 2006, (being 48 hours before the time of the meeting). Appointing a proxy will not
preclude a member attending and voting in person at the meeting.
Appointment of proxies electronically
Shareholders who would prefer to register the appointment of their proxy electronically via the internet can do so
through Lloyds TSB Registrars’ website at www.sharevote.co.uk using their personal Authentication Reference
Number (this is a series of 24 numbers printed under the shareholder’s name on the form). Alternatively,
shareholders who have already registered with Lloyds TSB Registrars’ online portfolio service Shareview can appoint
their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on ‘Company Meetings’. 
Full details and instructions on these electronic proxy facilities are given on these websites.
Appointment of proxies through CREST 
Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST, you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST
electronic proxy appointment service. Further details are contained below.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies for the Annual General Meeting, including any
adjournment(s) thereof, through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures
described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST
members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST
message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCO’s specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message,
regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given for a
previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by Lloyds TSB Registrars 
(ID 7RA01) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified above. For this purpose, the time of receipt
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications
Host) from which Lloyds TSB Registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner
prescribed by CREST.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member 
or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s))
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service
provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the
CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat a CREST Proxy Instruction as invalid in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. Annual Report 2006   ICAP plc 123
3 Right to attend and vote
Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that in order to
have the right to attend and vote at the meeting (and also for the purpose of calculating how many votes a person
entitled to attend and vote may cast) a person must be entered on the register of holders of the ordinary shares of
the Company by not later than 6pm on 17 July 2006 (being two business days before the time fixed for the meeting).
Changes to entries on the register after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend or vote at the meeting and the number of shares on which they can vote.
4 Documents on display
The Register of directors’ interests in the share capital and debentures of the Company, together with copies of the
service agreements under which directors of the Company are employed and copies of the terms and conditions of
appointment of non-executive directors, are available for inspection at all times at the Company’s registered office
during normal business hours from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting, and will

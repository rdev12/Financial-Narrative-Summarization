BGEO Group Annual Report 2015 GROUP
Changes in regulation in Georgia and our new strategy, both of 
which were announced in 2014, created the need for a new legal 
structure in Georgia. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) 
announced its intention to regulate banks in Georgia on a stand-
alone basis and thereby limit investments in non-banking 
subsidiaries by locally regulated banking entities. 
In order to comply with the regulation to separate the banking and 
investment businesses as well as highlight our new strategy to 
grow Bank of Georgia’s (BOG or the Bank) strong retail and 
corporate banking franchise as well as capture compelling 
investment opportunies, we established a fully owned subsidiary, 
JSC BGEO Group, under Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC to serve 
as the Georgian holding company for the Group. We then grouped 
our subsidaries into separate banking and investment businesses 
under JSC BGEO Group, which was completed in August 2015. 
At the time of completion of the Georgian restructuring, we 
announced our intention to change the name of Bank of Georgia 
Holdings PLC to BGEO Group PLC to reflect the new Group 
structure and strategy. The name change became effective in 
November 2015.
BGEO Group PLC
BGEO Group PLC (BGEO or the 
Company) is a UK incorporated 
holding company of a Georgia-
based banking group with an 
investment arm (BGEO and its 
subsidiaries, the Group). It aims to

20% ROAE and at least 20% 
growth of retail loan book in banking 
business, and at least 20% IRR and

investment business.
Banking Business
Our Banking Business comprises at least 80% of the 
Group’s profit and consists of Retail Banking, Corporate 
Banking and Investment Management businesses at its 
core and other banking businesses such as P&C

operations in Belarus (BNB). The Group strives to benefit 
from the underpenetrated banking sector in Georgia 
especially through its Retail Banking services.

Group’s profit and consists of Georgia Healthcare Group 
(Healthcare Business) – an LSE (London Stock Exchange 
PLC) premium segment listed company, m
2
 Real Estate 
(Real Estate Business), Georgia Global Utilities (Utility 
Business or GGU) and Teliani Valley (Beverage Business).

in a number of underdeveloped markets and the Group 
is well positioned to capture growth opportunities in the 
Georgian corporate sector.

4x20 strategy going forward
Going forward we plan to increase the relative size of our highly profitable Retail Banking business 
and to generate additional non-interest income from advisory and other fee-generating businesses.  
In addition, we plan to make further equity investments in areas outside our core banking operations. 
4x20 strategy in 2015 4x20 strategy going forward
At the end of 2015, the Board updated 
our strategy with the aim of making it 
more relevant. While we are committed to 
growing our business while maintaining 
our existing strong capitalisation, Tier I 
c.20% became non-relevant, as regulation 
moved to Basel 2/3. Additionally, in the 
context of excess capital of c.GEL 600 
million at BGEO Group, we aim to have 
efficient capital management at the Bank. 
To reflect this, at the end of 2015, we 
have updated our 4x20 strategy, which is 
focused on enhancing BGEO’s profitability 
by optimising capital allocation. This 
includes our continued commitment to 
the Bank’s highly profitable retail franchise 
and augmenting the Group returns 
through carefully targeted direct equity 
investments, with a clear exit strategy and 
targeted IRR above 20%, to contribute 
up to 20% of the Group’s profits.
Our key goal is to continue producing 
high returns in the long run for our 
shareholders. Currently, we see that Retail 
Banking is producing over 30% ROAE 
while Corporate Banking is producing 
c.15% ROAE. Therefore, we want to 
increase the share of retail banking 
portfolio to 65% over the next three years.
Due to the limited access to capital 
and management in a small frontier 
economy such as Georgia, we continue 
to see a much better risk return profile 
when investing in Georgian companies 
than when lending to those same 
corporates. We also believe that the 
Group can add value for our shareholders 
by investing in opportunities, which 
currently are not accessible to our 
shareholders, changing management 
and governance, institutionalising and 
scaling up the companies, and most 
importantly, unlocking value by exiting 
from these companies over time. BGEO’s 
management has a proven track record 
of creating value through successful 
business development and investments.

Georgia Healthcare 
Group (GHG) 
A long-term, high-growth 
investment story 
 
GHG is the largest healthcare 
services and medical insurance 
provider operating in the 
fast-growing, predominantly 
privately owned, Georgian 
healthcare market, which is 
characterised by low utilisation 
and high fragmentation, leaving 
significant room for medium 
to long-term growth. Our 
healthcare services business 
had a 26.6% market share as 
of 31 December 2015, with 
2,670 hospital beds and it 
has the widest geographic 
coverage among its peers with 
facilities located in six regions 
that contain three-quarters 
of the population of Georgia. 
GHG is also the largest 
medical insurer in Georgia with 
a 38.4% market share as of 
31 December 2015, based on 
revenue and with approximately 
234,000 people holding 
GHG’s medical insurance 
policies as of 31 December 
2015. In November 2015, 
GHG completed an initial 
public offering on the premium 
segment of the London Stock 
Exchange (GHG:LN). BGEO 
holds a 65% stake in GHG 
as of the date of this report.

Strategic report Overview
Chairman’s statement
Through this letter, I would like to 
cover four important points: 
1. the current economic and political 
situation in Georgia is solid and its 
outlook promising; 
2. the strategy announced last year is 
more relevant than ever; 
3. the role of corporate governance is a 
keystone of our way of doing business; 
and
4. talent management and incentives drive 
our performance.
I will elaborate on each of these messages 
below.
Politics and the economy 
Last year we witnessed a democratic, 
peaceful change of government. The 
political situation in Georgia is still 
complicated, but a helpful way to look 
at it is across two levels: firstly, on a 
domestic basis, and secondly, on an 
international one, with a particular 
emphasis on its relationship with Russia. 
Let me start by going over a few facts 
about the situation within the country. 
The recent appointment of a strong 
prime minister has brought about a 
number of initiatives, including a four-
point plan to speed up economic 
growth. Highlights include a reform of the 
education system, which aims to create 
professional higher education systems 
in line with the demands of the labour 
market, tax code amendments aimed 
at further liberalizing tax and customs 
procedures, policies to speed up the 
implementation of infrastructure projects, 
and governance reform to allow legal 
entities to receive services based on a 
single window principle, similarly to how 
individuals currently receive services 
at public service halls in Georgia. 
In addition, governance of the country has 
progressed. Firstly, the judiciary system 
has been reformed, and the courts in 
Georgia are now independent. Secondly, 
the President has created an institutionally 
distinct office for the Presidency, which 
reinforces checks and balances. Thirdly, 
the Central Bank now has a respected new 
governor with an IMF background and an 
independent board has been named to 
check its power. Finally, the country enjoys 
independent TV stations and newspapers, 
representing many points of views. 
We will have the next Parliamentary 
elections in October 2016, which could 
either lead to a more pluralistic political 
situation or a reelection of the current 
government. It is difficult to predict the 
outcome, but on the whole the country 
has been moving in the right direction 
with a peaceful and democratic change 
of government. The new government 
favours competence over loyalty, and a 
reaffirmation of its pro-Western position 
with the signing and implementation of 
an EU association agreement. Finally, the 
assets of the country are being developed, 
principally tourism and water. This points 
to a promising path ahead, although 
not necessarily a predictable one. 
On the international front, relations 
with Russia have improved and Russia 
has been focusing on other fronts. 
The majority of the population, 70% to 
be precise, would not trade today for 
yesterday. Georgia will continue its quest 
for NATO membership, ensuring close 
cooperation but probably not accession. 
Most promising for Georgia is the entry 
of Iran into the community of nations. On 
the Iranian New Year in 2016, numerous 
tourists could be seen in Tbilisi. One 
can hope that investments might follow 
and that Georgia could become an 
important trade partner to this nation. 
In fact, Georgia could do extremely well. 
The country’s success will be built on 
tourism, rich ecology and casinos. It will 
require a service infrastructure of hotels, 
banks and eventually hospitals. It will 
also bring investment in transportation, 
pipelines, railroads, and ports to connect 
to its neighbours. The industrial strategy 
of this country is right. It is pragmatic 
and, if anything, it is too prudent. Most 
importantly, BGEO plays a crucial role 
in it. One could say that what is good 
for Georgia is good for BGEO. 
Our new strategy is promising
Last year we adopted a two-pronged 
strategy. Firstly, we would continue to 
make the Bank of Georgia a cost and 
Neil Janin
Chairman
“I am proud to announce  
that BGEO performed very 
well, reporting GEL 310.9 
million in profit, which 
demonstrates year over year 
growth of 29. 1 %. This is 
particularly impressive 
considering the challenges 
we have faced in 2015, 
including weak oil  
prices, foreign exchange 
fluctuations, and a  
complex political context. 
The Group’s results are 
presented in our CEO’s  
letter and in various  
sections of this report.” Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   7

innovation leader. The Bank is our most 
precious asset and it continues to perform 
well and deliver as you will read later in this 
report. Secondly, we aim to buy assets in 
Georgia cheaply, grow them, and sell them 
to investors at a higher price. This way 
we will make money for our shareholders, 
bring money in the local economy, 
and provide foreign investors with an 
opportunity to own high-yielding assets. 
Let me start with the Bank. We appointed 
a new CEO for Bank of Georgia, Murtaz 
Kikoria, and promoted Irakli Gilauri to 
Chairman of the Bank. We wanted to have 
one person concentrate on minding the 
day to day affairs of the Bank, allowing 
Irakli Gilauri to focus on our new ventures. 
Murtaz is the orchestra conductor we 
need to lead and support the very strong 
cast of top executives of the Bank. With 
the support of Irakli Gilauri, his mission is 
to make sure that the Bank continues to 
perform and transform itself. The Bank’s 
agenda is full. In the retail bank, we are 
preparing to change the approach of our 
main branches from a product to a client 
one. This means that we will focus on 
client needs in order to propose suitable 
products, rather than push products to 
all clients in an indiscriminate manner. 
It involves a major cultural change and 
a transformation of our processes, the 
configuration of our branches and most 
importantly the mindset of our employees. 
We have also decided to merge the 
areas of corporate banking, investment 
banking, and wealth management. We 
are well regarded in this domain, and have 
accumulated a wealth of knowledge and 
capital markets capabilities in the Georgian 
and neighbouring markets during the 
past several years through our corporate 
advisory, research and brokerage 
practices united under Galt & Taggart. Galt 
& Taggart research aims to help decision 
makers – policymakers, International 
financial institutions, businesses and 
foreign investors – appreciate the 
opportunities of investing in Georgia and 
the South Caucasus. In this context, our 
wealth management/investment banking 
business has plenty of room to grow.
Our 2015 highlight was the successful 
IPO of Georgia Healthcare Group 
PLC on the London Stock Exchange. 
We were able to float c.35% of GHG 
and raise US$ 100 million that we 
will invest to grow GHG further. 
What we are doing in health care is a 
good illustration of the uniqueness of our 
strategy, which has three components. 
Firstly, we can buy assets cheaper than 
others. Why? Assets in Georgia are small 
and owned by individuals who need a lot of 
hand-holding in Georgian - something that 
foreign buyers have neither the ability nor 
the time to do. We may have bought more 
than 40 hospitals, but they were bought 
one by one, often from local doctors who 
made their own decisions, and would 
not just sell to anyone with money.
Secondly, we provided our health care 
subsidiary with very capable managers, 
starting with its CEO Nikoloz Gamkrelidze. 
Nick is a good example of a manager 
who developed his skills over the course 
of his career at the Bank of Georgia. We 
grow this talent within the Bank, as it is 
difficult to find local managers capable 
of executing sophisticated strategies. 
Otherwise, we sometimes attract Georgian 
talent from Europe or the US. These 
people will only return if they are offered a 
sizeable challenge, a promise of personal 
development, attractive incentives, and an 
overall feeling that they are contributing to 
the well-being of the country. Small, family 
owned companies cannot do that, nor can 
foreign investors. We are putting a special 
emphasis on talent in this annual report. 
Thirdly, we have implemented world class 
governance systems including a robust 
Board. If you look at the Board of GHG, 
you will see a mixture of members who 
have experience in Georgia, as well as new 
independent members chosen for their 
competence and judgment. In this specific 
case: insurance, medicine, medical 
supply, and hospital management. We 
intend to replicate this set up in all areas 
that we are committed to developing.
GHG is not our only investment. Irakli 
Gilauri will give you a short description of 
our portfolio investments, which include 
real estate, utilities, power generation, and 
consumer goods. We look at our portfolio 
of investments as trees in a forest: some 
are mature and solid, others are promising 
saplings. When we see an opportunity to 
create value, we will not hesitate to bet on 
it. Similarly, if we cannot see potential, we 
will hold back. Unlike a private equity firm, 
we are under no pressure or obligation to 
invest any of our reserves, and if we cannot 
find interesting opportunities, we will 
return the money to shareholders, either 
through dividends or stock buybacks. 
Corporate governance and talent 
development
The Board plays an important role in 
our companies. The BGEO board is 
composed of an array of highly competent 
individuals with complementary skill sets 
needed to run our businesses. The board 
works collectively with management to 
set the strategy and review operations. 
In fact, we set aside days every year to 
review asset allocation and investments. 
We encourage dialogue and discussion 
before taking any decision. 
Additionally, each member is encouraged 
to interact with management members as 
advisors. The nature of contribution varies, 
from providing expertise and judgement to 
coaching and development. Allow me to 
introduce them to you: Hanna Loikkanen 
is very experienced investor in Russia 
and the CJS. She brings her wisdom 
and judgment as an investment manager 
to evaluating our investments. David 
Morrison, the Board’s vice chairman, is 
our guardian. He is aware of our fiduciary 
responsibilities and regulatory obligations, 
making sure we do the right things the 
right way. His long tenure at Sullivan and 
Cromwell in New York, Paris and Frankfurt 
serves him well in this regard. Al Breach is 
an outstanding macro-economic investor. 
His point of view is invaluable in making 
funding decisions and advising the Bank 
on its asset and liability management. 
Kaha Kiknavelidze is also a macro investor 
who, as a Georgian, gives us an insight 
into the local economy which we would 
not otherwise have. Tamaz Georgadze is 
the second Georgian on our Board with a 
specialty in digital and retail banking. He 
heads his own very successful FinTech 
company based in Berlin, and was one 
of the foremost retail banking experts 
at McKinsey. Kim Bradley is our real 
estate guru, with 25 years’ experience 
behind him in multiple markets. One of 
the contributions he made to m

Strategic report Overview
real estate subsidiary, was helping them 
build their risk management system and 
manage their liquidity risk. Last but not 
least, Bozidar Djelic, with an extensive 
experience in government, as a banker, 
and as advisor to a number of countries, 
helps us with government relations, capital 
markets, and provides the group with a rich 
perspective and judgment in this region. 
My job is to manage the Board, ensure 
that we have the right people on the 
board and in leadership positions in 
the key areas of the Bank, and facilitate 
and frame discussions on all areas, but 
especially on strategy and execution. 
It is worth mentioning that the board 
meets without the CEO at every board 
meeting and that we run regular third 
party evaluations of our effectiveness and 
continue to rank very highly. We still lack 
the diversity that we would like to see, but 
we are working on it. We had promised to 
onboard two women, but have only invited 
one so far. We are actively searching. 
Finally, the Board of course fulfils its 
fiduciary duties. We have meaningful 
discussions in the committees, as 
you will see in the reports of the 
Chairmen of each committee below.
Succession planning and Talent 
management
This is a young company and the top 
managers of the organization are the 
ones who built it. The Board is aware and 
concerned by the necessity of preparing 
a new generation of leaders for the long 
term. It is our highest priority today. We 
have encouraged the bank to change the 
scope of its human resources strategy 
and to develop a pipeline of leaders at 
an early stage. Promising employees 
should be tracked and developed by 
giving them appropriate opportunities and 
timely leadership and technical training. 
For those already at the top, the incentive 
system is as follows: our partners, 15 in 
total, take home the minimum they need 
 to live well, with the rest being stock 
vesting in five years. If they make the 
shareholders rich in the long term, 
they too will be rich. There are no ways 
for executives to finesse the system 
and play the short term. Above all, no 
cash, just stock vesting in five years. 
It is not an appropriate incentive 
system for every company. For ours, 
a young growing company, it works 
and keeps everyone’s mind focused 
on making money for shareholders.
Beyond top management, we are 
committed to building a culture where 
personal growth and development are 
encouraged. We are making a point to 
show you our top 100 executives in this 
report. We have made changes to our 
human resources management and 
we intend to reinforce our capacity to 
attract, develop and promote talent in 
all areas of the group. We have named 
one of our most creative executives as 
head of HR, with a precise mandate.
Regarding succession, the Board has a 
definite plan of what we would do in the 
case that our current CEO is no longer 
able to continue. He has been key to our 
success. However, we are building the 
bench behind Irakli Gilauri by promoting 
more people to positions that cover duties 
he was doing directly. We cannot replace 
Irakli Gilauri, but we can build talent around 
him and introduce a way of doing business 
that will become BGEO’s trademark and 
culture. Irakli is keen to see that happen 
and is showing the way to all his team. 
I hope this letter has helped inform our 
shareholders of the current situation of 
BGEO and its promising outlook. While the 
strategy and future of group is solid and 
the political context promising, investing 
in operations in countries such as Georgia 
can still feel daunting. Therefore as a final 
point, I wanted to highlight our liquidity 
situation which will allow us to weather 
whatever storm may come in our path and 
enable us to achieve long term success. 
Irakli Gilauri elaborates on this below. 
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, the 
Board intends to recommend an annual 
dividend of GEL 2.4 per share payable 
in British Pound Sterling at the prevailing 
rate. This is in the range of our payout 
ratio target of 25-40% and represents a 
14% increase over the 2014 dividend.
Chairman’s statement continued
I feel very fortunate and proud to be part 
of the remarkable journey of this institution 
and this country. I am proud of the work 
accomplished by CEO Irakli Gilauri and his 
entire management team. I am touched 
by their desire to not only build a great 
company, but also do well for the country. 
Finally, I am grateful for the investors 
who trust them with their money. I think 
they too can be proud and take comfort 
in the returns on their investment.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Dear Shareholders,
A key challenge for any company is how it 
performs in a difficult macro-economic 
environment. This challenge has been 
successfully met by BGEO Group as your 
Company managed to deliver a record 
high profit in US Dollar terms despite the 
backdrop of the Lari weakening by more 
than 35% versus US dollar compared to 
pre-depreciation levels and the uncertain 
macro-economic environment in the region 
throughout 2015. This success was mainly 
driven by two major factors:
• People working for the Group; and
• Strategic decisions made by the 
Board in the past 5-7 years.
These two factors – the people 
working for your company and the 
long term vision we have for each  
of our business lines – will be a 
leitmotif to this letter, in which I 
focus on: strategy – for our Banking 
and Investment Businesses as well 
as for the Group in terms of capital 
returns and allocations; and talent 
development.
Banking Business:
Two key metrics we measure our  
Banking Business performance against  
are Return on Average Equity (ROAE) and 
retail loan book growth, each targeted at 
the 20% level. As outlined in detail later in 
this report, both targets were achieved by 
a considerable margin; we grew the retail 
loan book by 35% and delivered c. 22% 
ROAE. To further improve profitability we 
set a 3-year target to increase the share  
of Retail Banking lending in the overall loan 
book, from the current 56% to a targeted 
65% level. Bank of Georgia is also well 
positioned in terms of both capital and 
liquidity to deliver on its growth strategy. 
Let me outline the background as well as 
the strategy going forward for each of the 
banking segments:
Retail Banking:
Retail Banking delivered a stellar 
performance by reaching c. 2 million 
clients, delivering loan book growth and 
ROAE targets. The acquisition and 
successful integration of PrivatBank 
Georgia played a major role. 
To further improve profitability  
we set a 3-year target to increase 
the share of Retail Banking lending 
in the overall loan book, from the 
current 56% to a targeted 65% 
level. Bank of Georgia is also  
well positioned in terms of both 
capital and liquidity to deliver on  
its growth strategy.
In order to better connect with the various 
segments of the retail client base, we 
operate a multi-brand strategy:
• Our Express Bank brand is aimed  
at the emerging bankable population. 
Express serves as a platform for 
bringing the currently under-banked 
population into banking and its main 
focus is to enable its client base to 
transact in a fast and easy way. We also 
sell only a limited number of banking 
products to our Express banking 
clients. Currently, 77 out of a total of 
114 Express branches are located in 
Tbilisi and going forward we would 
like to roll out Express branches in 
regions to reach a wider population. 
The all-in cost of opening a new 
Express branch is just US$ 50,000. 
• Under the Bank of Georgia brand,  
we are serving mass retail clients. 
We have historically been very much 
a product-driven organisation, which 
helped us in acquiring new clients. 
However, we now have a relationship 
with c. 2 million clients and our 
challenge for the next three years is 
to increase the product to client ratio 
from a current low of 1.7 to 3.0. To this 
end, we intend to shift our business 
model from product to client centric. 
In 2016, we would like to move to a 
focused service model in 10 branches, 
where clients have a single touch-
point to acquire products and receive 
consultation. In the medium-term, 
we intend to convert the Bank of 
Georgia brand into a single touch-
point front office organisation. 
Irakli Gilauri,  
Chief Executive Officer

would like to draw your 
attention to people working 
for your company and long 
term vision we have for each 
of our business lines.” 10   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Overview
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
• Our new Solo model was introduced 
in 2015 and the major part of our 
planned lounge roll-out has now been 
completed. The Solo brand is used for 
servicing the emerging mass affluent 
segment. To qualify for Solo services 
one needs to have an income of GEL 
3,000 per month. At Solo lounges, 
clients are served by personal bankers 
and, in addition to banking products, 
are offered luxury goods at cost and 
other lifestyle offers including a travel 
magazine and entertainment. Recently, 
Solo presented a Sting concert to its 
clients at a concert that was limited 
to Solo clients only, which created 
further interest in the Solo franchise. 
We intend to grow the number of 
Solo clients to 40,000 by the end of 
2018, from the current 12,000 level. 
Net profit per Solo client stood at GEL 
1,350 in 2015, over 20 times of what 
we have in the mass retail segment 
under the Bank of Georgia brand.
Another big project targeted for 2016 in 
retail banking will be to plan and begin to 
implement a new strategy for the 
digitalization of banking services. 
Digitalization will play a major part in 
making our services more competitive and 
at the same time more efficient.
Retail Banking is headed by Mikheil 
Gomarteli, who joined the Bank 19 years 
ago and his first job was to sell debit cards 
door-to-door. Before heading Retail 
Banking, Mikheil worked in almost every 
position in the bank: teller, credit analyst, 
and headed our reporting and budgeting, 
marketing, and branch management 
departments. Mikheil is leading a group of 
excellent Retail Bankers and their inside-
out knowledge of Retail Banking and 
detailed understanding of business are 
invaluable for the further success of the 
business line. 
Corporate and Investment Banking:
Our Corporate Bank has increased its 
ROAE from 12% in 2014 to 16% in 2015. 
We believe the current risk return profile of 
corporate business is not as attractive as 
the Bank runs a relatively concentrated 
loan book, with the top 10 exposures 
accounting for 12.4% of total loan book. 
Therefore, our major strategic goal is to de-
concentrate the corporate loan book, while 
stepping up our investment Banking 
Business by issuing corporate bonds in the 
local market. We have already made 
progress in this regard in 2015; we have 
decreased concentration from 15.7% in 
2014 to 12.4% in 2015, and at the same 
time issued bonds worth US$ 63 million in 
the local market. Going forward, we are 
also targeting to syndicate out our large 
exposures to local and international 
players. 
Georgia is becoming the service 
hub of the region and we expect to 
grow our business on the back of it. 
Further growing our wealth 
management platform is essential in 
order for us to issue local corporate 
bonds. This strategy should result 
in further de-concentrating the loan 
book, enhancing the fee-based 
business, increasing ROAE and 
improving the overall risk return 
profile of the segment.
In order to further capture synergies 
between the corporate banking and 
investment management (investment 
banking and wealth management 
franchises) and expedite the process of 
developing the local capital market,  
we have decided to merge these two 
business lines. 
We have appointed Archil Gachechiladze 
to head the merged entity. Archil joined the 
Bank in 2009, and he has headed both the 
corporate banking and the investment 
management businesses. Archil has 
delivered great results in both corporate 
banking and investment management and 
his obviously successful track record was 
the key reason for the Board’s decision to 
appoint Archil as head of Corporate and 
Investment Banking. Archil is a Cornell 
MBA and worked at Lehman Brothers’ 
Private Equity arm prior to returning to 
Georgia. He has built an excellent team 
around him. Archil’s superb strategic 
vision, insights on both corporate banking 
and the investment management 
businesses, as well as his great execution 
skills will be the key to deliver on the 
merged CIB strategy.
The Bank’s cost discipline:
Identifying and eliminating unnecessary 
costs is part of our DNA. We have been 
running positive operating leverage for 
quite some time. We also have a strong 
history of successfully acquiring and 
integrating other financial institutions and 
delivering substantial cost synergies. The 
most recent opportunity was the 
successful integration of PrivatBank 
Georgia in 2015, where we fully integrated 
a bank with 400,000 active clients within 4 
months while eliminating unnecessary 
costs and delivering on annualised pre-tax 
synergies of GEL 30 million, GEL 5 million 
more than initially announced. 
Our three-year target is to maintain 
a 35% cost to income ratio. 
Effective implementation of the 
client-centric model in Retail 
Banking as well as digitalisation  
will have a positive contribution  
to the low Cost to Income ratio 
going forward. 
Tornike Gogichaishvili heads our 
operations overseeing operating and 
capital expenditures and his contribution  
to the 36% cost to income ratio is 
tremendous. Tornike joined the Group in 
2006 and soon became CEO of our 
insurance business. Tornike also played a 
crucial role in capturing efficiencies in our 
Ukrainian banking subsidiary. Tornike has 
been heading the Bank’s operations 
business since 2010. His deep 
understanding of business and processes 
is the key to successfully capturing further 
cost efficiencies going forward.
The Bank’s risk management:
In the year of a major depreciation against 
the US Dollar, I would like to focus on 
credit risk as it is by far the largest risk 
category that any bank is exposed to. 
Our risk department is best in class. 
They have passed the test of 
prudence and control both in 2008 
during the global financial crisis, 
when cost of risk stayed within the 
Bank’s net interest margin, as well 
as in 2015, when the currency lost 
more than 35% of its value against 
US dollar compared to pre-
depreciation levels. 
Investors often ask me how we retained 
such a low cost of risk (2.7%), in a year of 
sharp depreciation in consideration that 
72% of our loan book is denominated in 
foreign currency, mostly US Dollars. The 
simple answer to this question is that 
Georgian bank balance sheets have been 
mainly in US Dollars for the past 20 years  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   11

or so and we manage currency risk, just  
as banks with local currency balance 
sheets manage the interest rate risk.  
(We have limited interest rate risk in our 
balance sheet.) 
How do we manage the foreign exchange 
risk? Currency-wise, our balance sheet is 
matched on both sides. Our clients who 
have local currency income and loan in US 
Dollars are exposed to currency risk, which 
makes us consider carefully how to 
manage their risk. We manage our clients’ 
risk in two ways: first, we issue these 
clients 20% less loan compared to issuing 
a Georgian Lari loan, in doing so we are 
creating a depreciation buffer. Secondly, 
we issue shorter-term loans than we would 
have issued in the first place and at the 
same time we keep a positive liquidity gap 
in our balance sheet, so if there is a need 
to prolong a loan to our client we have the 
capability to do so. Under the above credit 
conditions not many qualify for US Dollar 
borrowing. One of the reasons for the low 
penetration of loans compared to GDP is 
due to this conservative underwriting policy 
used by Georgian banks. 
90% of our corporate loan book is 
denominated in foreign currency, mainly 
US Dollars - of which 50% have US Dollar 
income and the rest do not. Because the 
Georgian economy is dollarised and a US 
Dollar proxy economy, when the Georgian 
Lari weakens all corporate players behave 
in a similar way: they adjust prices, capture 
efficiencies and adjust to the new reality. 
As Georgia is an oil-importing country, 
Georgian corporates had a big saving from 
lower oil prices, but the adjustment of 
prices on their final goods was not as 
dramatic as it could have been. Hence 
inflation in the country was recorded below 
5% in 2015. Weak corporates, whose 
businesses were struggling even before 
depreciation, go out of the business, 
healthier companies will need some sort of 
prolongation, but their business continues 
to generate the cash and service the debt 
on a monthly basis as they used to do,  
and strong companies do not even need 
prolongation. This is exactly what 
happened during the recent depreciation. 
On the retail side of the balance sheet we 
have 54% of loans in foreign currency, 
mostly US Dollar and the remaining in 
Georgian Lari. Georgian Lari-denominated 
loans are mainly issued as consumer loans 
and credit cards to 400,000 customers. So 
the mass population are not exposed to 
currency risk. c. 21% of the retail loan book 
is in foreign currency, mainly US Dollar 
loans to SMEs and Micros and the 
situation with these customers is very 
similar to corporate clients, as described 
above. C. 26% of the loan book is in 
mortgages and the remaining c. 7% is 
consumer loan and credit cards. When 
underwriting the mortgages we use a 20% 
buffer and issue shorter-term. So, the 
maximum term of the mortgage in Georgia 
is generally 10 years. With this pre-
condition not many qualify, and actually 
only the best quality borrowers we have 
are our mortgage borrowers. In total there 
are only c. 38,000 mortgages outstanding 
in the whole country. We announced the 
automatic re-profiling of the mortgage 
loans. Basically, we offered automatic 
prolongation of the mortgage loans in  
such a way that Georgian Lari monthly 
payment stayed at a similar level as it was 
before the depreciation. As we have top 
quality mortgage borrowers, out of our 
13,000 mortgage borrowers only 1,100 
took the offer.
Giorgi Chiladze is Chief Risk Officer of the 
Bank. Giorgi earned his PhD in physics 
from Johns Hopkins University. He has 
excellent judgement and a strong 
understanding of the big picture that 
serves all of our shareholders well. In 
Giorgi’s hands we are much safer. 
 
Leadership transition in Banking 
Business:
One of our major challenges for 2015 was 
to make sure that banking continued to 
perform well as I was handing over the 
leadership of Banking Business to  
Murtaz Kikoria. 
Murtaz is a seasoned banker  
with more than 25 years’  
experience in this sector. Murtaz 
served as a banking regulator, who 
institutionalised banking regulation 
from the early 2000s and made the 
Georgian banking sector extremely 
resilient. He has occupied top 
positions in leading Georgian banks 
as well as a Senior Banker position 
at EBRD. 
Murtaz joined the Bank in 2008, his major 
achievement was the successful 
turnaround of our Ukrainian banking 
subsidiary and its subsequent divestment. 
Murtaz also served as CEO of our 
healthcare business where he acquired a 
number of different hospitals, contributing 
in a major way to the successful GHG IPO. 
Murtaz’s deep knowledge of banking, as 
well as his great people skills, will be key  
to the success of our Banking Business 
going forward.
Investment Business:
In last year’s letter to shareholders, I 
outlined in detail the way we invest in and 
manage companies. In brief, I would say 
that the strategy of our Investment 
Business is very simple: we buy companies 
or assets cheaply, institutionalising them by 
allocating and developing top talent in 
Georgia, eliminating unnecessary costs, 
growing the companies as market leaders 
in order to achieve scale-driven cost 
advantage, and crystalising the value of the 
them within six years. We invest in small 
ticket sizes; usually we would not invest 
more than US$ 25 million in any new 
opportunity. We also like to stage 
investments to limit the risks. Once we 
make sure that an appropriate level of 
institutionalisation has been achieved in the 
portfolio company, we may invest in bigger 
ticket sizes. To this end, we like bolt-on 
acquisitions to expedite the market 
leadership and scale-driven cost 
advantage. Bolt-on acquisitions also 
enable us to capture cost synergies and 
eliminate unnecessary costs. The GHG 
case study in this Annual Report outlines 
our strategy of doing investments. 
In pursuing this strategy, we aim to achieve 
at least a 20% IRR. The limited access to 
capital in this small frontier economy is one 
of the reasons we are able buy cheaply. 
So, the availability of cash at all times at 
the Group level is critical to seize 
opportunities quickly.
Overall, the performance of the 
Investment Business was 
exceptional in 2015. We have 
delivered consolidated profit growth 
of 81%. The growth was mainly 
driven by GHG’s superb 
performance and m
2
 Real Estate 
completing its projects ahead of 
deadline and within budget. The 
IPO of GHG was the key milestone 
in the Investment Business as we 
managed to crystalise the value of 
our investment and achieve a 
triple-digit IRR. 12   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Overview
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
Let me speak to our portfolio companies 
one by one:
Georgia Healthcare Group: 
GHG’s main goal is to double its 
2015 healthcare revenue in 2018 
while producing c. 30% EBITDA 
margin. 
The Company targets to achieve this 
revenue growth by growing its market 
share by number of beds in the hospital 
business from the current 27% level to 
c.30% by the end of 2018. The Company is 
also in the process of rolling out a national 
chain of ambulatory clinics where its 
market share by revenue is currently just 
1% and GHG is targeting to grow this to 
5% by the end of 2018. 
At the beginning of 2016, GHG  
made a strategic move to expand into 
pharmaceuticals. Subject to regulatory 
approvals, GHG has agreed to acquire 
GPC, the third-largest retail and  
wholesale pharmacy chain in Georgia.  
This acquisition will enable GHG to 
become the largest drug purchaser in  
the country and be present in the entire 
healthcare eco-system which amounts to 
GEL 3.4 billion. The pharmacy business is 
expected to be highly synergistic both to 
reduce the cost of drugs for our hospitals 
as well as to cross-sell through GPC’s 
loyalty programme to ambulatories. GPC 
has c. 12 million customer interactions 
per annum. It is expected GHG will  
open pharmacies on the premises of 
approximately 40 hospitals and large 
ambulatory clinics owned by GHG to boost 
the revenue of GPC. The acquisition price 
of GPC implies 5.7 times EV/EBITDA 
before eliminating unnecessary costs  
and capturing further cost and revenue 
synergies. The post-synergy multiple is 3.3.
GHG is led by Nick Gamkrelidze, who 
joined the Group’s insurance subsidiary 
business in 2006, soon becoming its CEO, 
and embarked on the healthcare strategy 
in 2011. As part of our talent management 
policy we have rotated Nick as CFO of the 
Group in order to get him familiarised with 
the working of a public company. Nick had 
demonstrated outstanding performance 
both running the healthcare business and 
being CFO of the Group. Nick is a good 
example of how one can become public 
company CEO in our Group by constantly 
learning and developing. Nick’s cost 
discipline and strategic vision is the key to 
the success of GHG and its IPO. Nick is 
leading a highly capable team and I 
strongly believe that under Nick’s 
leadership, the GHG team will deliver  
on its strategy.

 Real Estate:
After launching the Real Estate Business  
in 2011, m
2
 has developed, or is in the 
process of developing 2,500 units, of 
which over 1,600 have already been sold. 
In a very short period of time m
2
 has 
become the largest residential developer in 
the country, enjoying scale advantage to 
be a lowest cost producer. To this end, in 
the past four-year period, m
2
 has managed 
to make housing more affordable in 
Georgia, bring the price of a one-bedroom 
apartment from US$ 40,000 to US$ 
29,000 in Tbilisi, while producing an 
average 65% IRR on its housing projects. 
The m
2
 housing business also 
complements our Retail Banking and  
helps to generate mortgages.
If you want to buy an apartment starting at 
US$ 29,000 in Tbilisi and have it rented out 
by m
2
, please email us: 29000@m2.ge. 
m
2
 has a strong franchise, excellent  
track record and solid balance sheet to 
accelerate its growth. Currently, m
2
 has a 
land bank with an estimated value of US$ 
34 million, where we can develop more 
than 5,200 apartments. Demand for 
apartments is expected to grow further  
as the country is becoming service hub of 
the region and urbanisation is expected to 
continue. At the same time due to a 
shortage of housing during Soviet-times 
and the Georgian tradition of multi-
generations living in one apartment 
resulted in 3.7 people living in one 
apartment in Tbilisi. On top of this, c. 70% 
of apartments are amortised in Tbilisi, as 
they were built in the Soviet times. 
The good news is that, alongside the 
housing development, we can develop 
commercial real estate, such as hotels and 
retail real estate. Our intention is to develop 
these projects over the next 4-5 years and 
retain yielding assets on m
2
 books. The 
number of visitors in Georgia grew from 
560,000 in 2007 to nearly 6 million in 2015, 
while branded hotel rooms had a marginal 
growth to only 1,200 rooms in Tbilisi. Hotel 
room growth was mainly attributed to 
four-star hotels, while family-run small 
hotels are servicing the rest of the visitors. 
For the budget hotel segment, we observe 
increasing prices and high utilisation levels. 
We think with our m
2
 franchise we can add 
value in this sector and, therefore, we have 
signed a 7-year exclusivity with Wyndham 
for the Ramada Encore brand to develop 
three-star hotels. Due to the limited supply 
of three star hotels, we see a significant 
opportunity in this segment, especially 
against the background of expected 
further growth in the number of foreign 
visitors. Georgia is truly becoming the 
major destination in the region. 
At the same time, we are starting the 
development of third party land to earn 
fees. Our customer-driven franchise,  
sales channels and being a low-cost 
producer puts us in a unique position  
to generate fees, while not taking balance 
sheet risk from re-investing m
2
 profit into 
the development of the land bank. To  
this end, on the back of performance 
between now and 2019, m
2
 is targeting to 
pay US$ 20-25 million in dividends to 
BGEO Group.
Over the next 4-5 years, our 
intention is to grow m
2
 into a Real 
Estate Investment Trust with an 
asset manager attached to it – in 
addition to generating rental 
income, m
2
 will be targeting to 
generate fees from third party  
land development. 
Irakli Burdiladze heads our Real Estate 
Business. Irakli joined Bank of Georgia as 
CFO in 2006. In 2010, when we decided  
to develop land which the Bank had 
repossessed after the 2008/09 crises,  
Irakli was assigned to spearhead our Real 
Estate Business. I have met no one more

in Georgia than Irakli. Irakli’s strategic 
thinking, and his excellent people, sales 
and execution skills enabled him to build  
a strong cash flow generating institution 
and I am confident in his ability, with the 
help of his excellent team, to deliver on  
our strategy.
Georgia Renewable Power Company 
(the hydro business – GRPC):
Our investment so far in our hydropower 
station business has been very small, but 
its prospects are tremendous. We decided 
to develop hydros in Georgia due to the 
simple fact that the cost of developing one 
MW of hydro is at least two times cheaper 
than in neighbouring countries. At the 
same time, domestic electricity 
consumption in Georgia has grown by 
3.6% CAGR from 2007 through 2015. As 
we did not know how to develop hydros 
ourselves, we have entered into a joint 
venture with RP Global, an experienced 
Austrian hydro development company. 
BGEO Group owns 65% in the joint  
venture and RP Global owns the  
remaining equity interest. 
Our intention is to build 4 hydro 
stations by the end of 2019 with total 
capacity of 105 MW. In addition, we 
plan to do detailed feasibility studies 
(ready to build) of additional hydros 
with a total capacity of 150 MW. We 
have earmarked US$ 25 million in 
equity investment over the next 3 
years to build the first four 105 MW 
hydros. After launching the hydros in 
2019, we expect to produce a ROAE 
of 20%+. 
One can build hydros cheaply in Georgia 
for two main reasons: 1. Georgia has a lot 
of hydro resources due to the Caucasus 
mountains and climate; and 2. these 
resources have not been tapped as access 
to capital has been limited.
On the demand side, domestic energy 
consumption will increase to match the 
requirements of Georgia’s growing 
economy, as well as increased external 
demand from our neighbours such as 
Turkey, Russia and Iran. Now that Iran is 
opening-up, it needs energy to develop its 
economy. The way our hydro licence is 
structured is that we are obliged to sell 
electricity during four months in autumn 
and winter in Georgia, when hydro 
generation (78% of energy produced in 
Georgia is hydro) is at a low level in 
Georgia, while we are free to sell energy 
during 8 months in spring, summer and 
autumn, when energy consumption is high 
in Turkey and Iran, due to the heavy usage 
of air conditioning. This way, throughout 
the year, we should be able to capture the 
most optimal sales price.
GRPC is led by Avto Namicheishvili,  
who is also Group General Legal Counsel. 
Avto joined the Group in 2007 and 
executed all major M&A and IPO 
transactions for our Group. While Avto 
acted as the Group’s legal counsel, he  
has accumulated tremendous business 
experience and we would like to leverage 
his knowledge in developing our hydro 
business. Avto’s execution skills, excellent 
people skills and out-of-the-box thinking 
will be critical in institutionalising our hydro 
development capabilities, which I believe 
will create a lot of value for our 
shareholders going forward. Through 
ongoing Board participation, Avto also 
helps me to manage our other Investment 
Businesses. He is one of the key players  
in executing our Investment Business 
strategy. 
Georgian Global Utilities (water utility 
and hydro business – GGU):
After the acquisition of our 25% stake in 
GGU in December 2014, we initiated senior 
management changes, which triggered 
substantial improvements in the operating 
business. 
As GGU is an infrastructure company we 
closely follow cash flow generation 
capabilities and want to make sure that by 
eliminating water losses, which currently 
stand at c. 50%, GGU delivers sustainable 
cash flow growth. As GGU consumes its 
own energy, generated by 135 MW hydro 
stations, efficiency improvements will have 
a double effect as freed-up energy can be 
sold to third parties. 
We are also developing hydro resources 
using the existing infrastructure of the 
Company. In 2015 we identified two 
stations with a total capacity of 16 MW. 
Building run-on hydros using the GGU 
infrastructure decreases the cost of 
development by 20-30%.
We aim to deliver GEL 80 million 
EBITDA in 2018 by reducing water 
losses and building new hydros. 
GGU is expected to pay dividends 
on the back of its 2016 performance 
and step up the dividends to at 
least GEL 20 million per annum  
from 2018. 
GGU is headed by Giorgi Tskhadadze, 
formerly CFO of Borjomi, a leading 
beverage company in Georgia. Giorgi has 
demonstrated an excellent track record in 
capturing efficiencies and streamlining 
operations. Giorgi Vakhtangishvili is CFO of 
GGU. He joined the Company in April 2015, 
previously serving as the #2 person in m
2
 
Real Estate. His contribution to the success 
of the GGU turnaround is equally important. 
Teliani Valley (beverage business):
Teliani Valley is one of the largest wine 
producers in the country, selling c. 3 million 
bottles a year. Its 2015 EBITDA was GEL 
3.9 million, a decrease compared to 2014 
as currencies lost values sharply, leading 
to decreased demand in Teliani’s major 
export markets, such as Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan. Teliani also operates a leading 
distribution company, distributing its own 
as well as third party goods. Teliani is also 
the distributor of imported Heineken beer. 
In 2016, Teliani is launching a beer 
and soft drinks production line, 
which will be a major source for its 
growth. Because of Teliani’s 
distribution capabilities, Heineken 
granted Teliani with a 10-year 
licence to bottle beer for Georgia, 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
BGEO Group owns 71% of Teliani and 
intends to invest US$ 10 million in equity to 
build the Heineken brewery in Georgia. The 
brewery will also produce other Heineken 
brands, mainstream beer and local 
lemonades. Teliani is targeting to launch 
beer production by the end of 2016. The  14   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Overview
brewery will have a capacity of c. 300,000 
hectolitres and will be scalable to 500,000 
hectolitres. The total project cost is US$ 37 
million. The beer market in Georgia is 
highly concentrated; Efes Group owns 
57% of the market share and 35% is 
owned by a local producer. Going forward, 
Teliani may become a diversified beverage 
producer in Georgia.
Shota Kobelia heads Teliani Valley. Shota 
joined Teliani in 2009. Prior to joining 
Teliani, Shota was an executive in the 
Pernod Ricard Group. Shota managed to 
capture more than 30% market share in 
bottled wine in Georgia, where competition 
is much greater than in the beer market. 
Shota’s leadership and sales skills will be 
the key for the success of our new 
investment. The Teliani team is very excited 
and engaged with the project, together 
with the Heineken team, to make it 
successful. 
Group strategy: capital returns and 
allocations
The simple way to look at our strategy is 
how much capital return we deliver to our 
shareholders in relation to the cash 
investment our shareholders make in the 
Group. Therefore, our aim going forward is 
not to issue new shares, rather deliver 
capital returns in order to generate a high 
return for already invested cash capital by 
our shareholders. 
Obviously sustainability of capital 
returns over long period of time is 
essential for the success of our 
strategy. As you all know, we run 
two forms of capital return: Ordinary 
Dividends paid by the Banking 
Business and Special Capital 
Returns (SCR), generated by our 
Investment Business. Let me 
discuss each form of capital  
return separately.
Ordinary Dividends:
Our Banking Business can be viewed as 
the provider of Ordinary Dividends. On the 
back of its 2015 financial performance we 
will be paying GEL 2.4 per share, which 
represents growth of 14% over 2014 
dividends and a payout ratio of 34% 
compared to 34% in 2014. Bank of  
Georgia is by far the largest and most 
valuable asset in our Group, which 
provides a high quality, stable dividend 
flow to our shareholders. Implementing the 
strategy outlined earlier in this letter should 
improve the quality of ordinary dividend 
generation capabilities of Bank of Georgia 
and make it more sustainable over a long 
period of time.
Special Capital Returns:
We updated our strategy in December 2014 
and introduced the Investment Business 
and the concept of Special Capital Returns. 
The Investment Business aims to deliver 
CSRs from divestments of our portfolio of 
companies. Our aim over a five-year period 
is to deliver CSRs of at least 50% in 
aggregate of the ordinary dividends 
delivered by the Banking Business over 
2015-2019 period. We view CSRs in three 
different forms: cash dividends, BGEO 
share buy-backs and the potential 
distribution of shares in our listed portfolio 
company. We are also aiming to buy-back 
shares for our management trust, rather 
than issue new ones – as we historically 
used to do. The aim is not to increase the 
Group’s outstanding number of shares from 
the current 39.5 million level. 
As a result of the successful IPO  
of GHG and the high cash flow 
generation of our Real Estate 
Business, we have clear visibility of 
SCR flow through 2019. The good 
news is that our existing 
investments can generate SCRs 
beyond 2019. 
However, we will need to improve the 
quality of SCR flow over the longer period 
of time. Therefore, holding a supply of  
cash to invest in opportunities and wisely 
re-allocating capital are important to 
increase the quality and certainty of SCRs 
over the longer run. That is why our plans 
regarding our cash buffer and our capital 
allocation strategy going forward are 
important. 
Cash buffer and capital allocations: 
Currently we hold c. US$ 52 million cash at 
the BGEO Group level, of which US$ 35 
million is allocated to our hydro and 
beverage businesses. Over the medium-
term, we aim to increase the unallocated 
cash buffer from the current US$ 17 million 
level to a higher one of US$ 50 million, or 
3.5% of market capitalisation of the Group. 
We believe this large cash buffer will 
be an important component to the 
successful implementation of our 
strategy and de-risking the Group in 
case of unexpected crisis. The 
unallocated cash buffer will be used 
to seek opportunities either for new 
ones or opportunities that capitalise 
on our existing companies for new 
projects or bolt-on acquisitions. The 
buffer will also enable us to buy 
back BGEO shares cheaply during 
any global capital markets or 
emerging market turmoil. As we use 
cash from the buffer, we will be 
disciplined to replenish it in a short 
period of time. 
As we will be increasing cash levels at the 
Group level, we will be running a Group-
wide treasury management. Therefore, we 
are in the process of setting up risk 
management guidelines at the Group level. 
The basic idea is to run an extremely 
conservative liquidity management policy. 
Allocated cash will be invested in Georgian 
government treasuries and short-term local 
bonds, while unallocated cash (e.g. US$ 
50 million) will be used to invest in 
short-term US treasuries or EU 
government bonds. 
Growing the intrinsic value of our  
portfolio companies will be one of my key 
performance indicators going forward.  
To this end, internally we are running 
valuation models for each of the portfolio 
companies. Valuation of the portfolio 
companies will also be used when 
deciding on BGEO share buybacks  
as well.

The way we manage the Group:
We run a lean management structure at 
the Group level. We have five senior people 
working at the Group level, including me, 
and all of us have multiple functions. I split 
my time between helping the Bank 
executives in strategic projects and 
overlooking portfolio companies in 
Investment Business by helping top 
executives with strategic decisions. Levan 
Kulijanishvili, a long-time veteran at the 
Bank of Georgia, is a CFO of the Group 
and Bank of Georgia. Levan’s ability to 
constantly learn and develop, as well as 
understand detail has no boundaries. Avto 
Namicheishvili and Eka Shavgulidze help 
me to overlook our portfolio companies by 
active Board participations, monitoring 
performance of the Group companies and 
assessing new opportunities. As 
mentioned above, Avto is also heading our 
hydro business and helps the Group 
company lawyers in case they need 
advice. In addition to her Group role, Eka 
handles production of all our investor 
relation communication materials. Eka also 
handles the Group’s debt capital funding 
needs. Eka’s exceptional analytical and 
strategic thinking skills are invaluable for 
the Group. Michael Oliver is helping me 
with investor relations. Mike has 25+ years 
of experience in UK banking and served as 
Director of IR of Lloyds Banking Group. 
Mike attends the Group’s strategic 
meetings and has a deep understanding of 
Georgia and the BGEO Group, which helps 
us to communicate the story effectively. 
Mike’s understanding of our investors’ way 
of thinking is very important for us in 
setting up the strategy. He is very 
passionate with great people skills. 
Talent development:
Attracting the very best talent to our Group 
has always been a top priority. This is how 
the success of our Group has been built. 
Good judgement, flawless execution and 
excellent team spirit is part of our culture. 
Bank of Georgia serves as a great platform 
for developing talent within the Group and 
the Board’s role in this development is 
tremendous. In addition to their fiduciary 
duties, Board members act as advisors/
coaches for all of our top executives.  
We have a diverse Board with sector 
specialists and we would like to further 
enlarge it by bringing more sector 
specialists to help our heads of  
businesses to grow further. 
As our businesses grow and the market 
evolves, we are in constant need for  
top talent to deliver on our strategy. We 
have much more talent available in-house 
than 11 years ago, when I joined the  
Bank of Georgia. To this end, we would  
like to further institutionalise the talent 
development and formalise our 
organisation culture. We would like to  
use the Bank of Georgia University,  
internal and external talent pools as 
platforms to develop future leaders by 
providing leadership, training and 
coaching, and mentoring by senior 
executives and the Board members.  
We also want to attract young talent 
through our Leadership Programs to 
develop future leaders for this organisation. 
“Helping each other to succeed by 
learning and providing feedback” is 
our leadership culture articulated in 
one sentence. Indeed, we see 
constant learning and development 
of management and employees  
as key to the success of your 
organisation and we will be 
investing time and money in it.
Sasha Katsman heads the HR and 
Branding of the Bank. He has a Group-
wide responsibility to institutionalise our 
talent development programme as well as 
roll out our leadership culture throughout 
the organisation. Sasha joined the Bank in 
2010 to head the Bank’s marketing 
department. His exceptional creativity, 
execution skills and ability to develop has 
already created substantial value for our 
organisation. Sasha built our brand and 
campaign machine. We decided to 
promote Sasha to deputy CEO of Bank of 
Georgia to head the Bank’s HR efforts in 
addition to his branding responsibilities. 
Summary: 
To summarise – at the Group level we want 
to increase the unallocated cash buffer to 
US$ 50 million to seize the opportunities in 
our Investment Businesses as they arise, 
potentially buy-back BGEO stock if it is 
cheap, and de-risk the Group in case of 
unexpected crisis. To improve efficiency in 
Retail Banking, we will be focusing on 
rolling out the client-centric model and 
further digitalising our banking services. To 
improve the risk-return profile of the 
Corporate and Investment Banking we 
want to de-concentrate the loan by issuing 
local bonds and simultaneously stepping 
up the wealth management business to 
leverage Georgia becoming the service 
hub of the region. In Investment Business, 
our key goal is to institutionalise our 
businesses by developing our talented 
management teams, cutting unnecessary 
costs, and scaling up the businesses 
through bolt-on acquisitions to expedite 
scale-driven cost advantage. 
In order to succeed in the outlined strategy, 
we need three things: 
1. your continuous support, for which we 
all at BGEO Group are very grateful
2. our continuous effort to develop and 
grow talent 
3. Georgia to continue on its successful 
growth path, about which I am more 
optimistic than ever

A platform to develop talent
Similarly to the limited access to capital in Georgia, the availability of management is limited and  
our platform is designed to help our people develop, and by producing top business talent in the 
country, we can add value for our shareholders. We understand that great management teams  
make great companies, and investing time in growing people continues to be critical for the success 
of our strategy.
At BGEO Group we have spent a lot of time building a top-class management team and we have a 
deep bench of people who have grown and are ready to take on bigger responsibilities. One of the 
reasons we are confident in our strategy is that we have human capital available both on the top and 
mid-management levels. We spend a lot of time coaching and mentoring our talent. 
We are growing fast in our banking businesses and our strategy for our investment businesses 
implies selling the companies that we develop. Therefore we fully understand that our talent 
producing machine must continue its work. For our top talent we have introduced a self-development 
programme by hiring coaches to help them to better understand their strengths and weaknesses. 
According to our policy, no matter how good the performance of our top executive is, they may  
get limited bonuses if we do not see progress in the executive’s self-development and growing  
their successor(s).
You have observed rotations in our top management every two to three years. We would like our top 
talent to receive experience in different roles and learn and grow. Rotations will continue in the future. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   17

Deepening economic integration with

route and Iranian market re-opening 
create new investment opportunities, while 
pursuing prudent monetary and fiscal 
policies ensures macroeconomic stability 
and enables the economy to adapt to 
any changes in external environment. 
Georgia’s key economic drivers
Reforms driven success. Georgia scored 
higher in most of the indicators in the latest 
Worldwide Governance Indicators report 
by the World Bank, which captures six key 
dimensions of governance – voice and 
accountability, political stability and lack 
of violence, government effectiveness, 
and regulatory quality, rule of law and 
control of corruption. In three out of these 
six indicators Georgia is ahead of some 
EU members and all five EU candidate 
countries. Importantly, efforts to eliminate 
corruption are widely acknowledged, 
bringing Georgia ahead of 13 EU member 
countries and all five candidate counties 
in the control of corruption indicator. 
The country is ranked 24th out of 189 
economies in the World Bank’s 2016 
Ease of Doing Business, 23rd out of 178 
countries by Index of Economic Freedom 
measured by Heritage Foundation in 
2016, 11th out of 197 countries in the 
Trace International’s 2014 Matrix of 
Business Bribery Risk and only 4% 
of people, less than in the UK and the US, 
admitted having paid a bribe according 
to the 2013 Global Corruption Barometer 
study by Transparency International. 
Georgia underscored its commitment to
European values by securing a democratic
transfer of political power in successive
parliamentary (October 2012), presidential
(October 2013), and local elections (June
2014) and showed that democratic
institutions are working effectively. Reforms 
continue to maintain and boost Georgia’s 
competitive advantage and enhance 
business-supportive environment.
New prime-minister put forth a so called 
4-pillar of reform initiatives to speed up 
economic growth and to support  business 
climate. Namely, the proposed measures 
include tax code amendments aimed 
at further liberalizing tax and customs 
procedures, Governance reform to allow 
legal entities to receive services based 
on a single window principle, speeding 
up the implementation of infrastructure 
projects and tailoring the education system 
offerings to labour market demands.
While remaining committed to European 
values, Georgia has also managed to 
stabilise relations with Russia as the latter 
lifted its embargo on Georgian products in 
2013. The Georgian Government continues
low-regulation, low-tax, free market
policies, strengthening its anti-trust policy,
and amending the labour code (while still
remaining flexible and providing comfort
for private sector participants) to comply
with International Labour Standards.
The economic Liberty Act, effective since 
January 2014, ensures continuation of a 
credible fiscal and monetary framework 
for Georgia, by capping consolidated 
Government expenditures at 30% of GDP, 
fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP and public 
debt at 60% of GDP. The Liberty Act also 
requires electorates’ approval through 
a nationwide referendum for imposing 
new taxes and raising existing tax rates, 
subject to certain exceptions. Georgia 
slashed the number of taxes from 21 in 
2004 to just six now, becoming one of 
the world’s most friendly tax regimes 
according to Forbes Misery Tax Index.
Endorsement from the international 
community. Imminent visa-free travel 
to the EU is another major success in 
Georgia’s foreign policy, following the 
signing of the Association Agreement 
and the related DCFTA with the EU in 
2014. A progress report by the European 
Commission released on 18 December 
2015 praised Georgia’s achievement of 
reform targets to become eligible for a 
visa-free regime in the Schengen area. 
The Russian side also made a move in 
the direction of easing visa procedures for 
Georgian citizens effective 23 December 
2015, following the Russian President’s 
statement at his annual press conference 
on 17 December 2015. Rewards of the 
DCFTA are already tangible – Georgian 
exports to the EU posted growth in 2015. 
Georgia is also benefiting from increased 
Russian arrivals, as relations between the 
two countries have improved. Visa-free 
access to the EU and to Russia will further 
improve business opportunities for small 
and medium-sized entrepreneurs through 
intensified direct contacts, affecting 
positively on investors’ interest in Georgia, 
the country already known for its business 
friendly environment. The Government 
continues maintaining strong relations 
with international development partners, 
focusing in the first place on infrastructure 
development priorities. In 2015, Georgia 
hosted the EBRD’s Annual Meeting and 
Market review
A fast-growing economy
Georgia – an open, diversified and easy emerging market in which to do business, committed to 
further progress. One of the top performers globally in fighting corruption and business-enhancing 
reforms, enabling the country to attract foreign investors to boost productivity and accelerate growth.

Business Forum, yet another sign of the 
country’s strong international relations and 
acknowledgment of its achievements. 
A natural transport and logistics hub, 
connecting important regions and 
a market of 900 million customers 
without customs duties. Georgia’s 
favourable geographic location (between 
land-locked energy-rich countries in the 
East and European markets in the West) 
and well-developed air, land and sea 
transport networks position the country 
to reap the benefits in transport, logistics, 
and tourism. Continued public spending 
on roads, energy, tourism and municipal 
infrastructure is helping strengthen a 
platform for businesses willing to trade 
with and work in Georgia. Georgia is a 
regional energy corridor that accounts for 
approximately 1.6% of the world’s oil and 
gas supply transit volumes. Travel inflows 
are a significant source of foreign currency 
for Georgia. The number of visitors to 
Georgia increased at a 26.6% CAGR over 
2005-2015 and tourism inflows stood at 
US$ 1.9 billion (14% of GDP) in 2015.
Stable energy supply and electricity 
transit hub potential. Georgia has a 
developed, stable and competitively 
priced energy sector. The country has 
overcome the chronic energy shortages 
of electricity and gas supply interruptions 
of a decade ago by renovating and 
building new hydropower plants, 
improving transmission infrastructure 
and increasingly relying on natural gas 
imports from Azerbaijan instead of Russia. 
Georgia became a net electricity exporter 
in 2007-2011 (a net importer in 2012-2015 
due to low precipitation and increased 
domestic demand), after being a net 
importer for more than a decade before 
2007. Currently, only an estimated 20% 
of Georgia’s hydro potential is utilised. 
The pipeline of investment projects 
in the energy sector is estimated at 
about US$ 3.2 billion in next 5-7 years, 
including the US$ 1 billion Nenskra 
HPP. Currently, 53 hydropower plants 
are in various stages of construction 
or development (feasibility study with 
construction rights, obtaining construction
permit), with 66 more in feasibility study 
stage. A total installed capacity of 
157MW was added to the grid in 2013-
2015 with a total investment value of 
US$ 265 million. Georgia’s transmission 
capacity is poised to increase and 
accommodate an additional installed 
capacity of 4,000MW by 2025 to meet the 
export and domestic demand growth. 
An influx of foreign investors on the
back of the economic reforms. Georgia’s
business-friendly environment coupled
with its sustainable growth prospects
continues to attract foreign investment.
On the downside, the massive FDI and
other capital inflows supported capital
goods imports growth. On the upside,
FDI inflows boosted productivity –
according to the World Bank, productivity
gains accounted for 66% of the
average 5.6% growth over 1999-2012.
Despite the gains, low relative levels of
productivity suggest further potential.
 
Robust GDP growth. Broad-based
structural reforms, liberalised trade, sound
public finances, and enhanced trade
and tourism infrastructure have fed into
robust GDP growth rates. Annual GDP 
growth averaged 5.1% from 2006 to 2015, 
despite the multiple hurdles Georgia has
faced – domestic and global crises, the
conflict with Russia in 2008, and recent
regional economic uncertainties 
Moreover, a diversified growth structure
and economic base, affords economic
flexibility in the face of headwinds. With 
the necessary institutions largely in place, 
favourable geographic location and well-
developed air, land, and sea transport 
networks, and Georgia’s real potential to 
transform itself as a regional service hub, 
Georgia is poised to generate 5% annual 
average real growth over the next decade, 
based on IMF’s 5-year growth forecast. 
Georgia’s diversified export markets 
and commodities are minimising 
potential impact of turbulence 
in any particular trading partner 
economy. Georgia has active free trade 
agreements with its neighbours and the 
EU. These agreements grant Georgia 
import duty-free access to a market 
of 900 million consumers, including 
the EU and Turkey. Exports more than 
Impressive GDP growth
Broad-based structural reforms, liberalised trade, and enhanced trade and tourism infrastructure have 
fed into robust – 5. 1 % annual average real GDP growth over 2006-2015 despite challenging external 
environment; potential to generate annual average real growth of 5% over the next decade.

doubled over 2006-2015, but there is
still significant upside potential. Despite 
nominal growth, exports share of GDP 
has remained stable. On the other hand, 
the services exports’ share of GDP 
has almost doubled, driven by growth 
in tourism and transport receipts. The 
pending reforms related to the EU DCFTA 
have the potential to enhance trade 
and expand Georgia’s export potential. 
One of the most significant changes in 
exports was a shift away from the Russian 
market after Russia’s 2006 embargo. 
The share of exports to Russia in total 
exports fell sharply from 18% in 2005 to 
8% in 2006 and 2% in 2008-2012. The 
embargo forced Georgian producers 
to redirect exports to other countries. 
Exports to Russia picked up in 2013, as 
Russia opened its borders to Georgian 
products, but accounted for only 6ppts 
out of the 22% total export growth in 2013. 
With the recent economic turbulence in 
Russia, exposure to the Russian market 
(wine, mineral water, and agricultural 
products) is once again receding. In 2015, 
Russia’s share in total Georgian exports 
declined 2.2ppts y-o-y to 7.4%. Overall, in 
2015, Georgian exports decreased 23% 
y-o-y due to turbulence in CIS markets, 
while exports to the EU increased 3.6%, 
accounting for 29% of total. As no single 
market and commodity accounts for 
a significant share in total exports, this 
minimises the potential negative impact 
of the turbulence on any particular 
market on Georgia’s trade balance. 
Georgian economy – top performer in 
the region in 2015
Georgia maintained macroeconomic 
stability in 2015 despite the challenging 
external environment. The growth 
slowed to 2.8% y-o-y in 2015 from 4.6% 
in 2014 due to challenging  external 
environment. The economic slowdown 
and currency depreciations experienced 
by its main trading partners have lowered 
Georgia’s exports and remittances in 
2015. The resulting shortfall in foreign 
earnings, combined with the worldwide 
strengthening of the US Dollars and 
related pickup in deposit dollarisation, 
caused the Georgian Lari to depreciate 
by more than 20% against the US Dollars 
in 2015. As the National Bank of Georgia 
(NBG) allowed the Georgian Lari to float, 
this depreciation helped to absorb
the external shock by reducing imports
(-15.2% y-o-y in 2015, excluding one-offs),
preserving FX reserves. Importantly,
adjustment in imports was on the back of
reduced demand on consumer goods, as
investments were driving the growth with
FDI hitting US$ 1.4 billion (9.7% of GDP). 
The current account deficit stood at 
11.8% of GDP in 2015, with FDI being 
one of the major sources of its funding
(and at the same time the major factor
behind the deficit creation). Construction 
posted strong double-digit growth 
(15.2%) on the back of BP gas pipeline
expansion and increased government
capital expenditures, while manufacturing 
(-4.9%) and trade (-0.3%) were the only 
sectors posting declines. The tourism 
industry recorded another year of 
improvement, with arrivals up 6.9%
y-o-y to 5.9 million in 2015. Despite highly
dollarised economy, NPLs remained low at
2.7%, helped in part by strong job creation
in the private sector. While depreciation
spurred inflationary expectations, annual
inflation was 4.9% at the end of 2015,
slightly below the NBG’s target of 5.0%,
helped by lower fuel prices as well as
gradual monetary tightening. Public 
debt stock increased to 41.5% of GDP
in 2015, up from 35.5% in 2014, as 
Georgian Lari depreciation pushed the 
external public debt to GDP ratio to 
32.6%, up 5.8ppts y-o-y. Notably, the 
bulk of the external public debt is owed 
to IFIs, carrying very low interest rate 
and long-term maturity profile, making 
public debt service sustainable.
Growth outlook in 2016 remains 
positive with expected strong rebound 
thereafter. Sustained macro stability, 
continuation of pro-business measures and  
the EU DCFTA – related expected

surge in FDI provide a solid base for the
robust growth potential in Georgia
in coming years. Importantly, the newly 
elected NBG governor feeds trust in 
the continuation of prudent monetary 
policy-making, strengthening business 
confidence. Fresh reforms from the 
government are another upside, adding
stimulus to growth and attracting foreign 
investors. Part of the deal includes the
introduction of the Estonian model, which
envisages applying corporate income tax
(a regular rate is 15% currently) to 
only distributed profit; undistributed 
profits, reinvested or retained, will 
not be subject to corporate income 
taxation. Proposed amendments to 
the tax code, upon approval by the
Parliament, will go into force from 
1 January 2017, adding an estimated GEL 
1.5 billion to private sector investments, 
inclusive of bank credit, in the medium 
term. Along with public infrastructure
spending, ongoing and new large scale
private investment projects: BP gas
pipeline expansion (US$ 2 billion), Nenskra
HPP (US$ 1 billion), and Anaklia deep sea
port project (US$ 2.5 billion), create a solid
base for improved economic prospects. 
The economy started 2016 sluggishly, 
however starting from February it appears 
to have turned the corner: tax revenues 
exceeded the 1Q16 plan, despite a slight 
dip in Jan-16, while tourism arrivals 
delivered a stellar performance, increasing 
15% y/y to 1.1mn visitors in 1Q, with 
particularly upward trend since February. 
Tourist arrivals are expected to increase 
significantly in 2016, as Georgia is the 
most viable alternative for tourists (mostly 
Russians) who used to travel to countries 
like Egypt, Turkey, and other destinations 
in this region. Additionally, Georgia is 
benefitting from an uptick in goods transit 
from Ukraine and Turkey to Central 
Asia and beyond, given the restrictions 
imposed on these countries by Russia.
The IMF expects growth to be 3.0% y-o-y 
in 2016, and to average 5.0% in 2017-2020.
The persistence of low fuel prices should
also help Georgia to improve its external
accounts, firm the exchange rate, and ease
inflation. Georgia’s increasing economic
integration with the EU, a bottoming out
of the recession in Russia and moderate
recovery in partner countries’ economies,
as well as new opportunities related to the
Iranian market and pick-up in transit 
services as well as an anticipated surge 
in tourism, should support Georgia’s
positive growth outlook in 2016-2018.
 
Well capitalised banking sector with 
low NPLs
The Georgian banking sector has been 
one of the faster growing sectors of 
the Georgian economy, yet still has 
one of the lowest penetration ratios 
among peer countries, particularly in 
retail. Amidst multiple downgrades across 
the region, the Georgian banking sector 
has remained profitable and maintained 
credit ratings with a stable outlook. The 
banking sector assets’ growth rate of 
28% (ten-year CAGR) has far outstripped 
the nominal GDP growth rate for the 
same period. Although Lari depreciation 
spurred loan and deposit ratios to GDP, 
penetration rates still remain low (50% of 
GDP and 45% of GDP, respectively) and 
only c.50% of the population have bank 
accounts, partly due to high interest rates 
and the population’s low earnings, which 
is evidenced by the lower penetration 
of the retail segment compared to the 
corporate segment. Penetration is also 
low as the NBG requires banks to apply a 
175% risk-weighting to FX loans (except for 
export oriented borrower exposures). As 
a result of the Central Bank’s conservative 
regulations, banking sector liquidity and 
capitalisation rates have been historically 
high. Despite high levels of liquidity and 
capitalisation, banking sector profitability 
has remained robust at 17% ROE over 
the past three years. The banking sector 
is entirely privately owned and quite 
concentrated with the two largest banks 
accounting for 60% of total assets. 
NPL’s 2015
Looking at Georgia’s growth in 2016 and beyond, we believe external challenges can be 
mitigated by coherent economic policies
Today’s Georgia – largely corruption-free, open, and flexible, with a clear political vector and signs that 
democratic institutions are working – is well-placed to serve regional markets.

Our strategy
Delivering on our 4x20 strategy
4x20 strategy – Georgia-focused banking group with an investment arm – reflects our competitive 
strengths and opportunities in the market.
During 2015, our 4x20 strategy entailed 
a 20% metric for our ROAE, Tier I CAR, 
retail loan growth and IRR for investment 
business. This strategy is built to allow 
us to capture compelling investment 
opportunities in Georgia’s corporate sector, 
on top of our continued commitment to 
growing our strong banking business.
Over the last few years we have made 
strong progress in delivering growth in our 
core Retail Banking, Corporate Banking 
and Investment Management businesses. 
This growth has been combined with 
maintaining a solid capital and liquidity 
position and consistently high returns on 
shareholder equity, delivering dividends 
that have increased by more than five-
times over the last three years and an 
excellent total return to shareholders. In 
addition, we have made great progress 
in developing, profitably growing our 
non-banking operations and delivering a 
successful IPO of our healthcare business. 
Throughout 2015, Georgia’s economic 
development has remained robust 
and was particularly resilient in the 
context of the economic turbulence 
in the region. The Company expects 
this progress to be maintained in the 
future. The banking sector in Georgia 
remains relatively underpenetrated and 
we expect our recent strong customer 
lending growth, particularly in the Retail 
Bank, to continue. Georgia’s capital 
markets development, which remains 
in its infancy, will create significant 
opportunities over the next few years 
to develop more capital efficient growth 
opportunities throughout the business 
and we expect to be at the forefront of 
that capital market development in the 
country, thereby producing value creation 
opportunities for our shareholders.

4x20 strategy going forward
Going forward we plan to increase the relative size of our highly profitable Retail Banking business 
and to generate additional non-interest income from advisory and other fee-generating businesses.  
In addition, we plan to make further equity investments in areas outside our core banking operations. 
4x20 strategy in 2015 4x20 strategy going forward
At the end of 2015, the Board updated 
our strategy with the aim of making it 
more relevant. While we are committed to 
growing our business while maintaining 
our existing strong capitalisation, Tier I 
c.20% became non-relevant, as regulation 
moved to Basel 2/3. Additionally, in the 
context of excess capital of c.GEL 600 
million at BGEO Group, we aim to have 
efficient capital management at the Bank. 
To reflect this, at the end of 2015, we 
have updated our 4x20 strategy, which is 
focused on enhancing BGEO’s profitability 
by optimising capital allocation. This 
includes our continued commitment to 
the Bank’s highly profitable retail franchise 
and augmenting the Group returns 
through carefully targeted direct equity 
investments, with a clear exit strategy and 
targeted IRR above 20%, to contribute 
up to 20% of the Group’s profits.
Our key goal is to continue producing 
high returns in the long run for our 
shareholders. Currently, we see that Retail 
Banking is producing over 30% ROAE 
while Corporate Banking is producing 
c.15% ROAE. Therefore, we want to 
increase the share of retail banking 
portfolio to 65% over the next three years.
Due to the limited access to capital 
and management in a small frontier 
economy such as Georgia, we continue 
to see a much better risk return profile 
when investing in Georgian companies 
than when lending to those same 
corporates. We also believe that the 
Group can add value for our shareholders 
by investing in opportunities, which 
currently are not accessible to our 
shareholders, changing management 
and governance, institutionalising and 
scaling up the companies, and most 
importantly, unlocking value by exiting 
from these companies over time. BGEO’s 
management has a proven track record 
of creating value through successful 
business development and investments.

Our strategy continued
4x20 strategy going forward
Due to the limited access to capital and 
management in a small frontier economy 
such as Georgia, we see a much better 
risk return profile when investing in 
Georgian companies than when lending to 
those same corporates. We also believe 
that the Group will be adding value for our 
shareholders by investing in opportunities, 
which currently are not accessible to our 
shareholders, changing management and 
governance, institutionalising and scaling 
up the companies, and most importantly, 
unlocking value by exiting from these 
companies over time. Our Plan A in exit is 
to take the company public. This way, as 
far as possible, it is our firm intention to 
create an opportunity for our shareholders 
to participate in such offerings. 
Our key principles around investing and 
managing the companies at BGEO:
1. Be opportunistic and disciplined
Georgia was born ten years ago and 
different sectors and businesses are in the 
process of formation, access to capital 
and management is limited, owners of 
businesses are cash poor and therefore 
good opportunities can be captured 
cheaply. At the same time, we are under no 
pressure to make new investments and we 
are extremely selective and opportunistic 
and will not commit more than US$ 25 
million in a single investment in a sector 
where we are not already present. Our 
dividend policy is the natural self-discipline 
mechanism for our investment business. 
2. In scale we trust
Achieving superior economies of 
scale in a small frontier economy is an 
essential part of the success. It actually 
significantly diminishes the risk of failure. 
3. Get our hands dirty
Similarly to limited access to capital in this 
country, the availability of management 
is limited and by being a machine of 
producing top talent in the country we 
can add value for our shareholders. We 
understand that great management teams 
make great companies, and investing 
time in growing people continues to be 
critical for the success of our strategy. 
4. Good governance makes good 
returns 
We are big believers that robust 
governance is the source of value creation 
for our shareholders. The natural and 
simple alignment of interest between 
shareholders and management by 
awarding long-term stock works well for 
value creation and, finally, we want to have 
good balance by having separate people 
as the Chairman and CEO of the Company. 
5. Liquidity is king 
In order for our strategy to work we 
need to be disciplined in unlocking the 
value of companies in which we invest 
and manage. Taking companies public 
is our preferred option for exit, as it is 
our intention to give our shareholders 
an opportunity to participate.
The way we invest and manage the companies
1.  At least 20% Return on Equity in the 
Banking Business
  Profitability is expected to be driven  
by further growth in both the retail  
and corporate banking businesses with 
an increased focus on the significantly 
more profitable retail franchise, as we 
aim to increase our share in retail loans.
2.  At least 20% retail loan book growth
  Our net loan book has grown at a 
CAGR of 23.6% from 2010 to 2015 and 
we remain committed to at least 20% 
growth in our retail customer lending. 
Our focus is on increasing retail loan 
portfolio to 65%, from its current 55%, 
over the next three years. Specifically, 
we are looking to further grow our 
Express (self-service) Banking network 
as well as our payments business, 
transform our retail mass market 
operations, through the Bank of Georgia 
brand, into a customer-centric bank and 
significantly increase our market share 
in the mass affluent segment, with our 
premium brand Solo.
3.  Internal rate of return of minimum 
20% for each of the individual future 
investments of the Company
  We will target investments with a 
minimum of 20% IRR and partial or full 
exit in a maximum of six years. We will 
acquire only businesses that we believe 
have a well-defined exit path, to which 
end we will target companies with 
potential EBITDA of at least US$ 30 
million within three to four years post 
acquisition with a view to potential 
future exits, including by way of stock 
market listings or trade sale.
4.  A maximum 20% profit contribution, 
of the Group’s profits, from our 
investments in non-banking 
businesses
  We aim to remain primarily a banking 
group, with an investment arm. No 
matter how well our non-banking 
companies do in terms of operating 
results, we want to see their exit to 
unlock the value and with the generated 
profit return capital to our shareholders 
and pursue new opportunities – in the 
event that we see one.
Dividends: Our future dividend policy is 
expected to comprise recurring 
dividend payments linked to recurring 
profits from the banking group, with a 
targeted dividend payout ratio of 
25–40%. In addition, we will aim to 
provide capital return upon the 
realisation of our financial investments 
and are targeting at least three capital 
returns in the next five years. Some of 
the profits may be reinvested if further 
attractive investment opportunities 
arise. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   33

Banking Business – crown jewel in our Group and the key driver of profitability
We have three segments in the banking business, of which Retail Banking will drive most of our 
Banking Business growth, Corporate Banking and Investment Management will improve our 
ROAE, with the latter also contributing an increasing share of our fee and commission income.
Investment Business
The planned capital allocations in the Investment Businesses during the 2015-2018 period are 
expected to total approximately US$ 35 million.
Strategic goal How we are doing this
Bank of Georgia aims to shift the mix of its 
customer lending to become 65% retail and 
35% corporate with the product per client 
ratio in the Retail Bank targeted to increase to 
3.0 products, from a current 1.7 products.
•  Expand our product offering through continuous innovation to remain at the forefront of meeting the 
growing funding and investment needs of our extensive retail customer and corporate client base.
• Expand our Express Banking strategy to increase our number of customers by attracting the currently 
unbanked population and by means of a shift towards transactional banking.
• Expand on our market-leading payments business in Georgia through our Express Banking strategy.
• Leverage our superior distribution network and local expertise across various business lines to step up our 
cross-selling strategies.
• Shift from current segment approach to client-centric approach with an aim to capture growth 
opportunities and increase penetration through cross-selling, to be measured primarily by an improvement 
in product/client ratio.
• With Solo strategy, we aim to significantly increase our market share in the mass affluent segment over the 
next three to four years.
• Continued investment in our IT and payment business.
The Bank will continue to reduce 
concentration risk in the corporate lending 
portfolio, with the support of the Investment 
Management business, to target the top ten 
borrowers to represent less than 10% of the 
total loan portfolio.
• In February 2016, we announced combination of the Bank’s Corporate Banking and Investment 
Management businesses into a Corporate Investment Banking business (CIB). The merged business will 
leverage our superior knowledge and capital markets capabilities in the Georgian and neighbouring 
markets both in terms of reach and the expertise that we have accumulated during the past several years 
through our corporate advisory, research and brokerage practices united under Galt & Taggart – a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Bank of Georgia at the forefront of capital markets development in the country. 
• As a result, we expect to grow our fee income, improve the Bank’s ROAE and reduce concentration risk in 
the corporate lending portfolio. Reflecting this change, the Group will report CIB business results 
separately starting in the first quarter 2016.
The net interest margin is expected to be 
c.7.25% – 7.75%.
• Leverage the Bank’s pricing power stemming from its market leadership to maintain strong loan yield 
levels and continue optimising its Cost of Deposits without compromising deposit growth.
• Access international capital markets to attract cheaper international funding.
The Bank aims to manage to a Cost/Income 
ratio of around 35% over the medium term.
•  Continued cost control measures and implementation of technologies aimed at improving workflow 
efficiency.
•  Leverage the strength of our scope and franchise to increase the cost-efficiency benefit for the underlying 
businesses and the Group as whole.
• Expansion of Express Banking strategy and investing in express technologies to enable us to further scale 
up the business with minimal incremental operating costs.
• Education platform to contribute further to lowering operating costs over the medium and long term.
The Bank will continue to enhance its already 
prudent risk management practice, and the 
Bank’s cost of risk ratio is expected to be in the 
1.5%-2.0% range.
• Risk management system is based on the principle of continually assessing risk throughout the life of any 
operation.
• Ongoing monitoring and control allowing efficient adjustments in case of any negative changes in the 
conditions on which the preliminary risk assessment was made.
• Determination of an acceptable risk level.
• Continuous analysis of efficiency of the risk management system.
Investment Business Strategic goal 
Healthcare business – Georgia Healthcare 
Group 
•  At least double 2015 revenues in 2018.
•  Achieve a 20% return on average equity and start paying dividends by 2019.

revenue in excess of 30% in the medium to long term.
•  Roll out a network of ambulatory clinics to achieve a 17% market share by revenues in the medium to 
long term.

How we are going to achieve our targets over the next two to three years 34   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Strategy
Our strategy continued
Retail banking – client-centric, multi-brand strategy
Express – capturing emerging retail banking clients
We began implementing our Express Banking strategy 
in 2012 by rolling out small-format, Express branches 
offering predominantly transactional banking services to 
clients through ATMs and Express Pay Terminals.
The aim was to make banking relationships simple, faster, cheaper and 
convenient for both our existing customers and for the emerging bankable 
population.
A Self-Service Terminal can be described as a small bank by itself as it 
allows a wide array of payment services ranging from current account 
top-ups and loan repayments to utility bill payments and metro ticket 
purchases. In 2015, we had installed 350 new Express Pay Terminals, 
resulting in 2,589 total Express Pay Terminals as of the end of the year. We 
are now leaders in Georgia in the payment systems market. We have 
combined our travel card for the Tbilisi bus and metro (of which we are the 
sole provider) and our contactless card with a loyalty programme linked to 
the customer’s current account to create an “Express Card” and have issued 
over 469,919 such cards in 2015. At the end of the year we had more than 
1,191,828 Express cards outstanding. 
Nowadays, express is the major growth driver in our fee and commission 
income from Retail Banking segment and a strong franchise attracting the 
unbanked population to the Bank, eventually growing them into a mass retail 
customers.

Bank of Georgia – unparalleled mass retail banking franchise
Under the Bank of Georgia brand we target the mass 
retail segment. This is our flagship brand and most 
significant profit contributor.
With 2.0 million individual clients and 100,000 SME and Micro clients, this 
segment is very much product driven and our biggest challenge is to change 
the business model to become more client-centric and therefore increase the 
1.9 current product to client ratio over time. We are currently working on 
three main areas to achieve our goal of higher product to client ratio in this 
segment. 
 
• Client-centric physical environment: we recognise that our current 
branches (pictured below) are built around products and they are not 
convenient to our clients. We have separate corners for various products 
and clients need to navigate the branch space to get all the services they 
need – the client now comes to the product, rather than vice versa. To 
address this, we have worked with McKinsey to redesign the branches to 
build them around the client and make their experience comfortable. We 
will be launching our first client-centric branch in September 2016 and 
aim to complete the redesign of most branches by the end of 2017.
• Client-centric service: we train our front-office personnel to sell and 
service across the product range. We also free up their time from 
processes that do not involve client interaction, by moving those 
processes to the back-office. 
• Client-centric digital channels: our clients extensively use digital 
channels. This includes both personal computer and mobile applications. 
And the digital channel utilisation has grown strongly for the past couple 
of years. We recognise that developing client-centric digital channels is no 
less important than redesigning our branches. We have established a 
digital banking division, with a team of marketing and IT professionals to 
lead our online transformation. We aim to launch the new digital channels 
by the end of 2016.

Solo – a fundamentally different approach to premium banking
In April 2015, we launched Solo - a fundamentally 
different approach to premium banking. As part of the 
new strategy, the Bank’s Solo clients are given access to 
exclusive products and the finest concierge-style 
environment at our newly designed Solo lounges and 
are provided with new lifestyle opportunities, such as 
exclusive events and handpicked lifestyle products.
In our Solo lounges, Solo clients are offered, at a cost, a selection of luxury 
products and accessories that are currently not available in the country. Solo 
clients enjoy tailor-made solutions including new financial products such as 
bonds, which pay a significantly higher yield compared to deposits, and 
other securities developed by Galt & Taggart, the Bank’s Investment Banking 
arm.
With Solo we are targeting the mass affluent retail segment and aim to build 
brand loyalty through exclusive experiences offered through the new Solo. 
We currently have only 11,869 Solo clients and an estimated market share of 
less than 13% in this segment. We have already opened two new Solo 
lounges and will increase the number of lounges in line with the increasing 
number of clients. Our goal with the new strategy is to significantly increase 
our market share in this segment over the next three to four years.

Reflecting this change, the Group will 
report CIB business results separately 
starting in the first quarter 2016.
One critical goal in the Corporate 
Banking business is to increase 
ROAE and we plan to do this by de-
concentrating our loan book and 
decreasing the cost of risk through: 
a. Syndicating loans out.
b. Selling risk.
c. Helping our large corporate clients to 
access capital by issuing debt securities 
on the local capital market.
We will focus on further building 
our fee business through the trade 
finance franchise, which we believe 
is the strongest in the region. 
As Georgia has a pay-as-you-go pension 
system, we believe that our international 
wealth management franchise can 
benefit by focusing on the distribution 
of local debt. So far we see that c.70% 
of the demand in local paper issuances 
comes from our international wealth 
management clients. Further enlargement 
of the footprint of our international wealth 
management franchise will be critical 
for the success of our strategy to build 
local capital markets. Therefore, we 
will be investing more in this area. 
As a result, we expect to grow our 
fee income, improve the Bank’s 
ROAE and reduce concentration risk 
in the corporate lending portfolio.  Investment business strategies

Our strategy continued
GHG is the largest healthcare services and medical insurance provider operating in the fast-
growing, predominantly privately-owned, Georgian healthcare market, which is characterised by 
low utilisation and high fragmentation, leaving significant room for medium to long-term growth. 
The healthcare services market (including 
hospitals and ambulatory clinics) is 
estimated at GEL 2.1 billion for 2015, with 
a strong compound growth momentum 
of 13.5% between 2011 and 2014, which 
is expected to continue growing at 13.3% 
during the period 2014-2018. Healthcare 
services spending per capita is currently at 
a very low base of only US$ 217, with annual 
outpatient encounters of only 3.5 per capita 
and hospital bed utilisation of only 50%, all 
significantly lower than many comparable 
countries. Supportive government reforms 
and the engagement of private players 
in the sector have resulted in significant 
improvements in the overall standard of 
infrastructure and greatly boosted demand 
for quality healthcare services. With GHG’s 
scale, efficient operations, breadth and 
quality of service offering and proven 
management team, the management of 
GHG believes that GHG is ideally positioned 
to take advantage of the expected long-
term macroeconomic and structural 
growth drivers favourably influencing the 
Georgian healthcare services market.
Reflecting these long-term growth 
prospects, the management of GHG is 
targeting at least doubling of 2015 revenues 
by 2018 through a combination of:
• Expanding through the further 
development of both existing and 
recently acquired hospitals, focusing 
predominantly on the higher revenue 
referral hospital segments in Tbilisi.  
The addressable hospital market is GEL 
1.2 billion in 2015 and is forecasted to 
grow at a compound annual growth 
rate of 11.3% during the period 2014 to 
2018. GHG’s market share was 14.0% 
and 22.1% by revenue and bed capacity, 
respectively, at 30 June 2015. Following 
the acquisition of High Technology Medical 
Centre University Clinic in August 2015, 
GHG’s market share by beds grew to 
26.6%, and (on a pro forma basis) market 
share by revenue increased to 17.6%.
• Launching of a network of new 
ambulatory clinics across Tbilisi and in 
other major cities in Georgia. 
The addressable ambulatory clinic market 
is GEL 0.9 billion in 2015 and is forecasted 
to grow at a compound annual growth 
rate of 15.9% during the period 2014 to 
2018. GHG’s market share was under 
1% at 30 June 2015, with the rest of the 
market similarly fragmented, with no single 
player having more than 1% market share 
and no other player having comparable 
access to capital and management, 
allowing GHG a unique first mover 
advantage in this highly fragmented and 
underpenetrated outpatient segment.
• Continuing to grow over the medium 
term by developing new services and 
investing in medical technology to fill 
existing medical service gaps in the 
country and improve efficiencies. 
Currently service gaps exist in a 
number of basic diagnostics areas 
and treatments, such as MRI, 
laparoscopic surgeries, oncology, 
pediatrics, neonatology, intensive care, 
cardiology, and rehabilitation services.
• Continued focus on improving 
operational efficiency and utilisation 
to further improve margins. 
GHG’s healthcare services EBITDA 
margin was 27.4% at 31 December 
2015, improving compared to 24.3% 
for the same period last year toward a 
target of approximately 30%. GHG is 
in the process of integrating its newly 
acquired hospital facilities, and is 
targeting a second wave of integration 
which among other things will include 
the centralisation of engineering, 
archiving, and ERP roll-out.
In March 2016, GHG signed a binding 
memorandum of understanding, 
subject to relevant regulatory 
approvals, to acquire a 100% equity 
stake in JSC GPC, one of the top 
three pharmaceutical retailers and 
wholesalers in Georgia. This move 
clearly fits GHG’s strategy to be 
the leading integrated player in the 
Georgian healthcare ecosystem

Renewable Energy – five-year roadmap
Over the past several years, m
2
 Real 
Estate has established itself as one of the 
most recognisable and trustworthy 
residential housing brands in the country. 
For the next three years, the main priority 
for m
2
 is to deliver capital return of US$ 
20-25 million by 2019 by:
• Continuing residential 
developments – continuing to unlock 
land value by developing housing 
projects and liquidating existing land 
plots, as well as to start development 
of third-party lands. Currently, m
2
 
owns land bank of US$ 43.4 million*, 
diligence, but so far have actually spent 
only about US$ 1 million. In the process, 
we have established a strategic 
partnership with industry specialists – RP 
Global (Austria), who have more than 25 
years of experience in the development, 
financing and operation of Small Hydro 
Power Plants in an international context. 
BGEO has 65% share in the business, with 
the remaining 35% owned by RP Global. 
Our goal for the next five years is to 
complete development of 100MW capacity 
with a capacity of c.5,200 apartments 
(in addition to 2,510 apartments in 
existing eight projects, both completed 
and ongoing).
• the Growing yielding asset portfolio 
– m

 will enhance its yielding asset 
portfolio through two sources: 
 – Commercial space: accumulating 
yielding assets, by mainly retaining 
commercial real estate in residential 
developments and acquiring 
opportunistically and/or developing 
high street retail, commercial and 
office space, with capital gain upside 
and c.10-12% annual yield.
 – 3-star hotel development: m

 has 
and identify additional 100MW 
development capacity. We currently have 
four hydropower plant projects, two of 
which will start in the beginning of 2017, 
with the launch scheduled in 2018. 
Construction of the other two 
hydropower plants will start later in 2017 
and complete in 2019. Exit opportunities 
include sale in parts or scaling up 
(through second stage) and doing public 
listing or strategic sale. We expect to 
realise IRR of at least 25%.

We aim to tap the renewable energy 
opportunity that exists in Georgia by 
investing in hydro power plant 
development. The industry is highly 
underpenetrated, with only 20-25% of 
Georgia’s hydro resources being utilised. 
It is relatively cheap to develop hydro 
power stations in Georgia, at 
approximately US$ 1.5 million, compared 
to at least US$ 3.0 in central Europe. 
For the past two years we have been 
actively engaged in planning and due

seven years and aims to develop 
three hotels (3-star, select service

About the GHG IPO
BGEO listed its healthcare subsidiary on the premium segment of the London Stock 
Exchange (GHG:LN) in November 2015 
GHG IPO was an important transaction for BGEO, as it represented the first realisation of BGEO’s 
investment in non-banking businesses, and demonstrated the potential to unlock the significant value 
described when the Group announced its new corporate strategy in December 2014. Following the 
GHG IPO, BGEO holds a 65% stake in the company. 
GHG story: creating single largest 
healthcare player in Georgia 
GHG is an exemplary story about how 
we seize opportunities and unlock the 
value in the Georgian corporate sector. 
In five years, we created the single 
largest healthcare player in Georgia and 
established a clear exit path through 
its IPO on the premium segment of the 
London Stock Exchange in November 
2015, achieving 121% IRR and 3.9x 
money on our investment at IPO. 
GHG’s story really started in 2011, when 
the government reforms in the healthcare 
sector created real opportunity for private 
players. Until 2011, we primarily focused 
on the medical insurance market and also 
owned several ambulatory clinics, which 
would service our insured clients. In 2007, 
the government launched the first stage 
of its targeted healthcare financing reform, 
by purchasing medical insurance from 
private insurance companies on behalf 
of c.0.8 million economically vulnerable 
citizens, giving boost to the medical 
insurance industry. However, despite 
growth in spending, the vast majority of 
healthcare facilities in the country were 
in very poor condition, seeing little to 
no investment since the Soviet-era. We 
had invested less than GEL 0.5 million in 
the healthcare business at this stage.

Additional

In 2011, the government launched 
its healthcare infrastructure reform, 
introducing incentives for private 
companies to invest in renovation or 
greenfield development of healthcare 
facilities. At that time, having been 
on both sides, in insurance and in 
healthcare services, we already had 
valuable insights into the industry and 
were well-positioned and fast to take 
advantage of the growth opportunity. 
Hence, in 2011, the Board made a decision 
to scale-up our healthcare operations, with 
a synergistic business model of three types 
of healthcare facilities (referral hospitals, 
community hospitals and ambulatory 
clinics) and medical insurance under one 
umbrella, capturing patient flow along 
the treatment pathway. In the next five 
years, we grew our business through 
greenfield developments, acquisitions and 
renovations, investing a total of GEL 142.4 
million. Most importantly, we were very 
disciplined in our investments, investing 
small at the beginning and always buying 
cheap. We invested only GEL 32.5 million 
during the first three years. Our first major 
acquisition, Block Georgia was a non-
cash transaction at 3.1x-EBITDA valuation, 
followed by the Imedi L acquisition for 
GEL 9.6 million at 4.9x-EBITDA valuation, 
achieving unparalleled scope relative to our 
competition by the end of 2012. During the 
first three years of investment, we tested 
the concept and worked on our longer-
term business development strategy; spent 
time on launching newly built or renovated 
healthcare facilities, restructured and 
integrated the acquired healthcare facilities 
and researched other acquisition targets. 
In 2012 and then in 2013, the government 
launched two other stages of its financing 
reform, eventually settling on the Universal 
Healthcare Programme, which covers 
the basic healthcare needs for the entire 
population of Georgia. Enhanced financing 
from the government gave a further boost 
to the healthcare industry and as GHG 
was already an established and major 
player in the industry, we accelerated 
investments and executed several key 
transactions, investing another GEL 
110.0 million between 2014 and 2015. 
Since 2011, we have established a core 
senior management team, hiring from 
leading healthcare institutions in Georgia 
and abroad, as well as promoting 
internally and rotating key employees 
within the Group to accomplish a robust 
and diverse senior management team at 
GHG. Furthermore, to create a natural 
and long-term alignment of interest 
between management and shareholders, 
we replicated BGEO’s management 
compensation structure at GHG level. We 
award long-term vesting shares (up to five 
years) to GHG’s management and make 
compensation in shares a large proportion 
of total annual compensation (e.g. 85-
90%). By putting strong management 
in place, with the right incentives and 
providing capital to fund growth, we 
further widened the gap between GHG 
and its competition. By the end of 2015, 
GHG operated 2,670 hospital beds, 
with a market share of 26.6% based on 
number of beds, and insured 234,000 
clients, with 38.4% market share based 
on net insurance premium revenue.
In 2014, we started working on the GHG 
IPO, in line with our strategy to fully or 
partially exit from our investments in non-
banking businesses, with ultimate goal 
to return the capital to our shareholders. 
We replicated BGEO’s governance 
structure at GHG, by putting a first class 
Board in place, with diverse skill-sets and 
expertise of the industry and the region. 
Our experience of similar transactions at 
BGEO, as well as constant engagement 
with the investor community proved 
essential in executing the GHG IPO – an 
important milestone in the realisation of 
BGEO’s investment business strategy. 
Raising money for further development 
of GHG’s business and crystallising the 
value of GHG were our main goals, both 
of which were successfully achieved 
through GHG’s IPO in November 2015. 
In November 2015, GHG successfully 
priced its IPO and completed the premium 
listing, raising a total of approximately 
US$ 100 million in primary proceeds and 
valuing GHG at a market capitalisation 
of £218 million at the admission, with a 
35% free float, following the exercise of 
over-allotment option that represented 
approximately 10% shareholding. 
GHG received strong support from 
a diversified and extremely high-
quality institutional investor base and 
welcomed more than 100 new investors, 
as it embarked on the next phase of 
development. Following completion of 
the IPO, the company was included in 
the FTSE All-Share Index in 1Q 2016.
A public listing enhances GHG’s ability 
to take advantage of the significant 
market growth prospects of the Georgian 
healthcare sector. Most of the primary 
proceeds of approximately US$ 100 million 
are being used to fund GHG’s immediate 
growth plans, aimed at helping it to 
achieve at least a doubling of 2015 revenue 
by 2018. GHG’s clear growth vision, 
combined with hospital expansion potential 
and first mover advantage in the highly 
fragmented and relatively underpenetrated 
ambulatory segment, creates a highly 
attractive investment opportunity in the 
Georgian healthcare services industry. 
BGEO has been a strong and committed 
shareholder to the development of the 
healthcare business for many years 
and we intend to maintain this support 
over the next few years, as GHG will be 
working on delivering on its goal to more 
than double 2015 healthcare services 
revenue by 2018, while achieving 30% 
EBITDA margin and capturing ample 
growth opportunities beyond 2018.

Key performance indicators
A strong performance
Our KPIs for 2015 reflect a continuing strong performance in each 
of our Banking and Investment Businesses, demonstrating 
excellent customer lending growth with improving margins, 
balance sheet strength and strong profitability, together with 
substantial further progress in our Investment Businesses.
For more information on our financial 
results, see page 70
Returns KPIs
Diversified revenue sources, a growing loan book and efficient 
cost performance were the main drivers of the exceptional results 
in terms of profitability against the backdrop of a weaker external 
environment in 2015. 
The resilience of NIM is a function of our distribution capabilities 
and pricing power. The substantial growth of the loan book during 
2015 enabled our NIM to withstand downward pressures and high 
excess liquidity levels than in 2014. The resulting robust growth in 
interest income, the further increased contribution of non-interest 
income to our revenue, strong margins and improving cost 
efficiency translated into 29.1% growth in profit. 
In 2016 and beyond, we will continue to focus on profitable 
earnings growth, to be driven by good levels of customer lending 
growth without compromising asset quality, an increase in the 
share of income from fee-generating operations and an expansion 
of our investment businesses.

BGEO risk management 
We are exposed to risk and uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial position, operational results and reputation as well as the value and liquidity of our shares. 
We are committed to safeguarding the interests of our shareholders and understand that in order to 
do this, a robust system of risk management and internal control is essential. 
Overview 
We identify, evaluate, manage and 
monitor the risks that we face through an 
integrated control framework consisting 
of formal policies and procedures, 
clearly delegated authority levels and 
comprehensive reporting. The Board 
confirms that our framework has been 
in place throughout the year under 
review and to the date of approval of 
this Annual Report and Accounts and is 
integrated into both our business planning 
and viability assessment processes.
Our Board, supported by our Audit and 
Risk Committees and senior management, 
is ultimately responsible for the Group’s 
risk management and internal controls. 
We believe that in order to have an 
effective risk management framework there 
needs to be a strong risk management 
culture within the Group. We have worked 
to ensure that managing risk is engrained 
in our everyday business activities. We 
seek to create an environment where there 
is openness and transparency in how we 
make decisions and manage risks and 
where business managers are accountable 
for the risk management and internal 
control processes associated with their 
activities. Our culture also seeks to ensure 
that risk management is responsive, 
forward-looking and consistent.
Our framework 
The Board’s mandate includes determining 
the Group’s risk appetite and risk tolerance 
as well as monitoring risk exposures to 
ensure that the nature and extent of the 
main risks we face are consistent with our 
overall goals and strategic objectives. We 
develop risk management strategies which 
address the full spectrum of risks that 
the Group faces. We are accountable for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the systems 
and processes of risk management and 
internal control, with the Audit and Risk 
Committees assisting in the discharge of 
this responsibility. We also focus on the 
resolution of any internal control failures 
that may arise, although no significant 
failures occurred during 2015 and the 
period up to the date of this Annual Report.
The Group’s risk appetite is the amount 
and type of risk that we are prepared 
to seek, accept or tolerate. Our risk 
appetite evolves over time to reflect new 
risks and changes in external market 
developments and circumstances.
Our control framework is the foundation 
for the delivery of effective risk 
management. At the Board, Committee 
and senior management levels, we 
develop formal policies and procedures 
which explain the way in which risks 
need to be systematically identified, 
assessed, quantified, managed 
and monitored. We clearly delegate 
authority levels and reporting lines 
throughout the management hierarchy. 
Each business participates in the risk 
management process by identifying 
the key risks applicable to its business. 
Through senior management, we 
ensure that our employees are given 
the appropriate training and knowledge 
to perform their roles in line with the 
framework we have developed.
On a day-to-day basis, management is 
responsible for the implementation of 
the Group’s risk management and other 
internal control policies and procedures. 
Based on our risk culture, managers 
“own” the risks relevant to their respective 
function. For each risk identified at any 
level of the business, the risk is measured, 
mitigated (if possible) in accordance 
with our policies and procedures and 
monitored. Managers are required to 
report on identified risks and responses 
to such risks on a consistent basis. 
Senior management regularly review 
the output from the bottom-up process 
by providing independent challenge 
and assessing the implementation 
of the risk management and internal 
control policies and procedures.
Comprehensive reporting forms an integral 
part of our framework. Our reporting 
process enables key risks to be escalated 
to the appropriate level of authority and 
provides assurance to the Committees and 
the Board. Key developments affecting our 
principal risks and associated mitigating 
actions are reviewed quarterly (or more 
often if necessary on an ad hoc basis if 
outside of the regular reporting process) 
by the Audit and Risk Committees, as 
appropriate, and the Board. The principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group 
are identified through this process. 
A description of these principal risks 
and uncertainties in addition to recent 
trends and outlook as well as 
mitigation efforts can be found on 
pages 48 to 51.
Since the Bank is the Group’s largest 
business and operates in the complex 
financial services sector, its risk 
management and internal control 
framework is key to that of the Group.
A detailed description of the Bank’s 
risk management and internal  
control framework can be found  
on page 99.
Internal control
As mentioned above, our Board is 
responsible for reviewing and approving 
the Group’s system of internal control 
and its adequacy and effectiveness. 
Controls are reviewed to ensure 
effective management of strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance 
risk issues. Certain matters, such as the 
approval of major capital expenditure, 
significant acquisitions or disposals 
and major contracts, among others, 
are reserved exclusively for the Board. 
The full schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for the Board can be found on 
our website, at http://bgeo.com/page/
id/67/schedule-of-matters-reserved-
for-the-board. With respect to other 
matters, the Board is often assisted by 
both the Audit and Risk Committees.
With respect to internal control over 
financial reporting, including over the 
Group’s consolidation process, our 
financial procedures include a range of 
system, transactional and management 
oversight controls. Our businesses prepare 
detailed monthly management reports 
that include analyses of their results along 
with comparisons to relevant strategic 
plans, budgets, forecasts and prior results. 
These are presented to and reviewed 
by senior management. Each quarter, 
the CFO of JSC BGEO Group and the 
Bank as well as the finance team discuss 
financial reporting and associated internal 
controls with the Audit Committee, which 
reports significant findings to the Board. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the 
quarterly, half-year and full-year financial 
statements and corresponding press 
releases and provides feedback to the 
Board. The external and internal auditors 
attend each Audit Committee meeting and 
the Audit Committee meets regularly both 
with and without management present.

with the Chief Risk Officer and Head of 
Compliance and other senior management 
on a quarterly basis. Any key issues 
identified are escalated to the Board. The 
Board also receives regular presentations 
directly from the head of each business. 
Important risk and internal control issues 
are addressed in such presentations. 
The Group’s internal audit function 
reviews a number of areas of risk 
pursuant to a programme approved by 
the Audit Committee. Any issues or risks 
arising from an internal audit review are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
appropriate actions are undertaken to 
ensure satisfactory resolution. The Head 
of Internal Audit has a direct reporting line 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Our systems of internal control are 
also supported by our Whistleblowing 
Policy, which allows employees to 
report concerns on an anonymous 
basis. The Audit Committee approves 
the Whistleblowing Policy on an 
annual basis and receives quarterly 
reports from the Head of Compliance 
on any significant issues raised.
Effectiveness review
Each year, we review the effectiveness 
of our risk management processes 
and internal control systems, with 
the assistance of the Audit and Risk 
Committees. This review covers all material 
systems, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The latest review 
covered the financial year to 31 December 
2015 and the period to the approval of 
this Annual Report and Accounts. 
We obtained assurance from 
management, Internal Audit, our external 
auditors and other external specialists.
The Board is able to conclude with 
reasonable assurance that the appropriate 
internal control and risk management 
systems were maintained throughout 
the year and operated effectively. The 
review did not identify any significant 
weaknesses or failings in the systems. We 
are satisfied that our risk management 
processes and internal control systems 
processes comply with the UK Corporate
Governance Code 2014 (the Code) 
and the FRC’s (Financial Reporting 
Council) guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting.
Although we did not identify any significant 
weaknesses or failings, we continuously 
strive to improve our framework as 
circumstances change and new risks 
emerge. With the assistance of the 
Audit Committee, external consultants 
were engaged in 2015 to perform an 
audit of the Group’s IT and IS systems, 
which included a review of our cyber-
security controls. The report concluded 
that our IT and IS controls overall are 
strong. We discussed the results and 
recommendations of the audit report with 
the Audit Committee and management, 
who subsequently developed a plan to 
address the main recommendations. 
With the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, we will continue to monitor 
management’s implementation of this plan.
Committee reports
As noted throughout this discussion, 
both the Audit and Risk Committees 
play an essential role in implementing 
effective risk management and internal 
control. Each Committee has described 
this work in their Committee report. 
The Audit and Risk Committee 
Reports can be found on pages 100 
to 103 and pages 104 to 105, 
respectively.
Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and 
position are set out on pages 2 to 85. 
After making enquiries, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that BGEO and the Group, 
as a whole, have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the Code, the Directors have assessed 
the viability of the Group over a three-
year period beginning 1 January 2016, 
being the first day after the end of the 
financial year to which this report relates.
This assessment has taken into 
account the:
• Group’s current financial and 
operational condition, including  
capital allocation;
• Group’s future prospects;
• Board’s risk appetite;
• Group’s strategy as set out 
on pages 30 to 41;
• Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, principally those 
related to the devaluation of the 
Lari and dollarisation of our loan 
book, and how they are managed, 
as set out on pages 48 to 51; 
• effectiveness of our risk 
management framework and 
internal control process; and 
• downside stress testing performed 
for the assessment period, which 
involved modelling the impact of a 
combination of severe and plausible 
adverse scenarios as well as the 
availability and likely effectiveness of 
the mitigating actions that could be 
taken to avoid or reduce the impact or 
occurrence of the identified underlying 
risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Directors have determined that a 
three-year period to 31 December 2018 
is an appropriate period over which 
to provide its viability statement as 
the Board considers its strategic plan, 
financial budgets and forecasts annually 
and on a rolling three-year basis. 
Based on the analysis described 
above, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period from 
1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.  48   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Principal risks and uncertainties
All of the risks set out below could materially affect the Group, its businesses, future operations and financial condition and could 
cause actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. The risks below are not the only ones that the Group will 
face. Some risks are not yet known and some currently not deemed to be material could later become so. In accordance with the 
provisions of the Code, the Board has taken into consideration the principal risks in the context of determining whether to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting and when assessing the prospects of the Group for the purposes of the Viability Statement. 
The Viability Statement can be found 
on page 47 of this Strategic Report.
The risks identified below are those that the Board considers to be the most relevant to the Group in 
relation to their potential impact on achievement of its strategic objectives. 
Risks and uncertainties Trend and outlook Mitigation
We may be adversely affected by 
continued devaluation of the Lari 
in addition to general deterioration 
of global, regional and Georgian 
economic conditions.
In 2015, the Lari depreciated against the 
US Dollar by 22%. Our Banking Business 
NPLs to gross loans increased to 4.3% 
as of 31 December 2015, compared to 
3.4% as of 31 December 2014, and our 
cost of risk ratio increased to 2.7% in 
2015 compared to 1.2% in 2014. There 
is a risk that any future devaluation of the 
Lari against the US Dollar may adversely 
affect the quality of our loan portfolio, as 
our corporate loan book and mortgage 
portfolio is heavily US Dollar-denominated 
and many of our customers earn Lari.
We are also affected by other 
macroeconomic and market conditions 
globally, regionally and in Georgia. Global 
markets conditions remain volatile and 
growth has recently slowed in many 
emerging economies, including Georgia. 
In addition to currency exchange rates, 
other macroeconomic factors relating 
to Georgia, such as GDP, inflation and 
interest rates, may have a material impact 
on loan losses, our margins and customer 
demand for our products and services.
In the last quarter of 2015, the GEL/
US$ exchange rate stabilised. Since 
1 January 2016, the Lari has appreciated 
against the US Dollar. We are, however, 
unable to predict future changes in 
the GEL/US$ exchange rate.
Global and regional economic 
conditions remain volatile and there is 
significant economic uncertainty.
Real GDP growth in Georgia decreased to 
2.8% in 2015 from 4.6% in 2014, according 
to Geostat. This decrease was due to a 
weaker external economic environment, 
which was reflected in weaker remittances, 
lower net exports from Georgia and lower 
FDI. Despite lower GDP growth in Georgia 
in 2015, we believe that Georgia was 
particularly resilient in the context of the 
economic turbulences in the region.
The IMF has predicted that GDP growth in 
the region is expected to be 0.5% in 2016, 
increasing to approximately 2.0% in 2017. 
With respect to Georgia alone, the IMF has 
predicted that GDP growth is expected to 
be 3.0% in 2016 and to average 5.0% in 
2017-2020. We believe that real GDP growth 
in Georgia will be in the range of 3.0% to 
4.5% in 2016 as a result of healthy market 
fundamentals, new investment opportunities, 
increased tourism and government reform 
aimed at tax and customs liberalisation. 
Average annual inflation was 4.0% in 2015 
and is expected to improve in 2016.
We continuously monitor market conditions 
and review market changes. We also 
perform stress and scenario testing to 
test our financial position in adverse 
economic conditions, which includes 
a GEL/US$ exchange rate of 2.7/1. 
We also establish limits on possible 
losses for each type of operation and 
monitor compliance with such limits.
Given our strong liquidity position, 
we believe that we will be able 
to manage risk related to our US 
Dollar-denominated loan book. 
In addition, the NBG requires banks to 
hold additional capital to mitigate potential 
risk associated with foreign currency 
loans to customers that earn Lari. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   49

Our loan book is heavily US Dollar-
denominated, the quality of which 
may deteriorate as a result of slower 
economic growth and Lari devaluation.
As at 31 December 2015, approximately 
90% and 54% of our corporate loan 
book and retail loan book, respectively, 
was denominated in foreign currency 
(predominantly US Dollars), while US 
Dollar income covered approximately 
50% of the total loan book. 
The quality of our loan book is affected 
by changes in the creditworthiness of our 
customers, the ability of our customers 
to repay their loans on time, the statutory 
priority of claims against customers, our 
ability to enforce our security interests 
on customers’ collateral and the value of 
such collateral should such customers 
fail to repay their loans, as well as factors 
beyond our control such as economic 
instability. Depreciation of the Lari against 
the US Dollar may result in customers 
having difficulty repaying their loans.
Our impairment charges and, in turn, 
our cost of credit risk, may increase if a 
single large borrower defaults or a material 
concentration of smaller borrowers default.
In 2015, we saw an increase in foreign 
currency (predominantly US Dollar) NPLs in 
both our retail and corporate loan portfolios, 
principally as a result of slower economic 
growth opposed to the Lari devaluation. 
During the same period, we also saw a 
47.9% and 15.1% increase in foreign currency 
denominated deposits on a nominal basis 
and constant currency basis, respectively. 
Foreign currency NPLs as a % of gross 
loans in retail banking and corporate 
banking increased by 0.3% and 2.2%, 
respectively, as of 31 December 2015 
compared to 31 December 2014. 
In 2015, we saw significant retail loan 
growth of 35.3%, as a result of the success 
of our Express Banking strategy and the 
acquisition of PrivatBank. The acquisition of 
PrivatBank increased the number of retail 
banking NPLs, but we do not view this as 
significant when compared to loan book 
growth. Retail banking default rates remain 
relatively low as our retail banking clients 
prefer to save in US Dollars and also receive 
remittances in US Dollars, which constitute 
a principal source of income for our clients.
The increase in foreign currency NPLs in 
our corporate banking business resulted 
from slower economic growth and our 
strategic decision in the second half of 2015 
to decrease corporate banking lending in 
order to reduce our exposure and improve 
our ROAE, which we successfully did.
In 2015, we also significantly increased 
our NPL coverage ratio (83.4% as 
of 31 December 2015 compared to 
67.5% as of 31 December 2014).
The quality of our loan book and our future 
cost of risk is dependent on macroeconomic 
conditions and may deteriorate if conditions 
worsen. Devaluation of the Lari against the 
US Dollars may cause our customers to face 
difficulty in meeting their payment obligations.
We have credit policies and procedures 
in place which incorporate prudent 
lending criteria aligned with our risk 
appetite to effectively manage risk. 
These policies and procedures are 
reviewed frequently and amended as 
necessary to account for changes in the 
economic environment or other factors. 
Our Credit Committees set counterparty 
limits by the use of a credit risk 
classification and scoring system and 
approve individual transactions. The credit 
quality review process is continuous and 
provides early identification of possible 
changes in the creditworthiness of 
customers, potential losses and corrective 
actions needed to reduce risk.
We also stress test our loan book to 
estimate the size of the portfolio that 
may be impaired. In light of the Lari to 
US Dollar devaluation, we will continue to 
stress test using a GEL/US$ exchange 
rate of 2.7/1. We allocate 75% more capital 
to the foreign currency loans of clients 
who earn income in Lari and discount 
real estate collateral values by 20%.
Given our strong liquidity position, we 
believe that we will be able to manage risk 
related to our US Dollar-denominated loan 
book by reprofiling such loans. Potential 
reprofiling may include extending maturities 
and/or converting US Dollar-denominated 
loans into Euro-denominated loans.
We will also continue to expand our 
Lari and Euro-denominated loan book 
in order to offset risk associated with 
our US Dollar-denominated loan book. 
In particular, we actively work with 
IFIs to raise long-term Lari funding to 
increase our Lari-denominated loans. 50   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

The local economy and our business 
may be adversely affected 
by regional tensions.
Georgia shares borders with Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey and 
has had ongoing disputes in the 
breakaway regions of Abkhazia and 
the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, 
and with Russia. These disputes have 
led to sporadic violence and breaches 
of peacekeeping operations. Regional 
tensions could have an adverse effect on 
the local economy and our business. 
Despite tensions in the breakaway territories, 
Russia has opened its market to Georgian 
exports. Russia and Ukraine’s relationship 
has continued to deteriorate. As a result, 
there is significant uncertainty as to how 
and when the conflict between Russia 
and Ukraine will be resolved. During 2015, 
Georgia delivered real GDP growth of 2.8%, 
whilst inflation was maintained below the 
5% target range. Foreign Direct Investment 
continued to be strong, tourist numbers 
– a significant driver of US Dollar inflows 
for the country – continue to rise and, 
as a result, the Georgian Government’s 
fiscal position continues to be strong. 
One of the most significant changes in 
exports was a shift away from the Russian 
market after Russia’s 2006 embargo. 
In 2014, Georgia and the EU signed an 
association agreement introducing the deep 
and comprehensive free trade agreement 
(DCFTA), effective since 1 September 2014, 
which is intended to simplify Georgia’s 
access to the EU market. The Government 
continues to maintain strong relationships 
with international development partners. 
An ongoing IMF programme, introduced in 
July 2014, is intended to help implement the 
government’s economic reform programme 
and aims to reduce macroeconomic 
vulnerabilities, increase policy buffers 
and support growth, while making the 
economy more resilient to external shocks. 
Risks and uncertainties Trend and outlook Mitigation
We face regulatory risk.
Our businesses are highly regulated.
Our banking operations must comply 
with capital adequacy and other 
regulatory ratios set by our regulator, the 
NBG, including reserve requirements 
and mandatory financial ratios.
Our ability to comply with these 
regulations may be affected by a number 
of factors, including but not limited to 
increases in minimum capital adequacy 
ratios imposed by the NBG, our ability 
to raise capital, losses resulting from 
a deterioration in our asset quality, an 
increase in expenses and a decline in 
the values of our securities portfolio.
We also provide other regulated financial 
services and offer financing products, 
including brokerage and pension fund 
operations, insurance and services such as 
asset management, all of which are subject 
to governmental supervision and regulation. 
With respect to our healthcare operations, 
there have been a number of reforms in 
the Georgian healthcare services market, 
including but not limited to the introduction 
of a Universal Healthcare Programme 
(UHC). It is possible that the Government 
may amend the UHC to enhance coverage 
and it may introduce new licensing or 
accreditation requirements, which may 
adversely affect our healthcare services 
and health insurance businesses.
Our businesses are currently in compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.
Compliance with changes in capital adequacy 
requirements and other regulatory ratios may 
be affected by factors outside of our control, 
including but not limited to a weakening 
of the global and Georgian economies.
In October 2014, an anti-monopoly agency 
was established and anti-monopoly 
legislation was implemented in respect of 
certain non-banking operations. We expect 
that such legislation may have an impact on 
our non-banking operations acquisitions as 
we will be required to seek permission to 
proceed with certain future acquisitions.
As healthcare legislation is continuously 
evolving, we expect that additional regulations 
will be adopted. We, however, cannot predict 
what additional regulatory changes will be 
introduced in the future or their effect.
Continued investment in our people and 
processes is enabling us to meet our 
regulatory requirements and places us 
well to respond to changes in regulation.
In line with our integrated control 
framework, we carefully evaluate the impact 
of legislative and regulatory changes 
as part of our formal risk identification 
and assessment processes and, to the 
extent possible, proactively participate 
in the drafting of relevant legislation. 
As part of this process, we engage in 
constructive dialogue with regulatory 
bodies, where possible, and seek external 
advice on potential changes to legislation. 
We then develop appropriate policies, 
procedures and controls as required 
to fulfil our compliance obligations.
Our compliance framework, at all levels, 
is subject to regular review by internal 
audit and external assurance providers. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   51

We are subject to operational risk.
The proper functioning of our systems, risk 
management, internal controls, accounting, 
customer service and other information 
technology systems, are critical to our 
operations. We are highly dependent on 
our information technology systems. Cyber 
threats show an increasing trend. We are 
also subject to the risk of incurring losses 
or undue costs due to human error, criminal 
activities (including fraud and electronic 
crimes), unauthorised transactions, 
robbery and damage to assets. 
Over the past few years, as our operations 
have expanded, we have seen an increase 
in external fraud, although losses from such 
frauds have not increased significantly.
Cyber-security threats have also increased 
year on year, but have not affected our 
operations. It is expected that such threats 
will continue to increase, which will require 
us to closely monitor such threats. 
Money laundering has also increased 
globally and will be continuously monitored 
by our AML compliance department.
We have an integrated control framework 
encompassing operational risk 
management and control, information 
technology and information security, 
AML compliance and physical 
security, each of which is managed 
by a separate department.
We identify and assess operational risk 
categories within our risk management 
framework and internal control processes, 
identifying critical risk areas or groups of 
operations with an increased risk level. In 
response to these risks, we develop and 
implement policies and security procedures.
We carry out regular IT and IS checks 
internally and with the assistance 
of external consultants. We have 
sophisticated anti-virus and firewalls, 
regularly conduct penetration testing 
and have back-up disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans in place

Bank risk management
Overview 
The banking business is the principal driver of the Group’s revenue and operates in the complex 
financial services sector – its risk management and internal control framework is fundamental to that 
of the Group.
The BGEO Board, supported by our 
BGEO Audit and Risk Committees 
and senior management, is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls. 
Formal policies and procedures have 
been developed at the BGEO level, with 
the help of senior management, which 
explain the way in which risks need to 
be systematically identified, assessed, 
quantified, managed and monitored. 
Clearly delegated authority levels and 
reporting lines have been established 
and comprehensive reporting forms an 
integral part of the BGEO risk management 
framework and internal control processes. 
Each business participates in the risk 
management process by identifying the 
key risks applicable to its business. 
A detailed description of the BGEO 
risk management control framework 
can be found on pages 46 to 47 of 
the Strategic Report.
The work undertaken by the Bank’s 
risk management bodies feeds back 
directly to BGEO and certain banking 
related risks have been identified 
in the Group’s Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties, which can be found on 
pages 48 to 51 of the Strategic Report.
 
Given the significance of the banking 
business, the risk management and 
internal control framework in place at 
the Bank is described in this section.
 
The role of the Bank in the overall risk 
management structure
Management of risk is fundamental to 
the banking business and is an essential 
element of the Group’s operations. 
The main risks inherent in the Bank’s 
operations are credit risk, liquidity risk, 
market risk (including currency and 
foreign exchange rate risks), operational 
risk and legal risk. The following is a 
description of the Bank’s risk management 
policies and procedures in respect to 
those risks. Business risks such as 
changes in the environment, technology 
and industry are monitored through the 
Group’s strategic planning process.
The Bank’s risk management system 
is based on the principle of continually 
assessing risk throughout the life of any 
operation and includes such stages as:
• risk identification;
• quality and quantity assessment 
of a particular risk;
• determination of an acceptable risk 
level;
• placement of authority limits and 
creation of reserves;
• use of collateral;
• ongoing monitoring and control 
allowing efficient adjustments in 
case of any negative changes in the 
conditions on which the preliminary 
risk assessment was made; and
• analysis of efficiency of the 
risk management system. 
Bank risk management bodies
The principal risk management bodies 
of the Bank are the: Supervisory Board, 
Audit Committee, Management Board, 
Risk Committee, Internal Audit, Treasury 
Committee, Credit Committee, Asset 
and Liability Management Committee 
(the ALCO), Compliance and the 
Bank’s Legal Department. Each of the 
Supervisory Board, Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee perform similar 
roles as the BGEO Board, BGEO 
Audit Committee and BGEO Risk 
Committee, but on the Bank level.
 
Management Board. The Management 
Board has overall responsibility for 
the Bank’s asset, liability and risk 
management activities, policies and 
procedures. In order to effectively 
implement the risk management system, 
the Management Board delegates 
individual risk management functions 
to each of the various decision-making 
and execution bodies within the Bank.
Internal Audit Department. The 
Internal Audit Department is responsible 
for the annual audit of the Bank’s risk 
management, internal control and 
corporate governance processes, 
with the aim of reducing the levels of 
operational and other risks, auditing the 
Bank’s internal control systems, and 
detecting any infringements or errors on 
the part of the Bank’s departments and 
divisions. It examines both the adequacy 
of and the Bank’s compliance with those 
procedures. The Bank’s Internal Audit 
Department discusses the results of all 
assessments with management, and 
reports its findings and recommendations 
to the Bank’s Audit Committee.
The Bank’s Internal Audit Department is 
independent of the Bank’s Management 
Board. The Head of the Bank’s Internal 
Audit Department is appointed by the 
Bank’s Supervisory Board and reports 
directly to the Bank’s Audit Committee. 
The Bank’s Internal Audit Department 
has 13 employees. The Bank’s Internal 
Audit Department audits all of the Bank’s 
subsidiaries, apart from BNB, which 
has its own internal audit department.
As part of its auditing procedures, 
the Bank’s Internal Audit Department 
is responsible for the following:
• identifying and assessing potential 
risks regarding the Bank’s operations;
• reviewing the adequacy of the 
existing controls established in 
order to ensure compliance with the 
Bank’s policies, plans, procedures 
and business objectives, as well as 
to current legislation and regulation 
and professional norms and ethics;
• developing internal auditing 
standards and methodologies;
• carrying out planned and random 
inspections of the Bank’s 
branches and subdivisions and 
auditing its subsidiaries;

Treasury. Treasury is responsible for 
managing the Bank’s assets and liabilities 
and its overall financial structure and is 
also primarily responsible for managing 
funding and liquidity risks of the Bank.
Credit Committee. The Bank has three 
credit committees (together, the Credit 
Committees), each one supervising and 
managing the Bank’s credit risks in respect 
of retail and investment management 
loans, corporate loans and counterparty 
loans. These three committees are: 
the Retail Banking Committee, the 
Corporate Banking Credit Committee 
and the Financial and Governmental 
Counterparty Risk Management 
Committee (FGCRMC), established in 
April 2014. FGCRMC manages, monitors 
and controls counterparty risk of financial 
and governmental counterparties of 
Bank of Georgia. Each Credit Committee 
approves individual loan transactions. 
Each Credit Committee is comprised of 
tiers of subcommittees. The FGCRMC 
comprises two tiers of subcommittees. 
The Committee consists of five members 
– Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, Head of Quantitative Risk 
Management, Head of Treasury and 
Head of Trade Finance, and a majority 
of votes is enough for approval. If the 
potential exposure exceeds US$ 10.0 
million, then the decision is deferred 
to the Asset and Liability Management  
Committee (ALCO). The Credit Committee 
for retail loans comprises four tiers of 
subcommittees. (For risk management 
purposes, investment management loans 
are classified as retail loans.) The Credit 
Committee for corporate loans comprises 
three tiers of subcommittees. Participation 
of the CEO is required for exposures 
exceeding US$ 8.0 million. All exposures 
to single group borrowers over US$ 25.0 
million require approval by the Supervisory 
Board. Lower tier subcommittees meet 
on a daily basis, whereas higher tier ones 
typically meet three to four times a week. 
Each of the subcommittees of the Credit 
Committees makes its decisions by a 
majority vote of its respective members.
Furthermore, the Credit Committee for 
Micro and SME loans comprises three 
tiers of subcommittees, and falls under 
the Credit Committee for retail loans. The 
first tier Micro and SME Credit Committee 
is chaired by the Head of the Group of 
the Micro and SME Lending Department 
and approves loans resulting in the Bank’s 
overall exposure to a borrower of up to 
US$ 15,000. A loan officer, who submits 
a loan application/project to the Credit 
Committee, does not have right to vote 
for the approval of the loan. The second 
tier Micro and SME Credit Committee is 
chaired by the Micro and SME Department 
representative (Head of the Micro and SME 
Department, Deputy Head of department, 
coordinator) and approves loans resulting 
in the Bank’s overall exposure to a 
borrower up to US$ 100,000. The third 
tier Micro and SME Credit Committee 
approves loans resulting in the Bank’s 
overall exposure to a borrower in the range 
of US$ 100,000 to US$ 1,200,000. The 
Committee is chaired by the Risk Manager, 
with mandatory participation from either 
the Head of the Credit Risk Analysis Unit or 
the Head of the Credit Risk Management 
Department (or his or her deputy) for 
exposures exceeding US$ 500,000.

Asset and Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO). The ALCO is the core 
risk management body that establishes 
policies and guidelines with respect 
to capital adequacy, market risks and 
respective limits, funding liquidity risk 
and respective limits, interest rate and 
prepayment risks and respective limits, 
money market general terms and credit 
exposure limits, designs and implements 
respective risk management and stress 
testing models in practice and regularly 
monitors compliance with the pre-set risk 
limits, and approves treasury deals with 
non-standard terms. Specifically, ALCO:
• sets money-market credit 
exposure/lending limits; 
• sets open currency position 
limits with respect to overnight 
and intraday positions; 
• establishes stop-loss limits for foreign 
currency operations and securities;
• monitors compliance with the 
established risk management models 
for foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and funding liquidity risk;
• sets ranges of interest rates for 
different maturities at which the 
Bank may place its liquid assets 
and attracts funding; and
• reviews different stress tests and 
capital adequacy models prepared 
by the Finance Department. 
The ALCO is chaired by the CEO and 
sits at any time deemed necessary, with 
decisions made by a majority vote of its 
members. ALCO members include the 
CEO, Deputy CEO Finance, Deputy CEO, 
Chief Risk Officer, Deputy CEO Corporate 
and Investment Banking, Deputy CEO, 
Retail Banking, the Head of the Finance 
Department, the Head of the Treasury 
Department and the Head of the Funding 
Department. The ALCO reviews financial 
reports and indices including the Bank’s 
limits/ratios, balance sheet, statement 
of operations, maturity gap, interest rate 
gap, currency gap, foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and funding liquidity risk 
reports, total cash flow analyses, customer 
cash flow analysis, and concentration 
risk analysis, for the past periods as 
well as future projections and forecasts, 
other financial analysis and further 
growth projections on a monthly basis.
Regulatory capital requirements in 
Georgia are set by NBG and are applied 
to the Bank on a stand-alone basis. NBG 
requires the Bank to maintain a minimum 
Total Capital Adequacy ratio of 10.5% 
of risk-weighted assets and a minimum 
Tier I Capital Adequacy ratio of 8.5% of 
risk-weighted assets, both computed 
based on the Bank’s stand-alone special 
purpose financial statements prepared 
in accordance with NBG regulations and 
pronouncements. On 30 June 2014, the 
NBG introduced new regulation aimed 
at replacing its old regulation, which was 
developed independently from international 
committees and organisations and was 
not based on the Basel Accord. The new 
capital regulation is based on the Basel 
Accord 2/3, with material regulatory 
discretions applied by the NBG. Pillar 
1 requirements of the new regulation 
came into force on 30 June 2014. The 
period starting 30 June 2014 through 
31 December 2017 was declared as a 
transition period. During the transition 
period the Bank will be required to comply 
with both old and new capital regulations 
of the NBG. Pillar II of the Basel Accord 
2/3, which entails implementation of 
the Internal Capital Adequacy Process 
(ICAAP), is planned to be introduced in 
2016. The old regulation will be completely 
phased out by 1 January 2018.
ALCO is the key governing body for the 
capital adequacy management as well 
as for the respective risks identification 
and management. ALCO establishes 
limits and reviews actual performance 
over those limits for both NBG as well 
as Basel I capital adequacy regulations. 
The Finance Department is in charge of 
regular monthly monitoring and reporting 
over NBG and Basel I capital adequacy 
compliance with original pronouncements 
as well as with ALCO policies. Capital 
adequacy management is an integral part 
of the Bank’s actual monthly reporting 
as well as the Bank’s annual and semi-
annual budget approval and budget review 
processes. The Finance Department 
prepares NBG and Basel I and Basel 
II – III capital adequacy actual reports 
as well as their forecasts and budgets, 
as well as different stress scenarios for 
both regulations, while ALCO and the 
Management Board regularly review them, 
identify risks, issue recommendations 
or propose amendment measures.

Legal Department. The Legal 
Department’s principal purposes are to 
ensure that the Bank’s activities conform 
to applicable legislation and to minimise 
losses from the materialisation of legal 
risks. The Legal Department is responsible 
for the application and development of 
mechanisms for identifying legal risks in 
the Bank’s activities in a timely manner, 
the investigation of the Bank’s activities 
in order to identify any legal risks, the 
planning and implementation of all 
necessary actions for the elimination 
of identified legal risks, participation 
in legal proceedings on behalf of 
the Bank where necessary and the 
investigation of possibilities for increasing 
the effectiveness of the Bank’s legal 
documentation and its implementation 
in the Bank’s daily activities. The Legal 
Department is also responsible for 
providing legal support to structural units 
of the Bank and/or its subsidiaries.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
Compliance. The Bank’s AML 
Compliance Department is responsible 
for the implementation of the Bank’s AML 
programme (including the development of 
AML policies and procedures, transaction 
monitoring and reporting and employee 
training) throughout the Bank and its 
subsidiaries. The AML programme 
is based on recommendations and 
requirements of international organisations 
including FATF and OFAC, as well as local 
regulations. The Bank’s Internal Audit 
Department makes annual assessments 
of the Bank’s AML systems and provides 
independent assurance of internal controls. 
The Bank has adopted risk-based 
approach in its policies and procedures 
aimed at preventing money laundering 
and terrorist financing, including a general 
anti-money laundering policy and rules 
on counteracting money laundering and 
financing of individuals and legal entities 
engaged in terrorist activities, as well as 
procedures for reporting to the Financial 
Monitoring Service of Georgia (FMS), 
a legal entity of public law. The Bank’s 
risk-based approach means that it applies 
enhanced due diligence procedures if it 
determines that there is a significant risk 
that particular customers are engaged in 
money laundering or financing terrorism. 
The Bank is obliged to notify the FMS 
of all transactions that are subject 
to monitoring. These reports are 
currently filed in electronic form in an 
offline mode by the AML Compliance 
Department, the reporting process is 
fully automated, and is supported by 
the special software application.
Bodies implementing the risk 
management system
The Bank’s risk management system is 
implemented by the Finance Department, 
Quantitative Risk Management and Risk 
Analytics Department, Treasury, Credit 
Risk Management, Operational Risk 
Management and Control, Legal, AML 
Compliance and Security departments 
and other departments. The Reporting 
and Analysis Unit reports to the Head of 
the Finance Department. The Finance 
Department and the Treasury Department, 
as well as AML Compliance Department 
report to the Deputy CEO (Finance). The 
Credit Risk Management (CB Portfolio 
Analysis), Quantitative Risk Management 
and Risk Analytics Department and 
Operational Risk Management and Control 
departments also Legal Department report 
to the Deputy CEO (Chief Risk Officer) 
and the Credit Risk Management (Retail 
Banking Portfolio Analysis) Department 
reports to the Deputy CEO (Retail Banking). 
The Quantitative Risk Management and 
Risk Analytics Department, in coordination 
with the Treasury, implements the 
Bank’s market risk policies by ensuring 
compliance with established open 
currency position limits, counterparty 
limits, VAR limits on possible losses and 
the interest rate policy set by the ALCO.
The Treasury Department manages 
foreign currency exchange, money 
market, securities portfolio and derivatives 
operations and monitors compliance 
with the limits set by the ALCO for these 
operations. The Treasury Department 
is also responsible for management of 
short-term liquidity and treasury cash flow 
and monitors the volumes of cash in the 
Bank’s ATMs and at its service centres.
The Credit Risk Management department 
manages credit risks with respect to 
particular borrowers and assesses overall 
loan portfolio risks. It is responsible for 
ensuring compliance with the Bank’s 
Credit Policies, management of the 
quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio 
and filing and loan administration.
The Operational Risk Management 
and Control Department identifies and 
assesses operational risk categories within 
the Bank’s processes and operations. It 
also detects critical risk areas or groups of 
operations with an increased risk level and 
develops internal control procedures to 
address these risks, through (among other 
things) business-process optimisation 
schemes, including document circulation, 
information streams, distribution of 
functions, permissions and responsibility.
The Legal Department monitors 
all changes in relevant laws and 
regulations, and ensures that those 
changes are properly reflected in 
the Bank’s procedures, instructions, 
manuals, templates and other relevant 
documentation. It also disseminates 
information on legislative changes to 
all relevant departments within the 
Bank. The Legal Department also 
participates in drafting laws and regulatory 
documents upon request of legislators 
and regulators, certain associations 
and other professional bodies. 
The Tax Compliance Unit of the Finance 
Department focuses on the Bank’s 
relationship with the tax authorities and 
provides practical advice and monitors 
tax compliance across the Group.
Each of the foregoing departments is 
provided with policies and/or manuals that 
are approved by the Bank Management 
Board and/or the Bank Supervisory Board 
(as required). The manuals and policies 
include comprehensive guidance for each 
stage of a transaction, including, but not 
limited to, manuals outlining asset and 
liability management policies, foreign 
exchange operations procedures, fixed 
income investment guidelines, Retail 
Banking operations procedures, the 
deposit policy and the Credit Policies.
Risk measurement and reporting
The Bank measures risk using a method 
which reflects both the expected loss 
likely to arise in normal circumstances 
and unexpected losses, which are an 
estimate of the ultimate actual loss based 
on different forecasting models. These 
models use probabilities derived from 
historical experience, adjusted from time to 
time to reflect the economic environment. 
The Bank also runs worst case scenarios 
that could arise in the event that extreme 
events, however unlikely, do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily 
performed based on limits established 
by the Bank. These limits reflect the 
business strategy and market environment 
of the Bank as well as the level of risk 
that it is willing to accept, with additional 
emphasis on selected industries. The 
Bank also conducts ongoing monitoring 
and control, allowing efficient adjustments 
in case of any unexpected changes in 
the conditions on which the preliminary 
risk assessment was made. In addition, 
the Bank monitors and measures 
the overall risk-bearing capacity in 
relation to the aggregate risk exposure 
across all risk types and activities.  56   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Strategy
The Group maintains a management 
reporting system which requires the 
Credit Risk Management, Finance and 
Funding Departments to prepare certain 
reports on a daily and monthly basis. On 
a daily basis, a statement of operations, 
balance sheet and treasury report (which 
includes the Bank’s open foreign exchange 
positions, cash flows, limits and balances 
on NOSTRO and LORO correspondent 
accounts) and confirmation that there 
has been compliance with mandatory 
financial ratios must be provided by each 
department. On a monthly basis, a report 
on the structural liquidity gap, a report 
on interest rate risk, monthly financial 
statements, and a Bank Supervisory 
Board quarterly report containing 
analysis of the Bank’s performance 
against its budget are provided.
Information compiled from all the 
businesses is examined and processed 
in order to analyse, control and identify 
early risks. This information is presented 
and explained to the Management 
Board, and the head of each business 
division. The report includes aggregate 
credit exposure, liquidity ratios and risk 
profile changes. Senior management 
assesses the appropriateness of the 
allowance for credit losses on a monthly 
basis. The Bank Management Board 
and Supervisory Board receive a 
comprehensive risk report once a quarter 
which is designed to provide all the 
necessary information to assess and draw 
conclusions on the Bank’s risk exposure.
Specifically tailored risk reports are 
prepared and distributed for all levels 
throughout the Bank in order to ensure 
that all business divisions have access 
to extensive, relevant and up-to-date 
information. A daily briefing is given 
to the Bank Management Board and 
all other relevant employees of the 
Bank on the utilisation of market limits, 
proprietary investments and liquidity, 
plus any other risk developments.
Risk mitigation and excessive risk 
concentration
As part of its overall risk management, 
the Bank uses derivatives and other 
instruments to manage exposures resulting 
from changes in interest rates, foreign 
currencies, credit risks, and exposures 
arising from forward transactions. While 
these derivatives are intended for hedging, 
they do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
The Bank actively uses collateral to reduce 
its credit risks.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations 
of risks, the Bank focuses on maintaining 
a diversified portfolio. Concentrations 
arise when a number of counterparties, 
or related shareholders, are engaged in 
similar business activities, or activities 
in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would 
cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by 
changes in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations also involve 
combined, aggregate exposures of large 
and significant credits compared to total 
outstanding balance of the respective 
financial instrument. Concentrations 
indicate the relative sensitivity of the Bank’s 
performance to developments affecting a 
particular industry or geographical location. 
Identified concentrations of credit risks 
are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit risk
Definition: Credit risk is the risk that a 
borrower or counterparty will be unable 
to pay amounts in full or in part when 
due. Credit risk arises mainly in the 
context of the Bank’s lending activities. 
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s credit policy are outlined in the 
Credit Policies. The Credit Policies also 
outline credit risk control and monitoring 
procedures and the Bank’s credit risk 
management systems. The Credit 
Policies are reviewed annually or more 
frequently if necessary. As a result of 
these reviews, new loan restructuring 
tools were introduced. The Bank also uses 
the NBG’s provisioning methodology in 
order to comply with NBG requirements.
The Bank manages its credit risk by 
placing limits on the amount of risk 
accepted with respect to individual 
corporate borrowers or groups of 
related borrowers, liability of insurance 
companies, types of banking operations 
and by complying with the exposure 
limits established by the NBG. The 
Bank monitors the market value of 
collateral, requests additional collateral 
in accordance with the underlying 
agreement, and monitors the market value 
of collateral obtained during its review of 
the adequacy of the allowance for the loan 
impairment. The Bank also mitigates its 
credit risk by obtaining collateral and using 
other security arrangements. The exposure 
to financial institutions is managed by 
limits covering on and off-balance sheet 
exposures and by settlement limits with 
respect to trading transactions such 
as foreign exchange contracts, etc.
The Credit Committees approve 
individual transactions and the Credit Risk 
Management Department establish their 
credit risk categories and provisioning 
rates, which are set as per provisioning 
methodology. The Deputy CEO (Chief Risk 
Officer) and the Credit Risk Management 
Department reviews the credit quality of 
the portfolio and sets provisioning rates, 
in consultation with the Bank’s CEO and 
Deputy CEO (Finance), on a monthly basis.
The Bank’s credit quality review process 
provides early identification of possible 
changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular collateral 
revaluations. Counterparty limits are 
established by the use of a credit risk 
classification system, which assigns each 
counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings 
are subject to regular revision. The credit 
quality review process allows the Bank 
to assess the potential loss as a result 
of the risks to which it is exposed and 
take corrective action. The Bank makes 
available to its customers guarantees/
letters of credit which may require that the 
Bank make payments on their behalf. Such 
payments are collected from customers 
based on the terms of the guarantee/letter 
of credit. They expose the Bank to similar 
risks to loans and these are mitigated by 
the same control processes and policies. 
Loan approval procedures
The procedures for approving loans, 
monitoring loan quality and for extending, 
refinancing and/or restructuring existing 
loans are set out in the Bank’s Credit 
Policies that are approved by the 
Supervisory Board of the Bank and/or 
the Management Board of the Bank. The 
Credit Committees approve individual 
transactions. The Bank evaluates 
Corporate Banking clients on the basis 
of their financial condition, credit history, 
business operations, market position, 
management, level of shareholder support, 
proposed business and financing plan 
and on the quality of the collateral offered. 
The appropriate level of the relevant 
Credit Committee is responsible for 
making the decision for loan approval 
based on credit memorandum, and 
where appropriate, Credit Risk Manager’s 
report. The loan approval procedures 
for Retail Banking loans depend on 
the type of retail lending product. 
Applications for consumer loans, including 
credit cards and auto loans, are treated 
under the “scoring” approval procedure. 
While certain loans of up to GEL 6,000 
are approved by the scoring system, 
the appropriate Credit Committee 
will determine the amount, terms and

conditions of other loans. Applications 
for mortgage loans by Retail Banking 
clients are completed by the mortgage 
loan officer and submitted to the Credit 
Risk Manager, who evaluates the credit 
risks and determines the amount, terms 
and conditions of the loan, which must 
be approved at the appropriate Credit 
Committee level. In the case of micro 
financing loans, officers evaluate loan 
applications, prepare a project analysis 
and submit proposals to the appropriate 
Credit Committee which makes the final 
decision. Credit Committee members have 
equal voting authority and decisions are 
approved by a simple majority of votes. 
Collateral
The Bank typically requires credit support 
or collateral as security for the loans and 
credit facilities that it grants. The main 
forms of credit support are guarantees and 
rights to claim amounts on the borrower’s 
current account with the Bank or other 
assets. The main forms of collateral for 
corporate lending are charges over real 
estate properties, equipment, inventory 
and trade receivables and the main 
form of collateral for retail lending is a 
mortgage over residential property. In the 
case of corporate loans, the Bank usually 
requires a personal guarantee (surety) 
from the borrower’s shareholders. Under 
the Bank’s internal guidelines, collateral 
should be provided (where it is required) 
to cover outstanding liabilities during the 
entire duration of a transaction. As of 
31 December 2015, 84.4% of the Group’s 
loans to clients were collateralised. An 
evaluation report of the proposed collateral 
is prepared by the Asset Appraisal and 
Disposal Department and submitted 
to the appropriate Credit Committee, 
together with the loan application and 
Credit Risk Manager’s report. When 
evaluating collateral, the Bank discounts 
the market value of the assets to reflect 
the liquidation value of the collateral.
Measurement
Exposure and limits are subject to annual 
or more frequent review. The Bank’s 
compliance with credit risk exposure 
limits is monitored by the Credit Risk 
Management Department on a continuous 
basis. The Bank establishes provisions 
for impairment losses of financial assets 
on collective basis and on individual basis 
when there is objective evidence that a 
financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. The Bank creates provisions 
by reference to the particular borrower’s 
financial condition and the number of 
days the relevant loan is overdue. If in 
a subsequent period the amount of 
the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed by an adjusted 
provision account. The determination 
of provisions for impairment losses is 
based on an analysis of the assets at 
risk and reflects the amount which, in the 
judgement of the Bank’s management, is 
adequate to provide for losses incurred. 
Provisions are made against gross loan 
amounts and accrued interest. Under 
the Bank’s internal loan loss allowance 
methodology, which is based upon IFRS 
requirements, the Bank categorises its loan 
portfolio into significant and non-significant 
loans. Significant loans are defined as 
loans in the amount of US$ 150,000 or 
more and non-significant loans are defined 
as loans less than US$ 150,000. The 
Credit Risk Management Department 
makes an individual assessment of all 
defaulted significant loans. Non-defaulted 
significant loans are given a collective 
assessment rate. All loans are divided into 
different groups (for example mortgage, 
consumer, microfinancing loans).
Since 2004, the Bank, jointly with certain 
other Georgian banks and with the Credit 
Information Group, a provider of credit 
information solutions, established JSC 
Credit Info Georgia (CIG) that serves a 
centralised credit bureau in Georgia. Since 
2009, all the participating banks, insurance 
companies and microfinance organisations 
share and contribute positive and negative 
customer credit information with CIG.
As of 1 January 2014, the Bank 
implemented a new loan loss provisioning 
methodology. The new provisioning 
methodology is based on statistical 
assessment of Probability of Default 
(PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) for 
each of the loan type. The management 
believes that the new methodology is a 
refinement of the existing methodology 
and will allow better allocation of Cost 
of Risk between different products. The 
new methodology was developed in 
consultation with Deloitte. Deloitte was 
a provider of IT solution – fineVare.
Non-corporate loans which are overdue 
for more than 150 days are written off 
automatically, except for mortgage 
loans which, since June 2009, are 
written-off once overdue for more than 
365 days. Significant loans may be 
written-off following an assessment 
by the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer 
and the Credit Risk Management 
Department, in consultation with the 
Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO, Finance.
Liquidity risk
Definition: Liquidity risk is the risk that the 
Bank will be unable to meet its payment 
obligations when they fall due under 
normal and stress circumstances. 
Monitoring: Liquidity risk is managed 
through the ALCO-approved liquidity 
framework. Treasury manages liquidity on 
a daily basis. In order to manage liquidity 
risk, it performs daily monitoring of future 
expected cash flows on customers’ and 
banking operations, which is a part of the 
assets/liabilities management process. 
The Finance Department prepares and 
submits monthly reports to the ALCO. 
The ALCO monitors the proportion of 
maturing funds available to meet deposit 
withdrawals and the amounts of inter-
bank and other borrowing facilities that 
should be in place to cover withdrawals 
at unexpected levels of demand.
The liquidity risk management framework 
models the ability of the Bank to meet its 
payment obligations under both normal 
conditions and during a crisis situation. 
The Bank has developed a model based 
on the Basel III liquidity guidelines. This 
approach is designed to ensure that 
the funding framework is sufficiently 
flexible to ensure liquidity under a wide 
range of market conditions. The liquidity 
management framework is reviewed from 
time to time to ensure it is appropriate to 
the Bank’s current and planned activities. 
Such review encompasses the funding 
scenarios modelled, the modelling 
approach, wholesale funding capacity, 
limit determination and minimum holdings 
of liquid assets. The liquidity framework 
is reviewed by the ALCO prior to approval 
by the Bank Management Board.
The Finance Department also 
undertakes an annual funding review 
that outlines the current funding 
strategy for the coming year. 
This review encompasses trends in 
global debt markets, funding alternatives, 
peer analysis, estimation of the Bank’s 
upcoming funding requirements, estimated 
market funding capacity and a funding 
risk analysis. The annual funding plan 
is reviewed by the Bank Management 
Board and approved by the Bank 
Supervisory Board as part of the annual 
budget. The Funding and Treasury 
Departments also review, from time to 
time, different funding options and assess 
the refinancing risks of such options. 58   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

This review encompasses trends in 
global debt markets, funding alternatives, 
peer analysis, estimation of the Bank’s 
upcoming funding requirements, estimated 
market funding capacity and a funding 
risk analysis. The annual funding plan 
is reviewed by the Bank Management 
Board and approved by the Bank 
Supervisory Board as part of the annual 
budget. The Funding and Treasury 
Departments also review, from time to 
time, different funding options and assess 
the refinancing risks of such options.
Mitigation: The Bank’s capability to 
discharge its liabilities is dependent on 
its ability to realise an equivalent amount 
of assets within the same period of time. 
The Bank maintains a portfolio of highly 
marketable and diverse assets that it 
believes can be easily liquidated in the 
event of an unforeseen interruption of 
cash flow. It also has committed lines 
of credit that it can access to meet its 
liquidity needs. Such lines of credit are 
available through the NBG’s refinancing 
facility. In addition, the Bank maintains 
a cash deposit (obligatory reserve) with 
the NBG, the amount of which depends 
on the level of customer funds attracted. 
As of 31 December 2015, in line with the 
NBG’s requirements, 15% of customer 
deposits in foreign currencies were set 
aside as minimum reserves. In addition, 
the Bank maintains a minimum average 
balance of 10% of its customers’ deposits 
in Georgian Lari at its correspondent 
account at the NBG. For wholesale 
funding, the NBG requires the Bank to set 
aside 15% of its unsubordinated foreign 
currency wholesale funding for borrowings 
with a remaining maturity of less than one 
year, 5% for borrowings with a remaining 
maturity of one to two years and 10% 
of its unsubordinated Georgian Lari 
wholesale funding for borrowings with a 
remaining maturity of less than one year.
Funding: In the Georgian marketplace, 
the majority of working capital loans 
are short term and granted with the 
expectation of renewal at maturity. As 
such, the ultimate maturity of assets 
may be different from the analysis 
presented elsewhere. In addition, the 
maturity gap analysis does not reflect the 
historical stability of current accounts. 
The Bank’s principal sources of liquidity 
are as follows:
• deposits; 
• borrowings from international 
credit institutions; 
• inter-bank deposit agreement;
• debt issuances;
• proceeds from sale of securities;
• principal repayments on loans;
• interest income; and
• fee and commission income.
As of 31 December 2015, the Group’s total 
consolidated amounts due to customers 
was GEL 4,751.4 million (US$ 1,984.0 
million) (as compared to GEL 3,338.7 
million and GEL 3,117.7 million as of 
31 December 2014 and 2013, respectively) 
and represented 59.0% (as compared 
to 56.2% and 59.0% as of 31 December 
2014 and 2013, respectively) of the 
Group’s total liabilities. In accordance with 
Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged 
to repay such deposits upon demand of a 
depositor. In the case of early withdrawal, 
the interest on the deposit is foregone or 
reduced. As of 31 December 2015, total 
amounts due to credit institutions and 
debt securities issued were GEL 2,828.9 
million (US$ 1,181.2 million) (as compared 
to GEL 2,265.9 million and GEL 1,886.1 
million as of 31 December 2014 and 2013, 
respectively) and represented 35.1% (as 
compared to 38.1% and 35.7% as of 
31 December 2014 and 2013, respectively) 
of the Group’s total liabilities. Amounts due 
to credit institutions and debt securities are 
taken from a wide range of counterparties. 
The Bank Management Board believes 
that both the Group’s and the Bank’s 
liquidity is sufficient to meet each of their 
present requirements. For information on 
the Group’s liquid assets, liabilities and 
maturity profile of the Group’s financial 
liabilities as well as further information on 
the liquidity risk of the Group see Note 30 
of the Notes to the consolidated financial 
statements of this Annual Report.
Market risk
Definition: The Bank is exposed to market 
risk (including currency exchange rate 
risk and interest rate risk), which is the 
risk that the fair value or future cash flows 
of financial instruments will fluctuate due 
to changes in market variables. Market 
risk exposure arises from mismatches 
of maturity and currencies between 
the assets and liabilities, all of which 
are exposed to market fluctuations. 
Mitigation: The general principles of the 
Bank’s market risk management policy are 
set by the ALCO. The Bank aims to limit 
and reduce the amount of possible losses 
on open market positions which may 
be incurred by the Bank due to negative 
changes in currency exchange rates 
and interest rates. The Bank classifies 
exposures to market risk into either 
trading or non-trading positions. Trading 
and non-trading positions are managed 
and monitored using different sensitivity 
analyses. In order to address these 
risks, the ALCO specifically establishes 
VAR limits on possible losses for each 
type of operation (currently the VAR limit 
is set for foreign currency exchange 
operations only) and the Quantitative 
Risk Management and Risk Analytics 
monitors compliance with such limits.
Currency exchange rate risk: Currency 
exchange rate risk is the risk that the 
value of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
due to changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to 
the effects of fluctuation in the prevailing 
foreign currency exchange rates on its 
financial position. The Bank’s currency 
risk is calculated as an aggregate of open 
positions and is controlled by setting a VAR 
calculation (established by the ALCO) with 
respect to the Bank’s currency basket. 
The Bank uses the historical simulation 
method based on 400-business-day 
statistical data. Its open currency positions 
are managed by the Treasury Department 
on a day-to-day basis and are monitored 
by the Quantitative Risk Management and 
Risk Analytics Department. The ALCO 
sets open currency position limits with 
respect to both overnight and intra-day

positions and stop-loss limits. Currently, 
the Bank’s proprietary trading position 
is limited by the ALCO to a maximum of 
15.0% of the Bank’s NBG total regulatory 
capital. The open currency position is 
also limited by ALCO to a VAR of seven 
basis points of its NBG regulatory capital 
for a one-day trading period with a 
95.0% “tolerance threshold”. The ALCO 
limits are more conservative than NBG’s 
requirements, which allow banks to 
keep open positions of up to 20.0% of 
regulatory capital. The Bank additionally 
limits open foreign currency positions 
other than US Dollar and Lari to 1% of the 
regulatory capital. The Bank also applies 
sensitivity stress tests to its open currency 
positions to estimate potential negative 
impact on its net assets and earnings.
Interest rate risk: The Bank has exposure 
to interest rate risk as a result of lending at 
fixed and floating interest rates in amounts 
and for periods which differ from those 
of term borrowings at fixed and floating 
interest rates. Interest margins on assets 
and liabilities having different maturities 
may increase or decrease as a result 
of changes in market interest rates.
Similarly to other Georgian banks, 
the majority of the Bank’s assets and 
deposits have fixed interest rates. In 
order to minimise interest rate risk, 
the Bank monitors its interest rate 
(repricing) gap and maintains an interest 
rate margin (net interest income before 
impairment of interest-earning assets 
divided by average interest-earning 
assets) sufficient to cover operational 
expenses and risk premium. Within 
limits approved by the Bank Supervisory 
Board, the ALCO approves ranges of 
interest rates for different maturities at 
which the Bank may place assets and 
attract liabilities. Compliance with the 
Bank’s interest rate policy is monitored 
by the Quantitative Risk Management 
and Risk Analytics Department.
As of 31 December 2015, the Group’s 
floating rate borrowings accounted for 
10.5% of the Group’s total liabilities. 
The Bank is also subject to prepayment 
risk, which is the risk that the Bank 
will incur a financial loss because its 
customers and counterparties repay or 
request repayment earlier than expected, 
such as fixed rate mortgages when 
interest rates fall. The Group reviews 
the prior history of early repayments by 
calculating the weighted average effective 
rate of early repayments across each 
credit product, individually, applying 
these historical rates to the outstanding 
carrying amount of each loan product as 
of the reporting date and then multiplying 
the product by the weighted average 
effective annual interest rates for each 
product. This allows the Bank to calculate 
the expected amount of unforeseen 
losses in the case of early repayments.
For further information on the Group’s 
market risk see Note 30 of the Notes 
to consolidated financial statements 
of this Annual Report.
Operational risk
Definition: Operational risk is the risk of 
loss arising from systems failure, human 
error, fraud or external events. When 
controls fail to perform, operational 
risks can cause damage to reputation, 
have legal or regulatory implications, or 
lead to financial loss. The Bank cannot 
expect to eliminate all operational risks, 
but through a control framework and by 
monitoring and responding to potential 
risks, the Bank aims to manage the risks. 
Controls include effective segregation 
of duties, access, authorisation and 
reconciliation procedures, staff education 
and training and assessment processes, 
including the use of internal audit.
Mitigation: The Bank manages its 
operational risks by establishing, 
monitoring and continuously improving 
its policies and procedures relating 
to the various aspects of the Bank’s 
cash, payments, accounting, trading 
and core processing operations 
and data back-up and disaster 
recovery arrangements.
The Bank has an integrated control 
framework encompassing operational 
risk management and control, 
AML compliance, corporate and 
information security and physical 
security, each of which is managed 
by a separate department.
The Operational Risk Management 
and Control Department is responsible 
for identification and assessment of 
operational risk categories within the 
Bank’s processes and operations, 
detecting critical risk areas or groups 
of operations with an increased risk 
level, developing response actions and 
the imposition of restrictions in critical 
risk zones to mitigate identified risk and 
developing business-process optimisation 
schemes, including document circulation, 
information streams, distribution of 
functions, permissions and responsibilities. 
The Operational Risk Management and 
Control Department is also responsible 
for developing and updating policies 
and procedures and ensuring that these 
policies and procedures meet legal and 
regulatory requirements and help to 
ensure that material operating risks are 
within acceptable levels. It also monitors 
and periodically reviews the Bank’s 
internal control systems to detect errors or 
infringements by the Bank’s departments 
and divisions. The Head of the Operational 
Risk Management Department, who 
reports to the Deputy CEO (Chief Risk 
Officer), is responsible for the oversight 
of the Bank’s operational risks. 60   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Resources and responsibilities
Sustainability lies at the heart of our business 
As a leading financial institution in Georgia, we understand our responsibility not only to shareholders 
but to society at large. 
The concept of sustainability lies at 
the heart of our business and reflects 
our contribution to sustainable 
development – development that 
meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs.
We consider sustainability to be integral 
to the growth of our business. Our 
sustainability agenda allows us to be 
profitable as well as environmentally and 
socially responsible at the same time. By 
implementing a sustainability approach 
in our activities, we foster long-term 
relationships with our main stakeholders 
by providing high return on investment for 
shareholders, satisfying the financial needs 
of customers, developing employees and 
contributing to the economic and social 
welfare of local communities, while taking 
into account our environmental footprint. 
In order to effectively manage the Group’s 
direct and indirect impact on society 
and the environment, the Board of 
Directors adopted an Environmental and 
Social Policy in 2012. This policy defines 
the Group’s strategy to develop solid 
management controls which will conserve 
natural resources, minimise health and 
safety risks, and provide employees 
with equal development opportunities, 
fair compensation and benefits. We are 
pioneering sustainability practices in our 
operations and are constantly seeking 
new ways to improve our performance.
Social matters
The Group considers the interests 
of its main stakeholders, which 
include customers, shareholders, 
employees, lenders, and society, 
in the development of strategy and 
operations improvement processes. 
We strive to positively contribute to 
society through the entire scope of 
our business activities by developing 
socially oriented products and services, 
implementing responsible approaches 
to our business operations, and carrying 
out sponsorship and charity activities.
Socially oriented products and 
services
Corporate Banking. In order to efficiently 
manage its indirect environmental and 
social impact, the Bank prioritised 
the integration of sustainable finance 
principles into its credit risk management 
procedures. In 2013, the Bank updated 
its Environmental and Social Risk 
Management Procedures in order 
to ensure the proper application of 
appropriate, risk-based and sector-
specific environmental and social risk 
assessment practices to its commercial 
lending activities. In 2014, the Bank 
actively started to put the procedures into 
practice, which have been carried on in 
2015. The Bank defined priority targets and 
promotes environmental and social risk 
management activities accordingly. Since 
then the Bank ensures it has a consistent 
approach to evaluating and managing 
environmental, human health and safety 
risks of the financed projects. These 
procedures are now being integrated 
into the Bank’s credit risk management 
process and will soon be routinely applied 
to all commercial transactions. In all that 
the Bank does, it strives to find sustainable 
solutions that make good business sense 
to clients and minimise their impact on 
the social and natural environment. 
The main objective of the Environmental 
and Social Policy is to increase the 
environmental and social benefits for our 
clients. Through Environmental and Social 
Risk Management Procedure, the Bank 
enhances the clients’ opportunities to be 
in compliance with national environmental 
and social regulations and to adopt 
best international practices in this area. 
The Environmental and Social Policy 
and Risk Management Procedures, 
along with other tools necessary for 
their implementation, comprise the core 
components of the Bank’s Environmental 
and Social Risk Management System 
(ESMS). Under this concept, the Bank 
endeavours to become an environmentally 
friendly financial institution. 
The Bank has appointed an Environmental 
and Social Coordinator, responsible 
for ensuring the proper operation 
and maintenance of the ESMS, and 
will appoint an Environmental and 
a Social Risk Manager, responsible 
for the practical, day-to-day 
implementation of the Bank’s ESMS.
We implement the following 
procedures to ensure the operation 
and maintenance of the ESMS:
• We refrain from financing 
environmentally or socially sensitive 
business activities mentioned in the 
exclusion lists of such Development 
Finance Institutions as EBRD, IFC, 
DEG, FMO, ADB and others.
• We aim at assessing the relative 
level of environmental and social risk 
associated with clients’ businesses. 
We require certain customers to 
implement specific environmental 
or social action plans to avoid or 
mitigate their environmental and 
social impact and adhere to specific 
monitoring and reporting requirements 
that we set in order to minimise 
environmental and social risk. These 
requirements are included as covenants 
in agreements between certain of 
our customers and the Bank.
• We aim at regular monitoring of 
environmental and social risks 
associated with the Bank’s activities, 
and assessing clients’ compliance with 
the terms of respective agreements.
Through ensuring comprehensive 
environmental and social assessment 
and action plans, as part of the stable 
due diligence, the Bank encourages 
the customers in fulfilment of their 
environmental and social obligations and 
has established a framework for them to 
achieve good environmental and social 
standards. In many cases, the Bank’s 
proper and timely management of the 
customers’ environmental and social risks 
facilitate them to avoid financial and legal 
sanctions during inspections conducted 
by the state enforcement agency.  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   61

Environmental and social issues are 
tracked at the project site in cooperation 
with the facility staff, providing ongoing 
advice and guidance on good practice and 
standards and monitoring compliance with 
the requirements. For environmental and 
social due diligence of certain high-risk 
and A category projects, the Bank has 
contracted independent external experts. 
As part of monitoring, the Bank requires 
each of its high-risk clients to provide 
the Bank with the annual report on their 
environmental and social performance 
and the implementation of applicable 
Environmental and Social Action Plans 
or each client is visited by the Bank staff 
on a regular basis. During 2015, the Bank 
held extensive ESDD (Environmental and 
Social Due Diligence), monitored the 
clients and developed action plans for 
non-compliant clients. It has to be noted 
that due to the Bank’s efforts, a few 
clients conducted environmental audit 
and obtained the environmental impact 
permits to continue implementation of their 
business activity legally. They have started 
taking measures to mitigate the impact 
on natural and social environment as has 
been required by the permitting body. 
According to Association Agreement 
between the European Union and Georgia, 
Georgia has commitment to progressively 
approximating its legislation in the 
relevant sectors with that of the EU and 
to implementing it effectively. Through 
this approximation process, Georgia is 
very actively developing and amending its 
national legislation in the relevant sectors. 
Therefore, the Bank regularly checks legal 
developments and updates with regard 
to environmental, health and safety and 
labour issues and places great emphasis 
on improvement of ESDD opportunities. 
It should be noted that with the aim to 
strengthen the clients’ knowledge and 
capacity in the area of environmental 
and social protection the Bank staff very 
intensively introduces the information 
about existing and new regulations and 
laws to the clients during the ESDD. 
Training activities are also an important 
element for enhancing capacity for 
policy implementation. In 2015, the 
Bank provided full opportunities for 
the development and enhancement 
of the Environmental and Social Risk 
Coordinator’s capacity. The Coordinator 
participated in the 9th Annual Community 
of Learning which was organised by IFC 
and took place in Washington DC on 
22-23 October 2015. The Community of 
Learning is a knowledge-sharing forum 
aimed at strengthening the implementation 
of environmental and social standards by 
financial institutions in emerging markets. 
The event provided an opportunity 
to exchange experiences, learn from 
investment case studies, and engage 
in dialogue among environmental and 
social risk management specialists from 
all over the globe. More generally, the 
Bank has delivered several trainings in 
this area and more than 100 employees 
were trained during the last two years. 
Leading experts and state inspectors 
were invited as trainers. It is envisaged 
to continue training activities. 
Other highlights of the year included a 
review of the ESMS. The purpose of the 
review was to ensure that policy remains 
fit for purpose, taking into account 
lessons learned from experience and 
changes in the relevant legislation. The 
review process began at the end of 
2014 and the revised policy document 
has been adopted and approved by the 
Board of Directors in 2015. In particular, 
the change in categorisation of the 
transactions took place, assessment 
procedures of low, medium and high-
risk projects were renewed, monitoring 
procedures of projects were refined, 
and also capacity building and staff 
training activities were defined.
As for direct impact on the environment, 
JSC Bank of Georgia carried out the 
inventarisation of the air pollution sources 
of heating systems and pollutants emitted 
from these sources. The objective of 
the inventarisation was identification of 
the exhaustion and emission sources 
of pollutants, evaluation of quantitative 
indices and constituent of emitted 
pollutants as well as identification of other 
emission parameters. The main pollutants 
of heating systems working on the diesel 
and natural gas are hydrocarbons, nitrogen 
dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
soot and carbon acid. The inventarisation 
reports were submitted to the Ministry 
of Environment and Natural Resources 
Protection of Georgia and approved. 
In 2015, the Bank also obtained mining 
licence for obtaining fresh water in one 
of the regional branches. As for efficient 
waste management, the Bank is regularly 
taking measures for waste minimisation 
and reduction in the environmental impact 
of waste. Concerning new initiative, 
green boxes were placed for separate 
collection of everyday paper waste. 
Paper waste is taken to the relevant 
facilities with the aim of recycling. 
The Bank is committed to respecting the 
principles of sustainable development, to 
protecting the environment, and willing 
to improve the level of public health and 
safety and protection of human health 
as an essential element for sustainable 
development and economic growth. 
The Bank continues to make progress 
towards its objective and to ensure efficient 
implementation of the Environmental 
and Social Management System. The 
Bank will continue to conduct business 
with due consideration to environmental 
protection and contribute to the creation 
of a sustainable society. The Bank will 
help increase clients’ benefits through 
proper and highly active implementation 
of the Environmental and Social Policy. 
The Bank also continues to support 
Georgia’s emerging economy by financing 
industries that are strategically important 
for the development of the entire nation. 62   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Infrastructure development. 
Infrastructure development continued to 
be a key financing and guarantee granting 
theme for the Bank, with almost US$ 36.15 
million committed to the construction 
and rehabilitation of the land-reclamation 
system, the rehabilitation of water supply 
and wastewater systems, the construction 
of refugee settlements, the construction 
and rehabilitation of highways, local 
municipal roads and bridges, the 
construction of a new multipurpose 
shopping centre, and the construction 
and rehabilitation of recreational/sport 
facilities and historical buildings. 
From US$ 36.15 million, US$ 12.5 million 
was committed to construction and 
rehabilitation of roads with the aim to 
provide easy access to one of the biggest 
hydro plant in Georgia and to construction 
of permanent operators’ village. 
US$ 5.55 million was committed to 
rehabilitation and reconstruction of 
Vere highway and Mziuri Park after 
disastrous flood in June 2015. Another 
significant financed project was 
renovation and construction of water 
systems throughout the whole country of 
Georgia in amount of US$ 10.0 million. 
With regard to construction of apartment 
complex for refugees, refugees who 
lost their own houses in Samachablo 
and Apkhazia will soon have their own 
apartments in Gori. The Bank financed 
construction of 450 apartments 
in amount of US$ 4.0 million.
The tourism sector has become a vital part 
of the Georgian economy as demonstrated 
by its significant growth since 2000. The 
Bank continues to finance the hospitality 
sector of Georgia by providing loans 
for hotel construction. Besides the 
above-mentioned US$ 36.15 million, the 
bank financed construction of hotels in 
amount of US$ 28.5 million. In particular, 
US$ 24.0 million Loan Agreement was 
signed between the client and the Bank 
regarding financing more than 200 room 
internationally branded hotel in Tbilisi. It 
is co-financed with European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development out of 
which the Bank financed US$ 12.0 million. 
Also US$ 3.5 million Loan was approved 
for construction of 272 bed hostel and 57 
room local brand hotel. The place is going 
to be a combination of inclusive bars, 
sound and art studios, co-working space, 
inner courtyard for events and exhibitions. 
It is believed to be the space for 
socialising, inspiration and collaboration, 
where you can implement new ideas, meet 
the artists and their art, have interesting 
conversations with foreign travellers 
and connect with free and rebellious 
minded people. Construction of a five star 
worldwide brand hotel was also financed 
by the Bank in amount of US$ 13.0 million. 
The Bank endeavours to finance the 
projects that provide millions of people 
with access to safe drinking water, sanitary 
waste water disposal services, well-
maintained urban roads and other types of 
projects that provide important sustainable 
development benefits to households 
and enterprises across the country. 
Hydropower sector. Georgia’s 
hydropower sector holds significant 
development potential. The Bank is 
committed to enhancing the security 
of energy supply, including the 
development of energy sector, promoting 
the development of appropriate 
projects in Georgia facilitating the 
development of relevant infrastructure 
and promoting energy efficient and the 
use of renewable energy sources.
In 2015, the bank financed construction of 
HPPs and equipment purchase in the total 
amount of US$ 3.8 million. In particular, 
the Bank financed construction of small-
scale HPP with installed capacity of 
1.5MW using the water and infrastructure 
of an existing irrigation system outside 
the irrigation period. The annual power 
generation is estimated to amount to 
6.77GWh with a good upside potential in 
case the water supply is higher than the 
minimum flow as stipulated in the supply 
contract with Georgian melioration. Small-
scale hydro power plants are of paramount 
importance, as it is a renewable and 
clean energy option and improves the 
sustainability of decentralised electricity. 
Another financed project was construction 
of small run-of-river HPP. This is a hydro 
power plant with an installed capacity 
of 3.07MW and an expected yearly 
generation of 20GWh. The total budget of 
the project is US$ 4.1 million, out of which 
US$ 2.88 million was financed by the bank, 
with a long-term credit facility and the 
letters of credit to purchase the equipment. 
The project was financed through the 
KFW credit line for renewable energy. 
Healthcare and education support. 
Continuous improvement in medical 
services in Georgia remains a top priority 
for the country’s strategic development. 
In 2015, JSC Bank of Georgia financed 
construction of a multifunctional high-
tech medical centre and purchase of 
equipment in amount of US$ 5.5 million. 
The clinic’s main areas of work include 
neurosurgery, gynecology, traumatology 
and general surgery. The clinic has 7,000 
square metres of space and is equipped 
with the latest medical technology. It 
has eight operational blocks, 30 bed 
reanimation and a 70 spot hospital. The 
clinic also has a high-tech diagnostic 
centre. This project is very important 
step forward in Georgian healthcare 
industry, as it gives Georgian citizens 
more access to high-quality service and 
creates more than 300 working places. 
Information and communications 
technology. In 2015, the Bank 
continued financing the leading fixed-line 
telecommunication service provider in 
Georgia. The Company invested about 
US$ 3 million for LTE infrastructure 
development, out of which US$ 1.2 
million was LC financing from the Bank 
to increase its internet penetration 
in low density populated areas.
Other. In 2015, Bank of Georgia financed 
the construction of a data centre, 
specialised in Bitcoin mining, BFDC 
Georgia (Bitcoin Mining Data Centre). A 
free industrial zone was created in Tbilisi, 
which hosts the data centre and provides 
a tax-free zone for the entities working 
in the information technology industry. 
The data centre was founded by Bitfury, 
a world leader in Bitcoin mining. The 
construction was concluded in 2015 and 
the data centre started its operations in 
December 2015. Total financing need 
was US$ 32.0 million, out of which Bank 
of Georgia financed US$ 5.0 million.
Retail banking
Bank of Georgia continues to innovate 
and come up with a wide range of socially 
oriented financial products and services 
that bring added value to individuals and 
small and medium-sized businesses 
(SMEs) and meet their respective needs.
Express Banking. The Georgian banking 
sector still experiences difficulties in 
overcoming economic and geographical 
barriers on its way to expanding financial 
services in remote regions and among 
low-income parts of the population. 
Our Express Banking service plays an 
important role in addressing this issue: 
• As at 31 December 2015, a network 
of 2,589 Express Pay terminals, 90 
Express and 24 Metro branches 
which are located all over the country 
including in remote mountain regions. 
• Express financial products such as 
Express card, Express deposit and 
Express loan. These financial products 
are uncomplicated, easily accessible 
and affordable to a segment of the 
population that would not have access 
to banking products and services 
otherwise. Since the beginning of the 
Express Banking service in December 
2011, the Bank has attracted 425,350

clients by 31 December 2015, of which 
58,669 were attracted in 2015 alone.
As part of the Express Banking service, we 
prioritise development of self-service skills 
to our clients. We plan to expand services 
in Express Pay terminals, develop web-
based application processing tools and 
implement a new instalment credit product. 
All these changes will provide more 
accessible banking service to our client. 
Youth support. We have developed 
a wide range of financial products to 
support young people in Georgia. For 
example, through the special conditions 
of the Child Deposit we provide parents 
with an opportunity to secure the future 
of their children. Starting from a minimal 
amount of GEL 10, a deposit can be 
opened for two years minimum at any 
time from a child’s birth until the age of 
18. The annual interest rate (12.00% for 
Georgian Lari and 2.25-4.25% for foreign 
currency) is added to the initial deposit. 
In 2015, we opened approximately 
3,505 Child Deposit accounts.
The Bank also offers special products 
that allow the youth to receive secondary 
and higher education. Examples of 
such products are school and student 
loans with favourable terms that do not 
require any financial guarantees and 
collateral. The total amount of school and 
student loans granted in 2015 was GEL 
130,148 and GEL 176,578 respectively.
Another example of a product supporting 
youth is a student card which provides 
special benefits for students of Georgian 
universities. The benefits include discounts 
for public transportation, a 2% interest 
rate for savings on the card Georgian Lari 
accounts and 1% for foreign currency, free 
distance banking services and others. In 
2015, the Bank issued 82,722 of these 
cards. In addition, every three months, 
the Bank awards 20 holders of student 
cards with three-month scholarships 
to encourage the student population to 
use financial instruments and support 
them financially during their study. 
One more example of supporting youth 
is a project called sCool Card – a 
multifunctional card for school children. 
The project is in its starting process. The 
main objective of this social-educational 
project is to make children get accustomed 
to a financial culture and improve their 
financial literacy. sCool Card is available 
for free and all of the transactions and 
card services are also free of charge. 
sCool Card provides special benefits for 
school children in Georgian schools. The 
benefits include public transportation 
(in Tbilisi), discounts for educational and 
entertaining centres popular among 
children, bookstores, cafes, as well as the 
accumulation of bonuses (sCoola) for each 
transaction. To accustom children to use 
the card and motivate school canteens in 
non-cash payments, there is a discount 
for POS terminals set up in schools. As 
a result, more and more children use 
the card for payments and children/
bartenders’ contact with cash is limited.
SME support. We continue to provide 
financing to SMEs, a backbone of 
the Georgian economy that ensures 
sustainable development of our country. 
Apart from our own micro-financing and 
SME loan programmes, we also participate 
in various programmes that support 
entrepreneurs. In 2015, the Bank partnered 
with a non-profit Agricultural Projects 
Management Agency which supports 
agricultural SMEs. Together, we co-
financed agricultural loans at fixed annual 
interest rates which were significantly lower 
than previous loans SMEs received by 
other institutions. In 2015, the total amount 
of Bank loans issued to SMEs was GEL 
934.1 million, of which GEL 257.1 million 
was issued to female entrepreneurs. 
Combined with supporting SMEs 
financially, the Bank also plans to 
organise educational events and provide 
financial and business knowledge 
related advice to entrepreneurs in order 
to enhance their finance management 
skills and ensure the sustainable 
development of their businesses. 
For example, the planned events in 
flagship service centres mentioned 
above will provide entrepreneurs with 
knowledge and skills in accounting, the 
drafting of legal documents, business 
development, sales and marketing. 
Also the environmental and social risk 
management process of SME clients 
is embedded throughout the Bank’s 
activities. Through ensuring comprehensive 
environmental and social risk assessment 
and action plans, we encourage the SME 
clients to be in compliance with national 
environmental and social legislation and 
achieve good environmental and social 
standards. During site visits, we provide 
advice and guidance on good practice 
and standards in this area, update the 
clients with regard to environmental, health 
and safety and labour issues and monitor 
compliance with the E&S legislation. 
In many cases of non-compliance, our 
proper and timely management of the 
SME clients’ environmental and social risks 
facilitate avoidance of financial and legal 
sanctions during inspections conducted 
by the state enforcement agency. 
EnergoCredit loans were provided to SME 
clients. The aim of such loans is to help 
companies reduce their energy intensity 
and increase their competitiveness 
through the following means: 
• reduction of operating costs for energy;
• increased production with the same 
cost for energy; and
• increased awareness among business 
operators and management staff/
employees.
By the use of EnergoCredit the company 
has the chance to receive a 10-15% 
subsidy and get an energy audit for 
free (if required). The total amount of 
EnergoCredit SME loans was US$ 43,642.
Mass retail. EnergoCredit residential loans 
were also provided to various groups of 
retail customers, the aim of which is to 
help households reduce their energy costs 
by purchasing energy efficient products, 
such as boilers and central heating, 
double glazing, insulation for walls, roofs 
and floors, solar water heating, solar 
photovoltaic systems, air-conditioning 
systems, home appliances (electric ovens, 
refrigerators, washing machines). A client 
applying for energy efficient loan is entitled 
to receive a 10% subsidy, calculated on 
the sub-loan amount disbursed to the 
client. The project started In November 
2013 and the total amount of EnergoCredit 
residential loans was US$ 4.3 million.
Affordable housing 
Currently, the Georgian real estate 
market is vulnerable to various economic 
and financial uncertainties. Numerous 
construction projects remain unfinished 
for long periods of time while there is a 
strong growing demand for housing from 
the Georgian population. In response 
to this increasing demand, the Group’s 
real estate development business, m
2
 
Real Estate was established in order to 
offer affordable housing to the emerging 
middle class in Georgia, especially 
young families. Currently, m
2
 Real Estate 
has completed its third successful 
project for the development and sale 
of affordable residential apartments. 
The company uses an innovative approach 
to design and construction processes 
so that each square metre is distributed 
efficiently and fits customers’ needs and 
wishes. As few customers can afford to 
buy large flats with an area exceeding 100 
square metres, the company continuously 
works to optimise the size of the 
apartments to meet the current demand 
of its customers without compromising 
the apartments’ convenience and  64   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

continuing to offer affordable housing 
products, we are helping to significantly 
enhance the quality of their lives.
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC (GHG) 
is the largest private healthcare services 
provider in the Georgian market. The 
Group operates a network of medical 
centres and hospitals through healthcare 
services business. It covers more than 
67% of the Georgian population with clinics 
located across the county and provides 
access to high-quality medical services 
to the population including those living in 
remote mountain regions. The accessibility 
of medical services is ensured by 
scheduling regular visits by specialists to 
small towns and villages and by providing 
patients with transportation to larger clinics 
in urgent cases and in cases when more 
sophisticated treatment is required. 
The healthcare services business of 
GHG also provides free regular medical 
examinations at various locations across 
the country including Batumi, Khulo, 
Keda, shuakhevi, Poti, Kvareli, Telavi and 
others. In addition, GHG’s specialists 
deliver free medical services, including 
examinations and treatments for socially 
and economically disadvantaged parts of 
the population. In cooperation with other 
healthcare institutions, Georgia Healthcare 
Group arranges free blood transportation 
and donations for its patients. 
Apart from healthcare services business, 
the Group operates a medical insurance 
business, which participated in the state 
insurance programme in 2015. Through 
this programme, it served more than 
400,000 policyholders represented 
by people below the poverty level, the 
elderly, children below five years of age, 
students, teachers and refugees. 
Sponsorship and charity
Within its sponsorship and charity 
activities, the Group continues to focus 
on promoting and enhancing access 
to education, conserving nature and 
supporting children with disabilities. The 
Group’s Sponsorship and Charity Policy 
implies partnering with Foundations 
and NGOs to deliver sustainable results 
and bring about positive change. Our 
priority is to help solve a cause, not the 
symptom. The Group chose to focus on 
the three areas bearing utmost importance 
for Georgian society. Sponsorship and 
charity funds are channelled through 
the Tree of Life Foundation that in its 
turn distributes funding via means of 
grants competitions thus assuring a 
transparent and fair way of financing.

Promoting and enhancing access to 
education. Bank of Georgia University, 
established in 2014, welcomed its second 
intake of MBA in Finance students in 
autumn 2015. Cost of studies in 2015 
were again in big part subsidised by 
the Bank, GEL 244,500 in total giving 
a possibility to up to 10 top students to 
study free of charge while the next 20 
can enjoy a 0% loan and start repaying 
one year after graduation. Besides 
providing high-quality education, Bank 
of Georgia University offers its students 
hands-on experience by offering them a 
possibility to observe various business 
processes at the Group’s companies. 
In summer 2014, Bank of Georgia’s start-
up incubator, Vegalab, started to operate. 
In total GEL 300,467 was spent on setting 
up and running the Lab which allows its 
incumbents to use a centrally located office 
and its facilities, training and mentoring free 
of charge. Since then, authors (individuals 
and groups) of 12 business ideas were 
selected to join the incubator out of 
which three projects were nominated 
for the next stage – capital financing. 
In 2013, the Bank became the first 
Georgian company to cooperate with 
one of the most prestigious scholarship 
programmes in the world, the Chevening 
scholarship, in order to provide Georgian 
students with an opportunity to pursue 
education in the UK. The Group provided 
GEL 293,555 in total and funded three 
students in 2015. The partnership with 
Chevening has been extended for the next 
year and the Group is looking forward 
selecting students who will continue 
their Master’s studies in the UK. 
In 2014, the Bank signed a partnership 
agreement with the prestigious US 
Fulbright scholarship scheme. Thanks 
to Bank of Georgia’s contribution two 
students from Georgia were able to enrol 
in a two-year Master’s degree programme 
at a US University in 2015. Funding 
provided to the students for their first year 
of studies amounts to GEL 225,450.
For the past three years the Bank has 
been supporting a Public Speaking 
competition organised by the English 
Speaking Union, Georgia. The competition 
allows top students who are in their 
senior year at a high school, or freshmen 
year at a university, to prepare a speech 
on a predetermined topic and present 
in front of a competent jury. The winner 
is granted a fully paid trip to London, 
to attend the global Public Speaking 
competition. We aim to be part of this 
competition during 2016 as well. 
The Bank has been supporting every 
single TEDxTbilisi conference from 
when it was first organised, in 2012. A 
TEDx conference is a locally organised 
TED format event, where communities, 
organisations and individuals join to 
initiate a conversation and connect 
with each other on different matters 
which are important for the society.
In 2015, Bank of Georgia provided funding 
in the amount of GEL 40,646 to a local 
NGO (Non-governmental Organisation), 
Educate Georgia to translate into Georgian 
one of the most widespread and popular 
free online educational platforms in the 
world, the Khan Academy. The project 
will allow some 200,000 Georgian pupils 
with internet access, 65% of who live 
outside Tbilisi to read and listen to the 
highest quality education materials. 
Conserving nature. Another priority of the 
Group’s charity activities is the preservation 
of wildlife diversity. Since 2010, the 
Bank has granted US$ 300,000 to the 
Caucasus Nature Fund (CNF) to cover the 
maintenance costs of Borjomi-Kharagauli 
National Park (BKNP), one of the most 
treasured national parks in Georgia. 
Supporting children. Since 2014, the 
Bank has been focusing its efforts on 
supporting children with disabilities 
– one of the most vulnerable social 
groups in Georgia. In 2015, the Bank 
donated GEL 103,904 to the Tree of 
Life Foundation which distributed the 
funds through two grants competition 
for relevant NGOs. In order to qualify 
for the competition, proposals had 
to focus on sustainable results and 
causing change in one of the following 
areas: providing education, developing 
infrastructure for disabled children, or 
fostering integration into the society. 
Some of the projects financed through the 
grants’ competition entailed: providing 119 
wheelchairs to children with disabilities or 
special needs, creation of a paraorchestra, 
setting up of a social taxi service for the 
disabled, organising adapted playground 
in one of the largest districts in Tbilisi. 
On 13 June 2015, Tbilisi experienced one 
of the worst floods in its recent history. 
With one of the highways and several 
homes destroyed, casualties and loss 
caused by the disaster amounted to 
around GEL 200 million. The Group was 
one of the first to come up with an initiative 
to raise funds to help the flood victims. 
The Group donated GEL 1 million in total 
to fund provision of new housing for those 
who were left without one. In addition, 
GEL 300,000 was donated by corporate 
and individual clients of the Bank to an 
account swiftly opened and promoted by 
Bank of Georgia within days of the flood.
 
Healthcare services business of GHG 
runs a wide range of charitable activities 
on a permanent basis for children 
with leukaemia. It also regularly gifts 
personal computers to children from 
socially and economically disadvantaged 
large families. Additionally, on religious 
holidays business delivers presents to the 
newborns across the patient network.
Employee matters
A key factor to our success is a cohesive 
and professional team, capable of 
accomplishing the Group’s objectives. 
We are committed to attracting and 
identifying the best professionals, 
caring and planning for their needs, 
investing in their development and 
fostering their commitment.
The HR department and the management 
system it implements play a vital role in 
managing our most valuable resources  
- our employees. The HR department 
develops HR policies and procedures 
which determine key principles, areas, 
approaches and methods that are 
crucial for building HR management 
systems for all our businesses. 
Examples of some our HR policies and 
procedures include, but are not limited to:
• employee planning and recruiting;
• staff administration;
• compensation and benefits;
• code of conduct;
• employee development and training;
• human rights;
• grievances;
• whistleblowing;
• retrenchment; and
• anti-nepotism. 66   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Strategy
The Bank’s HR management department 
works closely with HR managers and 
executives from our subsidiaries in order 
to ensure proper implementation of the 
main principles and provision of necessary 
support in all HR-related matters.
We recognise the importance of observing 
human rights and are committed to 
implementing socially responsible business 
practices. Our Human Rights Policy 
establishes priorities and puts control 
procedures in place to provide equal 
opportunities and prevent discrimination 
or harassment on any grounds, including 
disability. Our Human Rights Policy 
applies to all employees (including the 
disabled) and includes procedures related 
to employment processes (including 
continued employment for employees who 
have become disabled while employed 
by us), training and development. 
We are committed to employee 
engagement. We believe that knowledge 
of our Group is key and we strive to 
provide our employees with a continuous 
flow of information which includes but 
is not limited to information about our 
corporate culture, the Group’s strategy 
and performance, risks relating to its 
performance, such as financial and 
economic factors, and our policies and 
procedures. We provide information 
in a number of ways, including via 
departmental managers, presentations, 
our intranet, email and regular town-hall 
and off-site meetings. We also value 
the views of our employees. We consult 
with our employees regularly and have 
implemented feedback systems, such as 
frequent employee satisfaction surveys, 
which ensure that our employees opinions 
are taken into account when making 
decisions which are likely to affect their 
interests. Employee feedback also 
helps to improve our customer focused 
orientation and client servicing approach. 
Talent attraction
Sustained development of the Group’s 
businesses requires the strengthening 
of the teams of our subsidiaries both by 
using the Group’s own significant internal 
resources through staff development 
and rotation, and by attracting external 
candidates. Our recruitment policy and 
relevant control procedures ensure an 
unbiased hiring process that provides 
equal opportunities for all candidates.
According to the HR Policy, internal 
candidates have priority when filling 
vacant positions, especially in situations 
where there are vacancies in top 
and middle management. Thus, in 
2015, 175 Group employees were 
promoted to managerial positions.
In order to attract young talent, we actively 
partner with leading Georgian business 
schools and universities, participate in 
job fairs and run extensive internship 
programmes aimed at the professional 
development of young professionals and 
their further employment. In 2012, Bank

of Georgia established a new format for 
its traditional internship programme. It 
attracts promising graduates and provides 
them with the opportunity to participate 
in a major professional training and 
leadership development programme. 
Interns are directly coached by the 
Bank’s executives to help them on their 
path to gaining their first management 
positions in the near future. In 2015, 
the number of young professionals 
(under 30 years old) increased by

represents 36% of total headcount.
Training and development
To manage our employees in a way that 
best supports our business strategy, we 
seek to help our employees contribute to 
business performance through personal 
and professional development.
Following our aspiration to develop 
strong leaders, we have developed an 
extensive programme for leadership 
development. We provide a standard 
Induction Training course for employees 
appointed to managerial positions. This 
programme covers a wide range of topics 
including corporate values, strategy and 
objectives, organisational structure, HR 
management policies, history of the Group, 
and specific courses for development 
of communication, presentation, 
management and leadership skills, among 
others. Selected mid-level and senior-level 
employees are given the opportunity to 
receive external training in well-known 
training institutions outside of Georgia. 
The Group’s corporate learning system 
is comprised of a wide range of internal 
and external training sessions specifically 
designed to meet the needs of front and 
back-office employees at the Group’s 
subsidiaries including banking, healthcare, 
insurance and real estate development. 
In 2014, Bank of Georgia launched 
a Leadership Development online 
programme for senior managers and some 
of our key employees. The programme 
was provided by a UK company and aimed 
to support the individual development of 
participants’ leadership capabilities. The 
programme was running successfully 
throughout this year as well and benefited 
all participants with a personally tailored 
development experience and gave 
them a greater awareness of their 
leadership strengths and opportunities 
for further growth and effectiveness. 
Each of the Group’s businesses 
has developed an extensive training 
programme for front office employees 
in order to provide them with relevant 
skills, such as effective communication 
and building strong and valued client 
relationships. For example, the Bank’s 
mentoring programme is part of a front 
office training process. Every new 
employee is provided with regular advice, 
guidance and practical instructions 
from an appointed mentor who later 
participates in the new employee’s 
performance appraisal. Through 
this programme, we aim to provide 
individual support to our employees in 
achieving their professional results and 
improving their personal effectiveness.
GHG’s healthcare services business 
provides additional training to its 
employees that work in the specialised 
field of healthcare. The company 
remains the only healthcare institution 
in Georgia to have in-house training of 
personnel. Since the beginning of 2014, 
GHG has invested over GEL 3.0 million 
in training and has a dedicated staff 
of 45 trainers, largely focusing on the 
areas of nursing and critical care. The 
business recently established a unique 
training centre in the Kutaisi region that 
will enhance the professional knowledge 
and skills of local medical personnel. 
Occupational health and safety
Ensuring the safety of the workplace and 
providing healthy working conditions 
are among the Group’s fundamental 
HR management principles. The Group 
pays particular attention to preventive 
measures, such as conducting 
regular staff training and medical 
check-ups, certifying workplaces, 
and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
The Group’s real estate development 
business is associated with high health 
and safety risks for contractors on sites. 
In order to minimise such risks, m
2
 Real 
Estate established a Health and Safety 
Policy and management procedures 
ensuring implementation of the health and 
safety measures at all worksites. The policy 
contains a range of precautions that seek 
to prevent any accidents related to the 
m
2
’s contractors or injuries to community 
members, as well as property damage and 
incidents caused by equipment failure.
In order to enhance the awareness of 
employees and contractors regarding 
health and safety risks associated with 
the construction process the company 
conducts regular training and educational 
seminars. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the 
number of health and safety training hours 
amounted to approximately 110, 1,008 
and 500 respectively. In addition, the m
2
 
publishes brochures and booklets with 
warnings and special rules to be followed 
when working on sites. Respective control 
procedures include quarterly audits by 
external health and safety consultants 
and internal monthly inspections of m
2
 
Real Estate worksites. In addition, m
2
 Real 
Estate has a comprehensive reporting 
procedure for health and safety concerns. 
In 2015, 2014 and 2013, no work-related 
fatalities or injury incidents occurred at 
the company’s construction sites.
With regard to emergency preparedness 
and response, m
2
 Real Estate established 
an Emergency Management Plan. It 
outlines possible scenarios during 
emergency situations and determines 
specific strategies for the company’s 
employees, contractors and visitors on 
how to react when in a crisis situation. 
Environmental matters
The Group recognises that its operations 
have both an indirect and direct impact on 
the environment and therefore seeks to 
establish management approaches which 
will help it become a more environmentally 
friendly institution. Being the largest 
financial institution in Georgia, the Bank 
produces significant indirect environmental 
impact through the projects which it 
finances. In order to properly manage 
this impact, the Bank has implemented 
an Environmental and Social Policy 
and Risk Management Procedures, as 
described in the “Social matters” section.
As for direct environmental impact, we 
believe that the impact of the banking and 
insurance businesses is not significant. 
Nevertheless, we undertake a number 
of measures to reduce electricity, paper, 
water, and fuel consumption. For example, 
in 2013 we upgraded our lighting system 
in the Bank’s headquarters by installing 
energy-saving bulbs and implemented 
KNX (EIB) System management, which not 
only helped us minimise our environmental 
impact but also reduced our energy 
costs by GEL 4,000-5,000 per month. 
We implemented this system in all of the 
Bank’s branches during 2014. In addition 
to our energy saving efforts, in 2015 we 
started a project “Green Box”. With this 
initiative the Bank continues its work 
towards minimising the paper waste. 
“Green Boxes” are placed on every floor 
of the Bank’s headquarters and are 
designated to collect paper for recycling 
purposes. The Group is also in the process 
of automating its operational processes 
in order to reduce the volume of printed 
documents and consequently minimise 
the overall use of paper. The Bank 
continues to acquire new printers which 
offer double-sided printing by default.
We are considering replacing part 
of our car fleet, which runs on 
petrol, with electric vehicles. 68   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Environmental aspect Preventive measures
Dust • Introducing speed limits on unmade roads
• Damping down using water bowsers with spray bars
• Sheeting of construction materials and storage piles
• Using defined moving routes and reductions in vehicle speed limits where required
Spills and leaks during refuelling • Installing a sealed drainage system at refuelling areas
• Providing suitable tanks (e.g. double skinned), bunds and impermeable liners at fuel 
stores and refuelling points
• Using drip trays for static plant (e.g. generators and pumps)
• Training staff in refuelling and pump operations
• Shortening the refuelling line as much as possible
• Performing regular maintenance checks of hoses and valves
• Conducting follow-up procedures for proper and safe refuelling by operators
Air emissions • Ensuring that new vehicles comply with the current European Union (EU) emissions 
standards at the time of purchase
• Implementing a regular maintenance programme to ensure all new vehicles continue to 
comply with relevant EU emissions standards
• Ensuring that older vehicles are maintained in order to eliminate extra emissions as 
much as reasonably practicable
• Strictly enforcing speed limits in order to optimise fuel consumption and production of 
exhaust fumes, and minimise dust generation on unpaved surfaces
Water contamination • Locating fuel stores and refuelling points further away from watercourses and aquifers
Fire • Providing a fire extinguisher adjacent to each item of mobile plant and equipment
Noise • Fitting effective silencers at all plant and machinery, and providing ear defenders and/
or plugs on sites
• No idling or revving of plant engines and all vehicles
• Using controlled venting, silenced equipment and absorbing screens
• Working at preferred times of day (daylight hours Monday to Saturday, otherwise 
communicated to the local community and authorities)
Vibration • Operating the equipment within the manufacturer specification limits and limiting any 
overuse
Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer • Ensuring that no ozone depleting substances (ODS) such as chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) and hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or products with known global 
warming potential are used

efficiency and thus outsources medical 
waste management to a company 
specialising in medical waste disposal. 
The total amount of generated medical 
waste in 2015 amounted to 125 tonnes 
compared with 159 tonnes in 2014 
and 55 tonnes in 2013, an increase 
which correlated with the significant 
expansion of GHG’s hospital network.
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013 (Scope 1 
and 2) and additionally have reported on 
those emissions under Scope 3 that are 
applicable to our business. All reported 
sources fall within our consolidated 
financial statements which can be found 
on pages 135 to 215 of this Annual Report. 
We do not have responsibility for any 
emission sources that are not included in 
our consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing this emissions data, 
we have used the World Resources 
Institute/World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WRI/
WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and emissions 
factors from the UK Government’s 
Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2014.
The reported data is collected and 
reported for the boundaries of four 
of the Group’s main businesses:
• Banking (represented by the Bank), 
which includes all of its offices 
and retail branches where the 
Bank has operational control.
• Real estate development (represented 
by m
2
 Real Estate), which includes 
its offices and construction sites.
• P&C insurance (represented by 
Aldagi), which includes all of its 
offices and retail branches where the 
company has operational control.
• Georgia Healthcare Group (represented 
by Evex and Imedi L), which includes 
its main office and hospitals where the 
company has operational control.
Scope 1 (combustion of fuel and operation 
of facilities) includes emissions from:
• Combustion of natural gas, diesel 
and petrol in stationary equipment 
at owned and controlled sites.
• Combustion of petrol, diesel and 
aviation fuel in owned transportation 
devices (cars and aeroplane).
Scope 2 (electricity, heat, steam and 
cooling purchased for own use) includes 
emissions from:
• Used electricity at owned and controlled 
sites; to calculate the emissions, we 
used the conversion factor for Non-
OECD Europe and Eurasia (average) 
conversion from the UK Government’s 
Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2014. 
• Used heat and steam (only 
applies to one site of Imedi L).
Scope 3 includes emissions from:
• Air business travel (short haul and 
long haul); information on the class of 
travel is unavailable hence we used an 
“average passenger” conversion factor.
• Ground transportation, including 
taxis, coaches and car hire. 
Data on emissions resulting from travel 
is reported for business-related travel 
only, and excludes commuting travel. 
Data from joint ventures, investments, 
or sub-leased properties have not been 
included within the reported figures. 
The data is provided by on-site delegates,

Overview of financial results
Executing our strategy
We have once again leveraged our distinctive capabilities and strengths, and managed to beat the 
38% Lari devaluation by delivering an all-time high net profit in US Dollar terms during 2015.
Consolidated results discussion
The Group’s profit of GEL 310.9 million was driven by the outstanding performance of our Banking Business, with its superior customer-
driven franchise, sound bank risk management policy and double-digit positive operating leverage, combined with an excellent 
performance from our portfolio of companies in the Investment Business. Obviously, Georgian GDP growth of c.3% was instrumental in 
keeping asset quality in check and delivering strong growth and record profitability. Georgian macroeconomic growth of c.3% was 
particularly resilient in the context of the economic turbulence in the region. Our base case scenario for GDP growth in 2016 is c.3% in 
real terms with inflation of up to 5%.

Our net banking interest income 
increased to GEL 512.9 million in 2015, 
showing strong double-digit growth 
of 43.6% y-o-y. This reflects the strong 
performance of interest income which 
outgrew interest expense. On a constant 
currency basis, growth in our full year 
interest income (up 32.1% y-o-y) outpaced 
growth in interest expense (28.7%). Our 
strong interest income performance was 
a result of robust growth in our average 
interest earning assets and improved Loan 
Yield, which was primarily driven by the 
PrivatBank acquisition. The y-o-y growth 
in interest earning assets was driven 
by the weakening Georgian Lari, which 
increased the Georgian Lari value of our 
foreign currency denominated interest 
earning assets, the PrivatBank acquisition 
and a slight 1.5% y-o-y growth in the net 
loan book on a constant currency basis.
Our average net loans increased to GEL 
5,401.9 million in 2015, up 30.5% y-o-y 
in nominal terms and up 1.5% y-o-y 
on a constant currency basis. Primarily 
driven by outstanding performance of 
our Retail Banking operations as well 
as the PrivatBank acquisition, which 
added GEL 245.6 million to our Banking 
Business net loan book at time of the 
PrivatBank integration in May 2015. 
The increase in our interest expense 
was driven by a two-fold effect: Strong 
growth in our average interest bearing 
liabilities and growth in cost of funding. 
This reflects a strong growth in average 
client deposits for 2015, which represent 
a more expensive source of funding. The 
growth was driven mainly by the growth 
in foreign currency deposits which again 
reflected in large part the weakening 
of the Georgian Lari. For the full-year, 
average interest bearing liabilities grew 
at 39.1% and cost of funding increased 
from 4.8% in 2014 to 5.1% this year. 
Average client deposits and notes grew 
38.0% y-o-y for 2015 to GEL 4,379,707.
Our net fee and commission income 
reached GEL 121.6 million in 2015, up 
19.4% y-o-y. On a constant currency 
basis, growth in our full year fee and  72   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Strategic report Performance
commission income (up 16.0% y-o-y) 
outpaced growth in fee and commission 
expense (13.1%). Growth was primarily 
driven by the ongoing success of our 
Express Banking service, which has 
expanded during the year partially driven 
by the integration of PrivatBank, whose 
clients were a mainly target segment for 
our Express products. We have added 
58,669 Express Banking customers in 
2015, representing 16.0% growth y-o-y in 
Express client base. The growth in client 
base has triggered a significant increase 
in the volume of banking transactions. 
The growth of transactions was achieved 
largely through the more cost-effective 
remote channels. Net gain from foreign 
currencies increased to GEL 76.9 million 
in 2015 (up 45.8% y-o-y). Growth reflected 
increased client activity as a result of 
the increased Georgian Lari volatility.
Our P&C insurance business, Aldagi, 
continued its strong yearly performance 
and posted gross insurance profit of GEL 
20.0 million (up 22.1% y-o-y). This increase 
was mainly driven by growth in Motor 
insurance and Life & Disability insurance. 
Our NIM stood at 7.7% (up 10bps 
y-o-y). NIM was adversely affected by the 
high liquidity levels that we purposefully 
maintained during 2015. Pro forma NIM, 
adjusted for excess liquidity levels, was 
8.2% for full-year 2015. NIM reflected 
strong Loan Yield which stood at 14.8% for 
2015 (up 50 bps y-o-y), largely driven by 
the addition of PrivatBank’s high yielding 
Loan Portfolio. PrivatBank’s higher margin 
is primarily driven by its mono-product of 
an all-in-one debit and credit card. Liquid 
Assets Yield stood at 3.2% in 2015 (up 
70 bps y-o-y), largely reflecting higher 
yield on Government issued securities. 
This was partially offset by a 30 bps 
increase in Cost of Funds, which stood 
at 5.1%. The increase in Cost of Funds 
was primarily driven by an increase in 
the cost of local currency funding as the 
local currency financing reference rate of 
the National Bank of Georgia increased 
gradually during 2015 to 8.0% at the year 
end, up from 4.0% at the end of 2014. 
As of 1 September 2015, we decreased 
the interest rates on one-year Dollar 
deposits from 5% to 4% in the retail 
segment, which is expected to drive our 
Cost of Funds down and decrease the 
dollarisation of our balance sheet. On the 
other hand, as of 1 September 2015, we 
increased the interest rates on one-year 
local currency deposits from 9% to 11% 
in the retail segment, which affected 
the increase in our cost of funds. Our 
liquidity levels as a percentage of total 
assets increased to 32.7% by the end of 
2015, compared to 26.6% a year ago as 
a result of an increased liquidity pool.
Our efficiency further improved in 2015, 
with double-digit operating leverage 
and an all time low cost to income ratio. 
Operating leverage was positive at 16.6%. 
The Cost/Income ratio stood at 35.7% 
in 2015 (down 480 bps y-o-y). Improved 
efficiency was a result of the integration 
of PrivatBank and the resulting synergies 
realised during the year, and our ongoing 
efforts to keep a tight grip on costs. 
Operating expenses increased to GEL 
267.9 million (up 23.0%). In 2015, y-o-y 
revenue growth largely outpaced growth 
in operating expenses, which reflected 
the PrivatBank acquisition and an organic 
growth of the business. The salaries and 
employee benefits increase was driven 
by the increased revenue base and 
PrivatBank acquisition. The administrative 
expenses increase was largely driven by 
expenses on rent, predominantly due 
to the appreciation of the US Dollar, the 
listing currency of rentals in Georgia, in 
addition to an increase in the number of 
leased branches following the PrivatBank 
acquisition, which also drove the increase 
in depreciation and amortisation.
For the full year 2015, Banking 
Business like-for-like Cost of Risk ratio 
(excluding devaluation effect) stood at 
2.4% (1.2% in 2014) and the like-for-
like cost of credit risk was GEL 133.6 
million (GEL 55.7 million for the year 
2014). Devaluation added 0.3% and GEL 
17.9 million to Cost of Risk and cost of 
credit risk, respectively, for the year 2015, 
resulting in Cost of Risk ratio of 2.7% and 
cost of credit risk of GEL 151.5 million. 
NPLs to gross loans increased by 30 
bps to 4.3% as of 31 December 2015, 
compared to 4.0% as of 30 September 
2015 and 90 bps from 3.4% as of 
31 December 2014. The increase was 
mainly due to Georgian Lari devaluation 
against US Dollar. NPLs increased to GEL 
241.1 million, up 57.0% y-o-y, reflecting 
the inclusion of PrivatBank’s NPLs, local 
currency devaluation against the US Dollar 
and overall 20.9% growth in net loan book. 
The NPL coverage ratio stood at 83.4% 
as of 31 December 2015 compared to 
68.0% as of 31 December 2014. NPL 
coverage ratio adjusted for the discounted 
value of collateral stood at 120.6% as of 
31 December 2015, compared to 110.6% 
as of 31 December 2014. Our 15 days 
past due rate for retail loans stood at 
0.9% as of 31 December 2015 compared 
to 0.8% as of 31 December 2014.
Non-recurring items increased to GEL 
13.1 million from GEL 11.8 million a year 
ago, which was largely driven by costs 
associated with the PrivatBank integration.

As a result of the foregoing, the 
Banking Business reported record 
profit of GEL 274.3 million in 2015 (up 
24.4% y-o-y) and achieved a ROAE of 
21.7% compared to 20.6% in 2014.
The Banking Business profit was 
supported by its banking subsidiary in 
Belarus – BNB, which added GEL 17.5 
million profit in 2015 (up 11.4% y-o-y). The 
growth was primarily driven by strong 
y-o-y growth in the BNB loan book to 
GEL 320.1 million, up 20.4% y-o-y, mostly 
consisting of an increase in SME loans. 
BNB client deposits increased to GEL 
277.6 million, up 37.6% y-o-y and reflecting 
BNB’s strong franchise in Belarus. BNB 
is well capitalised, with Capital Adequacy 
Ratios well above the requirements of its 
regulating Central Bank. For 2015, Total 
CAR was 16.5%, above the 10% minimum 
requirement by the National Bank of the 
Republic of Belarus (NBRB) and Tier I 
CAR was 8.1%, above the 5% minimum 
requirement by NBRB. Return on Average 
Equity (ROAE) for BNB was 23.5%.
Our Banking Business balance 
sheet remained very liquid (NBG 
Liquidity ratio of 46.2%) and well-
capitalised (Tier I Capital Adequacy 
ratio, NBG Basel 2/3 of 10.9%) with a 
well-diversified funding base (Client 
Deposits and Notes to Liabilities of 
63.4%). The NBG Liquidity ratio stood at 
46.2% as of 31 December 2015 compared 
to 35.0% as of 31 December 2014, against 
a regulatory requirement of 30.0%. Liquid 
assets increased to GEL 3,007.0 million, 
up 60.4% y-o-y. Additionally, liquid assets 
as a percentage of total assets increased 
to 32.7% y-o-y, up from 26.6% a year 
ago, and liquid assets as a percentage 
of total liabilities also increased to 38.2% 
y-o-y, up from 32.3% a year ago. Our 
share of amounts due to credit institutions 
to total liabilities decreased slightly y-o-y 
from 22.8% to 21.5%, with the share of 
client deposits and notes to total liabilities 
increasing y-o-y from 59.9% to 63.4%. Net 
Loans to Customer Funds and DFIs ratio, 
a ratio closely observed by management, 
stood at 90.8%, down from 108.6% as 
of 31 December 2014. The decrease 
was mainly due to the slower growth in 
net loans and an increase in deposits.

Performance highlights
Retail Banking revenue in 2015 
increased to GEL 427.4 million, up 
44.0% y-o-y. Net banking interest income 
reached a record level of GEL 322.9 
million, up 49.6%. Impressive growth in 
net banking interest income for Retail 
Banking was mostly a result of PrivatBank 
integration, which was primarily a credit 
card business, and the significant growth 
(partly attributable to the devaluation 
effect) of the Retail Banking loan book, 
particularly the mortgage, micro and SME 
loan portfolios, and a fairly stable NIM. 
The Retail Banking net loan book 
reached a record level of GEL 2,796.5 
million, up 35.3% y-o-y; with robust 
growth on constant currency basis of 
19.0% y-o-y. The growth was a result of 
strong loan origination delivered across 
all Retail Banking segments: consumer 
loan originations of GEL 671.2 million 
in 2015 resulted in consumer loans 
outstanding totalling GEL 626.8 million as 
of 31 December 2015, up 19.2% y-o-y; 
micro loan originations of GEL 572.0 
million in 2015 resulted in micro loans 
outstanding totalling GEL 546.7 million as 
of 31 December 2015, up 27.2% y-o-y; 
SME loan originations of GEL 346.9 
million in 2015 resulted in SME loans 
outstanding totalling GEL 357.1 million as 
of 31 December 2015, up 51.2% y-o-y; 
Mortgage loans originations of GEL 288.1 
million in 2015 resulted in mortgage loans 
outstanding of GEL 809.0 million as of 
31 December 2015, up 34.6% y-o-y; 
point of sale (POS) loan originations of 
GEL 200.3 million in 2015 resulted in POS 
loans outstanding of GEL 119.4 million as 
of 31 December 2015, up 28.2% y-o-y. 
Retail Banking client deposits increased 
to GEL 1,880.0 million, up 39.3% y-o-y; 
growth on constant currency basis 
was 15.5% y-o-y. The growth of client 
deposits on a y-o-y basis was due to 
the increase in the number of Express 
Banking clients, who bring with them the 
cheapest source of deposits for the Bank 
– current accounts and demand deposits. 
Our Retail Banking net fee and 
commission income increased to a 
record level of GEL 78.2 million, up 
32.9% y-o-y. Net fee and commission 
income reflects continued growth of our 
Express Banking franchise, which has 
attracted 425,350 previously unbanked 
emerging mass market customers 
since its launch three years ago; it grew 
58,669 y-o-y in 2015, alongside the 
addition of c.400,000 customers as a 
result of the PrivatBank acquisition. This 
has driven the number of client-related 
foreign currency and other banking 
transactions substantially higher. 
Retail Banking recorded NIM of 9.6%, 
down 20 bps y-o-y, reflecting an 
increased Loan Yield of 17.6%. Increase 
of 20 bps y-o-y was largely a result of 
PrivatBank’s high yielding loan portfolio 
which was consolidated in 2Q15 and had 
a loan yield of 29.3% at the moment of 
acquisition and Cost of Client Deposits of 
3.9%, up 10 bps y-o-y, which is a resilient 
performance notwithstanding the increase 
in local currency denominated deposits.

Operating expenses increased to 
GEL 172.3 million, up 35.0% y-o-y, 
resulting in a Cost to Income ratio of 
40.3% and positive operating leverage 
of 9.0 percentage points, which reflects 
increases in salaries and other employee 
benefits, principally driven by the 
growth in headcount that reflects the 
growing revenue base and increase 
in administrative expenses which was 
largely driven by expenses on rent, 
predominantly due to the appreciation of 
the US Dollar and the listing currency of 
rentals in Georgia. Increased number of 
leased branches also drove the increase 
in depreciation and amortisation. 
The cost of credit jumped significantly to 
GEL 75.4 million in 2015, compared to GEL 
9.2 million in 2014. The increase was a 
result of a combination of factors including 
the 35.3% growth of the Retail Banking 
loan book, the devaluation and the new 
portfolio acquired with the PrivatBank 
acquisition. Consequently, Retail Banking 
Cost of Risk was 2.6% compared to 0.4% 
a year ago. The following factors contribute 
to what we consider to be a relatively 
low default rate in Retail Banking: a large 
number of our Retail Banking borrowers 
(approximately 500,000 borrowers), 
whose loans are in local currency, are not 
affected by the US Dollar appreciation 
against Georgian Lari; although our 
mortgage borrowers are affected by the 
devaluation as most mortgages are US 
Dollar denominated, they represent a very 
small portion of our clients (approximately 
13,000). Additionally, these customers 
are relatively high earners, with a bigger 
capacity to bear the effects of devaluation; 
our Retail Banking clients prefer to save in 
US Dollars as indicated by the dollarisation 
levels of our client deposits; thus their 
interest income in nominal Georgian Lari 
terms has increased with the Georgian 
Lari devaluation against the US Dollar. 
These also represent clients who either 
have local currency or mortgage loans; US 
Dollar is the main currency for remittances, 
a major source of hard currency inflows 
to Georgia, which represent the main 
income for a large number of families 
in Georgia. Therefore, their income 
increased in nominal local currency 
terms with the US Dollar appreciation. 
As a result, Retail Banking profit 
reached GEL 146.7 million in 2015, 
up 8.8% y-o-y and achieved a 
strong ROAE of 24.6% in 2015. 
Operating highlights
Our Express Banking continues to deliver 
strong growth as we follow our mass

PrivatBank story: strategic acquisition and flawless integration execution 
In December 2014 – the Board made 
the decision to acquire PrivatBank as it 
represented a strong strategic fit with 
our target to increase our share of retail 
loans. PrivatBank was essentially a credit 
card business with retail loans making 
up 85% of its loan book. In addition, 
PrivatBank with its vast branch network 
(43% of the Bank’s network at that time) 
represented a particularly strong fit for 
the Bank’s Express branch (self-service) 
format. This was also complemented with 
PrivatBank’s strong payment platform.
In January 2015 – we completed the 
acquisition of PrivatBank for c.GEL 92 
million cash consideration for 100% of 
PrivatBank (1.11x P/BV), of which 10% 
or GEL 9.2 million will be paid on the 
first anniversary of the closing (January 
2016), subject to representations and 
warranties/holdback provisions. During 
the five months following the acquisition, 
our integration team focused on IT 
integration, optimisation of costs and 
number of branches, PrivatBank product 
development and relevant trainings. Our 
IT integration team spent two months in 
Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine at PrivatBank 
headquarters to migrate PrivatBank’s 
information systems into our banking 
software, which we completed with just 
24 hours of downtime for PrivatBank 
clients. This represents an exceptionally 
short period of time for full IT integration 
in the banking industry. All of the data 
associated with the customers and 
transaction histories, including the 
data of c.800,000 customers (of which 
c.400,000 are active customers), over 1.1 
million cards with respective transaction 
histories, c.150,000 loans and c.75,000 
deposits, have been successfully 
migrated onto our banking software. 
During this period, we rebranded 35 
PrivatBank branches into our self-service 
format Express Banking branches, and 
completed the in-house development of 
PrivatBank’s trademark mono-product of 
an all-in-one debit and credit card to add 
the transport and payment capabilities of 
our Express card. PrivatBank customers 
continue to use PrivatBank cards, which 
are now serviced by our card processing 
platform, without the need to change 
them into Bank of Georgia cards. In order 
to optimise PrivatBank’s branch network, 
we pilot tested utilisation of our Express 
Pay terminals by PrivatBank’s clients. 
The results showed that the terminals, 
which act as a self-service substitute 
to branches, had proved very popular 
with PrivatBank clients. Consequently, 
we closed more branches than initially 
expected – 58 out of 93 – and reduced 
PrivatBank employee numbers by c.50%, 
which contributed to a significant reduction 
in PrivatBank operating costs, down 
44.6% q-o-q in 2Q15 despite only having 
effect for last 50 days in 2Q15. Active 
liability optimisation measures resulted in 
a significantly reduced Cost of Funding 
to 5.3% in 2Q15 (7.5% in 1Q15). We 
reported PrivatBank stand-alone figures 
until its full integration in May 2015. 
In May 2015 – we announced the 
completion of the full integration of 
PrivatBank, in under five months 
compared to our initial integration 
estimate of nine to 12 months. Integration 
costs totalled GEL 2.6 million as of 
30 June 2015, less compared to our 
expectation of up to GEL 3 million. 
We anticipate annualised pre-tax 
administrative and funding cost synergies 
to reach c.GEL 29 million – above our 
pre-announced GEL 25 million – as a 
result of GEL 18.5 million synergy in 
operating expenses compared to pre-
announced GEL 15 million and GEL 
10.5 million synergy in cost of funds, 
slightly above the pre-announced GEL 
10 million. PrivatBank, which at the 
time of acquisition was the ninth largest 
bank in Georgia by assets, increased 
our market share in retail loans by 
4.3 percentage points and in retail 
deposits by 2.5ppts (Market data as of 
31 March 2015). The acquisition added 
c.400,000, predominantly emerging 
mass market, customers. We plan to 
leverage the enhanced capabilities 
of our Express Banking franchise to 
capture increased revenue from cross-
selling banking products to these newly 
acquired customers, who currently 
have very low product to client ratios.

Performance highlights
Corporate Banking revenue increased 
to GEL 213.3 million, up 33.5% y-o-y.
Annual growth was diversified across all 
revenue lines, with net banking interest 
income driving the majority of the increase 
since the same period last year. 
Net banking interest income was GEL 
134.9 million, up 30.8%. While the net loan 
book and the loan yield for CB were largely 
flat y-o-y, the growth in net interest income 
was primarily driven by the appreciation of 
the US Dollar, as almost 90% of corporate 
banking loans are foreign currency 
denominated, primarily in US Dollars. 
The Corporate Banking net loan 
book was GEL 2,130.4 million, down 
1.4% y-o-y. On a constant a currency 
basis, the corporate loan book declined 
by 21.0% y-o-y. Foreign currency 
denominated loans grew slightly by 1.9% 
y-o-y, while local currency denominated 
loans decreased considerably by 
22.9% y-o-y, reflecting the appreciation 
of the US Dollar during the year.
Corporate Banking client deposits 
increased significantly to GEL 1,848.0 
million, up 55.8% y-o-y. Growth on 
a constant currency basis was 34.2% 
y-o-y. The mix of client deposits by 
currency showed the same dynamics 
and drivers in 2015, as for our loan 
book, resulting in 35.0% increase in local 
currency denominated deposits, reaching 
GEL 777.3 million, compared to 75.5% 
increase in foreign currency denominated 
deposits, reaching GEL 1,070.8 million.
Our current account balances have 
increased significantly during 2015, 
reflecting our focused efforts on 
maintaining high liquidity levels, particularly 
in local currency. This is also reflected in 
increased cost of current accounts and 
demand deposits to 2.1% in 2015, up 
from 1.5% a year ago. The increase was 
primarily driven by an increase in cost 
of local currency denominated current 
accounts and demand deposits to 4.0%, 
up from 2.2% a year ago, while we reduced 
cost on foreign currency denominated 
current accounts and demand deposits. 
As a result, at the end of 2015, total current 
accounts and demand deposits reached 
GEL 1,386.3 million, up 74.5% y-o-y, of 
which local currency denominated current 
accounts and demand deposits were GEL 
601.5 million, up 58.9% y-o-y and foreign 
currency denominated, mostly US Dollar, 
current accounts and demand deposits 
were GEL 784.8 million, up 88.7% y-o-y. 
Our Corporate Banking net fee and 
commission income increased to GEL 
31.1 million, up 25.5% y-o-y. Our net 
banking foreign currency gain increased 
significantly in 2015, reflecting increased 
volatility of the GEL/US Dollar exchange 
rate during these periods. As a result, we 
recorded net banking foreign currency 
gain of GEL 38.1 million, up 53.5% 
Corporate banking recorded NIM 4.5%, 
flat y-o-y. NIM reflected a growing Loan 
Yield, which was 10.7% in 2015, up 10 
bps y-o-y. This was partially offset by the 
increasing Cost of Client Deposits, which 
was 3.4% in 2015, up 50 bps y-o-y, largely 
as a result of a more expensive Georgian 
Lari deposits as described above.
Operating expenses were well 
contained in 2015, increasing slightly 
to GEL 51.9 million, up only 5.9% y-o-y. 
With the devaluation driven increase in 
revenue, this resulted in a very strong 
Cost to Income ratio of 24.3% in 2015 
and positive operating leverage of 27.6 
percentage points y-o-y. Slight increase 
in operating expenses was partially driven 
by salaries and other employee benefits 
of GEL 33.8 million in 2015, up GEL 0.6 
million or 1.9% y-o-y, mainly reflecting 2.0% 
y-o-y decrease in cash bonuses and ESOP, 
related to lower loan origination during 
the year and administrative expenses 
which increased to GEL 13.2 million 
in 2015, up GEL 2.2 million or 20.5%, 
reflecting increase in occupancy and 
rent expenses mostly driven by US Dollar 
appreciation against the local currency. 
Cost of credit risk was GEL 55.7 million in 
2015, up 33.4%, and Corporate Banking 
Cost of Risk was 2.3% compared to 
1.7% a year ago. As a result, Corporate 
Banking profit reached GEL 86.3 million 
in 2015, up 51.6% y-o-y. Our strategic 
goal for Corporate Banking in 2015 
was to reduce concentration risk in the 
corporate lending and improve its ROAE. 
As a result of this strategy, concentration 
of top ten corporate banking clients 
was reduced to 12.4% in the end of 
2015, down from 15.7% a year ago. 
Corporate Banking achieved ROAE 
of 16.4% as of 31 December 2015, a 
significant improvement compared to 
11.7% a year ago. This result reflects 
our continuous efforts to increase ROAE 
of Corporate Banking business, as 
well as the effect of the devaluation.
As a result of the recently announced 
combination of our Corporate Banking 
and Investment Management businesses 
into a Corporate Investment Banking 
business (CIB), we expect to grow our 
fee income, further improve the Bank’s 
ROAE and reduce the concentration 
risk in the corporate lending portfolio. 
Reflecting this change, the Group will 
report CIB business results separately 
starting in the first quarter 2016.

The AUM of the Investment 
Management segment increased to 
GEL 1,373.1 million, up 33.7% y-o-y. 
This includes Wealth Management clients’ 
deposits and assets held at Bank of 
Georgia Custody, Galt & Taggart brokerage 
client assets and Aldagi pension scheme 
assets. Investment Management posted 
GEL 14.3 million profit in 2015 compared 
to GEL 11.5 million in 2014. Net fee and 
commission income of GEL 3.2 million 
compared to GEL 8.8 million in 2014.
Wealth Management deposits 
increased to GEL 1,023.3 million, up 
27.1% y-o-y, growing at a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.4% over 
the last five-year period. On a constant 
currency basis, deposits decreased by 
0.6% y-o-y on the back of a 70 bps decline 
in the Cost of Client deposits to 4.8% in 
4Q15. The decrease was partially due 
to Wealth Management focus switching 
from deposits to bonds, as a number 
of bond issuances, yielding higher rates 
than deposits by Galt & Taggart, were 
offered to Wealth Management clients.
As of 31 December 2015, the amount 
of the Bank’s Certificates of Deposits 
issued to Investment Management 
clients increased to GEL 589.8 million, 
up 28.0% compared to 31 December

Performance highlights
For full year 2015, GHG reported record 
results and strong growth, supported both 
organically and as a result of a number of 
acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. 
Revenue reached GEL 242.7 million, 
implying growth of 22.5% y-o-y. The 
revenue growth was primarily driven by 
healthcare services business, which 
reported revenue of GEL 195.0 million, up 
32.5% y-o-y with impressive 17.3% organic 
growth, and the remaining 15.2% growth 
was contributed from recent acquisitions. 
The medical insurance business also 
contributed GEL 55.3 million to total 
revenue, while recording a decrease of 
20.8% y-o-y which was primarily driven 
by an anticipated shift in the structure of 
State-financed healthcare programmes.
Healthcare services revenue growth 
of 32.5% y-o-y was primarily driven by 
referral hospitals, which posted GEL 
168.5 million revenue in 2015, up 36.6% 
y-o-y and driven by strong organic 
growth and acquisitions. Organic revenue 
growth of 17.3% was largely sourced 
from government-funded healthcare 
programmes. Medical insurance claims 
increased as Georgian Lari devaluation 
against the US Dollar drove the prices of 
drugs up, which represent c.21% of our 
medical insurance claims. To address 
the second driver, GHG has adjusted the 
pricing of medical insurance products 
and it is expected to have positive impact 
gradually, with the renewal of existing 
contracts or new sales at adjusted 
prices. Additionally, GHG is renegotiating 
prices for drugs with pharmaceutical 
distributors, leveraging its combined 
scale from claims on drugs in its medical 
insurance business and purchases of 
drugs and other medical disposables 
for its healthcare services business.
GHG’s margins improved as a result of 
the increased utilisation and scale of 
the business, as well as management’s 
continued focus on efficiency and the 
ongoing integration of recently acquired 
healthcare facilities, with a 15.8% increase 
in COGS lagging behind 22.5% growth 
in revenues. In 2015 operating expenses 
increased only 17.7% y-o-y, resulting 
in a positive operating leverage of 4.8 
percentage points y-o-y. GHG delivered on 
its EBITDA margin target three years ahead 
of time (GHG targeted c.30% healthcare 
services business EBITDA margin by 
2018). Healthcare services EBITDA 
margin reached 27.4% for the full year. 
As a result, strong margin performance 
translated into GHG EBITDA of GEL 56.1 
million in full year 2015, up 52.3% y-o-y.
The increase in depreciation and 
amortisation costs was primarily driven 
by the acquisitions completed during the 
past year. The increase in net interest 
expense was a result of increased 
borrowings throughout the year raised 
for financing acquisitions and growth 
projects. However, net interest expense 
is expected to decrease significantly, as 
a total of GEL 104.4 million of borrowings 
were prepaid at year end 2015 and 
beginning of 2016 from IPO proceeds, 
reducing borrowings to GEL 105.6 million 
by the end of January 2016. As a result 
of prepaying the borrowings, GHG’s net 
debt to EBITDA was zero, due to cash and 
bank deposits exceeding borrowings. 
 
As a result, GHG’s 2015 profit reached 
GEL 23.6 million, up 78.1% y-o-y for the 
period. The adjusted profit
1
 was GEL 28.0 
million, which reflects currency exchange 
adjustment relating to the proceeds 
received from the capital raise and the 
positive impact of utilising some of the 
proceeds to reduce the Group’s existing 
indebtedness by GEL 104.4 million to GEL 
105.6 million as at 31 January 2016.
By the end of 2015, GHG operated 45 
healthcare facilities, of which 16 were 
referral hospitals, 19 were community 
hospitals, and 10 were ambulatory clinics. 
This compares to 28 healthcare facilities, 
of which five were referral hospitals, 20 
were community hospitals, and five were 
ambulatory clinics as of 31 December 
2012 – a remarkable three-year growth 
story. Total beds operated were 2,670, 
of which 2,209 were beds at referral 
hospitals and 461 were beds at community 
hospitals and market share by number 
of beds was 26.6%. The number of 
insured clients was 234,000 and GHG’s 
market share in medical insurance was 
38.4% based on net insurance premium 
revenue, as at 30 September 2015.
1. Adjusted net profit excludes the effect of the IPO. 
The adjusted profit includes add back for a 
non-recurring one-off FX loss as well as an add 
back of one quarter interest expense released 
through prepayment of debt at the end of 2015 
and in January 2016. 84   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Governance
Dear Shareholders,
Our Board is committed to excellence in corporate governance. 
We see robust corporate governance as fundamental to the 
effective management of the business and a principal contributor 
to the long-term success of the Group, creating trust and 
engagement between the Group and our stakeholders. 
The Board provides leadership of the Group within a framework of 
controls which enables risks to be assessed which allows us to 
put the human and financial resources in place that we believe will 
optimise the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives and 
increase shareholder value. We seek to create an environment in 
which transparency, honesty, integrity and fairness are valued and 
practised by our employees every day. This inclusive environment 
helps us attract, retain and develop the best talent. The Group is 
committed to its customers and clients and works hard to act 
ethically and responsibly in all of its business dealings. 
In this part of the Annual Report, we explain our governance 
policies and practices and the measures that we have taken to 
ensure that the Group continues to apply high standards of 
corporate governance. 
The key themes of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 form 
the framework for discussing our corporate governance structure. 
As such, our approaches to Leadership and Effectiveness are 
outlined on pages 93 to 96, Accountability on page 99 of this 
Governance Report, Shareholder engagement on page 106 and 
Remuneration on pages 107 to 123. Given the importance of the 
work of the Nomination, Audit, Risk and Remuneration 
Committees, each Committee presents a separate report, which 
can be found within this section.
Our governance framework is reviewed and benchmarked against 
recent Code developments, FRC guidance and best practice each 
year.
Among the key corporate governance actions taken during the 
year, we would like to highlight the following:
• We continued our focus on Board succession planning and 
strengthened our Board with the appointment of a new 
Independent Non-Executive Director, Hanna Loikkanen, in June 
2015 in line with our Board Diversity Policy. We see our Board 
as a team comprised of individuals each having an area of 
expertise, but who collectively engage in the full range of issues 
facing the Group.
• We successfully completed our Group restructuring and 
implemented our executive management development plan, 
which has been a principal focus for us over the past several 
years. Succession planning is developing talent that can 
succeed.
• We continued our focus on our systems of risk management

Non-Executive Director

and internal control, assisted by our Audit and Risk 
Committees. 
• We retained Lintstock Ltd. (Lintstock) to conduct a formal 
evaluation of each Director’s skills and contribution and that of 
the Board as a whole and its Committees. We used the 
independent review to compare last year’s results to this year’s 
in order to ensure that the priorities set last year were followed 
through in 2015. 
• Our Board and management continued to engage extensively 
with our investors, reflecting our commitment to transparent 
reporting and dialogue.
We see maintaining good governance and improving it as an 
ongoing process, and plan to continue to adapt our governance 
framework as our business, strategy and the environment in which 
we operate evolves. We view new regulations and guidance as an 
opportunity for our Board and Committees to upskill and expand 
their capabilities.

Compliance Statement
Responsibility for good governance lies with the Board. 
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2015 and to the 
date of this Annual Report, we applied the Main Principles 
and complied with the Provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 save for Section D.1.1, which 
recommends a three-year vesting period for all shares 
granted as part of remuneration. As described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy on pages 107 to 123, shares granted as discretionary 
compensation vest over a two-year period following the work 
year for which the discretionary compensation was earned. 
However, our overall remuneration package is weighted 
heavily to deferred share compensation and includes deferred 
salary shares which vest over a five-year period following the 
work year. As a result, the average vesting period for deferred 
share compensation exceeds the Code’s recommended 
minimum of three years. 
The Code and associated guidance is published by the 
Financial Reporting Council and is available at 
www.frc.org.uk.

Governance
The role of the Board
Our principal duty, collectively, is to promote the long-term 
success of the Group by directing management in creating and 
delivering sustainable shareholder value. We do this by setting the 
Group’s core values and strategy and overseeing its 
implementation by management. We also set the Group’s key 
policies and review management and financial performance. The 
framework of controls and procedures that we have established 
allow risk to be assessed and managed effectively. While our 
ultimate focus is long-term growth, the Group also needs to deliver 
on short-term objectives and we seek to ensure that management 
strikes the right balance between the two.
We are mindful of our wider obligations and consider the impact 
our decisions will have on the Group’s various stakeholders, such 
as our employees, our shareholders, our customers and clients, 
the environment and our community as a whole. 
In order to ensure that we meet our responsibilities, specific  
key decisions have been reserved for approval by the Board.  
A full formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for  
the Board can be found on our website, at 
http://bgeo.com/page/id/67/schedule-of-matters-reserved-for-the-
board.
Clearly defined roles of the Chairman, CEO and 
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Chairman, CEO and Non-Executive Directors  
has clearly defined roles within our Board structure.  
A description of these roles can be found on our website,  
at http://bgeo.com/page/id/66/roles-and-responsibilities.
Operation of the Board
We schedule in person Board meetings at least four times a year 
in Georgia, for a period of two to three days each time. We also 
hold meetings at our London offices, with Directors either 
attending in person or via teleconference. Matters which require 
decisions outside the scheduled meetings are dealt with through 
additional ad hoc meetings and conference calls. In addition, in 
2015, all Directors attended our annual investor day. In total, we 
met formally as a Board 12 times during the year. The Board also 
passed written resolutions on five separate occasions.
At each regularly scheduled meeting, we receive reports from the 
Group Chairman, BGEO CEO, CFO of JSC BGEO Group and the 
Bank, Bank CEO on the performance and results of the Group. 
The CEOs of our principal subsidiaries and the Deputy CEOs of 
the Bank regularly update the Board on the performance, strategic 
developments and initiatives in their respective segment 
throughout the year. The Bank’s Chief Risk Officer, Group General 
Counsel and Group Head of Investor Relations also regularly 
present to the full Board. The Board also receives updates from 
Group operating functions on internal control and risk 
management, compliance, internal audit, human resources and 
corporate responsibility matters.
There is an annual schedule of rolling agenda items to ensure that 
all matters are given due consideration and are reviewed at the 
appropriate point in the financial and regulatory cycle, although 
this is flexible to enable pressing matters, when they arise, to be 
dealt with in a timely manner. 
The Chairman and BGEO CEO seek input from the Non-Executive 
Directors ahead of each Board meeting in order to ensure that any 
particular matters raised by Non-Executive Directors are on the 
agenda to be discussed at the meeting. In addition, the Chairman 
meets with the CEO after each meeting to agree the actions to be 
followed up and to discuss how effective the meeting was.
The Chairman and CEO also maintain frequent contact (in person 
or otherwise) with each other and the other Board members 
throughout the year outside of the formal meetings.
Board Committees
To assist the Board in carrying out its functions and to ensure 
there is independent oversight of financial, audit, internal control 
and risk issues, review of remuneration as well as oversight and 
review of Board and executive succession planning, the Board has 
delegated certain responsibilities to Board Committees. 
In 2015, the Board had four Committees, comprised solely of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors: the Nomination Committee, 
the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee. Each Board Committee has agreed Terms of 
Reference, which are approved by each Committee and the Board 
and reviewed annually. Each Committee’s Terms of Reference can 
be found on our website at 
http://bgeo.com/page/id/70/terms-of-reference.
 
The Chairman of each Board Committee reports to the Board on 
the matters discussed at Board Committee meetings. You will find 
later in this section reports from the Chairman of each Board 
Committee on the Committee’s activities in 2015 and priorities for 
2016.
In addition, each Board Committee provides a standing invitation 
for any Non-Executive Director to attend Committee meetings 
(rather than just limiting attendance to Committee members).

Please further note that the Non-Executive Members of the Board of BGEO are identical to the Members of the Supervisory Board of the 
Bank.
Board size, composition, tenure and independence
We consider that a diversity of skills, backgrounds, knowledge, 
experience, geographic location, nationalities and gender is 
important to effectively govern the business.
The Board and its Nomination Committee work to ensure that the 
Board continues to have the right balance of skills, experience, 
independence and Group knowledge necessary to discharge its 
responsibilities in accordance with the highest standards of 
governance.
During 2015, our Board comprised nine members: the Chairman, 
the CEO and seven Independent Non-Executive Directors. We 
believe our overall size and composition to be appropriate, having 
regard in particular to the independence of character and integrity 
of all of the Directors as well as the key technical expertise and 
skills in banking, risk, finance, technology and international 
business the Directors bring to their duties. No individual or group 
of individuals is able to dominate the decision-making process and 
no undue reliance is placed on any individual. The average tenure 
of our Non-Executive Directors is 3½ years. We value diversity and 
are committed to increasing the proportion of female 
representation on our Board in accordance with our Board 
Diversity Policy, adopted last year. In 2015, when we refreshed our 
Board, we appointed Hanna Loikkanen as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director and we continue to interview female 
candidates for independent Non-Executive Board appointments. 
We have assessed the independence of each of the seven 
Non-Executive Directors and are of the opinion that each acts in 
an independent and objective manner and therefore, under the 
Code, is independent and free from any relationship that could 
affect their judgement. Each Non-Executive Director has an 
ongoing obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances 
which could impair his or her independence.
Details of the individual Directors and their biographies  
are set out on pages 86 and 89.
Evaluation of Board performance
The Board continually strives to improve its effectiveness and 
recognises that its annual evaluation process is an important tool 
in reaching that goal. As mentioned in the Governance Statement, 
in 2015, we engaged Lintstock, an external effectiveness 
evaluation specialist, for the second year in a row to conduct an 
evaluation of the Board, each of our Committees, our Chairman 
and our CEO. In 2015, we added a dedicated succession planning 
questionnaire.
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary to set the context for the 
evaluation and to tailor the content of the surveys distributed to the 
Board. All Directors were requested to complete an online survey. 
The anonymity of all respondents was ensured throughout the 
process in order to promote the open and frank exchange of 
views. 96   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which was shared with 
all members of the Board, addressing the following areas of Board 
performance:
• the composition of the Board, taking into account the Group’s 
strategic goals and diversity priorities;
• the relationships between the members of the Board and 
between the Board and management, as well as the 
atmosphere in the boardroom;
• the management of time of the Board, including the annual 
number of meetings, work cycle, the Board’s agenda, as well 
as the content, format and timeliness of the Board packs;
• the support and training needs of the Directors;
• the clarity of the Group’s strategy, the Board’s testing and 
development of the strategy and the effectiveness with which 
the opinions of stakeholders are considered when drawing up 
the strategic plan;
• the risk appetite of the Board, the information provided to the 
Board to support its oversight of risk, and performance of the 
Board in identifying and managing the main risks facing the 
Group;
• the structure of the Group at senior level, the succession 
planning for the CEO and key management positions beneath 
the Board;
• the Board’s exposure to management and the ability of the 
Board to evaluate senior management; and
• the composition and performance of the Committees, the 
performance of the Chairman and CEO.
Lintstock also provided the Chairman with feedback received in 
respect of the performance of other Directors. Mr Janin 
subsequently met individually with each of the Directors to discuss 
the results and set strategic goals for improvement where 
necessary. The performance of Mr Janin was also reviewed, with 
the results discussed openly with the Board. 
The results of the evaluation confirmed that the Board and the 
Committees were operating effectively, promote open and 
challenging debate and is well supported by information flow. 
Progress had been made in improving gender diversity on the 
Board, executing the Group’s strategy and succession planning for 
executive management, enhancing our systems of risk 
management and internal control and successfully integrating the 
Risk Committee. No significant changes to the commitments of 
the Chairman or Non-Executive Directors were identified.
As a result of Lintstock’s report and subsequent Board discussion 
of the findings, we have set the following objectives for 2016: 
continued monitoring of the execution of our Investment Business 
strategy, development of a longer-term strategy, the appointment 
of one additional female member to our Board and continued 
oversight of risk management and internal controls.
We have found the external evaluation process to be helpful in 
improving the performance of our Board and it is envisaged that 
Lintstock will conduct a follow-up review next year, in order to 
build upon the issues raised in this year’s process in greater depth. 
The review content for each subsequent evaluation is designed to 
build upon learning gained in the previous year to ensure that the 
recommendations agreed in the review are implemented and that 
y-o-y progress is measured.
The CEO also has his performance individually reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee against KPIs which are set annually 
(further details of the KPIs can be found on pages 44 to 45).
Succession planning and Board appointments
We believe that effective succession planning mitigates the risks 
associated with the departure or absence of well-qualified and 
experienced individuals. We recognise this, and our aim is to 
ensure that the Board and management are always well resourced 
with the right people in terms of skills and experience, in order to 
effectively and successfully deliver our strategy. We also recognise 
that continued tenure brings a depth of Group-specific knowledge 
that is important to retain. 
The Board Nomination Committee is responsible for both Director 
and executive management succession planning. There is a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new Directors to the Board. More detail on the role and 
performance of the Nomination Committee is on pages 97 and 98.
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment
On appointment, our Non-Executive Directors are given a letter of 
appointment that sets out the terms and conditions of their 
directorship, including the fees payable and the expected time 
commitment. Each Non-Executive Director is expected to commit 
approximately 25 to 35 days per year to the role. An additional 
time commitment is required to fulfil their roles as Board 
Committee members and/or Board Committee Chairmen, as 
applicable. We are confident that all Non-Executive Directors 
dedicate the amount of time necessary to contribute to the 
effectiveness of the Board. The Letters of Appointment for our 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at our 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
Board induction, ongoing training, professional 
development and independent advice
On appointment, each Director takes part in an induction 
programme, during which he meets members of senior 
management below the Board level, receives information about 
the role of the Board and individual Directors, each Board 
Committee and the powers delegated to these Committees. He is 
also advised of the legal and other duties and obligations of a 
Director of a premium listed company. 
We are committed to the continuing development of our Directors 
in order that they may build on their expertise and develop an 
ever-more detailed understanding of the business and the markets 
in which Group companies operate. All of our Directors 
participated in ongoing training and professional development 
throughout 2015, which included briefings, site visits, development 
sessions and presentations by our Company Secretary, members 
of management, external speakers and our professional advisors. 
We also ensure that all of our Directors have access to 
independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, on 
any matter relating to their responsibilities.
Re-election of Directors
All of our Directors seek re-election every year and accordingly all 
Directors will stand for re-election in 2016 (with the exception of 
Hanna Loikkanen, who is standing for election, as she was 
appointed in June 2015). The Board has set out in its Notice of 
Annual General Meeting the qualifications of each Director and 
support for re-election and election, as applicable.

Dear Shareholders,
Succession planning for the Board, taking into account 
gender diversity; succession planning for senior 
management; and the facilitation of an external valuation of 
the effectiveness of our Board as a whole, our Committees 
and individual Directors were again the key areas of focus of 
the work of the Nomination Committee during 2015. 
In 2015, we made significant progress in implementing our 
senior management succession plan in line with our revised 
strategy. We also appointed a female Independent 
Non-Executive Director to the Board in line with the Board 
Diversity Policy we adopted in 2014, making good on our 
commitment to increase female representation on our Board. 
Details of these changes are discussed below.
As discussed on pages 95 and 96, we appointed Lintstock as 
our external evaluator for the second year in a row. This 
appointment assisted us to measure our performance y-o-y 
and set priorities for continued improvement.

The role of the Nomination Committee
The role of the Nomination Committee is to assist in ensuring that 
the Board comprises individuals who are best able to discharge 
the responsibilities of Directors, having regard to the highest 
standards of governance, the strategic direction of the Group and 
diversity aspirations of the Board. We also help to ensure that the 
Group appoints excellent senior managers capable of successfully

• reviewing the composition of the Board and Board Committees 
to ensure they are appropriately constituted and balanced in 
terms of size, skills, experience, independence and knowledge;
• identifying suitable candidates for appointment to the Board 
based on clearly set criteria which takes into account the skills, 
experience and diversity required by the Board, and the

Succession planning, Board Diversity Policy and Board 
recruitment and appointment process
Succession planning
With respect to Board succession planning, the Nomination 
Committee continued to search for suitable candidates for Board 
positions in 2015, taking into account technical expertise and our 
Board Diversity Policy, outlined later in this section. In June 2015, 
we appointed one additional Independent Non-Executive Director, 
Hanna Loikkanen, to the Board. Ms Loikkanen brings in a wealth 
of experience in banking and investment management and we are 
pleased to welcome her to the Board. Her biography can be found 
on page 89. 
Upon completion of our Group restructuring in August 2015 to 
separate our banking and non-banking businesses, we 
implemented changes in our senior management structure in 
order to complement the new strategy announced in December 
2014. As succession planning is a continuous process, in 
December 2015, the Committee further analysed the Group’s 
execution of strategy and the skills of management and made 
additional changes, effective 1 February 2016, in order to best 
utilise management talent.  98   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Directly below is a summary of the implementation of our senior 
management succession plan.
• Irakli Gilauri was appointed as Group CEO and resigned from 
his position as CEO of the Bank;
• Murtaz Kikoria resigned from his position as CFO of the Bank 
and assumed the position of CEO of the Bank;
• Levan Kulijanishvili was appointed as CFO of JSC BGEO Group 
and the Bank (in addition to his role as Head of Internal Control, 
Security and AML Compliance);
• Archil Gachechiladze was appointed as Deputy CEO 
(Corporate and Investment Banking) following the combination 
of the Bank’s Corporate Banking and Investment Management 
businesses; 
• Avto Namicheishvili was appointed as General Counsel of JSC 
BGEO Group;
• Tornike Gogichaishvili was promoted to the role of Deputy CEO 
(Operations), having previously served as Chief Operating 
Officer of the Bank; and
• Alexander (Sasha) Katsman was promoted to the role of Deputy 
CEO (Human Resources and Brand Management), having 
previously served as Head of Brand Management. 
We believe our internal promotions reflect the increasing strength 
of our executive management team and strong results of the 
coaching and development programmes we have implemented 
over the past few years.
Board Diversity Policy
The statement and objectives of our Board Diversity Policy are as 
follows:
Statement
Our Board embraces diversity in all its forms. Diversity of skills, 
background, knowledge, technical expertise, and gender, 
amongst other factors, will be taken into consideration when 
seeking to appoint a new Director to the Board. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, any Board appointment will always be made based 
on merit.
Objectives
• The Board should ensure the appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to ensure an effective Board.
• The Board should ensure that it comprises a majority of 
Directors who are independent in character and judgement.
• The Board aims to increase the number of women on the 
Board to two within the next two years and further increase this 
number thereafter.
Board recruitment and appointment process
The Board has formal, thorough and transparent procedures in 
place for Board recruitment and appointment.
In identifying suitable candidates, we typically seek 
recommendations from trusted advisors but may also use open 
advertising or external search services to facilitate the recruitment. 
We carefully assess each candidate against our objectives and 
Board Diversity Policy, and take care that appointees have enough 
time available to devote to the position.
Short-listed candidates are generally seen first by the Chairman, 
the BGEO CEO and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. If 
the selection process progresses further, each potential candidate 
is invited to meet other members of the Nomination Committee as 
well as members of management. We then decide whether to 
recommend an appointment to the Board and the Board decides 
whether to make the appointment.
Committee effectiveness review
It is the Nomination Committee’s responsibility to organise the 
Board, Committee and individual Director performance reviews. In 
2015, the Nomination Committee recommended, and the Board 
approved, the re-appointment of Lintstock. Details of the process, 
results and 2016 action plan can be found on pages 95 and 96.
Lintstock also performed the effectiveness review of the 
Nomination Committee in respect of 2015. The evaluation 
principally addressed how effectively the Nomination Committee 
reviews the composition of the Board and the Board Committees 
as well as how the Nomination Committee develops and 
implements succession plans for both the Board and executive 
management. The evaluation concluded that the Nomination 
Committee continues to operate and perform effectively. 
For 2016, the Nomination Committee will continue its focus on 
Board succession planning by monitoring the needs of the Board 
and its Committees to ensure that both new additions and 
successions are managed in line with the evolving business, 
strategic objectives, the Board’s gender diversity and regulatory 
requirements. In particular, we have identified accounting or IFRS 
experience and additional female representation as key priorities in 
our Board successon plan. 
We will also continue to grow the talent of our management 
through coaching and development programmes, which we have 
found to enhance self-development and mentoring skills, resulting 
in the further development of potential future leaders within the 
Group. The Nomination Committee will also continue to meet with 
senior managers in order to gain greater understanding of the 
breadth and depth of management talent.

statement is provided on page 124 confirming that the Board 
considers the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is

necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s and BGEO’s 
performance, business model and strategy. The statement of 
disclosure of information to our auditor is also set out on page 124.
Risk management and internal control
The BGEO Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework. The BGEO Board, 
which is assisted by the Audit Committee and Risk Committee, 
confirms that it monitors the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems and carries out a review of their effectiveness, at 
least annually. The monitoring and review covers all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls.
A discussion of BGEO’s risk management and internal control 
framework can be found on pages 46 to 47.
Since the Bank is the Group’s largest business and operates in the 
complex financial services sector, its risk management framework 
and internal control processes are key to that of the Group. 
A detailed description of the Bank’s risk management 
framework and internal control processes can be found on 
pages 52 to 59. 
The BGEO Board also confirms that it has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and how we 
mitigate these risks and uncertainties are outlined on pages 
48 to 51.
The BGEO Board has determined that having separate Audit and 
Risk Committees, each with specific Terms of Reference, assists it 
in creating an effective risk management framework and provides 
the challenge and review necessary across the Group. The 
Committees collaborate with one another, as appropriate, to 
ensure that matters of mutual interest raised in either of the 
Committees are discussed. 
The Audit Committee Report and Risk Committee Report can 
be found on pages 100 to 105 of this section. In addition, Note

provides additional detail regarding risk management and 
internal control procedures. 100   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Dear Shareholders,
Our activities focus on the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting and processes. In 2015, both our Group and the 
environment in which it operates continued to evolve. The 
devaluation of the Lari in the first half of the year required our 
focus on loan loss allowances and the provisioning process, the 
most important and significant area of judgement affecting our 
results. 
In light of the updates to the Code in respect of risk management 
and internal controls, we spent time last year ensuring that 
additional requirements introduced by the Code were met by the 
Group. We improved the risk management framework and 
processes and systems of internal control. We worked closely 
with the Risk Committee to ensure that the responsibility for the 
oversight of our risk management processes and internal 
controls were appropriately covered between the two 
Committees. We also dedicated particular attention to our IT and 
information security controls and instructed EY to perform an 
audit of our IT and information security systems, which included 
a review of our cyber-security controls. 
I am also pleased to announce that Hanna Loikkanen was 
appointed to the Committee in March 2016. She has served on 
audit committees of other financial institutions and will be a great 
asset to our Committee going forward.
I invite you to read about the results of these and the other main 
activities of the Committee in the report below.

Chairman of the  
Audit Committee
Composition of the Audit Committee and meetings
The composition of the Audit Committee and the members’ 
attendance during the year is listed on page 95. Our Audit 
Committee is solely comprised of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
With respect to the Audit Committee’s qualifications and 
background, Mr Morrison is a trained securities lawyer who 
specialised in financial disclosure for over 25 years; 
Mr Kiknavelidze is a trained financial analyst skilled in financial 
statement analysis who manages his own investment fund; 
Mr Bradley served as a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs, 
where, immediately prior to joining the Company’s Board and 
Audit Committee, he sat on various audit committees within the 
organisation and assessed internal audit functions and internal 
controls. Our Audit Committee believes that each member has 
recent and relevant financial experience in satisfaction of the 
requirements of the Code. 
The biographies of the members of the Audit Committee are set 
out on pages 86 and 89.
The Audit Committee works to a planned programme of activities 
focused on key events in the annual financial reporting cycle and 
standing items that it considers regularly under its Terms of 
Reference. Our meetings are regularly attended by the CFO of JSC 
BGEO Group and the Bank, head of Internal Audit, head of Internal 
Control, Security and AML Compliance and Risk departments, 
Chief Risk Officer of the Bank and occasionally by the BGEO and 
JSC BGEO Group CEO and Bank CEOs. The external auditor also 
attends the regularly scheduled Audit Committee meetings. 
Separately, we had regular private sessions with the heads of 
Internal Audit and Internal Control, Security and AML Compliance 
departments and the external auditor. These sessions, which are 
not attended by management, allow us to discuss any issues of 
concern in more detail and directly with the audit teams. From time 
to time, other members of management are invited to attend 
meetings in order to provide a deeper level of insight into key 
issues and developments.
Meetings of the Audit Committee take place prior to the Board 
meeting in order for the Audit Committee to report its activities and 
matters of particular relevance to the Board.
Mr Morrison attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that may be raised on the Audit Committee’s activities.
Key purpose and responsibilities
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee encourages and 
seeks to safeguard high standards of integrity and conduct in 
financial reporting, internal control and risk management (together 
with the Risk Committee), internal audit and the supervision of our 
external auditor. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on 
how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations 
to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year.
The primary roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
remained the same as in 2014, save for changes adopted in 
response to amendments to the Code. The Audit Committee’s full 
Terms of Reference are available on our website at http://bgeo.
com/uploads/pages/audit-committee-terms-of-reference3-64.pdf. 
Financial reporting
We carried out our primary responsibilities to monitor the integrity 
of the financial statements of the Group and formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance as 
well as review the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policies and their quality and consistency. We assessed the clarity 
and consistency of disclosures, including compliance with relevant 
financial reporting standards and other reporting requirements. We 
also reviewed and challenged the going concern assessment and 
viability statement.
In addition to analysing and discussing reports received by 
management throughout the year, the Audit Committee met 
frequently with management and the external auditors. Meetings 
with the external auditors often occurred without management 
present. In these meetings, we discussed accounting and 
reporting matters affecting the Group, including the new 
presentation of the Group’s income statement, the change in 
functional currency and the upcoming adoption of IFRS 9.
In addition, the meetings with the external auditors involved 
discussions of the key risks identified by the external auditors as 
being significant to the 2015 audit. Taking into account the key 
audit risks identified by our external auditors, but also using our 
own independent knowledge of the Group, we reviewed and 
challenged where necessary, the actions, estimates and 
judgements of management in relation to the financial statements.  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   101

Additional 
information
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Audit 
Committee in relation to the financial statements are addressed 
below.
Appropriateness of allowance for loan losses
In 2015, we continued to scrutinise the appropriateness of the 
allowance for loan losses. As mentioned in last year’s Annual 
Report, the Bank introduced a new loan loss provisioning 
methodology on 1 January 2014, which was developed in 
consultation with Deloitte. This provisioning methodology, 
which the Bank continued to use in 2015, is based on a 
statistical assessment of probability of default and loss given 
default. 
In 2015, slower economic growth, the devaluation of the Lari 
and the acquisition of PrivatBank led to deterioration in our loan 
book quality. These factors led to increases in our Banking 
Business Cost of Risk ratio and cost of credit risk. In response, 
provisioning levels were increased on both the corporate and 
retail loan books to account mainly for the increased post-
devaluation risk. The main judgements in respect of the 
appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses involved the 
timing of the recognition of any given impairment and the size of 
the loan loss. Throughout the year, management reported on 
the Bank’s principal borrowers as well as on the largest 
impaired and non-performing loans. Management also reported 
to us on the methodologies for identifying assets at risk, 
categorising the loan portfolio and determining provisioning 
rates, as well as the assumptions applied in calculating the 
provisions for loan losses. In connection with these reports, we 
challenged the underlying assumptions made by management 
with respect to individually and collectively impaired loans and 
the system of controls to prevent and detect errors in the 
estimation for loan losses. 
In conclusion, we were satisfied that the impairment provisions 
were appropriate. The disclosures relating to impairment 
provisions are set out in Note 10 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
Valuation of own premises and investment properties
We received reports from management on the assumptions to 
be used in valuing the Group’s premises and investment 
properties. The Group engaged Colliers International Georgia 
(Colliers), an independent external valuer, to value 52 of our 
properties, which covered approximately 60% of our portfolio. 
EY tested the Colliers valuation of our premises and investment 
properties and reported its findings. We discussed the results 
of the Colliers and EY findings. We scrutinised and challenged 
management assumptions and judgements and were satisfied 
with the assumptions and judgements applied. The disclosures 
relating to the valuation of own premises and investment 
properties are set out in Note 30 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
In addition to the primary judgements discussed above, we also 
discussed accounting and financial reporting matters relating to: 
our M&A/transactional activity, including valuation of options, 
convertible shares and goodwill; revenue recognition in our 
healthcare business; the new presentation of the Group’s income 
statement; the change in functional currency; the classification of 
non-recurring income and expenses; GHG listing costs; and the 
upcoming adoption of IFRS 9.
Risk management and internal controls
The Audit Committee recognises that a strong and effective 
system of risk management and internal control. Although the 
Board assumes the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework, its work is supported 
by both our Committee and the Risk Committee. 
Please see pages 46 to 47 for a description of the BGEO risk 
management framework and internal control processes.
Since the Bank is the Group’s largest business and operates in the 
complex financial services sector, its risk management framework 
and internal control processes are key to that of the Group. 
A detailed description of the Bank’s risk management 
framework and internal control processes can be found on 
pages 52 to 59. 
The Risk Committee Report is set out on pages 104 to 105.
In relation to risk management and internal control, the Audit 
Committee: 
• ensures that there are clearly defined lines of accountability and 
delegation of authority;
• reviews the effectiveness of the policies and procedures and 
systems for risk management and internal control related to:
 – financial reporting, which includes challenge of management 
judgements and estimates;
 – whistleblowing;
 – conflicts of interest (including assistance to the Board with 
reviewing the permissibility of such conflicts; and
 – anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies and procedures.
• monitors various areas of operational risk, including 
investigations into control weaknesses and management’s 
response to such findings, including:
 – IT and information security (including cyber-security);
 – corporate security and similar areas of operational risk; and
 – internal and external fraud or misconduct.
The Audit Committee is supported by a number of sources of 
internal assurance within the Group in order to discharge its 
responsibilities, including reports from and regular discussions 
with the Group executives with whom it regularly meets as 
described earlier in this Report. We receive internal audit’s reports 
on the control environment and, as mentioned later in this Report, 
we approve the internal audit plan which, for 2015, included a 
thorough risk management and internal control assessment. 
During 2015 and up to the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts, internal audit did not find any significant weaknesses in 
risk management or internal controls. We challenged the reports 
by management and internal audit and requested data regarding 
the application of controls for various types of transactions 
affecting the relevant account balances in the financial statements. 
With respect to external assurance, the Audit Committee reviews 
the external auditors’ observations on risk management and 
internal financial controls identified as part of its audit. As the 
quality of the Group’s financial statements are dependent on the 
effectiveness of our internal IT and information security control 
systems, we approved the engagement of EY to perform an 
external audit of our IT governance, IT processes and information 
security controls in order to obtain external assurance on the 
design and operating effectiveness of these systems. This audit 
also confirmed that our IT and information security control systems 
are effective. Data security and privacy procedures were found to 
be strong, although cyber-security was noted as (and continues to 
be) a significant risk.
Based on the above, we are satisfied that our overall internal 
control framework is effective.  102   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
We have asked management to implement a plan to further 
improve our IT strategy and architecture in order to make sure that 
the data and reports produced by our IT and information security 
systems continue to ensure that our financial statements are 
prepared to a high quality. There will be ongoing focus on controls 
to prevent an information security breach or cyber-attack given the 
changing nature of potential threats. We will continue to monitor 
these systems in 2016.
The Audit Committee has also considered and confirmed to the 
Board that its work is performed in accordance with the provisions 
in the Code and the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) 
associated Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee monitors the scope, extent and effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function and the internal audit 
programme and we seek to ensure it is adequately resourced, has 
the correct standing within the Group and is focused on the 
correct issues. Following the assessment of the internal audit 
function in 2014, the Audit Committee approved a larger budget 
for 2015, which allowed our IT audit function to be partially 
outsourced, staff to be hired and continued training and 
development to be provided for the internal audit team.
We also review and approve the internal audit policy and annual 
internal audit plan. The 2015 internal audit plan focused on 
assessed risks and internal controls and we reviewed the plan on 
a regular basis, including any changes proposed to the scope of 
work. We also discuss and approve changes to the internal audit 
methodology.
Although the Board retains overall responsibility for the internal 
control and the identification of and management of risk, the 
internal audit function provides independent assessment on the 
robustness and effectiveness of the systems and processes of risk 
management and control across the Group.
In 2015, 66 audit assignments were undertaken by the Internal 
Audit Department, covering a wide range of financial reporting and 
operational controls, IT and IS systems and risk management 
processes. We received regular reports from internal audit on its 
audit activities, progress of the internal audit plan, the results of 
any unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these 
issues and resource requirements of the Internal Audit 
Department. We also reviewed and monitored management’s 
responsiveness to internal audit’s findings through follow-up 
reports provided by internal audit. The Head of Internal Audit has 
direct access to the Audit Committee and the opportunity to 
discuss matters with the Audit Committee without other members 
of management present.
We reviewed internal audit’s self-assessment of its performance 
and independently formed our own view of the internal audit 
function by considering the progress of internal audit against the 
agreed plan, the quality of the reporting by internal audit to the 
Audit Committee and the ability of internal audit to address 
unsatisfactory results. On this basis, we concluded that the 
internal audit function is effective and respected by management 
and conforms to the standards set by the Institute of Internal 
Auditors. 
External audit
With respect to our responsibilities for the external audit process 
on behalf of the Board, we:
• approve the annual audit plan, which includes setting the areas 
of responsibility, scope of the audit and key risks identified;
• supervise the audit engagement, including the degree to which 
the external auditor was able to assess key accounting and 
audit judgement;
• review the findings of the external audit with the external 
auditor, including the level of errors identified during the audit;
• monitor management’s responsiveness to the external auditor’s 
findings and recommendations; 
• review the content of the management letter issued by the 
external auditor;
• review the qualifications, expertise and resources of the 
external auditor;
• monitor the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and 
compliance with ethical, professional and regulatory 
requirements;
• review audit fees and the cost effectiveness of the audit; 
• monitor the rotation of key partners in accordance with 
applicable legislation; and 
• recommend the appointment, re-appointment or removal, as 
applicable, of the external auditor.
We have an established framework for assessing the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. This includes:
• a review of the audit plan, including the materiality level set by 
the auditors and the process they have adopted to identify 
financial statement risks and key areas of audit focus;
• regular papers and communications with the external auditor to 
both the Committee and management;
• regular discussions with EY (without management present) and 
management (without EY present) in order to discuss the 
external audit process;
• a review of the final audit report, noting key areas of auditor 
judgement and the reasoning behind the conclusions reached;
• a review of EY’s 2015 Transparency Report and the annual FRC 
Audit Quality Inspection Report of EY; and
• a formal questionnaire issued to all Committee members and 
senior management of the Group who are involved in the audit 
(including internal audit) which covers among other items things 
the quality of the audit and audit team, the audit planning 
approach and execution, the presence and capabilities of the 
lead audit partner, the audit team’s communication with the 
Committee and management and the auditor’s independence 
and objectivity.
In 2015, we received an Audit Quality Inspection Report from the 
Audit Quality Review team of the FRC in respect of EY’s 2014 audit 
of the Group. The FRC provided us with a copy of their report 
which has been reviewed and discussed by the Audit Committee 
and separately with the external auditor. The Audit Committee is 
satisfied that the matters raised do not give it concerns over the 
quality, objectivity or independence of the audit and believe that 
the matters raised in the FRC Report have been appropriately 
addressed by EY in the 2015 audit.
Following our assessment of the external auditor, we formed our 
own judgement (which was consistent with management’s view) 
and reported to the Board that:
• the audit team was sound and reliable, providing high-quality 
execution and service;
• the quality of the audit work was of a high standard;
• EY’s independence and objectivity were affirmed; 
• EY was in a position to challenge management on its approach 
to key judgements; and
• appropriate discussions were held with the Audit Committee 
during the audit planning process.
We have sought assurance and are comfortable that no undue 
pressure has been asserted on the level of audit fees so as to 
ensure that there is no risk to audit work being conducted 
effectively.

Lead audit partner rotation and audit tendering
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group every five years. The current lead audit 
partner, Andrew McIntyre, has been in place for four years. He has 
confirmed that he will not be returning as our lead auditor in 
respect of the 2016 audit. 
We have been monitoring audit regulatory developments from the 
FRC, Competition Commission and EU, which require us to put 
our external audit contract out to tender no later than 2022. EY 
was appointed as our Group statutory auditor by shareholders at 
our 2012 AGM, following a competitive tender process. The Audit 
Committee and Board have recommended the re-appointment of 
EY each year since 2012, which has been approved by 
shareholders. We fully support the re-tendering requirements and 
will carry out a competitive tender process prior to the 2022 
deadline. The Committee has complied with the relevant parts of 
the Competition and Market Authority Final Order on the statutory 
audit market for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Non-audit services
We have a long-established policy in relation to the supply of 
non-audit services by external auditors and, in particular, we 
refrain from using our external auditors to provide tax advisory 
services unless there is a very strong case for not seeking an 
alternative supplier. We engage external advisors to provide 
non-audit services based on the skills and experience required for 
the work. When engaging our external auditors under the limited 
circumstances detailed in our policy, prior to the engagement 
commencing, BGEO is required to satisfy itself that the external 
auditor’s objectivity and independence would not be compromised 
in any way as a result of supplying non-audit services. All non-
audit services are pre-approved by the Audit Committee and 
communicated to the Board. Any permissible non-audit service 
that exceeds £100,000 must be robustly justified and, if 
appropriate, tendered, before it is approved. If non-audit services 
are undertaken by the external auditor, the Audit Committee 
receives regular reports on such non-audit services so that it can 
monitor the types of services being provided and the fees 
incurred. The Group’s current Non-Audit Services Policy was 
reviewed and approved in March 2016 and can be found on our 
website at http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/policy-on-nonaudit-
services-32.pdf.
In 2015, EY provided certain non-audit services to the BGEO 
Group including: assurance services in respect of our IT 
processes; FATCA advice; the provision of comfort letters for 
creditor covenants; and employee training. The value of these 
non-audit services was US$ 155,000. In preparation for GHG’s 
listing, due to EY’s extensive knowledge of GHG, the GHG Board 
decided that EY was best placed to undertake the considerable 
amount of work required in the short time-frame in the preparation 
for listing. As a result of this, for the year ended 31 December 
2015, a total of US$ 1,295,000 non-audit fees were incurred for 
EY’s services in relation to the listing of GHG which are not 
expected to re-occur in the future. Therefore, both EY and the 
Audit Committee do not consider that this work
compromises the independence of the external auditors.
EY has expressed its willingness to continue as auditor of the 
Group. Separate resolutions proposing its re-appointment and 
determination of its remuneration by the Audit Committee will be 
proposed at the 2016 AGM.
Whistleblowing, conflicts of interest and anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption policies and procedures
The Audit Committee ensures that there are effective procedures 
relating to whistleblowing. In particular, we have developed a 
Whistleblowing Policy which allows staff to confidentially raise any 
concerns about business practices. We keep this policy under 
review and receive regular updates from management as to any 
issues raised by employees. 
We have also developed a Conflicts Authorisation Policy through 
which we assess actual and potential conflicts of interest and 
assist the Board in its review of the permissibility of such conflicts.
The Audit Committee also keeps under review the Group’s 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and procedures and 
receives reports from management on a regular basis in relation to 
any actual or potential wrong-doing. There were no significant 
findings in 2015.
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised Code, the Directors are required to 
assess the viability of the Group. In collaboration with the Risk 
Committee, we spent time considering the timeframe over which 
the viability statement should be made as well as an assessment 
underlying the period of coverage, which we agreed should be 
three years, which corresponds to the Group’s business planning 
cycle. In particular, we looked closely at the Group’s current 
financial position, including allocated capital expenditure and 
funding requirements, future prospects, the principal risks and 
uncertainties related to financial reporting, risk management and 
internal control as well as the downside stress testing. We 
discussed our analysis with the Risk Committee, management and 
full Board. The viability statement is set out on page 47.
Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
Having been tasked by the Board to advise it, we examined the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts to consider whether they are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
We did this by satisfying ourselves that there was a robust process 
of review and challenge at different levels within the Group to 
ensure balance and consistency. We reviewed several drafts of the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts and directly reviewed the 
overall messages and tone of the Annual Report with the CEO and 
CFO. We also considered other information regarding the Group’s 
performance and business presented to the Board during the 
period, both from management and the external auditor. After 
consideration of all of this information, we are satisfied that, when 
taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Committee effectiveness review
For the second year in a row, the performance review of the Audit 
Committee was externally facilitated by Lintstock. The 2014 
Committee evaluation identified that Committee members would 
like to enhance the review of internal and external auditor 
effectiveness, finalise the division of responsibilities with the Risk 
Committee and continue to focus on loan loss provisioning and 
our internal controls relating to information security (including 
cyber-security) and IT risk. The 2015 Committee effectiveness 
evaluation, performed in March 2016, largely mirrored the 2014 
review in order to allow a direct comparison of performance. In 
addition, the 2015 evaluation added quality of financial reporting, 
the assessment of the Group’s IT and information security systems 
and internal financial reporting controls as well as risk 
management within the scope of the Audit Committee’s 
responsibilities. The effectiveness evaluation concluded that the 
Audit Committee operates and performs effectively. 
In 2016, we will work with the Nomination Committee and seek to  
appoint an individual with accounting or IFRS expertise to the 
Board and Audit Committee as well as continue to remain focused 
on the Group’s IT and information security systems, in particular, 
cyber-security. 104   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Group’s Risk Committee Report. 
As our Group continues to grow, our Risk Committee and the 
Group leadership recognise that the risks facing the Group 
need to be supported by an increasingly robust and dynamic 
system of risk management and internal controls. 
As mentioned in the Accountability section on page 99, the 
Board determined in early 2014 that having separate Audit 
and Risk Committees, each with specific Terms of Reference, 
would provide additional scope and breadth necessary to 
better measure and address risk across the Group. In 2015, 
we continued to work closely with the Audit Committee. 
Some topics are considered by both Committees from their 
different perspectives, which we believe enhances our 
governance and risk oversight. Two of our Risk Committee 
members are also members of the Audit Committee.
In 2015, our focus followed our mandate. We assisted the 
Board in setting the Group’s risk appetite and exposure in 
order for the Group to achieve its strategic objectives and in 
making any necessary modifications to the strategy given 
changing economic conditions and risk environment. We also 
monitored the Group’s risk exposure and actions to address 
risk, which included oversight and support of our senior 
management risk team. We recognise that risk evolves, and 
since its formation, the Committee has sought to create a 
dynamic environment whereby Committee members, other 
Board members and senior management are encouraged to 
escalate any concerns they may have and propose issues for 
discussion. As you will read in the following pages, a key risk 
addressed directly by our Committee during the year was the 
decline in the value of the Lari and its effect on our loan book.
Together with the Audit Committee, we also devoted time 
ensuring that the new requirements introduced by the Code in 
respect of risk management and internal controls were met by 
the Group and reviewed the processes supporting the 
assessment of the Group’s longer-term solvency and liquidity 
which underlie the new viability statement.
Our Committee is comprised of five Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. I invite you to read more about our 
work in the following report.

Kim Bradley
Chairman of the  
Risk Committee
Key purpose and responsibilities
The purpose of the Risk Committee is to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to the oversight of risk and to 
provide advice in relation to current and potential future risk 
exposures. This includes reviewing the Group’s risk appetite and 
risk profile and assessing the effectiveness of the risk 
management framework. 
The key responsibilities of the Risk Committee are to: 
• support the Board to ensure that risk appetite and exposure 
are addressed as part of strategy; 
• oversee the risk management infrastructure and process and 
its effectiveness;
• support the Board in monitoring risk exposure and the 
implementation of our strategy to address risk;
• oversee, support and evaluate the risk management roles of 
our senior management risk team; 
• encourage and ensure open and broad discussion on 
perceived risk concerns and responsive efforts to mitigate 
when necessary; and
• assess the adequacy and quality of the risk management 
function in conjunction with the Audit Committee and the 
effectiveness of risk reporting within the Group.
The principal risk categories overseen by the Risk Committee 
include reputational, geopolitical, macro-economic and market, 
liquidity and capital, credit and certain operational risks (other than 
those overseen by the Audit Committee) within the Group. As to 
credit risk, our focus is principally on forward-looking matters.
The Risk Committee’s full Terms of Reference are available on our 
website at http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/risk-committee-terms-
of-reference2-48.pdf. 
Composition of the Risk Committee and meetings
The composition of the Risk Committee and the members’ 
attendance during the year is listed on page 95. Our Risk 
Committee is solely comprised of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
The biographies of the members of the Risk Committee are set out 
on pages 86 and 89.
Our meetings are regularly attended by the Chairman of the Board, 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee, BGEO and JSC BGEO 
Group CEO, Bank CEO, JSC BGEO Group and Bank CFO, Chief 
Risk Officer and occasionally by our head of Internal Audit and our 
external auditor. From time to time, other members of 
management are invited to attend meetings in order to provide a 
deeper level of insight into key issues and developments. In 
addition, non-Committee Board members are also invited to 
attend. 
At each meeting, the Risk Committee receives detailed reporting 
which provides an analysis of: the Group’s overall risk profile using 
both quantitative models and risk analytics, key risk exposures 
and management actions, performance against risk appetite, the 
emerging and potential risks the Group may face, the drivers of 
risk throughout the Group as well as analyses of down-side stress 
testing scenarios. The underlying assumptions, methodology 
applied and results of such stress testing are challenged by the 
Risk Committee. In 2014, we recommended changes to the 
content of reporting by management and also requested additional 
stress scenarios and key assumptions, which were all 
implemented in early 2015.  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   105

Meetings of the Risk Committee take place prior to the Board 
meeting in order for the Risk Committee to report its activities and 
matters of particular relevance to the Board.
Risk Committee activities during 2015
In addition to our regular responsibilities, we spent time focusing 
on the evaluation of the design, completeness and effectiveness of 
the risk management framework focusing on the requirements of 
the Code, the FRC guidance in respect of risk management and 
the needs of our businesses. 
As mentioned in last year’s Annual Report, our priorities in 2015 
included close monitoring of the US Dollar-denominated loan book 
covered by Lari income; the integration of PrivatBank; and the 
implementation of investment business strategy. We monitored 
each of these risks very closely throughout the year with the rest of 
the Board and management. We also ensured that the Audit 
Committee assessed operational risk associated with IT and 
cyber-security in accordance with our agreed division of 
responsibilities.
In 2015, the Group saw an increase in NPLs in respect of US 
Dollar-denominated loans covered by Lari income as a result of 
slower economic growth, the devaluation of the Lari and the 
PrivatBank acquisition. We monitored this very closely. For our 
retail loan book (especially mortgage loan), we discussed with 
management actions that might be taken to reduce our risk, 
including the offering of loan restructuring options to certain retail 
customers, and followed closely the evolution of NPLs. In the end, 
very few customers chose to restructure their loans and default 
rates were not materially affected, principally due to relatively low 
loan to value ratios in our mortgage book, retail customers’ 
preference to save in US Dollars and the increase in US Dollar 
foreign remittances. 
Despite approximately 85% of our corporate loan book being 
denominated in US Dollars, more than 50% of customers with US 
Dollar loans have income in US Dollars. We saw that the majority 
of our corporate customers were able to continue servicing their 
loans due to increased oil prices and stable inflation rates, despite 
the devaluation in the Lari. We closely monitored NPL levels and  
management’s actions to assure adequate coverage of our loan 
loss exposure, including the increase in our NPL coverage ratio 
during the year, from 67.5% as of 31 December 2014 to 83.4% as 
of 31 December 2015. In the second half of 2015, we discussed 
and agreed with management a plan to decrease our corporate 
lending as well as reduce the concentration of our top 10 
corporate banking clients as part of our strategy to rebalance our 
loan book in favour of lower-risk retail loans. 
We closely followed management’s work on the integration of 
PrivatBank and were pleased that it was executed so smoothly – 
five months ahead of schedule and at a cost that was significantly 
less than expected. We also monitored the development of NPLs 
in the PrivatBank portfolio and were satisfied that increasing NPLs 
and provisions did not materially impact the important overall 
benefits of the acquisition.
We monitored execution risk associated with the GHG IPO on the 
premium segment of the London Stock Exchange and were 
pleased that, in the face of turbulent market conditions, the 
transaction was successfully completed in November 2015, raising 
gross proceeds of approximately US$ 100 million, which is critical 
to GHG’s development plans. For the real estate business, we 
monitored completion risk and pre-sales to ensure that projects 
were proceeding as planned.
In 2014, the Committee recommended changes to the content of 
reporting by management, management responsibilities and 
reporting lines to the Committee, all of which were adopted. In 
2015, we reviewed these changes and were pleased with the 
outcomes.
We have also assisted in formulating the Group viability statement 
in conjunction with the Audit Committee and management. 
The viability statement can be found on page 47.
We also carefully reviewed the principal risks and uncertainties 
disclosure and other relevant risk management disclosures for 
inclusion in this Annual Report. 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and a discussion 
of how we mitigate these risks and uncertainties are outlined 
on pages 48 to 51.
Committee effectiveness review
In 2014, due to the Risk Committee’s recent formation, we decided 
to assess our own effectiveness internally. However, in 2015, an 
externally facilitated review of the Risk Committee was performed 
by Lintstock. The evaluation principally addressed the composition 
of the Risk Committee, the division of responsibilities between the 
Risk and Audit Committees, the alignment of risk appetite with 
Group strategy, the oversight of the risk management 
infrastructure and process and the effectiveness of the risk 
management function. The evaluation concluded that the 
Committee operates and performs effectively. 
Our priorities for 2016 include ensuring that both the reduction of 
our corporate loan book exposure and operational risks in our 
investment business are monitored and executed in keeping with 
our Group strategy. We will also continue to focus on loan quality 
in relation to the US Dollar-denominated loan book. 106   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Shareholder engagement
The Company has a comprehensive shareholder engagement 
programme and maintains an open and transparent dialogue with 
existing and potential shareholders, a responsibility that the 
Company takes very seriously. 
The Board’s primary contact with institutional shareholders is 
through the Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, CEO and Head of Investor Relations, each of whom 
provide a standing invitation to shareholders to meet and discuss 
any matters they wish to raise. Our Committee Chairmen also 
make themselves available to answer questions from investors.
We formally communicate with our shareholders via our AGM, 
Annual Report and Accounts, Half-Year Report and Interim 
Management Statements. These are supported by a combination 
of presentations and telephone briefings. Over the course of the 
year, we met with over 200 institutional investors, and participated 
in more than 20 investor conferences and road shows around the 
world. Our Directors and management met with shareholders in 
the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States, Singapore and 
South Africa. 
At our 2015 AGM, we received just over 12% of votes against our 
resolution to authorise the Company to call general meetings on 
not less than 14 days’ clear notice. We have decided that we will 
not propose this resolution to our shareholders at our 2016 AGM.
In November 2015, BGEO hosted an investor day in London, 
which was open to all investors. This investor day provided the 
opportunity for investors to receive an update from the Board and 
executive management on strategy and performance as well as 
meet informally with the full Board and raise matters of interest. 
BGEO was pleased to host 50 investors at our investor day.
In addition to our shareholders, we meet and present to analysts 
throughout the year and hold regular meetings with the Group’s 
existing lenders and actively engage with potential lenders to 
discuss our funding strategy. Our Company Secretary also has 
ongoing communication with the shareholders’ advisory groups.
The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Board 
understands the views of major stakeholders. The full Board is 
regularly kept informed of these views by the Chairman as well as 
executive management and the Investor Relations team and, to the 
extent deemed appropriate, issues raised at these meetings have 
been adopted by the Group. Informal feedback from analysts and 
the Group’s corporate advisors is also shared with the Board.
In December 2015, we replaced our previous website,  
www.bogh.co.uk with a new and enhanced website,  
www.bgeo.com, which ensures that our stakeholders can access 
the Group’s results, press releases, investor presentations, analyst 
reports, details on our corporate governance and corporate and 
social responsibility framework, our leadership, as well as other 
information relevant to our stakeholders. We also ensure that 
shareholders can access details of the Group’s results and other 
news releases through the London Stock Exchange’s Regulatory 
News Service. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   107

Annual Statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholders,
The discretionary remuneration of our CEO, Irakli Gilauri, is always 
one of our Committee’s most important decisions. It conveys to 
our shareholders our sense of the Group’s performance and 
prospects, how Mr Gilauri has performed, and of course, how the 
Committee rewards that performance. Although the discretionary 
compensation of senior management is not part of our formal 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, our views of the Group’s 
performance and prospects are generally also reflected in senior 
management discretionary compensation decisions, of course 
always dependent on how each senior manager performs in 
respect of his KPIs. 
As mentioned in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
although the Committee and the Board rated the overall 
performance of Mr Gilauri as excellent, which would have meant a 
discretionary bonus award at or near maximum opportunity as per 
our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Mr Gilauri requested that his 
actual bonus should be notably less. Mr Gilauri was concerned that 
2015 could be a considerably more difficult year than 2014, so as a 
demonstration to the Group of the need for cost discipline, he felt 
that he and the group of senior officers he leads should take a lower 
discretionary bonus. His suggestion was met with overwhelming 
support by the senior officers. The Committee also accepted that 
view. As a result, the Committee ultimately awarded Mr Gilauri 
discretionary compensation of 25,000 shares, representing 27% of 
total salary and 55% of his maximum opportunity. 
Despite the Lari devaluation and challenging macro-economic 
conditions, 2015 was another record year for the Group. It met or 
exceeded its strategic objectives as described in the Strategic 
Report of this Annual Report and achieved an all-time low cost to 
income ratio. Mr Gilauri also met or exceeded all of his objective 
and non-tangible KPIs. The Committee and the Board again rated 
Mr Gilauri’s overall performance in 2015 as excellent and although 
Mr Gilauri’s austerity in 2014 was commendable, the Committee 
strongly felt that he deserved a discretionary award near maximum 
opportunity. As a result, the Committee agreed to award Mr Gilauri 
47,000 shares, representing 46% of total salary and 92% of his 
maximum opportunity.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
What is in this report? 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report describes the 
implementation of BGEO’s remuneration policy for Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors and discloses the amounts 
earned relating to the year ended 31 December 2015. 
The report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report has been 
prepared in line with the recommendations of the Code and 
the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by 
shareholders in a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and took 
formal effect from the date of approval and will apply until the 
2017 AGM, at which time we will be required to submit our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval by shareholders. 
A summary of our policy has again been included in this 
report (set out on pages 117 to 123) for the purposes of clarity 
and transparency.  
The Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (set out on pages 107 to 108) and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (set out on pages 109 to 123) will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
I am also pleased to report that the Committee met all of its 
priorities set for 2015, as set out below:
• the Bank signed a new Service Agreement with Mr Gilauri on 
24 August 2015, which will become effective on 1 May 2016. 
The new Service Agreement reflects the terms of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and ensures that the combination of the 
substantial number of deferred salary shares and the potential 
to earn discretionary shares of a significant value keeps 
Mr Gilauri highly motivated and aligned with shareholders;
• new contracts were signed with six of our senior officers whose 
contracts were coming up for renewal. Although not required, 
the terms of the contracts are also in line with our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy;
• we increased the number of our Committee meetings and 
implemented a more formal review cycle; 
• we enhanced our review of the performance of senior and 
middle management; and 
• we improved the exchange of information with the full Board.
At the 2015 AGM, our Directors’ Remuneration Report was 
approved by nearly 94% of shareholders, further affirming that our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy is the right one – striking a balance 
between rewarding achievement and aligning the interest of 
executive management with our shareholders in order to promote 
the long-term success of the Group.

1. The Remuneration Committee and its advisors
The Remuneration Committee considers matters relating to executive management remuneration and remuneration for other senior 
management. The Remuneration Committee’s full Terms of Reference are available on our website at
http://bgeo.com/uploads/pages/remuneration-committee-terms-of-reference-29.pdf.
The composition of the Committee and the members’ attendance at meetings during 2015 is listed on page 95. 
In addition to the formal meetings held during the year, the Committee participated in various discussions by telephone outside of 
these meetings.
Other attendees at Committee meetings who provided advice or assistance to the Committee on remuneration matters from time to time 
included the CEO, Bank CEO, the other Board members and General Counsel. Attendees at Committee meetings do not participate in 
discussions or decisions related to their own remuneration.
The Committee seeks advice from time to time from independent remuneration advisers. In 2015, we again engaged H2Glenfern to 
review our disclosure and advise on our discussions with shareholder advisory groups. H2Glenfern voluntarily operates in accordance 
with the Code of Conduct of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the United 
Kingdom. H2Glenfern has confirmed that it has adhered to the Remuneration Consultant Group’s Code of Conduct throughout the year 
for all remuneration services provided to BGEO and the Committee has therefore satisfied itself that all advice provided by H2Glenfern 
was objective and independent. H2Glenfern was paid a fixed fee of £5,880 for its remuneration consultancy services and does not 
provide services to the Group other than remuneration advice. 
The Committee also received advice from Baker & McKenzie LLP, its legal advisors, on compliance and best practice.

3. Directors’ remuneration
3.1 Single total figure of remuneration for the sole Executive Director (audited)
The table below sets out the remuneration received by BGEO’s sole Executive Director, Irakli Gilauri, for 2015 and 2014 in respect of his 
employment with BGEO and the Bank. Mr Gilauri is not entitled to any remuneration in respect of his role as Chairman of either GHG PLC 
or JSC GHG or any other subsidiary within the Group.
Mr Gilauri’s February 2013 contract provides for cash and deferred share salary compensation fixed at 2013 levels. In addition, Mr Gilauri 
is entitled to discretionary deferred share compensation up to a maximum of 50% of total salary (including both the cash and deferred 
salary components). This figure was agreed in connection with the increase in the absolute market value of Mr Giauri’s fixed 
compensation (cash and deferred share salary) in 2013.
Approximately 83% of Mr Gilauri’s compensation for 2015 set forth in the table below is in the form of deferred shares, for which the 
average vesting period exceeds three years.

Notes:
1 BGEO and Bank cash salaries are expressed in US Dollars but paid in GBP and Lari, converted into the respective currency as described in Note 2 of the table in section 1 of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 109 of this Annual Report. Accordingly, there may be variations in the numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
2 Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of the BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year. For both 2014 and 2015, 
the award was 90,000 BGEO shares. The value is calculated by reference to the share price of US$ 21.71 (based on the official share price of £14.06 per share converted 
into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5443, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England) as at 19 February 2013, the date the 2013 contract was 
signed. Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the year to which the 
award relates (the “work year”) even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract. The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an 
explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are described in section 1(a) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 119 of this Annual Report. 
3 Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figures show the value of BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of bonus awards in the relevant year. 
For 2015, options were awarded over 47,000 BGEO shares. The value is calculated by reference to the share price on 12 February 2016 which was US$ 23.39 (based on 
the official share price of £16.18 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.4458, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on 
the same date). For 2014, options were awarded over 25,000 BGEO shares. The value is calculated by reference to the share price on 19 March 2015 which was US$ 26.17 
(based on the official share price of £17.77 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.4727, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of 
England on the same date). The discretionary compensation in respect of the relevant years is deferred and vests as to 50% in January two years following the work year 
and 50% in January of the following year, subject to the leaver provisions described in section 8 of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 121 of this Annual Report. The 
means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 1(b) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
on page 119 of this Annual Report. The basis for determining Mr Gilauri’s 2015 discretionary awards is described in section 3.2 below. 
4 Benefits. The figures show the gross taxable value of health and disability insurance and Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. 
5 Pensions. The figures show the aggregate employer contributions for the relevant years into the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme.
6 Dividend equivalents. The figure shows the dividend value paid in respect of nil-cost options exercised in the relevant years.
7 Mr Gilauri was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.
8 No money or other assets are received or receivable by Mr Gilauri in respect of a period of more than one financial year, where final vesting is determined by reference to 
achievement of performance measures or targets relating to the relevant period.
The following table sets out details of total remuneration for Mr Gilauri for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015 and his 
discretionary compensation as a percentage of maximum opportunity. The Company does not have a LTIP and therefore the table does 
not include long-term incentive vesting rates against maximum opportunity.

Notes:
1 Single figure of total remuneration for 2013, 2014, and 2015 has been calculated in accordance with the table above. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the maximum opportunity for 
Mr Gilauri was 50% of salary.
2 In 2012, Mr Gilauri’s cash salary was US$ 437,500 and the value of the salary deferred shares was calculated by reference to the global depositary receipt (GDR) price on 
25 May 2010 of US$ 10.20 per GDR. The award of discretionary deferred shares was 30,000 BGEO shares in respect of 2012. The value is calculated by reference to the 
share price on 15 February 2013 which was US$ 21.49 per share (based on the official share price of £13.84 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate 
of 1.5525, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The maximum opportunity in 2012 was less than 50% of Mr Gilauri’s total 
remuneration. 
3 For 2011, Mr Gilauri’s cash salary was US$ 375,000 and the value of the salary deferred shares was calculated on the same basis as 2012. The award of discretionary 
deferred shares was 34,000 BGEO shares in respect of 2011. The value is calculated by reference to the share price on 6 March 2012 which was US$ 15.61 per share (based 
on the official share price of £9.92 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England 
on the same date). The maximum opportunity in 2011 was 100% of Mr Gilauri’s salary, being US$ 1,293,000. 
4 For 2010, Mr Gilauri’s cash salary was US$ 375,000 and the value of the salary deferred shares was calculated on the same basis as 2011 and 2012. The award of 
discretionary deferred shares was 20,000 GDRs in respect of 2010. The value is calculated by reference to the GDR price on 21 February 2011 which was US$ 20.50. The 
maximum opportunity in 2011 was 100% of Mr Gilauri’s salary, being US$ 1,293,000. Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   111

3.2 Basis for determining Mr Gilauri’s discretionary deferred share compensation in respect of 2015
Mr Gilauri’s KPIs include both objective and non-tangible components. The objective elements largely track the Group’s KPIs as he is 
expected to deliver on the Group’s strategy, but the KPIs also include non-tangible factors such as leadership, strategy development and 
implementation as well as corporate and social responsibility.
The following table sets out the objective KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2015 as well as Mr Gilauri’s performance against them.

The new management structure is in place, performing well and 
resulting in greater efficiencies. Recent promotions have also served 
to motivate management generally.
Management team Coaching and 
mentoring 
Met Mr Gilauri has taken this responsibility very seriously. He has 
enhanced opportunities for promotion within the Group for 
members of management that continue to upskill – in performance, 
management of others and self-development. Mr Gilauri has 
provided guidance to those members of the management team with 
the potential and drive to further grow their talent.
Self-development Continued self-
development
Exceeded Mr Gilauri has prioritised self-development, principally through 
analysis of his own management style. He identified weaknesses 
and began to successfully address them. His increased self-
awareness has resulted in him improving his own leadership skills 
and has had a very positive effect on the wider management culture.
Note:
1 As management succession planning is a continuous process, additional changes were made in February 2016 to best utilise management talent. The February 2016 
changes included the promotion of several members of management.
In terms of objective KPIs, Mr Gilauri met or exceeded all KPIs, as described above. In terms of non-tangible factors, the Committee also 
considered Mr Gilauri’s performance very strong. In 2015, Mr Gilauri continued to progress the Group’s social and environmental agenda, 
which is described on pages 60 to 69. Under Mr Gilauri’s leadership, an Environmental and Social Coordinator was hired in 2015 and 
sponsorship and charitable contributions increased, most notably to: (i) enhance access to education through Bank of Georgia University 
as well as the Chevening and Fulbright scholarship funds; (ii) support the disabled, both through increased access to the Bank’s 
branches and charitable contributions; and (iii) fund nature conservation within the country. In his personal capacity, Mr Gilauri has also 
established an education fund, sending a strong message that personal charitable contributions can also make a difference.
For 2015, the Committee found that Mr Gilauri’s performance was excellent. He met and exceeded his KPIs as outlined above. As a 
result, the Committee determined that Mr Gilauri should be awarded discretionary deferred share compensation near maximum 
opportunity. As a result, the Committee agreed to award Mr Gilauri 47,000 shares, representing 46% of total salary and 92% of his 
maximum opportunity. See section 1(b) of the summary of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 118 which describes why the 
Remuneration Committee steers away from a strict weighting of the performance measures and the discretion it retains in respect of 
determining the number of discretionary shares that may be granted. 112   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
For 2016, in respect of objective KPIs, we plan to measure Mr Gilauri’s performance against KPIs which reflect the separation of our 
Banking and Investment Businesses as well as the strategy of the Group as a whole as outlined below. Strict weighting is not imposed on 
the KPIs below for the reasons mentioned in section 1(b) of the summary of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 119.
Banking Business
• ROAE of 20%.
• Retail loan book growth of 20%.

• Growth of the value of our Investment Businesses.

Notes:
1 In 2015, Mr Gilauri exercised options in respect of 174,500 BGEO shares. Mr Gilauri’s unvested and unexercised shares include the shares granted on 2 March 2016 in 
respect of the 2014 work year. 
2  At year-end 2015, NeilCo Limited, a company wholly-owned by Mr Janin, held 10,000 BGEO shares. 
3 At year-end 2015, Gemsstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGEO shares. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and discretionary compensation 
in deferred shares. The long vesting periods, particularly for deferred salary shares (five years), result in executive management having 
large holdings of unvested shares. Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding period on 
Mr Gilauri’s or executive management’s shares. The policy naturally results in our executives holding a significant number of unvested 
shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting. We believe these results are consistent with the principles of the 
Investment Management Association.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri’s shareholding remains 539,819 BGEO shares, representing approximately 1.4% of the 
share capital of BGEO. The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds four years.
None of Mr Gilauri’s connected persons have interests in any BGEO shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGEO. Notwithstanding this, some 
Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders. There have been no changes in the Non-Executive Directors’ BGEO 
shareholdings since 31 December 2015. 
Several of our Directors chose to subscribe for shares in the GHG IPO, which closed on 12 November 2015. The following table sets forth 
the respective holdings of GHG shares of each Director as at 31 December 2015.

3.9 Mr Gilauri’s interests in Group debt securities and real estate
Directors and senior management of the Group from time-to-time will purchase debt securities or real estate from Group entities on an 
arms-length basis. In the interest of transparency, such transactions entered into by our sole Executive Director, Mr Gilauri, are described 
below.
Mr Gilauri participated in the US$ 20 million two-year bond offering by m
2
 Real Estate and the US$ 15 million two-year bond offering by 
Evex, each of which are described on page 81 of this Annual Report and Note 18 of the Accounts on page 188. Both bonds are listed on 
the Georgian Stock Exchange. As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauri has purchased US$ 243,900 worth of m
2
 Real Estate 
bonds and US$ 281,390 worth of Evex bonds.
 
On 24 December 2015, Mr Gilauri purchased an apartment in the m
2
 Real Estate Skyline Project (described on page 85 of this Annual 
Report) in the amount of US$ 519,220. Mr Gilauri purchased this apartment during the pre-sales phase on an arms-length basis. 
Pre-sales were offered to potential clients that have either requested to receive direct marketing from m
2
 Real Estate or through direct 
marketing to Solo and private wealth customers of the Bank.
3.10 Details of Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment 
Letters of appointment are entered into by BGEO with each Non-Executive Director, generally for three-year terms. The letters of 
appointment require Non-Executive Directors to provide one month’s notice prior to termination. New BGEO letters of appointment for 
each Non-Executive Director, save for Hanna Loikkanen, were signed on 10 April 2014. Ms Loikannen signed her letter of appointment on 
12 June 2015. Ms Loikkanen will be proposed for election at the AGM and all other Non-Executive Directors will be proposed for annual 
re-election at the AGM. 
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for an initial term of six years, with a maximum tenure of nine years, if their skills and 
experience continue to enhance the effectiveness of the Group and their continued appointments are deemed to be in the best interests 
of the Group. As the Group continues to evolve, the Board has and will continue to enhance its skills and will continue to improve gender 
diversity in line with its Board Diversity Policy.
The table below shows each Non-Executive Director’s date of appointment to the Board of BGEO and the Supervisory Board of the Bank.

4. Senior officer remuneration 
In addition to the CEO of BGEO and the Bank, in 2015, there were seven senior officers. These individuals include the Bank’s Deputy 
CEOs responsible for the following divisions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking and Investment Management as well as the 
CEOs of GHG and m
2
 and the Group General Counsel.
Key information regarding remuneration for senior officers is disclosed below in the interests of transparency, but the remuneration of 
senior officers is not subject to the Regulations or to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The principles and remuneration structure 
described in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy are currently applied in broadly the same way to senior officers. This means that, as for 
Mr Gilauri, senior officers receive remuneration based on two components: 
• salary, which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a five-year period; and 
• a discretionary award, payable 100% in deferred share compensation vesting over a two-year period, which is dependent on both 
Group performance and the executive achieving his KPIs.
Unlike previous years, we have not combined the table reflecting senior officer remuneration for a two-year period due to additional 
disclosure required in respect of 2015 in respect of deferred share salary. Certain senior officers signed new contracts upon expiration of 
their previous contracts and increases in deferred share compensation for these senior officers occurred during the year, which has 
required us to calculate the value of 2015 deferred share compensation using different share values. In addition, certain senior officers 
received a portion of their deferred share salary from entities within the Group other than BGEO. Details for each senior officer are listed in 
the footnotes to the 2015 table.
With respect to both 2015 and 2014, the following applies to remuneration for both years:
• Cash salary. Values are expressed in US Dollars but paid in Lari.
• Deferred share salary. Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally 
granted in January of the year following the work year even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract. The 
terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are 
described in section 1(a) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
• Discretionary deferred share compensation. The means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the 
terms and conditions are described in section 1(b) of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
• Taxable benefits, pension and dividend equivalents. See footnotes 4, 5 and 6 in the table provided in section 3.1. 116   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

2    For all senior officers, save for Mr Gamkrelidze (see footnote 9), discretionary deferred share compensation granted in 2016 in respect of the 2015 work year is in the form of 
BGEO shares, the value of which is calculated by reference to the BGEO share price on 12 February 2016 which was US$ 23.39 (based on the official share price of £16.18 
per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.4458, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). 
3 The value of deferred salary share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 per share (based on the official 
share price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same 
date). Mr Kikoria’s deferred share salary was increased from 25,000 to 35,000 in July, which became effective 1 September 2015. The value of the additional 10,000 deferred

Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary deferred 
compensation were awarded over 27,500 BGEO shares (see footnote 1).

deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 25 February 2014 which was US$ 39.79 per share (based on the official share price of £23.85 
per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.6682, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in 
respect of discretionary deferred compensation were awarded over 14,000 BGEO shares (see footnote 1).

price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). 
Mr Gomarteli’s deferred share salary was increased from 25,000 to 30,000 in July, which became effective 1 September 2015. The value of the additional 5,000 deferred 
salary shares is calculated by reference to the share price on 24 August 2015, which was US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of £16.16 per share converted into US 
Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary deferred 
compensation were awarded over 28,500 BGEO shares (see footnote 1). 
6   The value of deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 per share (based on the official share 
price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). 
Mr Gvalia’s deferred share salary was increased from 25,000 to 30,000 in July, which became effective 1 September 2015. The value of the additional 5,000 deferred salary 
shares is calculated by reference to the share price on 24 August 2015, which was US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of £16.16 per share converted into US 
Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary deferred 
compensation were awarded over 15,000 BGEO shares (see footnote 1). 
7   The value of deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 per share (based on the official share 
price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same 
date). Mr Gachechiladze’s deferred share salary was increased from 30,000 to 35,000 in July, which became effective 1 September 2015. The value of the additional 5,000 
deferred salary shares is calculated by reference to the share price on 24 August 2015, which was US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of £16.16 per share converted 
into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary 
deferred compensation were awarded over 30,000 BGEO shares (see footnote 1). 
8    The value of deferred share compensation for the first 10 months of the year is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 per share 
(based on the official share price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of 
England on the same date). Mr Namichieshvili’s service agreement with the Bank expired on 31 October 2015. He accepted a new service agreement with JSC BGEO Group 
on the same terms as his previous agreement with the Bank, which became effective 1 November 2015. As a result, the value of his deferred share salary for the last two 
months of the year is calculated by reference to the share price on 24 August 2015, which was US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of £16.16 per share converted 
into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary 
deferred compensation were awarded over 32,000 BGEO shares (see footnote 1). 
9    Mr Gamkrelidze’s deferred salary share compensation is comprised of 175,000 GHG PLC shares in respect of his employment at GHG and 55,000 BGEO shares in respect 
of services rendered to the Group in relation to the GHG IPO. The value of the 175,000 GHG shares is calculated by reference to a share price US$ 1.16 per share, which 
corresponds to EY’s determination of the value of such shares as at 1 April 2015 (prior to the listing of GHG PLC). The value of the 55,000 BGEO shares is calculated by 
reference to two different share prices. The value of 25,000 BGEO shares is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 per share 
(based on the official share price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of 
England on the same date) and the value of 30,000 BGEO shares is calculated by reference to the share price on 17 December 2014 which was US$ 29.34 per share (based 
on the official share price of £18.76 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5643, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England 
on the same date). Options in respect of discretionary deferred compensation were awarded over 237,500 GHG shares, the value of which is calculated by reference to the 
GHG PLC share price on 15 February 2016 which was US$ 2.53 per share (based on the official share price of £1.74 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange 
rate of 1.4552, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date).
10  On 1 September 2015, Mr Burdiladze’s 2013 service contract with the Bank was transferred to m2 and on 1 November 2015, he accepted a new service agreement with 
m2 on the same terms as his previous agreement with the Bank, save for the increase in deferred salary shares to 30,000, as described below. The value of deferred share 
compensation in respect of 25,000 salary shares for the first 10 months of the year is calculated by reference to the share price on 18 February 2013 which was US$ 21.36 
per share (based on the official share price of £13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by 
the Bank of England on the same date). Mr Burdiladze’s deferred share salary was increased from 25,000 to 30,000 in July, which became effective 1 September 2015. The 
value of the additional 5,000 deferred salary shares prior to commencement of his new service agreement with m2 on 1 November 2015 is calculated by reference to the 
share price on 24 August 2015, which was US$ 25.43 per share (the official share price of £16.16 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being 
the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The value of his 30,000 deferred salary shares for the remaining two months of the year is also 
calculated by reference to the share price on 24 August 2015 as described directly above. Options in respect of discretionary deferred compensation were awarded over 
32,000 BGEO shares (see footnote 1). Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   117

5. Committee effectiveness review 
An externally facilitated review of the Committee was performed by Lintstock. The evaluation principally addressed the composition of the 
Committee, the structure and effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy and the performance evaluation process. The effectiveness 
evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate and perform effectively. 
Our priorities for 2016 include the commencement of discussions regarding the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be 
proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM. We are also carefully monitoring the performance of senior management against 
expanded self-development and mentoring KPIs and are enhancing the scope of management performance evaluations. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(which has not been amended) is valid for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM and will not be presented to shareholders for 
approval at the 2016 AGM. In the pages that follow, we have provided a summary of the key provisions of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy in order to provide context to the discussion of the implementation of the policy in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
107 to 123. Please refer to the 2013 Annual Report for the full text of the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which is also available 
on our website, http://bgeo.com/page/id/1/annual-reports. There will be no significant changes between the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and its implementation in 2016.
Mr Gilauri entered into a new contract with the Bank, which will take effect on 1 May 2016. The terms of the contract are consistent with 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.  118   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

talent.
•  Reflective of the Executive 
Director’s duties to each of BGEO 
and the Bank, respectively.
Deferred share salary
•   Fixed compensation in the form of

•  Reviewed upon renewal of the service contract.
•  There is no provision for the recovery or withholding of cash salary.
Deferred share salary
•   Awarded annually over the number of BGEO shares under the terms of the 
service contract with the Bank (currently 90,000 per annum for Mr Gilauri 
under his contract with the Bank).
•  Reviewed upon renewal of the service contract.
•  Awards are formally granted in January of the first year following the work 
year, and vest as to 20% in January of each of the second, third and fourth

•   There is no provision for the recovery or withholding of deferred share salary.
Discretionary 
deferred share 
compensation
•  Annual performance-based 
compensation paid entirely in the

Notes:
1 A discussion of how we implemented the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2015 is set out on pages 107 and 123.
2 BGEO cash salary is converted from US Dollars to Sterling at the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on each monthly payment date. Bank cash salary is 
converted from US Dollars to Lari at the exchange rate published by the National Bank of Georgia on each bi-weekly payment date.
3 At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options), the Executive Director receives (in addition to the vested shares) cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the 
underlying shares between the date the award was made and the vesting date. Dividend equivalents are paid in Lari as at the date dividends were paid to other shareholders. 
4 Work year refers to the year following the year to which the award relates.
(a) Salary 
The deferred share salary comprises the most important element of the Executive Director’s fixed annual remuneration and is 
commensurate with his role within the Group. By heavily weighting the base salary to deferred share compensation rather than cash, the 
Executive Director’s day-to-day actions are geared towards sustained Group performance over the long term. The deferred share salary 
component is neither a bonus nor a LTIP: it is salary fixed at the outset of each three-year service contract and is therefore not subject to 
performance targets or measures. That salary, however, increases or declines in value depending on Group performance over the 
five-year vesting period, aligning the Executive Director’s interests directly and naturally with those of shareholders. 
(b) Discretionary deferred share compensation 
The Group does not operate a LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation. No cash bonuses are paid to Executive Directors. Instead, individual and Group performance 
is rewarded through an award of discretionary deferred share compensation that vests over the two years following the work year. As 
discretionary deferred share compensation is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any 
performance measures over the period from award to vesting.
The aggregate pool of shares available each year for awards of discretionary deferred share compensation for the Executive Director and 
all other members of executive management is determined annually by the Remuneration Committee in its discretion, based on a number 
of factors including:
• financial objectives (e.g. ROAE, operating leverage and Cost to Income ratio); 
• business growth objectives (e.g. net loan book growth and deposit growth and fee and commission generation); 
• risk management objectives (e.g. capital strength, liquidity management and cost of credit risk); 
• the performance of the Bank relative to its competitors in Georgia and in the light of overall global market conditions; and 
• the market value of the shares at the time the discretionary share award is determined.
 
The number of shares over which an individual Executive Director’s discretionary deferred share compensation will be granted is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the performance of the Group and the Executive Director’s KPIs, which are 
set for the Executive Director by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year and which reflect the Executive Director’s 
required contribution to the Group’s overall key strategic and financial objectives for the financial year. A description of the KPIs set for 
Mr Gilauri in respect of 2015 and his performance against these targets can be found on pages 111 and 112.
While the Remuneration Committee has defined the set of factors to determine the aggregate pool of discretionary shares and evaluate an 
Executive Director’s performance, it seeks to steer away from defining a series of narrow objectives for its Executive Directors and does not 
utilise strict weighting of performance measures. A high level of discretion is intentionally maintained when determining the quantum of 
discretionary deferred shares awarded to each Executive Director. Even in a “good” year for an Executive Director (e.g. achievement of most 
of his KPIs), in a “bad” year for the Group (e.g. poor financial performance by it) the Executive Director could receive little or no discretionary 
share compensation. 
As mentioned in the table on the previous page, the maximum value of discretionary deferred share remuneration that Mr Gilauri may be 
awarded in a given year for the remainder of his service contract with the Bank is capped at 50% of his total salary. 
(c) Equity compensation trust and dilution limits
An equity compensation trust, the Rubicon Executive Equity Compensation Trust (Trust), was established for the purposes of satisfying 
deferred share compensation awarded to Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility. In 2015, Sanne Fiduciary 
Services Limited, acting as trustee of the Trust, purchased 282,657 shares in the market. The BGEO shares currently committed to the 
Trust will partially satisfy awards in respect of the 2015 work year. We intend for Sanne to continue purchasing additional shares in the 
market, but may need to issue new shares, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of shares committed to the Trust in order to 
satisfy awards. However, the Group has committed to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share compensation 
from the time of the Company’s listing on the Premium Segment of the LSE will not exceed 10% of BGEO’s ordinary share capital over any 
10-year period.
(d) Business expenses
Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their service 
contracts, on provision of valid receipts. 
2. Legacy arrangements
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this 
Policy taking effect. The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include 
(without limitation) obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and 
benefit plans.  120   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
3. Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received on our remuneration structure each year as well as 
guidance from shareholder representative bodies, as we view 
shareholder input as key when shaping remuneration policy. We 
frequently meet with our shareholders to discuss our remuneration 
structure and engage directly with several shareholder advisory 
groups. The feedback we received is positive and our 
shareholders are widely supportive of our executive remuneration 
structure, understanding that although it varies from a typical UK 
remuneration structure in that we do not operate a LTIP or give 
cash bonuses, the absence of cash bonuses and the dominance 
of deferred share compensation in the overall remuneration 
package creates a direct and natural alignment of shareholder and 
executive management interests.  
4. Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group
The Remuneration Committee considers the pay and employment 
conditions of executive management (other than Directors) when 
determining an Executive Director’s remuneration as well as 
changes in pay and employment conditions across the Group as a 
whole in relation to the proposed pay for Directors. The 
Remuneration Committee consults with the Human Relations 
department, executive management and other employees during 
the year to seek feedback on the executive remuneration structure 
and takes such views into account when analysing its Policy. In 
2015, the employees consulted confirmed that they were satisfied 
with the manner in which they were compensated. In taking this 
information into account in determining an Executive Director’s 
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee relies on its 
judgement, particularly given that international comparisons are 
the most relevant for senior management and the Georgian labour 
market is more relevant for other employees.
5. Comparison with Remuneration Policy for employees 
generally 
The components of the remuneration package for Executive 
Directors (as provided for by the Policy) are broadly the same as 
those for non-Board members of the executive management team. 
Other members of senior management and middle management 
receive their entire salary in cash and do not receive a deferred 
share salary. Their bonuses may be either in the form of cash and/or 
shares which vest over a three-year period following the award. All 
other employees within the Group receive a cash salary and may be 
eligible to receive cash bonuses, portions of which may be deferred 
until the publication of the audited annual results for the work year 
and/or based on continuous employment with the Group. The 
deferred portion of the cash bonus may also be reduced if it is 
revealed, upon completion of the annual audit, that the annual 
results published by the department where the employee works 
were incorrect in any material respect. All employees receive a 
competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice 
and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on the same 
terms as applicable to Executive Directors. 
6. Total remuneration opportunity for our sole Executive 
Director 
The chart below shows the remuneration which Mr Gilauri, our 
sole Executive Director, could receive in respect of 2016 under the 
Policy at three different performance levels. It should be noted 
that, at the maximum level, 89% of Mr Gilauri’s 2016 compensation 
will be in the form of deferred shares for which the average vesting 
period exceeds three years. At the minimum level, 85% of 
Mr Gilauri’s 2016 compensation will be in the form of deferred 
shares for which the average vesting is just under four years.

■ Discretionary deferred share compensation
■ Fixed share salary ■ Fixed cash salary
Notes:
1 Salary is comprised of cash, deferred share salary, benefits and pension 
contributions. Mr Gilauri’s total cash salary in 2016 in respect of both his service 
contract with BGEO and the JSC BGEO Group will be US$ 437,500. In 2016, 
Mr Gilauri’s new contract with the JSC BGEO Bank, which was approved on 
13 July 2015, will become effective on 1 May 2016. From 1 January 2016 until 
30 April 2016, the value of the deferred share salary payable is calculated by 
reference to the share price as at the date Mr Gilauri’s 2013 service contract at the 
Bank was signed, being US$ 21.71 per share (the official share price of £14.06 per 
share as at 19 February 2013 converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 
1.5503, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the 
same date). From 1 May 2016 until 31 December 2016, the value of the deferred 
share salary payable is calculated by reference to the share price as at the date 
Mr Gilauri’s new service contract with JSC BGEO Group was approved, being 
US$ 29.44 per share (the official share price of £18.96 per share as at 13 July 
2015 converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5526, being the 
official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). The 
price is the value at which the shares were committed to the Trust and underlies 
the determination of compensation expense in the Group’s income statement 
for the year. Deferred share salary in respect of 2016 will be formally granted in 
January 2017 and will vest from January 2018 to January 2021. For the purposes 
of this graph, we have used the value of pension and benefits for 2015 as we 
assume that pension and benefits in 2016 will be substantially the same.
2 The means of determining the number of shares underlying the discretionary 
deferred share compensation and terms and conditions applying to this 
compensation are described in section 1(b) above. Discretionary deferred shares 
in respect of 2016 will be formally granted in January 2017 and will vest in January 
2018 and 2019. 
3 Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gilauri receives only 
fixed remuneration, comprised of cash salary, deferred share salary, pension 
contributions and benefits and the Remuneration Committee considers that the 
Group’s and/or the Director’s performance in 2016 does not warrant any award of 
discretionary deferred share compensation.
4 On-target opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gilauri receives fixed 
remuneration (as described above) and assumes a discretionary deferred share 
compensation award at 70% of the maximum opportunity for Group and individual 
performance which is in line with the Group’s expectation, which is excellent 
performance. 
5) Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gilauri receives fixed 
remuneration (as described above) and a discretionary deferred share 
compensation award of 50% of total salary (i.e. the Remuneration Committee 
considers that the Group’s and the individual’s performance in 2016 warrant the 
highest possible level of discretionary deferred share compensation). 
6) The value of deferred shares does not take into account any increase or decrease 
in share price over the vesting period or any dividend equivalents payable on 
vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options).  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   121

7. Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy
In 2015, each member of the Board of BGEO, with the exception of 
Mr Gilauri, served as a member of the Supervisory Board of the 
Bank. Fees for Non-Executive Directors on both the Board of BGEO 
and the Supervisory Board of the Bank are paid solely in cash. Each 
member received a base fee and was further remunerated for 
membership on the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and/or Nomination Committee, if applicable. 
The Policy provides for a Non-Executive Director’s remuneration 
package to be comprised of the following elements:

the Bank).
•  The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right, in its sole 
discretion, to amend and

Notes:
1 Non-Executive Directors do not receive any deferred share salary or discretionary 
deferred share compensation, pensions, benefits or any variable or performance-
linked remuneration or incentives. 
2 Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, 
including travel expenses, incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their 
letters of appointment, on provision of valid receipts.
3 Non-Executive Directors who are appointed to the Board and/or to the 
Supervisory Board of the Bank by shareholders of BGEO are required to waive 
any entitlements to fees which would otherwise be payable to them under the 
Policy for so long as they are appointees of a shareholder.
8. Payments for loss of office of the current Directors
The following paragraphs (a) to (d) summarise the termination 
provisions of Mr Gilauri’s service contracts with BGEO, the Bank 
and JSC BGEO Group, all of which are consistent with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. In 2015, and as of the date of this 
Annual Report, Mr Gilauri remained the sole Executive Director on 
the BGEO Board.
The Group’s policy for payments for loss of office for 
Non-Executive Directors is described in paragraph (e) below and 
its approach to payments for loss of office for future Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors is described in section 9 below. 
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are 
kept for inspection by shareholders at BGEO’s registered office.
(a) Termination of BGEO service contract dated 15 December 
2011
Mr Gilauri’s service contract with BGEO is for an indefinite term 
(subject to annual re-election at the AGM) and is terminable by 
either party on four months’ written notice. Where the service 
contract is terminated on notice, BGEO may put Mr Gilauri on 
garden leave for some or all of the notice period and continue to 
pay his cash salary under the BGEO service contract, provided 
that any accrued and unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed 
to be taken during the garden leave period.
BGEO may terminate Mr Gilauri’s employment early with 
immediate effect and without notice and pay in lieu of notice in  
the case of, among other circumstances, his dishonesty, gross 
misconduct, conviction of an offence (other than traffic-related)  
or becoming of unsound mind. BGEO may also terminate the 
agreement with immediate effect by payment in lieu of notice, in 
which case the payment in lieu of notice shall be solely in respect 
of cash salary due under the BGEO service contract as at the date 
of termination of employment. 
(b) Termination of Bank service contract dated 19 February 
2013
Mr Gilauri’s service contract with the Bank is for an initial term of 
three years expiring on 1 May 2016, which may be renewed by 
agreement between the parties or terminated prior to the expiry of 
the term by either Mr Gilauri or the Bank. A further service contract 
has been agreed effective from 1 May 2016 and the termination 
provisions of it are described further at paragraph (c) below. The 
current agreement was subject to variations on 26 February 2014 
and 24 August 2015. The latter variation was in connection with 
Mr Gilauri’s change of role to Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
of the Bank. The Bank may terminate the service contract 
immediately without notice (subject to the terms set out below), 
whereas Mr Gilauri may terminate the contract upon three months’ 
written notice or such shorter period as is agreed with the 
Supervisory Board and CEO of the Bank. 
Separation payments
Mr Gilauri is entitled only to:
• accrued and unpaid cash salary; 
• accrued but not yet paid dividend equivalents; 
• benefits; 
• holiday pay; and 
• reimbursement of business expenses, 122   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
if his contract is terminated in the following circumstances:
• termination by the Bank for “cause” (cause being defined as 
gross and wilful misconduct in the course of his duties having a 
material adverse effect on the Group, material repeated failure 
to perform his duties or breach of his obligations or conviction 
of a felony, among other circumstances);
• termination by reason of death or disability (in which case he 
receives life or disability insurance benefits); or
• termination by Mr Gilauri other than for “good reason” (meaning 
uncorrected material breach of a material provision of the 
service contract by the Bank which is not cured within 45 days 
upon Mr Gilauri serving notice of breach, or material and 
unremedied illegal or unethical behaviour by Bank employees 
which has been notified to the Board by Mr Gilauri and the 
Board fails to react and cooperate with Mr Gilauri in addressing 
the behaviour).
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract is terminated for any other reason, 
or is not renewed on substantially similar terms on expiry of the 
terms of the service contract, he is entitled to a separation 
payment equal to 12 months’ cash salary plus any accrued and 
outstanding unpaid cash bonus, holiday pay and reimbursement 
of business expenses. He will not be entitled to any additional 
severance or leaving allowance, reimbursements, pay in lieu of 
notice, benefits, compensation for sick leave or other similar 
payments other than in respect of his deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation (as described below). 
Any separation payments are intended to include a severance 
allowance and any additional payments would be decided by 
shareholders at a general meeting.
The Bank may restrict Mr Gilauri from being employed in the 
financial industry and/or providing consulting or similar services to 
a competing financial institution (based in a country in which the 
Bank operates) for a period of up to four months following the 
termination of his employment, and will continue to pay him his full 
cash salary under the Bank service contract as compensation for 
his unemployment. In addition, the Bank may impose a two-year 
non-compete period in exchange for accelerated vesting of his 
deferred share compensation (as described below). These 
non-competition covenants are subject to a materiality threshold. 
Deferred share compensation on termination 
Mr Gilauri will be entitled to an award of his deferred share salary in 
respect of any incomplete calendar year which he has worked. He 
may also be awarded discretionary deferred share compensation if: 
• his service contract expires and is not renewed upon 
substantially similar terms; 
• he is or is not offered a new service contract but is offered and 
accepts continued membership of the BGEO and/or Bank 
Board; or
• his service contract is terminated before its expiry date but he 
continues as a member of the BGEO and/or Bank Board.
Mr Gilauri will not be entitled to any deferred share salary for 
calendar years covered by the contract period during which he 
has not worked.
Vesting and lapse of existing awards 
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract is terminated for cause or by  
him other than for good reason, his unvested deferred share 
compensation will, unless otherwise agreed with the Board, lapse 
on the termination date.
Any unvested deferred share compensation of Mr Gilauri will vest 
immediately if:
• his service contract is terminated by the Bank other than for 
cause; is terminated by him for good reason; or expires and 
neither a renewed agreement nor Board membership is offered; 
or 
• he ceases to be an Executive Director by reason of death, 
disability, injury, redundancy or retirement at normal retirement 
age; or
• there is a change of control of the Bank, BGEO or any 
intermediary holding company of the Company (as appropriate). 
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract expires and he is offered but refuses 
membership of the board of a company within the Group, 50% of 
his unvested deferred share compensation will vest immediately 
and the remaining 50% will, at his discretion, either continue to 
vest as normal or he may acquire some or all of the underlying 
shares for a specified price based on the price of the shares on 
their respective grant dates in accordance with the terms of the 
service contract plus a 10% annual increase from the respective 
grant date until the date of purchase (if any) by Mr Gilauri. In 
consideration for this vesting treatment, Mr Gilauri will be bound by 
a two-year non-compete period during which he may not be 
employed by, provide consultancy services to or otherwise found 
or be a partner or associate of a commercial bank in Georgia (save 
that he may hold less than 5% of shares of a publicly listed bank). 
If it is found that either an interim or annual statement, following an 
audit, requires a material adjustment, and such adjustment is due 
to the inaccuracies of a department under Mr Gilauri’s control, 
then the Board may decide that all or any unvested securities  
may lapse.
If Mr Gilauri’s service contract expires and is not renewed upon 
substantially similar terms but he is offered and accepts continued 
or renewed membership of the BGEO and/or Bank Board, 50% of 
his unvested shares vest immediately and the remaining 50% shall 
continue to vest as normal. 
If he subsequently ceases to be a member of the Bank and/or 
BGEO Board, at Mr Gilauri’s discretion, unvested shares either 
continue to vest as normal or he may acquire some or all of the 
underlying shares for the specified price as described above.
Mr Gilauri will be paid cash payments equivalent to the dividends 
accrued on his deferred share compensation. Such payments  
will be made on the vesting date in respect of dividends paid from 
the date the award was made to the vesting date. Such cash 
payments shall accrue and be payable on any vested shares, even 
if Mr Gilauri’s service contract with the Bank has been terminated 
prior to vesting. The Bank will not pay any cash equivalent in 
respect of dividends on any deferred share compensation that  
has lapsed. 
(c) Termination provisions in Bank service contract dated 
24 August 2015
As disclosed in paragraph (b) above, on 24 August 2015, Mr Gilauri 
entered into a new service agreement with JSC BGEO Group. This 
will be effective from 1 May 2016 and is on the same terms as the 
contract described in (b).  Annual Report 2015  BGEO Group PLC   123

Additional 
information
(d) Previous service contract with the Bank dated 25 May 
2010
Any unvested awards granted under Mr Gilauri’s previous service 
contract with the Bank (for the period from 25 May 2010 until and 
including 30 April 2013) shall vest immediately on termination of his 
current service contract for any reason, except that (i) if his current 
agreement is terminated by the Bank for cause, any unvested 
awards shall (unless the Board determines otherwise) lapse, and 
(ii) if it is terminated by Mr Gilauri for any reason other than for 
good reason (and unless the Board determines otherwise to his 
advantage), 50% of the unvested awards will vest immediately and 
the remaining 50% will, at his discretion, either continue to vest as 
normal or the underlying shares may be acquired for the specified 
price as above. 
(e) Termination of Non-Executive Directors’ appointments
The letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors provide for 
a one-month notice period although BGEO may terminate the 
appointment with immediate effect without notice or pay in lieu of 
notice if the Non-Executive Director has committed any serious 
breach or non-observance of his or her obligations to BGEO, is 
guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings BGEO or him/herself into 
disrepute or is disqualified as acting as a Non-Executive Director, 
among other circumstances. Upon termination, the only 
remuneration a Non-Executive Director is entitled to is accrued 
fees as at the date of termination together with reimbursement of 
properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the termination date.
9. Policy on the appointment of external hires and internal 
appointments
Any arrangement specifically established to recruit a new 
Executive Director would take the form of deferred shares. The 
value of these deferred shares would be capped to be no higher, 
on recruitment, than the awards which the individual had to 
surrender in order to be recruited and the vesting period of such 
deferred shares would be a similar timeframe to the awards being 
bought out. The application of performance conditions and/or 
clawback provisions may also be considered, where appropriate.
The remuneration package offered to any new Executive Director 
would comprise the components described in section 1 above. 
A new Executive Director would be paid no more than the 
Remuneration Committee considers reasonably necessary to 
attract a candidate with the relevant skills and experience but such 
package would be capped at the annual total monetary value or 
the total number of shares currently awarded to executives at the 
equivalent level of seniority pursuant to existing contractual 
arrangements. The terms and conditions attaching to any 
component of the remuneration might be varied insofar as the 
Remuneration Committee considers it necessary or desirable to 
do so in all the circumstances. 
Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and,  
where relevant, his or her family may be provided depending on 
the individual’s circumstances. BGEO has not set a maximum 
aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any individual’s 
relocation support, but it will aim to provide support of an 
appropriate level and quality on the best terms that can  
reasonably be obtained.
Any payment upon termination of a new Executive Director’s 
service contract would not exceed 12 months’ cash salary  
under the relevant service contract, plus any accrued and unpaid 
cash salary, benefits and holiday pay and reimbursement of any 
business expenses. The Group may also continue to pay a former 
Executive Director his full cash salary for any period following the 
termination of his appointment during which he is prohibited from 
competing with the Group. 
It is expected that the following vesting provisions will apply to 
deferred share compensation in the case of termination of a new 
Executive Director’s service contract: 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would lapse upon 
termination of the service contract by BGEO or the Bank for 
cause, termination by the Executive Director other than for 
good reason or if the Executive Director’s employment is 
terminated for any other reason and he is not offered continued 
membership of the Board or the Bank’s Supervisory Board. 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would continue to vest 
in the normal way during the respective vesting period(s) upon 
termination by BGEO or the Bank without cause, if the 
Executive Director’s service contract expires and he is not 
offered a new service contract on substantially similar terms on 
expiration or if the Executive Director ceases to be an Executive 
Director by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement 
(at normal retirement age). 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would vest immediately 
upon death of the Executive Director, termination of the service 
contract by the Executive Director for good reason or a change 
of control. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board reserves the right to permit 
unvested deferred share compensation to vest irrespective of the 
Executive Director’s departure when such Executive Director 
departs on good terms with the Group. 
If an existing employee of the Group is appointed as an Executive 
or Non-Executive Director, any obligation or commitment entered 
into with that individual prior to his appointment will be honoured 
by the Group in accordance with the terms of those obligations or 
commitments, even where they differ from the terms of the Policy.

Statement
We are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Director’s 
Remuneration Report, the Strategic Report and the accompanying 
consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires us to 
prepare financial statements for each financial year. As required, 
we have prepared the accompanying consolidated and separate 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable law.
We must not approve the accompanying consolidated and 
separate financial statements unless we are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period.
In preparing the accompanying consolidated and separate 
financial statements, we are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;

reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial

unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
We are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the 
Group’s transactions, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and the Group, and to 
enable us to ensure that the consolidated and separate financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the consolidated and 
separate financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have further responsibility for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor
We confirm that, so far as we are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and we 
have taken all steps that we reasonably should have taken as 
Directors in order to make ourselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s statutory auditors 
are aware of such information.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the consolidated and separate financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and the Group taken as a 
whole; 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and 
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.
 
In arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of 
processes that form part of its internal control and risk 
management systems, including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate senior 
management with overall coordination by the Head of Investor 
Relations to ensure consistency across sections;
• an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure 
factual accuracy;
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual Report are 
undertaken by the CEO and other senior executive 
management; and
• the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee and Risk 
Committee prior to consideration by the Board.

Share capital and rights attaching to the shares
Details of the movements in share capital during the year are 
provided in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on 
page 189 of this Annual Report.
As at the date of this Annual Report, there was a single class of 
39,500,320 ordinary shares of one pence each in issue, each with 
one vote. The rights and obligations attaching to BGEO’s ordinary 
shares are set out in its Articles of Association. Holders of ordinary 
shares are entitled, subject to any applicable law and BGEO’s 
Articles of Association, to:
Directors’ Report
• have shareholder documents made available to them including 
the notice of any general meeting;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general meetings, 
either in person or by proxy; and
• participate in any distribution of income or capital.
In accordance with a request issued by BGEO, Sanne Fiduciary 
Services Limited, acting as trustee of the Trust, has waived its right 
to receive any dividends. This waiver will remain in place 
indefinitely, unless otherwise instructed by BGEO.
BGEO is permitted to make market purchases of its own shares 
provided it is duly authorised by its members in a general meeting 
and subject to and in accordance with section 701 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2015
AGM but no purchases were made during this financial year.
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to 
control of BGEO. 
There are no restrictions on transfers of shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by 
laws or regulations such as those relating to insider dealing;
• pursuant to the Group Share Dealing Code, whereby the 
Directors and designated employees require approval to deal in 
BGEO’s shares; and
• where a person with an interest in BGEO’s shares has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide BGEO 
with information concerning interests in those shares.
All employees (including Directors) that are deemed by BGEO to 
be insiders have complied with the Group’s Share Dealing Code. 
There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights save in 
situations where BGEO is legally entitled to impose such a 
restriction (for example under the Articles of Association where 
amounts remain unpaid in the shares after request, or the holder is 
otherwise in default of an obligation to BGEO). BGEO is not aware 
of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit before taxation of GEL 359.4 million (year 
ended 31 December 2014: GEL 276.6 million). The Group’s profit 
after taxation for the year was GEL 310.9 million (year ended 
31 December 2014: GEL 240.8 million).
BGEO may by ordinary resolution declare dividends provided that 
no such dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by 
BGEO’s Directors. The Directors may also pay interim dividends  
as appear to be justified by the profits of BGEO available for 
distribution. 
As BGEO is a holding company, BGEO relies primarily on dividends 
and other statutorily (if any) and contractually permissible payments 
from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its 
obligations and pay dividend to its shareholders. 
As a result of the Bank’s strong financial performance and 
condition, the BGEO Board intends to recommend an annual 
dividend of GEL 2.4 payable in British Pounds Sterling, which is 
subject to shareholders’ approval at the 2016 AGM. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid on 22 July 2016 to shareholders on 
the UK register of members at the close of business in the UK 
(6:00 pm London time) on 8 July 2016. 126   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

or a member of the Group, or any criminal or regulatory fine.
Related party disclosures
Details of related party disclosures are set out in Note 32 to the 
consolidated financial statements on pages 211 to 212 of this 
Annual Report.
Significant agreements
On 23 October 2015, BGEO entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with GHG and JSC BGEO Investments which regulates 
the degree of control that BGEO and its associates may exercise 
over the management and business of GHG. The principal 
purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that GHG  
and its subsidiaries are capable at all times of carrying on their 
business independently of BGEO and its associates. The 
Relationship Agreement took effect on 12 November 2015 and will 
continue until the earlier of: (i) GHG shares ceasing to be admitted 
to listing on the Official List; and (ii) BGEO, together with its 
associates, ceasing to own or control (directly or indirectly) 20% or 
more of the voting share capital of GHG. If BGEO ceases to be a 
controlling shareholder (within the meaning of LR 6.1.2A of the 
Listing Rules), it may terminate the Relationship Agreement by 
giving one month’s written notice to GHG.
Under the Relationship Agreement, for so long as BGEO and its 
associates together hold 20% or more of the voting share capital 
of GHG, BGEO and its associates shall amongst other things:
• conduct all transactions, agreements or arrangements entered 
into between (i) BGEO and its associates and (ii) GHG or any of 
its subsidiaries on an arm’s length basis and on normal 
commercial terms and in accordance with the related party 
transaction rules set out in the Listing Rules;
• not take any action that has or would have the effect of 
preventing GHG or any of its subsidiaries from complying with 
their obligations under the Listing Rules;
• not propose or procure the proposal of any resolution of the 
shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended, or 
appears to be intended, to circumvent the proper application of 
the Listing Rules; and/or
• abstain from voting on any resolution required by LR 11.1.7R(3) 
of the Listing Rules to approve a transaction with a related party 
involving BGEO.
The Relationship Agreement entitles BGEO to appoint one person 
to be a Non-Executive Director of GHG for so long as it (together 
with its associates) holds at least 20% of the voting share capital of 
GHG.
The Relationship Agreement also provides that (subject to 
permitted exceptions) neither BGEO nor its associates shall 
compete with the business of GHG nor use any names associated 
with GHG and that GHG shall not use any names associated with 
BGEO or its associates.
A copy of the Relationship Agreement is available to view at the 
BGEO’s registered office. 
At no time during 2015 did any Director hold a material interest in 
any contracts of significance with BGEO or any subsidiary of the 
Group. BGEO is not party to any significant agreements that would 
take effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of 
BGEO.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Monitoring of credit quality and 
appropriateness of allowance for loan losses 
Balance of GEL 198.9 million, prior year 
comparative GEL 103.8 million
JSC Bank of Georgia, which is the principal 
subsidiary of BGEO Group PLC, is the largest 
credit institution in Georgia. There is a risk that 
the Group’s management may be under pressure 
to report strong financial performance in order 
to meet the expectations of internal and external 
stakeholders, particularly in light of lowered 
economic growth forecasts in Georgia, the 
devaluation of the Georgian Lari against the US 
Dollar and the acquisition of PrivatBank. 
The allowance for loan losses is calculated using 
a collective provisioning model or discounted 
cash flow analysis and this involves a high level 
of subjectivity and reliance on the provisioning 
models and assumptions therein. Specifically, 
for individually impaired loans, management 
judgement is involved in the process of assessing 
the impairment charge. 
As a consequence, there is a greater risk of 
misstatement in these balances, either by fraud or 
error, including through the potential override of 
controls by management.
 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 101); 
Accounting policies (page 153); and Notes 4, 10 
and 29 of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(pages 164, 175 to 177 and 196 to 199)
The risk has increased in the current year as a 
result of lowered economic growth forecasts in 
Georgia, the devaluation of Georgian Lari against 
the US Dollar and the acquisition of PrivatBank.
We performed a walkthrough of the loan loss provision process 
and assessed the design and operating effectiveness of key 
controls. 
We tested key controls over collective loan loss provisioning, 
which included controls over the process of identifying the loans 
to be included in the collective provisioning and management’s 
review of key assumptions. For each of significant risk group, we 
tested application controls (including loss given default, probability 
of default, loan loss allowance and probability of default migration 
controls).
We tested key controls over the specific loan loss provision, which 
addressed aspects such as the classification of borrowers into 
their respective risk grades, calculation of days past due, and the 
recalculation of the loan loss allowance, including the valuation of 
collateral.
For the specific loan loss provision, we selected loan exposures on 
a sample basis and tested the appropriateness of the specific loan 
loss provision as at the balance sheet date, including reviewing 
the Group’s documented credit assessment of the borrowers, 
challenging assumptions around future cash flow projections and 
the valuation of collateral held. 
For the collective loan loss provision, we critically assessed the 
appropriateness of the collective provisioning methodology as 
well as the key assumptions and data inputs (including probability 
of default rates, cure rates, efficiency factor and average workout 
time) into the model with reference to our understanding of the 
business, relevant accounting standards and market practices. 
We also recalculated the collective loan loss provision and 
performed sensitivity analysis to changes in key inputs (including 
probability of default rates, efficiency factor, average workout time 
and collateral value) to the collective provisioning model.
We inspected a sample of restructured loans and the Group’s 
documented assessment to provide assurance that any loans 
that have been subject to forbearance have been appropriately 
provided for, classified and reported.
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 
one component, which covered 89% of the risk amount.
Based on the results of our 
audit procedures, we concluded 
that the loan loss provision is 
within a reasonable range as at 
31 December 2015.
Risk of fraud in recognition of healthcare 
revenue 
Balance of GEL 184.0 million, prior year 
comparative GEL 125.7 million
Georgia Healthcare Group (“GHG”) is one of the 
largest healthcare providers in Georgia. There is a 
risk that the Group’s management may be under 
pressure to report strong financial performance 
in order to meet the expectations of internal and 
external stakeholders, particularly following the 
listing of Georgia Healthcare Group PLC and in 
light of lowered economic growth forecasts in 
Georgia and the devaluation of the Georgian Lari 
against the US Dollar. Further, compensation tied 
to the performance of the Group may create an 
incentive for management to manipulate results. 
As a consequence, there is a greater risk of 
misstatement in these balances, either by fraud or 
error, including through the potential override of 
controls by management.
This is a new risk this year. Our audit approach and 
assessment of key areas of audit focus changes in 
response to circumstances affecting the Group.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 101); 
Accounting policies (page 159); and Note 24 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements (page 192)
We performed a walkthrough of the healthcare revenue process and 
assessed the design and operating effectiveness of key controls.
We increased our standard sample size for transactional testing by 
at least 1.7 times according to our statistical sampling methodology, 
to respond to this risk of fraud. We agreed transactions on a sample 
basis back to supporting audit evidence, such as receipt of cash and 
invoices; where appropriate, we also recalculated the fees charged.
We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order 
to identify and test the risk of misstatement arising from management 
override of controls. We performed substantive analytical review to 
consider unusual trends that could indicate material misstatements, 
and we considered changes in key drivers of healthcare revenue, such 
as bed occupancy, number of patients and number of beds.
We also performed cut-off testing to obtain evidence that revenue is 
recognised in the correct period.
We performed specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 
one component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Based on the results of our audit 
procedures, we concluded that 
the healthcare revenue for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 is 
materially correct. 130   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Valuation of land and buildings and 
investment properties
Balance of GEL 474.8 million, prior year 
comparative GEL 414.4 million
The Group adopted the revaluation model for the 
measurement of its land and buildings and the fair 
value model for investment properties. 
Real estate valuation is inherently uncertain and 
subject to an estimation process. Furthermore, the 
Group’s real estate properties are located primarily 
in Georgia, where the secondary market is relatively 
illiquid. 
Although the valuations are performed by a 
combination of internal and external, appropriately 
qualified valuers, there remains a risk that individual 
assets might be inappropriately valued.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 101); 
Accounting policies (pages 155 to 156); and Notes 
4, 11, 12 and 30 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (pages 164, 178 to 180 and 205 to 206)
The risk has neither increased nor decreased in the 
current year.
We performed a walkthrough of the real estate valuation process and 
assessed the design effectiveness of key controls. 
We engaged our Real Estate specialists to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the Group’s real estate valuations. This 
assessment included evaluating the competence and objectivity of the 
external valuers engaged by the Group, challenging the methods and 
assumptions used and testing the data provided by the valuers.
In respect of properties which were not subject to individual 
valuation by the external valuers, we ascertained management’s 
basis for conclusion, challenged management’s assumption that 
property prices in certain categories and locations had not changed 
significantly during the year, and corroborated these by reference to 
our understanding of the Group’s real estate portfolio and market 
information.
We ensured the appropriate recognition of the results of real estate 
valuation in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ 
and IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk 
area in four components, which covered 80% of the risk amount.
Based on the results of 
our audit procedures, we 
concluded that the valuations 
of land and buildings and 
investment properties are 
within a reasonable range as at 
31 December 2015.
Accounting for complex or one-off 
transactions
The Group has experienced significant levels of 
growth and change in recent years. The Group has 
expanded its investment business over the years as 
part of the Group’s strategy to capture compelling 
investment opportunities.
From time to time, the Group has entered into a 
number of complex and one-off transactions and 
agreements, including transactions relating to 
business combinations and valuation of options 
and convertible shares, for which determining the 
appropriate accounting treatment is inherently 
subjective, requires the exercise of a high 
degree of judgement, is subject to significant 
levels of estimation uncertainty, or requires 
the re-assessment of fair values arising from 
historic transactions on a periodic basis. We 
focused on this area due to the complexity of the 
accounting considerations and the involvement of 
management’s judgement. 
This is a new risk this year. Our audit approach and 
assessment of key areas of audit focus changes in 
response to circumstances affecting the Group.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 101)
We assessed management’s processes for identifying and accounting 
for complex and one-off transactions. 
We reviewed significant complex and one-off transactions, including 
transactions relating to business combinations and valuation 
of options and convertible shares. We critically challenged the 
assumptions and judgements made by management in determining 
the appropriate accounting treatment in accordance with applicable 
IFRSs. We assessed whether the conclusions reached by 
management were consistent with the underlying agreements and 
commercial factors applicable to each of the transactions.
Complex and one-off transactions were subject to full scope audit 
procedures by the Primary audit team.
We highlighted to the Audit 
Committee the need for the 
Group to continue to improve 
its internal controls to match 
the growth in the business, 
particularly in relation to complex 
and one-off transactions. 
Based on the results of our 
audit procedures, we concluded 
that the complex and one-off 
transactions are materially 
correct as at 31 December 2015 
and for the year then ended.
IT general and automated controls over 
financial reporting
The integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
is dependent on the integrity of data and reports 
produced by the Group’s IT systems and the 
effectiveness of IT-dependent controls in the 
processes underlying the preparation of the 
financial statements. There is a risk that IT general 
and automated controls over financial reporting are 
not designed and operating effectively.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 101 
to 102)
The risk has neither increased nor decreased in the 
current year.
We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the key IT 
systems that are relevant to financial reporting.
We examined the controls over program development and changes, 
access to programs and data and IT operations in respect of those IT 
systems, and embedded application controls.
We engaged our IT specialists to perform sufficient audit procedures 
to enable us to place reliance on the IT applications and relevant 
controls identified as having a material impact on the financial 
reporting process. Where exceptions were observed in our testing, 
we identified compensating controls and tested those to address the 
identified risk. In addition, we performed substantive audit procedures 
to cover the additional risks associated with the ineffective controls 
over logical access.
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in one 
component, which covered 100% of the risk.
The results of our audit 
procedures on the IT general 
and automated controls over 
financial reporting, including 
the results of our testing of 
compensating controls and the 
procedures performed to cover 
the additional risks associated 
with the ineffective controls 
over logical access, provided us 
with sufficient audit evidence to 
enable us to place reliance on 
the IT applications and relevant 
controls identified as having a 
material impact on the financial 
reporting process.

The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into 
account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent Internal Audit findings when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to make sure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected six components. Of the six components selected, we performed 
an audit of the complete financial information of two components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or 
risk characteristics. For the remaining four components (“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within the components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial 
statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.

Details of the specific scope component which was audited by a component team are set out below:
Component Location Scope Auditor
JSC Medical Corporation EVEX Georgia Specific EY
Components subject to a full scope audit account for over 84% (2014: over 89%) of the Group’s revenue, over 88% (2014: over 84%) of 
the Group’s pre-tax profit and over 90% (2014: over 92%) of the Group’s total assets. Components subject to a specific scope audit 
account for over 7% (2014: over 1%) of the Group’s revenue, over 6% (2014: over 2%) of the Group’s pre-tax profit and over 6% (2014: 
over 5%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the 
components but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
Of the remaining 22 components that together represent 6% of the Group’s pre-tax profit, none are individually greater than 5% of the 
Group’s pre-tax profit. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation 
journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

contribution of such components to the Group consolidated financial statements varies each year.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors operating under our instruction.
For the one specific scope component, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a 
whole. 132   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to make sure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor visits the principal components of the Group. The Senior Statutory Auditor is based in the UK, but since Group management and 
operations reside in Georgia, the Group audit team operates as an integrated primary team including members from the UK, Georgia and 
Russia. The Senior Statutory Auditor visited Georgia four times during the current year’s audit and there was regular interaction between 
team members in each jurisdiction. 
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the Georgian primary team and the component team and any issues arising from 
their work, as well as meeting with Group and local management. In addition, we participated in planning and closing meetings and 
reviewed selected audit working papers. The primary team interacted regularly with the component team where appropriate during 
various stages of the audit and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit 
procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be GEL 18.0 million (2014: GEL 13.8 million), which is 5% (2014: 5%) of pre-tax profit. 
We consider the basis of our materiality to be one of the principal considerations for shareholders of the Company in assessing the 
financial performance of the Group. It is linked to the key earnings measures discussed when the Group presents the financial results.
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of 
material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. Our evaluation of materiality requires 
professional judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative considerations implicit in the definition.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and made adjustments based on the final financial performance of the 
Group.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2014: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely GEL 9.0 million (2014: GEL 6.9 million). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage (which is the lowest in the range) due to misstatements which were identified in the prior year 
audit. Our approach is designed to have a reasonable probability of ensuring that the total of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
does not exceed our materiality of GEL 18.0 million for the Group financial statements as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the 
relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In 
the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was as follows:
BGEO Group PLC GEL 9.0 million
JSC Bank of Georgia GEL 7.5 million
All specific scope components GEL 2.2 million
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of GEL 0.9 million 
(2014: GEL 0.7 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
2015 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 124, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, financial and non-
financial information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired in the course of 
performing the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model 
and strategy; and whether the annual report appropriately addresses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee that we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.
Companies Act 2006 reporting We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review requirements We are required to review:
• the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on 
page 47, and longer-term viability, set out on page 47; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review. 
We have no exceptions to report. 134   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
Statement on the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the entity
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything 
material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
entity, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.

Notes:
1. The maintenance and integrity of the BGEO Group PLC web site is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented 
on the web site.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Following the National Bank of Georgia’s intention to regulate banks in Georgia on a standalone basis and thereby limit investment in 
non-banking subsidiaries by locally regulate entities, the Group undertook legal restructuring in 2015. For this purpose, JSC BGEO Group 
was created to act as an ultimate Georgian holding company for the Group, which in turn holds:
• JSC Bank of Georgia and its subsidiaries serving banking operations;
• Newly created JSC BG Financial and its subsidiaries providing non-banking financial services;
• Newly created JSC BGEO Investment and its subsidiaries providing non-financial products and services.

Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
No new or revised IFRS during the year had an impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: 
• Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); 
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; 
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to 
the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All 
intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses 
control over a subsidiary, it:
• Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
• Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests
• Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
• Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
• Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
• Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
• Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained 
earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair 
values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This 
includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. It is then considered in the determination of goodwill. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in either profit or loss or as a change 
to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the 
appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for 
within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognised at the acquisition date. If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate 
consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise 
significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method 
and are initially recognised at cost, including goodwill. Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. However, when the Group’s 
share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the 
Group is obliged to make further payments to, or on behalf of, the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
associates; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and investment securities, derivatives and non-financial assets such as 
investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are 
disclosed in Note 30.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest .A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in 
its highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 − Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable;
• Level 3 − Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Financial assets
Initial recognition
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, or 
available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition.
Date of recognition
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the 
period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are not entered into with the intention of immediate or short-term resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated as 
investment securities. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This calculation includes all fees paid 
or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums 
and discounts. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised 
or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.  152   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified  
in any other categories. After initial recognition available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being 
recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income 
statement. However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Whilst the Group does not adopt a formal hedge accounting policy, in the ordinary course of business the Group enters into various 
derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps and options in the foreign exchange and capital markets. Such financial 
instruments are initially recognised in accordance with the policy for initial recognition of financial instruments and are subsequently 
measured at fair value. The fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models that take into account the current 
market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments and other factors. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when it is negative. Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income 
statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies translation differences.
Measurement of financial instruments at initial recognition
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments not at fair value 
through profit or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price. If the Group determines 
that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, then:
• if the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e., a Level 1 input) or based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the Group recognises the difference between the fair value at initial 
recognition and the transaction price as a gain or loss;
• in all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial 
recognition and the transaction price. After initial recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a gain or loss only 
when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with central banks, 
and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within ninety days of the date of origination and are free from contractual 
encumbrances and readily convertible to known amount of cash. 
Borrowings
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in 
the group having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other than by the 
exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity instruments. Such instruments include 
amounts due to credit institutions and amounts due to customers (including promissory notes issued). These are initially recognised  
at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. 
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying 
amount of the liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subordinated debt
Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the Bank on the international financial markets or domestic market. The 
holders of subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of the Bank’s liquidation. 
Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
Leases
i. Finance – Group as lessor
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at a value equal to the net investment 
in the lease, starting from the date of commencement of the lease term. In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments 
the discount factor used is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance 
lease receivables. Lease payments received are apportioned between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease 
receivable. Finance income is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding. 
ii. Operating – Group as lessee 
Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included into other 
administrative and operating expenses.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
iii. Operating – Group as lessor
The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the nature of the 
asset. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term as other income. The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease 
term on a straight-line basis. Initial direct costs incurred specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a 
result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial 
difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such  
as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables
For amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the Group first 
assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively  
for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risks 
characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an 
impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been 
incurred). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original effective 
interest rate of the asset. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery 
and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment 
loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment  
loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the 
consolidated income statement in the respective impairment line with a negative sign as a reversal of impairment.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a 
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. The calculation of the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure 
less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. 
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Group’s internal credit grading 
system that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and 
other relevant factors. 
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss 
experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of 
current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the years on which the historical loss experience is 
based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows 
reflect, and are consistent with, changes in related observable data from year to year (such as changes in unemployment rates, property 
prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their magnitude). The 
methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss 
estimates and actual loss experience. 
Write-off of loans to customers
All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when overdue by more than 150 days. Retail mortgage loans are written off when 
overdue by more than 365 days. Write off of corporate loans overdue by more than 150 days is subject to management discretion and is 
evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account the current and expected positions of the loan/borrower. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an 
investment or a group of investments is impaired. 154   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in  
the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the 
consolidated income statement – is reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement. Impairment 
losses on equity investments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement; increases in their fair value after impairment 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets 
carried at amortised cost. However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the 
amortised cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. Future interest income is based on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount  
the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded in the consolidated income 
statement. If, in a subsequent year, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the 
consolidated income statement. 
Renegotiated loans
Renegotiated loans comprise carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been 
renegotiated.
Where possible, the Group seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This may involve extending the payment 
arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions. 
The accounting treatment of such restructuring is as follows: 
• If the currency of the loan has been changed the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised. 
• If the loan restructuring is not caused by the financial difficulties of the borrower the Group uses the same approach as for the 
modification of financial liabilities described below.
• If the loan restructuring is due to the financial difficulties of the borrower and the loan is impaired after restructuring, the Group 
recognises the difference between the present value of the new cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate and the 
carrying amount before restructuring in the provision charges for the period. In cases where the loan is not impaired after 
restructuring, the Group recalculates the effective interest rate. 
Once the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no longer considered past due. Management continuously reviews renegotiated loans 
to ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject to an individual or 
collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loan’s original or current effective interest rate. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset,  
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
• the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower  
of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision)  
on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may 
repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at 
fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option 
exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and acceptances. 
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, in ‘Other liabilities’, being the premium 
received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amortised premium 
and the best estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the consolidated income statement. The premium received is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for, as follows:
• Raw materials: purchase cost on a first-in/first-out basis
• Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the 
normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated 
costs necessary to make the sale.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in the respective territories in which BGEO and 
its subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes  
are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial 
reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit  
or loss. 
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Georgia and Belarus also have various operating taxes that are assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are included as a 
component of other operating expenses. 
Investment properties
Investment property is land or building or a part of a building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not used 
by the Group or held for the sale in the ordinary course of business. Property that is being constructed or developed or redeveloped for 
future use as an investment property is also classified as an investment property. 
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently remeasured at fair value reflecting 
market conditions at the end of the reporting period. Fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on the basis of various 
sources including reports of independent appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualifications and who have recent 
experience in valuation of property of similar location and category.
Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property or for which the market has become less active 
continues to be measured at fair value. Earned rental income is recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for 
Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue for Investment Business companies. Gains and losses resulting from 
changes in the fair value of investment property are recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking 
Business companies and within real estate revenue or gross other investment profit for Investment Business companies, depending  
on weather the gains derive from active property development or passive appreciation respectively. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group  
and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. If an investment property 
becomes owner-occupied, it is reclassified to property and equipment, and its carrying amount at the date of reclassification becomes its 
deemed cost to be subsequently depreciated.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment, except for office buildings and service centres, is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred if the 
recognition criteria are met. Office buildings and service centres are measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment charged 
subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.  156   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Following initial recognition at cost, office buildings and service centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the 
date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are 
performed once in every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is 
restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for property and equipment 
included in other comprehensive income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously 
recognised in the consolidated income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the consolidated income statement. A 
revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the 
same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the revaluation reserve for property and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for property and equipment to retained earnings is made for the difference between 
depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation based on the assets original cost. Additionally, 
accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is 
restated to the devalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is 
transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset, commences from the date the asset is ready and available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Years
Office buildings and service centres Up to 100
Hospitals and clinics Up to 100
Furniture and fixtures 10
Computers and equipment 5-10
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end. 
Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated until the time they are available for use and reclassified to respective 
group of property and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the related leased asset or the expected lease term if lower.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in other operating expenses, unless they qualify for 
capitalization.
Goodwill Impairment
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to 
which the goodwill is so allocated:
• represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
• is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which the 
goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods. 
Intangible assets
The Group’s intangible assets include computer software and licenses. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite and 
amortised over 4 to 10 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
Amortisation periods and methods for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recorded as an expense as incurred. Software development costs 
(relating to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software) are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group 
can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the 
asset and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete 
the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development. Other software development costs are recognised 
as an expense as incurred.

Insurance and reinsurance receivables
Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost. The carrying value of 
insurance and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income. 
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. 
Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered 
direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business. Amounts due to reinsurers are estimated in a 
manner consistent with the associated reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract. Premiums ceded and claims 
reimbursed are presented on a gross basis. 
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when an indication of impairment occurs. Reinsurance receivables are 
impaired only if there is objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract that this 
can be measured reliably. 
Insurance liabilities
General insurance liabilities
General insurance contract liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date, 
whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other 
recoveries. Significant delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, 
particularly in respect of liability business, environmental and pollution exposures – therefore the ultimate cost of which cannot be known 
with certainty at the reporting date. 
Provision for unearned premiums
The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as 
unearned premium. The change in the provision for unearned premium is taken to the consolidated income statement in order that 
revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, the amount of expected future benefit payments. 
Liability adequacy test
At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums net of related deferred 
acquisition costs. In performing the test, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and policy administration 
expenses, as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any inadequacy is immediately charged to the 
consolidated income statement by establishing an unexpired risk provision.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of 
obligation can be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance sheet commitments is estimated regularly based on the past history of actual 
losses incurred on these commitments.
Retirement and other employee benefit obligations
The Group provides management and employees of the Group with private pension plans. These are defined contribution pension plans 
covering substantially all full-time employees of the Group. The Group collects contributions in the size of 2% of full-time employees’ 
salaries, of which 1% is deducted from the salaries and the other 1% – additionally paid by the Group. When an employee reaches the 
pension age, aggregated contributions, plus any earnings earned on the employee’s behalf are paid to the employee according to the 
schedule agreed with the employee. Aggregated amounts are distributed during the period when the employee will receive accumulated 
contributions. Respective pension benefit obligations are recorded within other liabilities, Note 15. 
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive share-based remuneration, whereby employees render services as 
consideration for the equity instruments (‘equity settled transactions’).
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the award (‘the 
vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The consolidated income statement charge or credit for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for the awards that do not ultimately vest except for the awards where vesting is conditional upon market 
conditions (a condition linked to the price of BGEO’s shares) which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.  158   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Where the terms of an equity settled award are modified, the minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. An 
additional expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as 
the replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and the new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Share capital
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business 
combination, are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par 
value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital. 
Treasury shares
Where BGEO or its subsidiaries purchase BGEO’s shares, the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, net of 
income taxes, is deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity. Treasury shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of premiums 
against additional paid-in capital.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting 
date. Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but 
before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility of any 
outflow in settlement is remote. A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but disclosed 
when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. 
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expense is recognised:
Interest and similar income and expense
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, interest 
income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the 
financial asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, 
prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of 
the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the 
Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest 
rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest 
income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.
Fee and commission income
The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of services it provides to its customers. Fee income can be divided 
into the following two categories:
Fee income earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time
Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period. These fees include commission incomes and 
asset management, custody and other management and advisory fees. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down 
and other credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest 
rate on the loan. 
Fee income from providing transaction services
Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party – such as the arrangement of the 
acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses – are recognised on completion of the underlying 
transaction. Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain performance are recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria. 
Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.

Insurance premium income
For property & casualty and health insurance business, premiums written are recognised at policy inception and earned on a pro rata 
basis over the term of the related policy coverage. Estimates of premiums written as at the reporting date but not yet received, are 
assessed based on estimates from underwriting or past experience and are included in premiums earned.
Insurance claims 
General insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, including the related handling 
costs and reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years. 
Healthcare revenue
The Group recognises healthcare revenue when the amount can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the entity. Healthcare revenue is presented net of corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of 
detailed bills with counterparties (mostly with the state). 
Healthcare revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for providing impatient and outpatient services 
and includes following components:
• Healthcare revenue from insurance companies – The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various 
insurance companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties;
• Healthcare revenue from state – The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the state programs 
based on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties;
• Healthcare revenue from out-of-pocket and other – The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on the 
completion of the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group. Sales are usually in cash or by credit card. Other revenue 
from medical services includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, which the Group has contractual relationship with. 
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered calculated according to contractual 
tariffs.
Gross real estate profit and Gross other investment profit
Gross real estate profit comprises revenue from sale of developed real estate property and revaluation gains on such developed 
properties.
Revenue from sale of developed real estate property is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the real estate 
have been transferred to the buyer. 
Gross other investment profit comprises revenue from sale of other finished goods and revaluation of other investment properties that 
were not developed by the Group.
Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have 
passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
Continuous transfer of work in progress is applied when: (a) the buyer controls the work in progress, typically when the land on which the 
development is taking place is owned by the final customer and (b) all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the work in progress 
in its present state are transferred to the buyer as construction progresses, typically when buyer cannot put the incomplete property back 
to the Group. In such situations, the percentage of work completed is measured based on the costs incurred up until the end of the 
reporting period as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred.
EBITDA 
The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of income statement for Investment Business. EBITDA is defined as earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, as well as cost of credit risk and net non-recurring items for the Investment Business.
Non-recurring income and expenses 
The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature. Any type of income or 
expense may be non-recurring by nature. The Group defines non-recurring income or expense as an income or expense triggered by or 
originated from an extraordinary economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and ordinary business course of 
the Group and is caused by uncertain or unpredictable external factors. Typical non-recurring income or expenses are but not limited to 
the following: 
• Bankruptcy of a subsidiary or an associate or any other extraordinary and irregular event that causes material impairment of an 
investment in that subsidiary or associate or impairment of associated goodwill; 
• Expenses incurred for the purposes of initial public offering (“IPO”) that are not directly attributable to issuance of new shares but are 
rather associated with the listing of existing shares; 
• Gains from bargain purchases (negative goodwill) associated with business combinations; 
• Impairment of property and equipment, which is an additional loss in excess of a regular depreciation charge caused by unexpected 
external factors; 
• Gains or losses from hyperinflation; 
• Gains or losses from breaches of borrowings before maturity; 
• Redundancy expenses and costs of lay off of management and executives; 
• Failure of a software or license provider to complete implementation of a software or license through a breach of agreement with the 
Group, resulting in legal disputes and/or litigations.  160   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Change in Presentation of Statement of Financial Position and Income Statement
The Group changed the reporting format to reflect its recently updated strategy to operate as a Georgia-focused banking group with an 
investment arm. As a result, consolidated statements of financial position and income statement are presented as a combination of the 
Group’s Banking and Investment businesses with corresponding inter-business eliminations. Certain line items of the statement of 
financial position and the income statement were reorganised to provide a more relevant presentation of these two distinct parts of  
the Group. 
Reclassifications
Starting from 2015, BGEO separated investment in associates from other assets in its separate financial statements and amended 
comparative financial information accordingly.
Due to the change in the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position, the following reclassifications were made to the 
31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 statements of financial position to conform to the year ended 31 December 2015 presentation

Functional, reporting currencies and foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency. BGEO’s and the 
Bank’s functional currency is Georgian Lari. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the 
financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded  
in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into functional currency at functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies – translation differences. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. When 
a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any 
exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a certain transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the transaction are 
included in gains less losses from foreign currencies (dealing). The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 
and 31 December 2013 were:
 Lari to GBP Lari to US$ Lari to EUR
Lari to BYR 
(10,000)

Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency  
of the Group are translated into Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and, their income statements are 
translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency 
of the Group, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular entity is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the rate at the reporting date.
Change in Functional Currency
Prior to 1 January 2007, the Bank determined that Georgian Lari was its functional currency, as it was the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Bank operated. However, in 2007 the Bank determined that US Dollar (“USD”) was its functional 
currency, due to the following:
• The US Dollars share of the Bank’s assets and liabilities was constantly increasing;
• Pricing of the loans was primarily based on the cost of funds which were sourced primarily from US Dollars denominated offshore 
banking borrowings and deposits, at the same time Global Depositary Receipts (“GDR”) of the Bank floated on the London Stock 
Exchange, and were priced and traded in US Dollars;
• After the Bank had listed its shares in the form of GDRs on the London Stock Exchange in November 2006, communication, planning 
and execution of business activities of the Bank with shareholders were generally in US Dollars.
In 2015 the Bank performed a re-assessment of its functional currency in accordance with International Accounting Standard 21 – “Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” (IAS 21) and determined that Georgian Lari was its functional currency, due to the following:
• US Dollars share of the Bank’s assets is stable and no longer increasing, while US Dollars share of liabilities is constantly decreasing;
• Due to their decreasing share in debt financing, pricing of the loans is constantly becoming less dependent on US Dollars 
denominated offshore banking borrowings and deposits, while following the listing of BGEO on the premium listing segment of the 
London Stock Exchange in February 2012, the Bank’s equity financing source also changed from US Dollars to British Pounds Sterling 
(“GBP”);
• Communication, planning and execution of business activities of the Bank with shareholders has become less relevant, concentrating 
more on Georgian Lari and GBP;
• Following listing on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange, share-based compensation of the management has 
changed from being US Dollars denominated to being GBP denominated;
In 2015 BGEO also performed a re-assessment of its functional currency in accordance with IAS 21 and determined that Georgian Lari 
was its functional currency as well, due to the fact that BGEO is a holding company that has no sufficiently substantive operations to 
enable it to have a different functional currency from its subsidiary.
As the result, the Bank and BGEO changed their functional currencies, from US Dollars and GBP respectively, to Georgian Lari starting 
1 January 2015 and this has been accounted for prospectively from that date.
Share capital, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings of BGEO were retranslated to Georgian Lari from the 31 December 2014 
GBP-GEL exchange rate of 2.8932 to the 1 January 2015 exchange rate of 2.9220. This movement is shown as a GBP-GEL translation 
effect in the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
Standards issued but not yet effective
Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published that are not yet effective for the current reporting period and which the Group has not early adopted. 
Such standards that are expected to have an impact on the Group, or the impacts of which are currently being assessed, are as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments 
project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and is 
currently assessing its impact of IFRS 9.
IAS 12 Income Taxes
In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets 
related to debt instruments measured at fair value and clarify recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, to address diversity 
in practice. Entities are required to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under 
IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
transferring goods or services to a customer. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements 
under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, when the IASB finalises their amendments to defer the effective date of IFRS 15 by one year. Early adoption is 
permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
IFRS 16 Leases
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases with an effective date of annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 
results in lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standard in a manner similar to the way in which finance leases are 
currently accounted for under IAS 17 Leases. Lessees will recognise a “right of use” asset and a corresponding financial liability on the 
balance sheet. The asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the financial liability measured at amortised cost. Lessor 
accounting remains substantially the same as in IAS 17. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on its financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from 
operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a 
result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited 
circumstances to amortise intangible assets. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the 
Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants
The amendments change the accounting requirements for biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants. Under the 
amendments, biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants will no longer be within the scope of IAS 41. Instead, IAS 16 will 
apply. After initial recognition, bearer plants will be measured under IAS 16 at accumulated cost (before maturity) and using either the 
cost model or revaluation model (after maturity). The amendments also require that produce that grows on bearer plants will remain in  
the scope of IAS 41 measured at fair value less costs to sell. For government grants related to bearer plants, IAS 20 Accounting for 
Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance will apply. The amendments are retrospectively effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have material impact on  
the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or 
contributed to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that the gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets 
that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between an investor and its associate or joint venture, is recognised in full. Any gain or 
loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent of 
unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. These amendments must be applied prospectively and are not expected  
to have any impact on the Group.
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. They include:
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
Assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of either through sale or distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing 
from one of these disposal methods to the other would not be considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original 
plan. There is, therefore, no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. This amendment must be applied prospectively. 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
(i) Servicing contracts
The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity 
must assess the nature of the fee and the arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement in IFRS 7 in order to assess 
whether the disclosures are required. The assessment of which servicing contracts constitute continuing involvement must be done 
retrospectively. However, the required disclosures would not need to be provided for any period beginning before the annual period in 
which the entity first applies the amendments.
(ii) Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements
The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless such 
disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent annual report. This amendment must be applied 
retrospectively.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits
The amendment clarifies that market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is 
denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in 
that currency, government bond rates must be used. This amendment must be applied prospectively.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated by 
cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the interim financial report (e.g., in the 
management commentary or risk report). The other information within the interim financial report must be available to users on the same 
terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time. This amendment must be applied retrospectively. These amendments are 
not expected to have any impact on the Group. 164   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. The 
amendments clarify:
• The materiality requirements in IAS 1
• That specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated
• That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements
• That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a 
single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss 
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial 
position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
The amendments address issues that have arisen in applying the investment entities exception under IFRS 10. The amendments to IFRS 
10 clarify that the exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements applies to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an 
investment entity, when the investment entity measures all of its subsidiaries at fair value.
Furthermore, the amendments to IFRS 10 clarify that only a subsidiary of an investment entity that is not an investment entity itself and 
that provides support services to the investment entity is consolidated. All other subsidiaries of an investment entity are measured at fair 
value. The amendments to IAS 28 allow the investor, when applying the equity method, to retain the fair value measurement applied by 
the investment entity associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries.
These amendments must be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early 
adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
4. Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the board of directors and management use their judgment and make 
estimates in determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The most significant judgments and estimates 
are as follows: 
Fair value of financial instruments
Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot be 
derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The 
input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in 
establishing fair values (Note 30).
Measurement of fair value of investment properties and property and equipment 
The fair value of investment properties and office buildings and service centres included in property and equipment is determined by 
independent professionally qualified appraisers. Fair value is determined using a combination of the internal capitalization method (also 
known as discounted future cash flow method) and the sales comparison method. 
The Group performs valuation of its investment properties, and office buildings and service centres once in every three years, unless 
there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market. Last valuation was performed as at 31 December 2015 by Colliers 
International Georgia. Results of this valuation are presented in notes 11 and 12, while valuation inputs and techniques are presented in 
note 30.
The estimates described above are subject to change as new transaction data and market evidence become available.
Allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables 
The Group regularly reviews its loans and finance lease receivables to assess impairment. The Group uses its judgment to estimate the 
amount of any impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there are few available sources of historical data 
relating to similar borrowers. Similarly, the Group estimates changes in future cash flows based on the observable data indicating that 
there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk 
characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the group of loans and finance lease receivables. The Group uses 
its judgment to adjust observable data for a group of loans and finance lease receivables to reflect current circumstances. 
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when estimating the amount of impairment loss for collateralised loans and finance  
lease receivables. Management monitors market value of collateral on a regular basis. Management uses its experienced judgment or 
independent opinion to adjust the fair value to reflect current circumstances. The amount and type of collateral required depends on the 
assessment of credit risk of the counterparty.
Information about allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables is presented in Note 10.

Acquisition of JSC PrivatBank
On 9 January 2015, the Bank acquired 100% of shares in JSC PrivatBank (“Acquiree”), a commercial Bank operating in Georgia, from 
PJSC CB PrivatBank (Ukraine) and its subsidiary for a total consideration of GEL 94,181.
The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree as at the date of acquisition was:

Amounts due from credit institutions 26,226

The Group decided to increase its presence in retail segment of Georgia’s banking sector, by acquiring JSC PrivatBank, thus 
consolidating a leading position in the growing retail segment of the Georgian commercial banking sector. Management considers that 
the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
GEL 32,130 and GEL 3,546 of revenue and profit, respectively, comes from the Acquiree during five months ended 31 May 2015. Had the 
acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the reporting period, revenue and profit of the combined entity for the current reporting period 
would not have been materially different. Fair value of any identified intangible assets was assessed as immaterial and thus no such 
assets were recognised by the Group. In May 2015, the Bank completed the integration of the Acquiree. The goodwill of GEL 11,055 was 
added to the Retail Banking cash generating unit, as JSC PrivatBank operations became an indistinguishable part of our Retail Banking 
business.
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the 
positive synergy which is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations. The whole amount of goodwill recognised is expected to 
be tax deductible.
1 Gross amount of loans to customers and finance lease receivables was GEL 335,008 of which GEL 37,621 is not expected to be collected;
2 Consideration comprised of GEL 94,181, which consists of GEL 84,933 cash payment and GEL 9,248 fair value of a holdback amount.
Acquisition of Healthcare Subsidiaries
During year ended 31 December 2015 JSC Medical Corporation EVEX (“Acquirer”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, made 
following acquisitions: 
• On 5 August 2015, 50% of the shares of LLC GNCo, a healthcare company operating in Georgia, was acquired from individual 
shareholders with effective management and operational control over the company;
• On 30 June 2015, 95% of the shares of LLC Deka, a healthcare company operating in Georgia, was acquired from individual 
shareholders;
• On 1 March 2015, 100% share in LLC Tbilisi Emergency Center, a healthcare company operating in Georgia, was acquired from 
individual shareholders. 166   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in the Tbilisi healthcare market by acquiring LLC GNCo, LLC Deka, LLC 
Tbilisi Emergency Center and. Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
GEL 19,010 and GEL 2,634 of revenue and profit, respectively come from the acquirees after their respective acquisition dates. If the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group would have recorded GEL 888,415 and GEL 314,429 of revenue and 
profit respectively. 
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the 
positive synergy that is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations. The goodwill of GEL 12,296 was added to the Healthcare 
cash generating unit. The whole amount of goodwill recognised is expected to be tax deductible. The Group has elected to measure the 
non-controlling interests in LLC GNCo and LLC Deka at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of their respective identifiable 
net assets.
1 Gross amount of receivables from healthcare services was GEL 18,271 of which GEL 9,951 is not expected to be collected;
2  Prior to acquisition, owners of LLC Deka encountered certain financial difficulties which resulted in a lower acquisition cost and a gain from a bargain purchase in the 
amount of GEL 5,361, recorded in net non-recurring items;
3  Consideration comprised GEL 68,827 which consists of cash payment of GEL 47,628 and a holdback amount with a fair value of GEL 21,199.

GEL 22,234 (2014: GEL 17,021, 2013: GEL 18,170).
Collateral and other credit enhancements 
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines are implemented 
regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
• For commercial lending, charges over real estate properties, equipment and machinery, corporate shares, inventory, trade receivables 
and third party corporate guarantees.
• For retail lending, mortgages over residential properties, cars, gold and jewellery and third party corporate guarantees.
Management requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement and monitors the market value of collateral 
obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan impairment.
It is the Group’s policy to dispose of repossessed properties in an orderly fashion. The proceeds are used to reduce or repay the 
outstanding claim. In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for business use.
Without taking into account discounted value of collateral, allowance for loan impairment would be GEL 176,759 higher as at 
31 December 2015 (2014: GEL 145,838 higher, 2013: GEL 47,256 higher).
Concentration of loans to customers
As at 31 December 2015, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the ten largest third party borrowers comprised GEL 
708,839 accounting for 13% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2014: GEL 711,647 and 16% respectively, 2013: GEL 610,916 and 
17% respectively). An allowance of GEL 2,484 (2014: GEL 4,034, 2013: GEL 22,740) was established against these loans.
As at 31 December 2015, the concentration of loans granted by the Group to the ten largest third party group of borrowers comprised 
GEL 1,094,979 accounting for 20% of the gross loan portfolio of the Group (2014: GEL 1,094,084 and 25% respectively, 2011: GEL 
912,106 and 25% respectively). An allowance of GEL 41,413 (2014: GEL 18,324, 2013: GEL 9,345) was established against these loans.

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations with indefinite lives have been allocated to six individual cash-generating units, for 
impairment testing: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking, Property & Casualty Insurance, Health Insurance, Healthcare and Liberty 
Consumer.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units (“CGU”) is as follows: 
2015 2014 2013
P&C Insurance 16,139  16,139  16,139 
Retail banking*  23,488  12,433  12,433

Liberty Consumer 3,439  3,439  3,439 
Total  72,984  49,633  48,720
*  GEL 11,055 increase in goodwill for 2015 is from acquisition of JSC PrivatBank (note 5), which was added to Retail Banking CGU. Impairment test revealed no need for 
impairment as at 31 December 2015.
**  GEL 12,296 increase in goodwill for 2015 is from acquisition of healthcare subsidiaries (note 5), which was added to Healthcare CGU. Impairment test revealed no need for 
impairment as at 31 December 2015.
 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets approved by senior management covering from one to three-year period. Discount rates were not adjusted for either a 
constant or a declining growth rate beyond the three-year periods covered in financial budgets. For the purposes of the impairment test, 
a 3% permanent growth rate has been assumed when assessing the future operating cash flows of the CGU.
The following discount rates were used by the Group for Corporate Banking and Retail Banking:

13. Goodwill continued
Discount rates
Discount rates reflect management’s estimate of return required in each business. This is the benchmark used by management to assess 
operating performance and to evaluate future investment proposals. Discount rates are calculated by using weighted average cost of 
capital (“WACC”).
For the Healthcare CGU the following additional assumptions were made over the first three-year period of the business plan: 
• Further synergies from healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage; 
• Growth of other healthcare business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth. 
For the Retail and Corporate banking CGUs the following additional assumptions were made: 
• Stable, business as usual growth of loans and deposits; 
• No material changes in cost/income structure or ratio; 
• Stable, business as usual growth of trade finance and other documentary businesses; 
• Further expansion of the express banking businesses bringing more stable margins to retail banking. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Management believes that reasonable possible changes to key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU 
will not result in an impairment of goodwill. The excess of value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the net book 
value as at 31 December 2015. Possible change was taken as +/-1% in discount rate and growth rate.
14. Taxation
The corporate income tax (expense) benefit comprises:
 
2015 2014 2013
Current income expense (38,959) (24,493) (17,284)
Deferred income tax expense (9,449) (11,332) (18,629)
Income tax expense (48,408) (35,825) (35,913)
Deferred income tax (expense) benefit in other comprehensive income (loss) 1,637 (124) (1,095)
Deferred tax related to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income during the years ended 31 December 2015, 2014 and 
2013 was as follows:
 
2015 2014 2013
Currency translation differences 1,276 (124) (873)
Net losses on investment securities available-for-sale – – 1 
Revaluation of buildings 361 – (223)
Income tax (expense) benefit in other comprehensive income 1,637 (124) (1,095)
The income tax rate applicable to most of the Group’s income is the income tax rate applicable to subsidiaries’ income which ranges 
from 15% to 25% (2014: from 15% to 27%, 2013: from 15% to 24%).
The UK Finance Bill 2015 was enacted in November 2015 reducing the standard rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 
1 April 2017 and 18% effective from 1 April 2020. There are no UK deferred tax balances at 31 December 2015. The deferred tax 
balances in other countries are recognised at the substantially enacted rates at the balance sheet date.

The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates. As at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 
2013 a reconciliation of the income tax expense based on statutory rates with the actual expense is as follows:
 
2015 2014 2013
Profit before income tax expense 359,353 276,592 245,256

Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax (profit tax), individuals’ withholding taxes, property tax and value 
added tax, among others. However, regulations are often unclear or nonexistent and few precedents have been established. This creates 
tax risks in Georgia and Belarus, substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems. 
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains

29. Risk Management
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, 
subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each 
individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks. It is also subject to operational risks. 
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. 
They are monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is an independent body and is directly monitored by the Board. It has the overall responsibility for developing  
and implementation of overall risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies and limits. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for the fundamental risk issues and manages and monitors relevant risk decisions covering, but not limited  
to: macroeconomic and environmental risks, general control environment, manual and application controls, risks of intentionally or 
unintentional misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, information security, anti-money laundering, information 
technology risks, etc.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Group’s risk appetite and exposure are addressed as part of strategy and 
appropriateness of risk strategy and appetite; oversee and advise the Board on the current and emerging risk exposures of the Group; 
oversee and monitor the implementation of the risk strategy by senior management to address the risk exposures of the Group; review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management framework and internal control systems (other than internal financial control systems 
which is the responsibility of the BGEO Audit Committee); assess the adequacy and quality of the risk management function and the 
effectiveness of risk reporting within the Group; ensure that risk is properly considered in setting the Group’s remuneration policy; 
oversee the communication of the tone from top related to risk management to every level of the business through senior management; 
review and approve the Group’s risk management policy. 
Management Board
The Management Board has the responsibility to monitor and manage the entire risk process within the Group, on a regular basis, by 
assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies and procedures as well as 
respective guidelines and controlling the implementation and performance of relevant departments and committees. 
Bank Asset and Liability Management Committee 
The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is the core risk management body. It is responsible for managing the 
Bank’s assets and liabilities, all risks associated with them as well as the overall financial structure of the Group. It is also primarily 
responsible for the funding, capital adequacy risk, liquidity risks and market risks of the Bank.
Internal Audit
Risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit function that examines both the adequacy 
of the procedures and the Group’s compliance with the procedures. Internal Audit discusses the results of all assessments with 
management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee. 196   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and 
unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models. The models make use of 
probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Group runs three different basic 
scenarios, of which one is Base Case (forecast under normal business conditions) and the other two are Troubled and Distressed 
Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are 
unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business strategy 
and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected 
industries. In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure 
across all risks types and activities. 
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks. This 
information is presented and explained to the Management Board, and the head of each business division. The reports include aggregate 
credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and 
changes to the risk profile. Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis. The 
Management Board receives a comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month. These reports are designed to provide 
all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group. 
Risk measurement and reporting systems
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that all business 
divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, 
proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
Risk mitigation
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes in 
interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecast transactions. While these are intended for 
hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks (see below for more detail).
Excessive risk concentration
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic 
region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to 
meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations also involve 
combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial 
instrument. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry  
or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on 
maintaining a diversified portfolio of both, financial assets as well as financial liabilities. Identified concentrations of credit risks or liquidity/
repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties failed to discharge their contractual 
obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual 
counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such 
limits. 
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, 
which assigns each counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take 
corrective action.
Derivative financial instruments
Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the 
statement of the financial position.
Credit-related commitments risks
The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf. Such 
payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit. They expose the Group to similar risks to loans and 
these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.

Past due loans to customers, analysed by age below, include those that are past due by at least one day and are not impaired.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio. This facilitates focused management of 
the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. The rating 
system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk 
ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Group’s rating policy. Attributable risk ratings are 
assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group  
as follows:
• A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no more than 30 days 
is assessed as a financial asset with High Grade; 
• A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 30 but less 
than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard Grade; 
• A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 60 days or 
borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at reporting date is assessed as a financial 
asset with Sub-Standard Grade.  198   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

Impairment assessment 
The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest are overdue by any 
number of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the 
original terms of the contract. The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and 
collectively assessed allowances. Loans are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by certain number of days as 
prescribed per the Group methodology, or history of the debt service is deteriorated by a certain percentage, as defined per the Group 
methodology, or any other defined event of default is identified. Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than through 
a collective impairment assessment model of the Group.

Individually assessed allowances
For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being 
individually impaired or not impaired. The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired 
is determined through individual assessment of the associated credit risk by assigning a proper credit rating. The allowances for non-
significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired are also individually assessed. The allowance for losses for individually 
significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the collective assessment approach described 
below. Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the counterparty’s business plan, its ability to 
improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the expected dividend payout should bankruptcy 
ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows and past 
history of the debt service of the borrower. Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances 
require more careful attention. 
Collectively assessed allowances
Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans (including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured 
consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.), both, significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence of 
individual impairment. Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet 
objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment. Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the 
following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is 
likely to have been incurred and the time it will be identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected 
receipts and recoveries once impaired. Local management is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as 
long as one year, depending on the product. The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with 
the Group’s overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision is made in a similar manner as for loans.

29. Risk Management continued
Liquidity risk and funding management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress 
circumstances. To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit base, manages 
assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates an assessment of expected 
cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen 
interruption of cash flow. The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs. In addition, the Group 
maintains a cash deposit (obligatory reserve) with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted. 
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios 
established by the NBG. As at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 these ratios were as follows: 
 
2015, 
%
2014, 
%
2013, 
%
Average liquidity ratio 38.1% 39.3% 42.3%
Maximum liquidity ratio 48.0% 46.8% 48.1%
Minimum liquidity ratio 28.9% 31.7% 35.5%
The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average (arithmetic mean) of daily 
liquidity ratios, computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows:
Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash. Those assets include 
investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due 
from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and/or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, 
amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are 
pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than 
six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less 
than six months. Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully 
collateralised by cash covers in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies. The maximum and 
minimum liquidity ratios are taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years. 
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared 
to the Bank’s standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation. The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and 
compared against set limits. In the case of deviations, amendment strategies/actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment 
obligations. Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects 
that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the 
expected cash flows indicated by the Bank’s deposit retention history.

The Group expects that not all of the contingent liabilities or commitments will be drawn before expiry of the commitments.
The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts. Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer 
period than indicated in the tables above. These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above. 
Included in due to customers are term deposits of individuals. In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay 
such deposits upon demand of a depositor (Note 16).
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such 
as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading 
portfolios. Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis. 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial 
instruments. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, on the Group’s consolidated income statement. 
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for 
the year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2015. Changes in basis points 
are calculated as standard deviations of daily changes in floating rates over the last month multiplied by respective floating rates. During 
the year ended 31 December 2015, year ended 31 December 2014 and year ended 31 December 2013, sensitivity analysis did not reveal 
any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Management 
Board has set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations. Positions are monitored daily. 
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2015 on its trading and non-
trading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement 
of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the income statement (due to the fair value of 
currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities). The reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the 
Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the last month. A negative amount in the table 
reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase. During the year 
ended the year ended 31 December 2015, year ended 31 December 2014 and year ended 31 December 2013, sensitivity analysis did not 
reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment 
earlier than expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when interest rates fall, or other credit facilities, for similar or whatever reasons.
The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan 
product individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and 
multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product. The model does not make a distinction between 
different reasons for repayment (e.g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation) and takes into account the effect of any prepayment 
penalties on the Group’s income. 
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on net interest income of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 
and 31 December 2013 is as follows:
Effect on net 
interest income
2015 (19,341)
2014 (16,744)
2013 (5,944)
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to perform, 
operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Group cannot 
expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group 
is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff 
education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit. 
Operating environment
Most of the Group’s business in concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business 
and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. Operations in Georgia may involve risks that 
are not typically associated with those in developed markets (including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the 
country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets). However, over the last few years the Georgian government has made a number of 
developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to 
create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax Code 
and procedural laws). In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia. 
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future stability of the 
Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and 
monetary measures undertaken by the Government. However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic 
slowdowns elsewhere in the world.

The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments which are recorded at fair value using valuation 
techniques. These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap 
models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign 
exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Trading securities and investment securities
Trading securities and a certain part of investment securities are quoted equity and debt securities. Investment securities valued using a 
valuation technique or pricing models consist of unquoted equity and debt securities. These securities are valued using models which 
sometimes only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data. The 
non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, its risk profile, and 
economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates.
Movements in level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value

The following table shows the impact on the fair value of level 3 instruments of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions:
In order to determine reasonably possible alternative assumptions the Group adjusted key unobservable model inputs as follows:
For equities, the Group adjusted the price-over-book-value multiple by increasing and decreasing the ratio by 10%, which is considered 
by the Group to be within a range of reasonably possible alternatives based on the price-over-book-value multiples used across peers 
within the same geographic area of the same industry.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not 
already recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short term maturity (less than three months) it is assumed that the 
carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a 
specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when 
they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed interest 
bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk  
and maturity.  208   BGEO Group PLC  Annual Report 2015

The Group’s capability to discharge its liabilities relies on its ability to realise equivalent assets within the same period of time. In the 
Georgian marketplace, where most of the Group’s business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation  
of renewing the loans at maturity. As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be different from the analysis presented above. To reflect 
the historical stability of current accounts, the Group calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years  
and includes the amount in the less than 1 year category in the table above. The remaining current accounts are included in the on 
demand category.

The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows:
• deposits; 
• borrowings from international credit institutions; 
• inter-bank deposit agreement;
• debt issues;
• proceeds from sale of securities;
• principal repayments on loans;
• interest income; and
• fees and commissions income.
As at 31 December 2015 amounts due to customers amounted to GEL 4,751,387 (2014: GEL 3,338,725, 2013: GEL 3,117,732) and 
represented 59% (2014: 56%, 2013: 59%) of the Group’s total liabilities. These funds continue to provide a majority of the Group’s funding 
and represent a diversified and stable source of funds. As at 31 December 2015 amounts owed to credit institutions amounted to GEL 
1,789,062 (2014: GEL 1,409,214, 2013: GEL 1,157,979) and represented 22% (2014: 24%, 2013: 22%) of total liabilities. As at 31 December 
2015 debt securities issued amounted to GEL 1,039,804 (2014: GEL 856,695, 2013: GEL 728,117) and represented 13% (2014: 14%, 
2013: 14%) of total liabilities.
In the Board’s opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Group’s present requirements.

party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions. In considering each possible 
related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the relationship, not merely the legal form.
Related parties may enter into transactions which unrelated parties might not, and transactions between related parties may not be 
effected on the same terms, conditions and amounts as transactions between unrelated parties. All transactions with related parties 
disclosed below have been conducted on an arm’s length basis.

33. Capital Adequacy
The Group maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business. The adequacy of the Group’s capital is 
monitored using, among other measures, the ratios established by the NBG in supervising the Bank.
Approved and published on 28 October 2013 by NBG, new capital adequacy regulation became effective in 2014, based on Basel II/III 
requirements, adjusted for NBG’s discretionary items. Pillar 1 requirements became effective on 30 June 2014, with Pillar II (ICAAP) 
requirements becoming effective 30 June 2015. A transition period is to continue through 1 January 2017, during which the Bank will be 
required to comply with both the new, and the current, capital regulations of the NBG.
During year ended 31 December 2015, the Bank and the Group complied in full with all its externally imposed capital requirements.
The primary objectives of the Group’s capital management are to ensure that the Bank complies with externally imposed capital 
requirements and that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to 
maximise shareholders’ value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk 
characteristics of its activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment 
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes were made in the objectives, policies and 
processes from the previous years.
NBG capital adequacy ratio
The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 11.4% of risk-weighted assets, computed based on the Bank’s 
standalone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements. As at 31 December 
2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows:

Dividends
On 16 February 2016, the Directors of BGEO declared their 
intention to recommend an annual dividend in the amount of GEL 
2.4 per share (payable in British Pounds Sterling at the prevailing 
rate), subject to approval by the shareholders at BGEO’s AGM. As 
a holding company whose principal assets are the shares of its 
subsidiaries, BGEO relies primarily on dividends and other 
statutorily and contractually permissible payments from its 
subsidiaries, principally the Bank, to generate reserves necessary 
to pay dividends to its shareholders.
If the annual dividend is approved at BGEO’s AGM on 26 May 
2016, BGEO envisions the following dividend timetable:
Ex-Dividend Date: 7 July 2016
Record Date: 8 July 2016
Currency Conversion Date: 11 July 2016
Payment Date: 22 July 2016

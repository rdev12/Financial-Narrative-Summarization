I am pleased to report record results for ITE Group plc which demonstrate the underlying
strength of our business.  Turnover and Headline Profit before tax for the year were £58.9 
million and £15.5 million respectively.  Headline diluted earnings per share grew by 75% to 4.2p
per share and diluted earnings per share improved to 3.0p per share on Profit before tax of
£12.3m compared to a loss of 1.0p per share on a Loss before tax of £0.4m in 2002.  The
Group has a strong balance sheet and ended the year with net cash of £22.1 million.
Strategic progress
We pursued a number of organic growth opportunities during the year, expanding our portfolio
of events in sixteen countries and enhancing our major brands. Recently ITE has agreed terms
with Expocentr, its principal Moscow venue, to extend the terms of its co-operation agreement
covering our key events for a further five years.
We have continued to focus our business on its most profitable areas of activity.  Since the
year-end we have sold all of our interests in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to Incheba a.s., the
owner of the other 50% interest.  The effect of the floods in Prague in August 2002 had 
shifted the focus of the Czech business towards investment in and refurbishment of exhibition
halls.
Board and management
There have been a number of changes to your Board during the year.  Russell Taylor was
appointed Group Finance Director and Company Secretary in March.  Russell is a Chartered
Accountant whose previous experience included eight years in the exhibitions industry.  In July,
Edward Strachan, Managing Director of our St Petersburg and Central Asia businesses was
appointed to the Board.  Edward has been with the Group for over ten years and now brings his
breadth of experience of our industry to the Board.
Alex Bernstein resigned from the Board in June. Alex had significantly contributed to building
our business in Moscow. Sir Hugh Bidwell, Deputy Chairman, stepped down from the Board in
September after seven years with ITE and Alexander Rozin resigned from the Board in November
following the sale of our Czech and Slovakian interests. The Board would like to thank these
Directors for their contributions to the development of the Group over the years.
In July, Marco Sodi replaced Jeffrey Stevenson as one of the Non-executive Directors nominated
by Veronis Suhler Stevenson.  Marco is actively involved in the European media sector. Michael
Hartley was appointed a Non-executive Director in October.  Michael is currently Chairman of
Dawson International plc and brings extensive experience of managing and growing 
internationally diversified groups of businesses.
In addition to the Board changes, we have streamlined and strengthened our management team.
I should like, on behalf of the Board, to thank all our staff for the very considerable effort that
they have made during the year.  We are particularly appreciative of their support during a 
period of organisational and structural change.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 1.1p per share bringing the total dividend for
the year to 1.6p per share. This represents a real increase of 6.7% in the annual dividend in line
with the Board’s progressive dividend policy.
Outlook
The Group enjoys a leading position in the Moscow, St Petersburg and Central Asian exhibition
markets.  We believe that these areas will continue to experience economic growth thereby
underpinning the expansion of our business.  We are opening opportunities for organic growth
by taking our existing brands and core products into new emerging markets.  With these strong
foundations, we are confident that we can add value and continue the good financial 
performance of this year.

Chairman’s Statement Financial performance
Turnover for the year of £58.9m (2002: £52.4m) and Gross Profits of £26.7m (2002: £21.4m) reflect both the
strength of the markets in which we operate and the benefits of re-focusing our business on its most profitable areas.
Control of overheads assisted Operating Profits of £11.7m (2002: £6.9m excluding impairment charges) and an
increase in Headline Profit before Tax to £15.5m from £8.4m last year. This is the stronger year in our biennial 
trading pattern and £2.4m of the increase in profits is attributable to events that only take place every two years.
Revenues are 12% higher than last year, despite the effect of a weakening dollar on our revenue streams. Circa
£4.4m of the increase in revenue is attributable to our biennial events, Moscow International Oil and Gas
and Autosalon.  Events which took place last year and did not recur in 2003 (or were discontinued)
and other timing differences reduced turnover by £4.3m. New launches and growth in our 
existing portfolio lifted turnover by £6.4m and profits by £3.6m.
The gross margin achieved of 45% is an improvement on last year’s margin of 41%. The
improvement is partly attributable to the margins we earn on the two biennial events,
and partly to the steps we have taken to reduce our cost of sales and to eliminate less
profitable business.
We carried out a review of our operating structure over the summer and the 
resulting changes yielded annualised savings of over £1m.  The costs of the
restructuring exercise were £0.4m. The cost of severing our relationship with the
Czech and Slovakian exhibition businesses was £0.8m. This included expensing
£0.5m of prepayments in respect of unused tenancies and a loss on disposal of
£0.2m. 
Our associated company contribution in the year primarily relates to our 50%
owned business in Istanbul, Turkey. The core business sold 150,000 square
metres, but yields are low and profits are depressed by the Turkish Lira, which
is only one third of its February 2001 value against the dollar.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review

ITE Group Plc
Annual Report 2003 The Group has performed well this year and the results represent a highly creditable performance.
This set of results confirms that our period of rationalisation and consolidation has been 
successfully completed and that the Group is making substantial progress. We have contracted
£35m of business for the 2004 year which is an increase on a like for like basis of 11%. 
Trading highlights
In 2003 we organised 114 events in 16 countries (2002: 117 events in 19 countries) and sold a
total of 292,000 square metres of space (2002: 255,800 square metres). We launched 19 new
events over the course of the year across a range of industries concentrating on the markets of
Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Turkey.
Like for like growth in space sales of our annually recurring events was in excess of 14%, led by
exceptionally strong results in our key core events. The top ten events ordered by contribution
to gross profit in 2003 and their change in size over the previous year were:
* 2002 Events not comparable due to biennial pattern
We enjoyed considerable growth in our key market, Moscow, which accounts for up to 70% of our
gross profit. The main influences were the good performance of our two biennial events and the
opening of a new 7,000 net square metre pavilion at the principal exhibition venue, Expocentr.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review (continued)
Expocentr  Russia
Offices : Moscow, St Petersburg. 
Our Russian exhibition business is very well established and enjoyed growth of 25% in both space and revenues.
Russia Building Week expanded to fill the newly built exhibition hall at Expocentr and has further potential to grow,
but is constrained for the time being by the availability of good quality exhibition space in Moscow.  Moscow
International Travel and Tourism show and the World Food Moscow event both enjoyed growth in space sales of
more than 15%. Our Oil and Gas event and Autosalon only take place every two years, but nevertheless both
enjoyed growth of 20% + over their previous editions. Moscow has become an increasingly competitive 
environment in recent years and presently continues to be under-resourced in available exhibition space. However,
new space will be available soon to provide the opportunity to enhance ITE’s growth.
The recently signed co-operation agreement with Expocentr is of real significance to the Group, as it secures our
key Moscow events at the leading Moscow venue of Expocentr for the foreseeable future.
Currently ITE is in new discussions to again further extend the term of our co-operation with Lenexpo, our 
principal venue in St Petersburg, following on from an agreement made late last year. Our premier events in 
St Petersburg remain the Baltic Building Week (8,000 Sq.m.) and Interfood St Petersburg (4,000 Sq.m.). We have
recently developed a new theme in St Petersburg with the agreement of a joint venture in the food production
technology area.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review (continued)
Food exhibition Central Asia
Offices: Kazakhstan (Almaty, Astana, Atyrau), Azerbaijan (Baku) and Uzbekistan
(Tashkent). 
ITE is the leading international operator established in these regions. The economies in these markets are 
buoyant, with growth underpinned by strong world oil and gas prices. In 2003 ITE launched 6 new events in the
region, mainly in Kazakhstan. The launches were in a range of industries including Building, Fashion, Packaging,
Cleaning and Chemicals.
In Kazakhstan, strong growth was developed in the city of Atyrau, where last year’s Infrastructure launch was split
into three separate exhibitions, all of which filled the existing venue capacity. In Almaty we entered into a 
funding arrangement to assist our venue partner to build a new exhibition hall, so as to facilitate growth in our
construction and oil and gas events (which both grew by circa 30%).
Our events in Azerbaijan are showing strong growth from a modest base – in particular in the medical and 
construction sectors.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review (continued)
Lighting prepared for exhibition Eastern & Southern Europe
Offices: Turkey (Istanbul), Ukraine (Kyiv).
We have strengthened our teams in Ukraine and Turkey and have increased the number of events held by making
a series of new launches. The reduction in space sales reflects the sale of our stand alone Czech business last
year and the decision to withdraw from our Belgrade events.
In Kyiv space sales increased by over 30%, though the new launch activity meant that this did not feed through
proportionately to profits. 
In Turkey our wholly owned business further extended its ‘Caspian’ brand, with successful launches in the
Transport, Banking and Finance and Ecology sectors. Caspian Telecoms, launched last year exhibited further good
growth. Overall space sales in Istanbul were affected by a reduction in size of the low yielding construction event,
Ankomak, but profits were still higher than in 2002.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review (continued)
Building and interiors exhibition International Sales Offices & Rest of World
We have international sales offices based in London and Hamburg which focus on selling international exhibitors
into our emerging market events (sales are shown in the regions where the events are held). We recently reviewed
the structure of our London office with a view to reducing overheads. Together with other cost control measures
we have successfully reduced our cost base in London by circa £1m on an annualised basis, without impacting
our sales capacity.
The Group has an increased focus in Africa, although this is not yet significant in revenue terms.  Our industry
brands are proving to be very strong – particularly in Oil and Gas where our brand has helped us win the tender
for the 2005 World Petroleum Congress in Johannesburg. This in turn has provided a platform for ITE to increase
the spread of our oil and gas events throughout the African market. If we consider a market to have significant
potential, we look to follow with the introduction of other selected events from our portfolio of sector brands.

Contemporary stand design Associates
During the year ITE held 50% interests in exhibition organising businesses in the Czech Republic, in Turkey and in
Egypt. As noted earlier, subsequent to 30 September we have disposed of our Czech Republic interests.
ITF in Istanbul has had an encouraging year, organising 16 events including the re-launch of important Auto events
which had been postponed following the economic crisis in 2001. This business is however still the lowest 
yielding market in which we operate. Although the increase in space sales was of real significance, the challenge
for the future is to improve the yields and profitability of the key events.
Outlook
ITE has made very significant steps in consolidating and securing its key business interests throughout the course
of the past year. We have considerable assets in our brands, international sales networks and local office 
infrastructures and these will underpin future growth. The markets in which we specialise continue to offer 
excellent prospects for us to develop and grow our business further.  We are also pursuing new market 
opportunities to leverage our brand strengths.  I look forward to and am excited by the prospects ahead.

Associates, Outlook Gross Profits increased to £26.7m from £21.4m in the prior year, with gross margins increasing to 45% from 41%
in the same period. The difference in our biennial pattern of events accounted for £4.4m of the increase in turnover
and for £2.4m of the increase in gross profits. 
Net Operating Expenses before goodwill amortisation of £12.7m (2002: £12.6m) includes £0.4m of redundancy
costs following a re-structuring of the London office in the summer (the prior year includes £1.4m of redundancy
costs and other non- recurring items).
A review of the expected useful economic life of the goodwill in our balance sheet was carried out in the second
half of the year. As a result of the review certain events are now being amortised over a shorter period which has
resulted in an increased amortisation charge for the year of £2.5m against £2.1m last year.
The share of associates’ operating profits was £0.7m in the year and related principally to the results of the
Turkish business, where the economy and the Turkish Lira showed signs of stabilising.  The comparative loss of
£1.4m in 2002 included £1m of non-recurring provisions for prepaid show costs. 
The Profit on Ordinary Activities before interest and tax of £11.6m is a £12.7m improvement on the prior year loss
of £1.1m.

Financial Review 
Post balance sheet event
On 7 November the Group sold its 50% shareholding in Incheba
Praha and its 50% profit share in the Coneco exhibition back to its
fellow investor, Incheba a.s. The overall loss of £0.8m on this 
transaction has been provided for at 30 September 2003. 
Incheba Praha had been accounted for as an Associated Company
until 31 March 2003, when as a result of our discussions with
Incheba a.s. at that time the Board concluded that it no longer
exerted significant influence over the activities of Incheba Praha.
Accordingly from 1 April 2003 the investment in Incheba Praha of
£0.2m was accounted for as an investment. The loss of £0.8m on
the sale of Coneco and Incheba Praha comprised £0.2m loss on 
disposal, the write off of a £0.5m prepayment made in connection
with Coneco venue rights, and the write off of £0.1m of 
outstanding debtor balances. Incheba a.s. has guaranteed the 
outstanding balance of the loan between ITE and Incheba Praha.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share increased to 3.1p from a loss of 1.0p
in the prior year.  The Group achieved Headline diluted earnings per
share of 4.2p per share compared with 2.4p for the year to 30
September 2002. Headline diluted earnings per share is based upon
profit before amortisation and impairment of goodwill, amounts 
written off investments and profits or losses on disposal of group
undertakings.
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 19
Turnover for the year was £58.9m against £52.4m for the prior year, an increase of 12%.  An analysis of the
change in composition of turnover is set out below: Cash flow
Net cash at 30 September 2003 was £22.1m (2002: £17.7m). The cash
inflow from operating activities was £14.4m (2002: £10.4m).  Of this
£1.3m was spent on acquisitions (mainly the purchase of an additional 15%
of the minority interest in ITE MODA Limited) and £2.3m was applied in 
settlement of existing deferred consideration commitments. A further
£4.0m was paid out in dividends and £3.7m in tax payments in the year. 
Interest
Net interest earned in the year was £0.7m, the same as the prior year. The
group held higher average cash balances through the year but our return
was reduced by the historically low interest rates available on Sterling,
Dollar and Euro deposits. The Group held most of its surplus cash in Sterling
throughout 2003. 
Taxation
The tax charge of £4.0m represents 26% of Headline pre-tax profits. Last
year it was anticipated that the effective tax charge of 25% would be 
continued into this year. The Group expects the tax charge to remain below
the UK corporation tax rate of 30% due to losses available in certain parts
of the Group and the lower tax rate experienced in some of our major 
overseas markets.
Treasury
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources, trade
debtors and trade creditors arising from its operations. It is the Group’s 
policy that minimal derivative transactions are undertaken and none were
undertaken in the year under review.
The main risks facing the Group are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk
and liquidity risk. The Board has reviewed and agreed policies to manage
these risks as follows:
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against
Sterling for both trading transactions and for the translation of net assets
and the profit and loss accounts of overseas operations. The principal 
exposure is to the Euro and Dollar exchange rates which form the basis of 
pricing for our international customers. During the year the Group 
experienced net foreign exchange losses of £0.4m (2002: £1.0m). The
exchange rate moved from $1.56: £1 at the beginning of the year to 
$1.68 : £1 at the end of the year and the exchange rate for the Euro
moved from 1.59 : £1  at the beginning of the year to 1.44 : £1 at 
30 September 2003.
The bulk of the Group’s business is in emerging markets, which by its
nature creates high levels of foreign currency risk. To offset some of this
risk, the Group invoices predominantly in Euros and US dollars. The Group
has a large proportion of its revenues and costs denominated in 
non-Sterling currencies. Sterling costs exceed Sterling revenue due to the
level of UK based costs – in particular London sales and head office costs.
In November 2002 the Group changed a significant proportion of its pricing
from Dollars to Euros. This change has made the Group less sensitive to
fluctuations in the US $ exchange rate at the year end and for the future.
It has not been Group policy to use derivative instruments to hedge foreign 
currency transactions due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of
transactions and the timing of cash flows from foreign currency receivables.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through cash holdings and debt facilities.
The objective of the Group is to maximise investment income and minimise
interest costs bearing in mind its liquidity requirements.  Throughout the
financial year no debt facilities have been required.
For short term debt, such as overdraft facilities or debt with a term of less
than six months, fixed or floating rates of interest are used.  For debt with
a term of greater than six months, it is policy that at least 75% must have
fixed rates of interest so as to minimise the Group exposure to interest rate
movements.  It is not group policy to hedge against interest rate 
movements.
It is Group policy that surplus cash is not invested in instruments that would
put the capital value at risk.  All invested funds have a determinable rate of
interest.
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 20 Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity of funding for operational needs
through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate.  The key
requirement for the business is to maintain flexibility to allow the Group to
take advantage of opportunities that could arise over the short term. The
needs of the business are determined on a rolling cash flow forecast basis,
covering weekly, monthly and twelve monthly requirements.  Short term
flexibility is maintained by holding cash in current accounts and high 
liquidity money market funds.  Should debt financing be required, the term
of the facility would be matched to funding needs.
Accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies are consistent with those of other
exhibition organisers.  Staff and exhibitor promotion costs are expensed as
incurred. Revenue and direct costs are not recognised until the completion
of an event. 
Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure on plant and equipment for the year of
£0.5m (2002: £0.7m) was largely on computer equipment and associated
software purchase and development. 
The Group funds the development of venues and facilities where such
improved facilities will improve the prospects and profitability of its
organising business. The funding can take the form of a prepayment of
future venue fees, or a loan which can be repaid by cash or by offset
against future venue fees. Generally the funding brings rights over future
venue use and advantageous pricing arrangements. Depending on the legal
form such funding advances are included in the Financial Statements as
either ‘Prepayments’ or ‘Other debtors’. 
At 30 September 2003 the Group’s sterling value of the outstanding 
balances was £3.3m (2002: £ 1.4m) advanced against facilities as follows:
St. Petersburg £1.6m
Almaty £0.7m
Kyiv £0.8m
Bulgaria £0.2m
Financial Review (continued)
These balances will be recovered from future venue use within three years
except in Bulgaria where ITE has no future events planned, and the loan will
be repaid by instalments.
Dividend
The Group has recommended a final dividend of 1.1p to give a total 
dividend of 1.6p for the year.  This compares to a total dividend in the prior
year of 2.45p.  The prior year dividend included 0.95p which related to the
year ended 30 September 2001, but which could not be paid in that year
for technical reasons.  Consequently, the Board increased the interim 
dividend for 2002 to make good this shortfall.  
Going concern
After considering the current financial projections for the Group, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate
resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.  For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
accounts.

Substantial shareholdings

Directors 
The current Directors and those who served throughout the year except as noted, are as follows:
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 23 Directors’ share interests
The interests of Directors in the ordinary share capital of the company 
are given in the Report on Remuneration on page 29.
Right to purchase the Company’s shares
At the last Annual General Meeting, the shareholders resolved to authorise
the Company to make one or more market purchases of up to 27,783,662
of the Company’s Ordinary Shares at a price between 1p (exclusive of
expenses) and 105% of the average middle market price for an Ordinary
Share as derived from the Official List of the UK Listing Authority for the
five business days immediately preceding the date on which the Ordinary
Share is purchased.
Donations
The Group made no charitable donations in the UK (2002: £4,320). 
No political donations were made.
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented,
high calibre employees focused on achieving excellent results.
Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by 
disabled persons, bearing in mind the aptitude of the applicant concerned.
In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled, every effort would 
be made to ensure their continued employment and progression in the
Group.  It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion
of disabled employees match that of other employees as far as possible.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to 
support the business in meeting its objectives.  This is reflected in the
training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree 
payment terms with suppliers when entering into each transaction to 
ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and abide
by the terms of payment.  As the Company is a holding company it has 
no trade creditors and accordingly no disclosure can be made of the 
year end creditor days.
Corporate social responsibility
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware of both the benefits to its business 
of engaging with its various constituencies in a socially responsible manner 
and the risks of failing to do so. As an operator of internationally focused 
businesses in emerging markets the Company ensures that it is culturally 
sensitive in its dealings with the local community and that its employment
and development policies are non discriminatory and encourage the 
employment of local nationals at all levels in the Company. Those employees
are encouraged to participate in and support their respective communities.
Ethics
The Company actively promotes integrity in its dealings with its employees,
customers and suppliers and with the authorities of the countries in which 
it operates and recognises that a reputation is a valuable and fragile asset 
gained over a substantial period. The leadership position of its exhibitions 
and the continued growth of its core shows is evidence of the success of 
its practices.
Environment
As a media services company, the Group acknowledges that its business has
an impact on the Environment, albeit relatively minor. The Company does not
manufacture or sell any tangible products. The Company controls actively its
energy costs and the office and other waste generated by its business.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will see from the Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
on page 68 that they are to consider and, if thought fit, to pass three 
resolutions as special business. These resolutions have become routine 
business at the annual general meeting of most public companies. 
The resolutions relate to:
renewal of the authority for the Directors to allot relevant securities;
renewal of the powers of the Directors to allot equity securities as if 
pre-emption rights did not apply; and
renewal of the authority for the Company to purchase certain of its own
shares, and to hold them as treasury shares.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting also includes two ordinary 
resolutions seeking approval for the establishment of new Performance
Share Plans.
Auditors
The Directors will place a resolution before the Annual General Meeting 
to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for the ensuing year.
The report of the Directors has been approved by the Board and signed 
on its behalf by:
Russell Taylor
Company Secretary
8 December 2003
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 25 Report on Corporate Governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance 
contained in the Combined Code which is appended to the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and for which the Board is accountable
to shareholders.
Statement about applying the principles of good governance
The explanation of how the principles have been applied is set out 
below and in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Report on
Remuneration. 
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets not less than seven times a year. The Board
considers a range of matters for its approval, including setting Group 
strategy, acquisition policy, the budgets, major capital expenditure, material
contracts and appointments to subsidiary Boards and monitors the 
performance of the businesses against appropriate forecasts or 
benchmarks.  The Board is supplied with financial and operational 
information on a timely basis, which the Board believes is in a form 
and of a quality to enable it to discharge its duties and carry out its 
responsibilities.  The Directors are provided with information and guidance
concerning the regulations applicable to Companies subject to the Listing
Rules and on their duties and responsibilities as Directors.  All Directors
have access to the Company Secretary and there is a procedure to enable
them to take additional independent professional advice at the expense 
of the Company. 
In addition to the Chairman, during the year the Board comprised three 
or four Non-executive Directors and five to seven Executive Directors. 
The Board currently has five Non-executive Directors and five Executive
Directors which it considers to be an appropriate balance of Executive 
and Non-executive Directors.  The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
are separate.
The Nomination Committee has considered all appointments to the Board
made since 1 April 2003. Prior to that date the Board considered the
appointment of Directors should involve all Directors.
The Directors’ diversity of experience and knowledge of the markets in
which ITE operates are key to the development of a robust strategy for the
Group and to its execution. The Non-executive Directors contribute an 
independent and objective view to the management of the company and
play a full and active part in the various Board committees.  The senior
independent Non-executive Director is Sir Jeremy Hanley.  The names and
biographies of the Directors are on pages 35 and 36.
Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a major shareholder of the Company has 
appointed Marco Sodi (who replaced Jeffrey Stevenson on 1 July 2003)
and Christopher Russell as its Nominee Directors pursuant to the terms
of its subscription agreement.  The Board do not consider that 
Messrs Sodi and Russell are independent in all matters but do consider 
that their independent judgement as members of the Remuneration, Audit,
Acquisition and Nomination Committees are not affected by their 
relationship with Veronis Suhler Stevenson.  The Board considers Iain
Paterson and Michael Hartley to be independent.  Sir Jeremy Hanley has a
marketing consultancy arrangement with the Company to promote and
open the Group’s shows in its overseas territories.  The Board does not
consider that the existing relationship between Sir Jeremy Hanley and the
Company materially interferes with the exercise of his independent 
judgement.
Any Directors appointed during the year are required to offer themselves
for re-election. In accordance with the Articles of the Company all the other
Directors are subject to re-election at least every three years as required
by the Provisions of the Code of Best Practice except the Directors 
appointed by Veronis Suhler Stevenson.
Board committees
The Board has established four principal committees all of which have 
written terms of reference.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises only Non-executive Directors. The
Committee, which is chaired by Sir Jeremy Hanley, meets at least 
twice a year. The other members are Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson 
and Christopher Russell.  The meetings are also attended by the 
Finance Director, the deputy Finance Director and the Auditors.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing accounting procedures and the
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 26 internal control environment. The Committee also reviews announcements
of the Company’s results and monitors compliance with accounting 
standards. In addition the Committee considers the appointment of the
Auditors, the scope of the audit and any issues arising, their fees and 
the nature, extent and costs of any non audit services provided by them. 
The Committee has access to any employee and is able to obtain 
external advice on any matter as required.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises only Non-executive Directors. 
The Committee, which is chaired by Sir Jeremy Hanley, meets at least 
three times a year. The other members are Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson
and Christopher Russell.  The meetings are also attended by the Chief
Executive Officer and external advisers as appropriate. It is the intention
that Michael Hartley will become Chairman effective at the Annual General
Meeting in 2004. 
Further information about the Committee is set out in the Report on
Remuneration on page 29.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Sir Jeremy Hanley, Michael Hartley,
Iain Paterson, Christopher Russell and Marco Sodi.  The Committee, which 
is chaired by Iain Paterson, is responsible, if requested by the Board, for
nominating candidates to the whole Board for approval and for considering
and making recommendations to the Board on its composition and balance.
Report on Corporate Governance (continued)
The Committee has been effective for all appointments made to the Board
since 1 April 2003.
The Acquisition Committee
The Acquisition Committee comprises Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson, 
Marco Sodi, Russell Taylor and Ian Tomkins.  The Committee, which is
chaired by Marco Sodi, is responsible to the Board for all aspects of all
acquisitions and divestments outside the ordinary course of business up 
to £5m in consideration.  Transactions of a greater size require the formal
approval of the Board.  The Committee is obliged to report regularly to 
the Board on all transactions under consideration or in contemplation.
Communication with shareholders
The Board considers communication with all shareholders to be extremely
important.  Shareholders are provided with full year and interim accounts 
to help them keep up to date with the performance of the Group and are
given the opportunity to ask questions directly of the Board at the Annual
General Meeting.  The Group’s website is regularly updated with copies of 
all Group press releases.
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives
between the Company and its institutional shareholders by making strategic
presentations to institutional investors every six months following the 
publication of the half year and annual results, by meeting shareholders 
to discuss long-term issues and obtaining feedback and by communicating
regularly throughout the year. 
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 27 Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
Except as disclosed above the Company has complied throughout the year
with the provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in section 1 of the
Combined Code.  The Board intends to comply with the provisions of the
revised Combined Code in as much as they are relevant to the Company.
Internal control
In applying the principle that the Board should maintain an ongoing 
sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Company’s assets, the Directors recognise that they have 
overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management to provide them with reasonable assurance regarding effective
and efficient operations, internal control and compliance with laws and 
regulations.  The objective of these systems is to provide reasonable
assurance of:
the identification and management of key business risks;
the safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or disposition;
the maintenance of proper accounting records and reliability of financial
information within the business for publication; and
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
·
·
·
·
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 28
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The system of internal control has been in place throughout the year and up
to the date of approval.  It is reviewed regularly by the Board and complies
with the Turnbull guidance. The Board has performed a specific assessment
of internal controls for the purpose of this annual report. The Audit 
Commitee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilites.
The Company does not currently have an internal audit function and the
Board considers that such a function is not currently needed. This position
is kept under review. Report on Remuneration
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Sir Jeremy Hanley
(Chairman), Iain Paterson, Christopher Russell and Michael Hartley. All the
members are Non-executive Directors. Sir Jeremy Hanley, the Chairman of
the Committee, is also the designated senior independent Non-executive
Director of the Company. Jeffrey Stevenson and Sir Hugh Bidwell were
members of the Committee until their resignations on 30 June 2003 and
19 September 2003 respectively.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and 
conditions of employment of the Executive Directors and key 
members of senior management; 
measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the
Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total remuneration on behalf 
of the whole Board; and
granting options under the various ITE group share option schemes 
detailed below.  
During the year the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants 
to advise on executive remuneration and the operation of the various ITE
group share option schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants have provided
no other advice to the Company. The Committee also received advice from
Ian Tomkins in relation to the remuneration of the Company’s senior 
executives (but not in relation to his own remuneration). 
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s principal policy aim is to ensure that remuneration offered 
is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and staff
with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’s strategy and grow
the business, having regard to the challenging economic conditions and
competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates.  
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the 
following factors:
the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies 
competing in the same markets as the Company;
the remuneration practice in the markets in which the Director is 
principally based;
the need to align the interests of the Directors with those of the 
shareholders;
the performance of the individual Director and of the Company as a whole;
and
any amounts payable to Directors in respect of services performed for 
the Associates of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors comprise base 
salary and benefits, a performance related bonus (save for Ross Stobie) 
and longer term share-based incentive arrangements. Therefore, a 
proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is performance-related. 
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are proposed by the Chief
Executive Officer and approved by the Board.
Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary: 
This is reviewed annually by the Committee. Base salary levels are set by
the Committee taking into account each Executive Director’s role, 
experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their
duties.
Variable bonus: 
Certain of the Executive Directors and senior management participate in
performance-related annual bonus schemes, which recognise Company
objectives. For the financial year commencing on 1 October 2003, Ian
Tomkins’ and Russell Taylor’s maximum annual bonus opportunity will be
85% and 50% of base salary respectively. The annual bonus opportunity 
of Edward Strachan is structured differently to take account of his specific
role. Ross Stobie and Ceyda Erem do not participate in an annual bonus
scheme.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 29 Long term incentives:
The Company operates the following option schemes: the ITE Group 
1998 Company Share Option Plan; the ITE Group 1998 Discretionary Share
Option Scheme; the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme,
and the ITE Group Employee Share Trust Unapproved Share Option Scheme. 
Options are granted under the ITE Group 1998 Company Share Option Plan
and the ITE Group 1998 Discretionary Share Option Scheme to ITE Group
employees (including Executive Directors who are employees). Options can
be granted under the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme
to certain key individuals who are not technically Group employees. The ITE
Group Employee Share Trust Unapproved Share Option Scheme can grant
options over shares held in the ITE Group Employees’ Share Trust. 
At the forthcoming AGM the Company is seeking approval for the 
establishment of a new Performance Share Plan under which it is intended
that awards be made to Executive Directors and other senior managers.
Appended to the Notice of AGM is a full description of the main features of
the new Plan including a full description of the performance conditions that
the Committee intends to apply to the initial awards that are to be made 
under the Plan. The relevant sections of the Notice of AGM form part 
of this report.
Pensions:
The Company does not itself have any pension arrangements. The Company
does however offer a stakeholder pension to its employees and contributes
10% of an employee’s contribution to an employee’s defined contribution
scheme.  During the year the Company has contributed to an individual
money purchase scheme on behalf of one of the Directors, until his 
resignation.
Directors’ service contracts
Executive Directors
Edward Strachan was appointed an Executive Director on 1 July 2003 
and is still remunerated as a consultant through the Company’s agreement
with Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited. 
The consultancy agreement (dated 30 September 2002) is for a minimum period of three years which is due to
end on 30 September 2005 and is structured to take account of his specific role and responsibilities.  From
September 2005, the consultancy agreement can be terminated on six months notice.
Consistent with market practice, other than Edward Strachan’s arrangements there are no service contracts or
other employment arrangements with any of the Executive Directors with notice periods in excess of one year or
terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess of one year’s package.
The dates of each contract and the relevant notice period are as follows:

Ian Tomkins’ contract provides that if within 12 months of a change in control of the Company his contract is 
terminated without notice (save in certain circumstances such as gross misconduct) or he resigns in circumstances
that amount to constructive dismissal, the Company shall pay him in lieu of notice (less statutory deductions) an
amount equal to 95% of salary, contractual benefits and bonus that he would have received had he remained in
employment during the notice period. For the purposes of calculating the bonus amount it will be assumed that the
target has been achieved.
The consultancy agreement relating to Edward Strachan provides that if following a change in control of the
Company his services are materially changed to his detriment, within six months of the change in control he 
can terminate the consultancy agreement on giving three months notice.
In the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s contract it is the Committee’s policy that (subject to
the provisions of each contract) the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the Executive Director will be 
determined by reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time. However, the Committee’s aim will
be to avoid rewarding for poor performance. Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive
Director’s duty to mitigate his loss.

As required by the legislation regarding disclosure in the remuneration
report, this graph illustrates the performance of the Company and a 
“broad equity market index” over the past five years.  As the Company 
is a constituent of the FTSE Small Cap index, that index is considered the
most appropriate form of “broad equity market index” against which the
Company’s performance should be graphed.  Performance, as required 
by the legislation, is measured by Total Shareholder Return (share price
growth plus dividends paid).

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 36 Directors’ responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  In preparing
those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They are also 
responsible for the systems of internal control, for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and we report if it does not.  We are not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as
described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Report on Remuneration and consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Report on Remuneration described as having been audited. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the 
financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company
and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the Report on Remuneration described as having been audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Report on
Remuneration described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as 
at 30 September 2003 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
The financial statements and part of the Report on Remuneration described as having been audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 43 The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been
applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its 
subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 September each year.  The results
of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to
the date on which control passed.  Acquisitions are accounted for under 
the acquisition method.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 
businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration
given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, 
is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful 
economic life, being between ten and up to a maximum of twenty years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 September 1998 
and earlier was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting
standard then in force.  As permitted by the current accounting standard
the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in
the balance sheet.  On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business,
the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is
included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
The useful economic lives for goodwill are periodically reviewed and this 
can result in them being reduced if circumstances dictate.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any 
provision for impairment.  Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed
assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, 
as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings - term of lease 
Plant and equipment - 4 years
Investments
Except as stated below, fixed asset investments are shown at cost less 
provision for impairment.  Current asset investments are stated at the
lower of cost and net realisable value.
In the Company balance sheet, for investments in subsidiaries acquired for
consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost
is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued.
Any premium is ignored.
Associates
In the Group accounts investments in associates are accounted for using
the equity method. The consolidated profit and loss account includes
the Group’s share of associates’ profits less losses while the Group’s share 
of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance
sheet. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for 
in accordance with the policy set out above. Any unamortised balance of
goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided 
in the ordinary course of business net of VAT and other sales related taxes.
Turnover is recognised when an event is completed.
Accounting Policies
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2003 44 Accounting Policies (continued)
Profit recognition on events
Profit is recognised when an event is completed.  Billings and cash received
in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events and
those straddling the year end, are deferred until the events are completed.
The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred
event income and prepaid event costs respectively.  Losses anticipated 
at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at
amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a
right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the company's taxable profits
and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange 
at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates 
of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling
at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of
the opening net assets and results of overseas operations and on foreign
currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment
in such operations, are reported in the Statement of total recognised gains
and losses. All other exchange differences are included in the profit and 
loss account. 
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
ITE Group plc

The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the parent company, ITE Group plc, was £4.9 million (2002: £9.4 million).  As permitted by Section
230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the parent company.

Factors that may affect future tax charges:
The Group has carried forward tax losses which should reduce tax payments in future years for some Group companies.   Capital allowances are expected to
continue to be in excess of depreciation in the next few years, although not significantly higher than for the current period.  The Group’s overseas tax rates
differ to the UK. The tax rate in Russia has reduced to 24%, whereas in Germany the effective rate is approximately 40%.
Interim paid of 0.5p (2002 – 1.45p) per ordinary share
Final proposed of 1.1p (2002 – 1.0p) per ordinary share
Under the terms of the trust deed dated 20 October 1998, the ITE Group Employees Share Trust, which holds 9,857,000 ordinary shares representing
3.5% of the Company’s called-up ordinary share capital, has agreed to waive all dividends due to it.

At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 November 1998, 
shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share
Ownership Trust (ESOT).  The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to
transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the Company’s
Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate
shares by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value.
The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued
ordinary share capital.  The ESOT held 9,857,000 shares in ITE Group plc 
at 30 September 2003 (2002: 9,957,000 shares). No grant of share
options has been made during the financial year.
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free
loan of up to £2.5 million for the purpose of buying shares.  At 30
September 2003, the amount of the loan drawn down was £2.1 million.
The ITE Group plc Company profit and loss account and balance sheet
include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2003.
The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend 
entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT.  No options were exercised and
105,000 options lapsed during the year.  A balance of 580,000 options
remained in issue at 30 September 2003. Details of the options in issue and
their exercise dates can be seen at Note 18 to the accounts.

The provision for national insurance on share options is calculated by reference to the employers national insurance cost on the potential gain based on the
difference between the exercise price and share price for those share options “in the money” at 30 September 2003.
Deferred taxation is shown at Note 7 to the accounts.
The onerous lease provision relates to the differential between rental income and lease commitments on two properties, one in the UK and one in the US.
The UK lease has a further 14 1/2 years to run and carries a rental of £90,000 per annum. On 20 December 2002 the Company subleased the property
for a period of five years for a rental of £62,000 per annum.   The differential has been provided for over the remaining term of the lease.  The US lease
runs to 2006 and has been fully provided for in this period.
The Financial Review provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group
faces in its activities.  The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the
strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13 “Derivatives and other financial
instruments: disclosures” (FRS 13).  Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary and associated companies are excluded from the scope of
these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.

Ceyda Erem has a controlling interest in CNR, a company that owns and
manages the largest exhibition halls in Istanbul and therefore, had a material 
interest in the purchase by the Group of its 50% interest in Istanbul Fuarcilik
A.S. (“ITF”) in December 1999. CNR was the vendor in that transaction and
continues to maintain an ongoing 50% interest in the Associate.
Commissions paid to ITF by the Group during the year amounted to £96,000
(2002: £140,000).  During the year ITF was charged approximately £3.7
million by CNR for rent, hall services such as electricity, security and 
advertising and stand construction (2002: £3.5 million).  At 30 September
2003 ITF owed ITE approximately £3,500 (2002: £21,000).  At 
30 September 2003 CNR owed ITF £1.2 million (2002: £2.4 million) of
which £0.9 million (2002: £2.0 million) has been provided against.
Ceyda Erem has advanced a loan to ITF for which no interest is charged.
The balance at the end of the year was £94,000 (2002: £224,000).
Alexander Rozin has a controlling interest in Incheba a.s. and therefore, 
held a material interest in the purchase by the Group of its 50% interest 
in Incheba Praha in November 1999.  Incheba a.s. was the vendor in that
transaction and continues to hold an ongoing 50% interest in the Associate.
Incheba a.s. and ITE advanced loans of CZK 130,750,000 (approximately
£2.5 million) each to Incheba Praha, on which interest has been charged 
at a variable rate of 1% above Euro LIBOR since 1 January 2002.  At 
30 September 2003 the principal and interest owed to ITE was £2.0 million
(2002: £2.5 million).  During the year the interest receivable by ITE was
£81,000 (2002: £85,000).  During the year there was a reversal of prior
period management fees to ITE of £416,000 and ITE received an invoice
towards flood damage costs of £388,000.  As at 30 September 2003,
Incheba Praha owed ITE £35,000 (2002: £0.9 million) for management 
and licence fees, which has been fully provided for.
Goodwill includes £2.0 million (2002: £2.6 million) in relation to the Coneco
exhibition run by Incheba a.s. to which ITE is entitled to 50% of the profits.
In 2003 no profit share has been recognised by ITE and amortisation of 
£0.6 million has been charged (2002: £442,000 before an amortisation
charge of £149,000).
Alexander Rozin received a salary and car allowance of $120,000 
(approximately £75,000) for being Chairman of Incheba Praha.
At 30 September 2003, Incheba a.s. owed ITE £110,000 (2002:
£210,000) in relation to the Coneco exhibition which has been included in
the provision for the loss on disposal.  The provision also includes a charge
of £0.5 million for a hall rental prepayment for the Coneco exhibition paid
to Incheba a.s. in 2001.  The remainder of the provision represents the 
carrying value of the investment in Incheba Praha of £181,000.
On 30 September 2002 ITE entered into an agreement with Kyzyl Tan
Consultants Limited, of which Edward Strachan is a shareholder,  to acquire
their 50% interest in various trade shows, for consideration of £150,000
and an amount based on the profit for the 2002 events (in 2002 assessed
to be £564,000).  The final consideration was £850,000.
In Kazakhstan, Iteca has transacted with Datacom, Expo Design and Saban
Holding for the provision of web systems, stand construction services and
office rental respectively.  Edward Strachan is a shareholder of all three
companies.  In total the services charged to Iteca were approximately
£150,000.  No amounts were owed to these companies at 
30 September 2003.

Additional information relating to the resolutions 13 and 14 above
The ITE Group plc Employees' Performance Share Plan 2004 (the 
"Employee Plan") and The ITE Group plc Key Contractors' 
Performance Share Plan 2004 (the "Key Contractor Plan") 
(together the "Plans"). 
Introduction: The principal terms of the proposed Employee Plan are set out
below. The principal terms of the Key Contractor Plan are broadly similar.
However, under the Key Contractor Plan only those who provide services to
a member of the Group (meaning the Company and any of its subsidiaries) 
under a contract for services are eligible to participate and references to
cessation of employment within the Group are replaced with references to
ceasing to provide services to a member of the Group.  The Employee Plan
limits set out below also apply to awards made under the Key Contractor
Plan.  
The Employee Plan may operate in conjunction with the ITE Group 
Employees' Share Trust (the "Trust"). The Trust may be funded by 
the Company to allow it to purchase or subscribe for Ordinary Shares in the
Company to satisfy awards made under the Employee Plan. The Employee
Plan limits referred to below will also apply in respect of all Ordinary Shares
in the Company ("Ordinary Shares") issued to the Trust to satisfy awards
under the Employee Plan. 
Awards under the Employee Plan will take the form of either a contingent
right to receive Ordinary Shares in the future free of charge (a "Contingent
Award") or an option with an option price set at the nominal value of 1p per
Ordinary Share.  Awards under the Key Contractor Plan will only take the
form of an option.  
The Plans will be administered by the Remuneration Committee (the
"Committee").
Key features of the Employee Plan
Eligibility: Any employee or full-time director of the Company or of any
other member of the Group will be eligible to participate. Awards may be
granted up to six months from reaching normal retirement age. 
Making of awards: Awards may usually only be made under the Employee
Plan, at the discretion of the Committee, within 42 days of the 
announcement of the Company's final or interim results.  However, where
the Committee considers there are exceptional circumstances awards may
ITE Group Plc
Annual Report 2003 70 be made at other times. The Plan will have a ten year life, although the
Committee will review it after no more than five years.
Vesting of awards: Awards vest after a three year period provided 
performance conditions have been achieved. Unvested awards will normally
lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group. However, in
certain "good leaver" situations (such as illness, disability, redundancy etc),
or in other exceptional circumstances, awards may vest early subject to the
extent to which the Committee determines that the performance conditions
are achieved at the date of cessation. 
On retirement awards will either remain unaffected or, if the Committee
determines, may vest early subject to the extent to which the Committee
determines that the performance conditions have been achieved at the date
of retirement, with account also taken of the time elapsed since grant. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, awards may vest early
subject to the extent to which the Committee determines that the 
performance conditions have been achieved at the date of the change of
control, with account also taken of the time elapsed since grant.
Participants will either be required to pay the 1p nominal value to acquire
the Ordinary Shares on exercise, or will acquire the Ordinary Shares on 
vesting for no cost. The Employee Plan will also allow awards, if the
Committee so determines, to be satisfied by a "cash alternative" payment,
although it is not currently envisaged that this feature will be used.
Performance conditions: For all awards made in the current financial year,
the performance condition will be based on the Company's aggregate fully
diluted headline EPS (excluding the costs associated with awards made
under the Employee Plan and any other share awards) over the three year
period following grant as follows:
Straight line vesting occurs between aggregate EPS of 12p and 13.5p.
There will be no re-testing of the performance conditions if the targets are
not achieved at the end of the relevant three year period. Therefore, if the
performance condition is not met at the end of this period the award will
lapse. These performance conditions have been chosen by the Committee
to take account of the Company’s biennial business cycle and to incentivise
management to deliver sustained EPS performance over the relevant three
year period in excess of expectations. The Committee will, for the purposes
of third party verification, confirm the extent to which these targets are
met with external advisers.
For future awards, the Committee will ensure that a similar approach is
taken to setting targets and the Committee will consult with the Company's
major shareholders in this respect.  However, the Committee intends to
obtain formal shareholders' approval before any materially different 
performance conditions are applied to future awards.
Individual limits: Awards over shares worth no more than 1 x base salary
may be made each year. 
Share retention: The Company intends to introduce an internal share 
ownership policy that will apply to Executive Directors.  This will require
Executive Directors to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-
tax gain made on the vesting or exercise of awards under the Employee
Plan, until they have built up a shareholding equal to 1 x base salary.
Employee Plan Limits: It is intended that either market purchased or new
issue shares will be used to source Ordinary Shares for awards. To the
extent that new issue shares are used, these will count towards the 
aggregate limit that provides that no more than 10% of the Company's
issued share capital should be subject to awards made under the Plans or
awards or options made under any other share incentive scheme adopted by
the Company in any ten year period.  In addition, also to the extent that

12p - 13.5p new issue shares are used, no more than 5% of the Company's issued share
capital can be subject to awards made under the Plans or awards or options
made under any other share incentive scheme adopted by the Company in
the ten year period following adoption of the Plans, subject always to
adherence to the 10% in ten year limit.
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares: Ordinary Shares issued or transferred
to participants on the vesting or exercise of an award will rank equally with
the Ordinary Shares then in issue save for rights attaching to Ordinary
Shares by reference to a record date preceding the date of vesting or 
exercise. The Company will apply to the UK Listing Authority for admission
to the Official List of any new Ordinary Shares issued.
Adjustment of awards: In the event of a variation in the Company's share
capital, such as a rights or capitalisation issue or reduction of capital, the
Committee may make an appropriate adjustment to the number of shares
over which an award has been made.
Amendments to the Employee Plan: The Committee may at any time amend
the Employee Plan in any respect providing that any amendment to the
rules dealing with who is eligible to participate, individual or Employee Plan
limits or the rule dealing with the adjustment of options following a variation
of share capital cannot be altered to the advantage of participants unless
approved by the Company in general meeting (except for minor 
amendments to benefit the administration of the Employee Plan or to take
account of changes in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable 
taxation, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the Company, the
Group or for a participant).
PAYE/NIC elections: The Employee Plan provides an indemnity to the
Company from the award holder in respect of any income tax and 
employee's national insurance liabilities. It also allows the Company to sell
shares on the award holder's behalf to meet these liabilities.
If the award takes the form of an option the award holder may, in the
Committee's discretion, and as a condition of exercise of an award, be
required to indemnify the Company in respect of any employers' national
insurance liability (or overseas equivalent) on exercise or alternatively, to
enter into an election with the Company to pass this liability from the
Company to the award holder.
Overseas Employee Plan: The Employee Plan provides that additional 
sections of the rules may be adopted for participants outside of the UK.
Awards granted under such additional sections may be granted subject to
different terms and conditions in order to take account of local laws.
However, additional sections must conform to the basic principles of the
Employee Plan and must not increase the limits set out in the Employee
Plan.
Pension: Awards under the Plans are not pensionable.

December 2006. I am delighted to report 
that the Group has had an extremely 
successful year growing substantially 
both organically and through acquisition. 
In December 2007, we further increased 
our	global	presence	by	opening	an	office	
in India, which complements our Singapore 
and	Chinese	offices.
Results
Our revenue from ship broking 
increased in US Dollar terms by 54% to 
US$39.3 million (2007: US$25.6 million). 
Excluding the effect of the acquisition of 
ACM Shipping Services Limited (ACMSS), 
like for like revenue in Dollars increased 
b y 	 2 2 % 	 o n 	 2 0 0 7 . 	 W e 	 fi x e d 	 a 	 r e c o r d 	 n u m b e r	
of ships and our forward income from 
time charters as at 31 March 2008 is 
at US$24.7 million, up 27% on last year. 
Sale and purchase had an exceptional 
year and the current forward order book 
is valued at US$7.5million. The weakness 
of the US Dollar continued to have an 
adverse effect on our Sterling equivalent 
revenues. Notwithstanding this weakness 
p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 a m o r t i s a t i o n 	 a n d 	 t a x a t i o n 	 w a s	
up 49% to £5.5 million (2007: £3.7 million), 
with adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(at 22.2 pence) up 49% on the preceding 
year. The business has remained extremely 
cash generative. The acquisition cost 
of ACMSS was £9.6 million paid by a mix 
of shares and cash.
Dividend
ACM is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy. The Directors 
are recommending a final dividend 
of 4 pence per share in respect of 
the year to 31 March 2008, making a 
total of 6 pence per share for the year. 
The dividend is payable on 9 October 2008 
to shareholders on the register as at 
12 September 2008.
Employees
Since our inception 26 years ago, the 
Group has developed a very successful 
business with an extensive and loyal 
list of clients. It has been particularly 
encouraging that we have been able 
to expand our teams with a number of 
well‑known senior brokers in the industry. 
We look forward to continuing to build 
on this strong platform. It is appropriate 
to extend our thanks to all members 
of our staff for their wholehearted 
commitment to our continued success.
Strategy
ACM’s strategy is to expand into an 
international	diversified	and	integrated	
shipping services provider, whilst 
maintaining its position as one of 
the	most	profitable	firms	in	the	tank er	
broking business. Our aim is to gain 
market share by continuing to build an 
expert team of brokers to penetrate new 
regional markets and other shipping 
sectors in order to grow the business 
with existing and new clients.
Current trading
The start to the current year has been 
encouraging .	F reight	rates	have	been	firm	
and the number of spot deals contracted 
has continued to rise. Despite the world 
economic problems, the prospect for the 
tanker freight market in the near term is 
good as global demand for transporting 
oil continues to be positive. Given the 
strength of our forward order book and 
the new areas ACM are moving into, the 
Board 	 looks 	 to 	 the 	 future 	 with 	 confidence.

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We are extremely pleased with the 
progress the Group has made during the 
year, both in terms of results for the year 
and investment in our future. Our US 
Dollar income, including four months 
of our new acquisition, ACMSS, was up 
54% on the previous year. Excluding this 
acquisition our Dollar income grew 22%. 
This follows an 8% increase in the previous 
year. We have also continued to invest for 
organic growth in terms of brokers both 
in the UK and overseas.
Spot brokerage
The core of ACM’s business is spot 
brokerage, which involves the hire of a 
vessel for a single voyage. The number 
of	spot	deals	fixed	during	the	year	is	an	
important performance indicator of the 
business. This grew 12% year on year 
following a 15% increase the previous 
year. Total spot income in US Dollars 
showed a 14% uplift. Our average freight 
income per deal increased slightly during 
the	year .	This	was	due	to	a	significant	
increase in rates in the last few months 
of the year following a period of relatively 
subdued rates in the previous months.
Time charter
Our time charter business, which involves 
the long‑term hire of tankers, had an 
excellent year. Income in US Dollars 
for the year showed a 45% increase over 
t h e 	 p r e v i o u s 	 y e a r . 	 A n 	 i m p o r t a n t 	 b e n e fi t 	 o f	
having a strong time charter ethos is that 
it gives the Group a forward order book. 
At the year end, ACM’s forward order book 
stood at over US$24.7 million and showed 
an increase of 27% on the previous year. 
This income includes certain contracts 
which run to 2018, but US$9.0 million 
of this will be invoiced in the 2008/9 
financial	year .
Sale and purchase
Our sale and purchase business was 
considerably strengthened during the 
year by our acquisition of ACMSS in 
December 2007. ACMSS business had 
an exceptional period of trading following 
the acquisition. Although we do not expect 
this level of performance to continue, 
we believe it continues to be a sound 
investment and was an important strategic 
move for the Group which will strengthen 
ACM globally.
Overseas operations and new markets
We have continued to expand our 
business globally. Our Indian office, 
which formally opened for business in 
December 2007, has already started to 
show very encouraging signs of its ability 
to increase our global market share of the 
tanker business. This follows a year of 
becoming established and training our 
e m p l o y e e s . 	 O u r 	 S i n g a p o r e 	 o f fi c e 	 c o n t i n u e d	
t o 	 s u p p o r t 	 o u r 	 U K 	 o f fi c e 	 a n d 	 a l s o 	 i n c r e a s e d	
its own direct business. In China we are 
in the process of changing our operation 
from a joint venture to a wholly owned 
and controlled operation. We believe that 
this approach will increase our opportunities 
to do business in the new building arena 
in this important market.
In early 2007 we started to become involved 
in the gas shipping market. This business 
is now showing signs of genuine progress 
and	we	are	confident	about	a	successful	
future for ACM in this market.
Joint venture
Our joint venture with GFI Group, Inc. to 
conduct derivative brokerage had another 
good year although the contribution 
t o 	 p r o fi t 	 w a s 	 s l i g h t l y 	 b e l o w 	 l a s t 	 y e a r	
at £0.9 million.
Acquisition of Harris & Dixon Shipbrokers
On 23 June 2008 we announced the 
acquisition of the ship broking business 
of Harris & Dixon Shipbrokers Limited. 
This acquisition is an excellent strategic 
step for ACM as they specialise in the 
one area of tanker broking that ACM 
is not currently involved in. Furthermore 
the deal will quickly become earnings 
enhancing. Harris & Dixon have an 
extremely experienced broking team who 
are committed to the Company for the 
long‑term; they bring with them a solid 
forward book and the combined customer 
bases will provide further exciting trading 
opportunities for the Group.
Outlook
This has been an exciting period for ACM, 
both organically and through acquisition. 
Our international footprint is growing and 
we are confident that this base along 
with synergies gained through acquisition 
will	help	drive	profitability	throughout	
the organisation.

Profit and earnings
P rofit	before	taxation	for	the	year	was	
£4.8 million (2007: £3.7 million). After 
adding back amortisation of £0.7 million 
on intangible assets arising out of the 
acquisition during the year, adjusted 
p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 t a x 	 a n d 	 a m o r t i s a t i o n 	 w a s	
£5.5 million. This represents an increase 
of 49% over the previous year.
Earnings per share increased from 
14.9 pence in 2007 to 19.3 pence basic, 
19.2 pence diluted, 22.3 pence adjusted 
and 22.2 pence on an adjusted 
diluted basis.
Foreign exchange
The bulk of the Group’s income 
is denominated in US Dollars. The US 
Dollar further weakened during the year. 
The average effective exchange rate for 
the year was US$2.00 compared with 
US$1.94 for the previous year, while the 
rate at 31 March 2008 was US$1.99 
compared with US$1.96 for the previous 
year. The Group’s revenue would have 
been higher by approximately £0.5 million 
if the 2007/8 US Dollar income had been 
translated at 2006/7 exchange rates.
Dividends
The	Directors	are	recommending	a	final	
dividend of 4 pence per share in respect 
of the year to 31 March 2008 at a total 
value of £691,000. T ogether with an interim 
dividend of 2 pence paid during the year, 
the total dividend in respect of the year 
would be 6 pence at a total value 
of £1,037,000.
Cash flow 
One of the key attributes of the Group is 
its cash generative nature. Cash generated 
from operating activities was £4.7 million 
( 2 0 0 7 : 	 i n fl o w 	 £ 0 . 3 	 m i l l i o n ; 	 l o w 	 d u e 	 t o	
s e t t l e m e n t 	 o f 	 p r e 	 I P O 	 b o n u s e s ) . 	 T h i s 	 i n fl o w	
excludes a further £1.3 million (2007: 
£1.4 million) received from joint ventures 
and associates. The cash balance at 
the year end was £3.6 million (2007: 
£0.6 million). However it should be noted 
that deferred consideration on the 
acquisition of ACMSS of £2.9 million 
was paid on 3 April 2008. The cash 
outflow	for	this	acquisition	during	the	
year was £0.2 million, being £2.8 million 
cash consideration less £2.6 million 
cash acquired.
Balance sheet 
Included within non‑current assets is 
£8.7 million for intangible assets which 
resulted from the acquisition of ACMSS.
Share capital has increased as 1,963,003 
shares were issued as part consideration 
for the acquisition of ACMSS. A share 
premium account of £3.7 million has been 
set up as a result of this acquisition, being 
the difference in value between the nominal 
value of the shares and the market value 
at the date of the acquisition.
T h e 	 p e n s i o n 	 d e fi c i t 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 d e fi n e d 	 b e n e fi t	
scheme has reduced to £1.0 million from 
£1.5 million. A deferred tax asset of 
£0.3 million (2007: £0.5 million) exists 
as a result of this liability. This scheme 
is closed to new members.
The value of net assets at the balance sheet 
date was £7.9 million (2007: £1.5 million).
Risk management
The Board seeks to identify and monitor 
risks facing the business.
Foreign exchange risk; the majority of 
the Group’s income is denominated in US 
Dollars and the rate of exchange relative 
to Sterling can have an effect on the 
performance of the Group. The Group 
uses foreign exchange instruments to 
manage this risk. At March 31 2008 the 
Group had forward foreign exchange 
contracts in place to sell US$6.4 million 
(2007: US$nil) into Sterling. The Board 
has introduced a policy to continually 
have some forward cover in place 
to help manage this risk.
Liquidity risk; at 31 March the Group did 
not hold any net debt but had overdraft 
facilities 	 with 	 its 	 bank 	 to 	 allow 	 flexibility 	
in its cash management and also to meet 
the Group’s commitments to pay deferred 
consideration in respect of the acquisition.
Interest rate risk; the Group has exposure 
to movements in interest rates in respect 
of its deposits and also in respect of the 
overdraft when utilised. All deposits are 
made with reputable banks.
International Financial Reporting Standards
These	financial	statements	are	the	first

Employees
The Group has high regard for its employees. The Group seeks to enhance their careers with training and career development

Directors’ responsibilities

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the

statements, the Directors are required to:
b select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
b  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
b  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors, individually, are aware:
b there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and
b  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
Donations 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £27,817 (2007: £29,932).
Financial risk

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Introduction
The Board is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance. Although under the rules of AIM the Group is 
not required to comply with the Combined Code, the Directors intend to comply so far as reasonably practicable for a Company 
of ACM’s size and nature. Where full compliance is not appropriate due to the Company’s size and/or nature, the Directors will 
refer to guidance for AIM listed companies issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board of directors
The Board consists of three executive and three non‑executive Directors, a composition which the Board believes is best suited 
to the continued success of the Group. 
The Board is responsible for establishing the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring the Group’s performance against its 
business plan. It is also responsible for leading and controlling the Group and in particular for formulating, reviewing and approving 
the Group’s strategy, budget, major items of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals. Regular meetings are held and all 
necessary information is supplied on a timely basis to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. Additionally, special meetings 
take place, or other arrangements are made when Board decisions are required in advance of the regular meetings. 
It is the Company’s policy that Directors are re‑elected by shareholders and the Company’s Articles require one third to retire 
by rotation. 
Board committees
The Board has a remuneration committee, an audit committee and a nomination committee. Each of these committees consist 
of the three non‑executive Directors and are chaired by Peter Sechiari. The Board has also recently set up a compliance committee 
consisting of Peter Sechiari and Ian Hartley.
The remuneration committee is discussed within the directors’ remuneration report.
The audit committee meets whenever there is business to discuss and meets at least twice each year. The audit committee is 
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on. It also 
meets with the auditor without executive Directors being present and review reports from the auditor relating to accounts and internal 
control systems.
The nomination committee has responsibility for making recommendations on the appointment of additional Directors 
to the Board and the appointment of members of the Company’s senior management team. It meets at least twice a year. 
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. Although no system can provide absolute assurance against misstatement 
or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance. The Board is also responsible 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the system.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Shareholder relations
The Board places significant importance on maintaining good communications with its shareholders. This includes meetings 
with shareholders and analysts as appropriate. Shareholders are also invited to the Company’s Annual General Meeting, 
where questions are taken. The Company also uses its Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Statement and website  
(www.acmshippinggroup.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
Corporate governance 15
ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of the three non‑executive Directors; Peter Sechiari (as Chairman), David Cobb and 
Timothy Chadwick. The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The remuneration committee 
considers all material elements of remuneration policy, including remuneration and incentives of executive Directors and senior 
management (including pension rights and compensation payments) with reference to independent remuneration research and 
professional advice. The Board is responsible for implementing the recommendations and agreeing the remuneration packages 
for individual Directors. The remuneration committee is also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under 
share option and incentivisation schemes. No Director is able to participate in discussions relating to his own terms and 
conditions of remuneration. Non‑executive Directors’ and Chairman’s fees are determined by the full Board on the advice of the 
remuneration committee.

Annual bonus
In order to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees a significant proportion of remuneration packages of executive 
Directors and senior management are geared towards an annual bonus. The Group adopts an industry standard bonus model 
whereby proportions of revenue and profit are distributed to senior employees as bonuses. The individual allocation of this bonus 
between the Directors and senior employees is discretionary. This discretion is exercised by the remuneration committee upon 
the recommendation of senior executives.
Pension contributions
The Company makes pension contributions on behalf of its executive Directors. James Gundy is a member of the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme. Ian Hartley is a member of the Group’s stakeholder scheme. John Plumbe chose not to have pension contributions 
paid on his behalf and exercised his right to receive an allowance equivalent to the Company contribution, net of national 
insurance. The non‑executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s pension schemes. 
Share incentives
The following Director was granted options under the EMI scheme in July 2007:
Ian Hartley   – awarded 48,661 options at an option price of 205.5 pence vesting between July 2010 and July 2012.

contracts with a notice period of six months after an initial one year term.
Directors’ remuneration report 16
ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the financial statements) of ACM Shipping Group plc for 
the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and company balance sheets, 
the group cash flow statement, the group statement of changes in equity and the group statement of recognised income and 
expenses and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the 
directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the directors’ remuneration report that is cross referred from 
the business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, the chairman’s 
statement, the chief executive’s review of the business, the financial review and the corporate governance statement. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.

principles of merger amounting.

Group cash flow statement
Year ended 31 March 2008 23
ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and those EU endorsed IFRS standards 
and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements 
(July 2008). The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
ACM Shipping Group plc’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (UK GAAP) until 31 March 2007. UK GAAP differs in some areas from IFRS. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the Directors have amended certain accounting methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with IFRS. 
Reconciliations and descriptions of the effect of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the Group’s equity and its net income 
and cash flows are provided in note 28. 
The Group’s transition date is 1 April 2006 and it prepared its opening IFRS balance sheet at that date. The Group’s IFRS adoption 
date is 1 April 2007.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as noted below.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for the parent company as provided by section 230, Companies Act 1985.
(b) Basis of consolidation
ACM Shipping Group plc was formed on 7 November 2006. These are the second statutory accounts for ACM Shipping Group plc 
and reflect the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 March 2008. 
The Company was formed solely to act as a parent undertaking to companies already in the Group. The initial shareholders of the 
Company received shares in ACM Shipping Group plc in exchange for their shares in ACM Shipping Limited. IFRS 3 has not been 
applied as this business combination falls outside the scope of IFRS 3.The transfer of ownership has therefore been accounted 
for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting since the members of ACM Shipping Group plc at the date of the share 
transfer and their rights relative to each other were unchanged. Hence the members had a continuing interest in the business 
both before and after the incorporation of ACM Shipping Group plc.
Under the principles of merger accounting, the assets and liabilities of ACM Shipping Limited and its subsidiary and associated 
undertakings have been brought in at their book values.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ACM Shipping Group plc and its subsidiary and associated 
undertakings and joint venture arrangements.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the Company and 
the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission. This is 
generally the point at which there is completion of contractual terms between the principles of a transaction. Time charter revenue 
is recognised on a monthly basis.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is provided 
on a straight line basis over the expected economic life of that asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements  – seven years
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – two to five years
(e) Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor 
are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(f)	 P ension	costs	and	other	post‑retirement	benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and recognises the pension liability in the Group balance sheet. The liability 
is the present value of the accrued defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme’s 
assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligations are measured using the projected unit method and discounted 
at an AA corporate bond rate. Assets are valued at market value.
The Company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes have been charged against 
profit as they fall due.
Notes to the financial statements

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies continued
(g) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset 
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
(h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. 
At each balance sheet, monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date with any 
gain or loss being included in the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas operations are converted at the balance sheet rate while the income statement 
is translated at the average rate for the year. Any exchange gain or loss arising on consolidation is charged to reserves.
(i) Joint ventures
The Group’s investment and share of the profits or losses of the joint ventures are included in the financial statements using 
the equity method.
(j) Investments
All investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(k) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. 
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill 
relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(l) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition 
less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward 
order book and customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either 
the expected due dates for future income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. 
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they 
may be impaired. The estimated useful life of the items in the forward order book is generally three to four years and for the 
customer relationships is ten years.
(m) Share‑based payments
The Company awards employees bonuses in the form of share options, on a discretionary basis from time to time. The options 
are normally subject to vesting conditions and, where it is considered likely that the conditions will be met, their fair value is recognised 
as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other reserve equity over the vesting period. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised.
(n) Financial instruments
Classification
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ 
funds) only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial 
assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
Notes to the financial statements continued

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies continued
(n) Financial instruments continued
Classification	continued
 b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non‑derivative 
that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that 
will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument 
so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called 
up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
The Company’s share capital is treated as equity.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity .
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Forward contracts
The Company uses forward contracts for foreign currency and accounts for these using hedge accounting.
(p) Adopted IFRS not yet applied
The following IFRS were available for early adoption but have not been applied by the Group in these accounts. Their adoption 
is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
 b  IFRS 3 Business combinations – revised. Applies to business combinations for accounting periods commencing on or after 
1 July 2009. There is no requirement for this to be applied retrospectively.
 b  IFRS 8 Operating segments. Replaces IAS 14 and applies for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the business has only one business segment and accordingly this standard will have 
no impact.
 b IAS 23 Borrowing costs (revised). Applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
 b  IFRIC 11 re IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions. Applied to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 March 2007.
 b IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements. Applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008.
 b IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes. Applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2008.
 b  IFRIC 14 The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction. Applies to accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008.
2. Segmental reporting
The Group has taken early adoption of IFRS 8 Operating segments. The Group operates in one business sector and does 
not report internally any segmental information other than revenue streams. As a result no additional business sector information 
is provided. Business is the Group’s primary reporting segment. Geographical information is not produced and is not readily 
available. In view of management the cost of developing this information would be excessive.

10. Intangible assets continued
The Group has capitalised the value of the forward order book and customer relationships of ACMSS acquired in the year. 
Goodwill has been allocated to the ACMSS cash generating unit for impairment testing purposes. The recoverable amount 
has been determined based on a value in use calculation using risk‑adjusted cash flow projections based on financial budgets 
prepared by the Group. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are:
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 11%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect market assessment of specific risks associated with the segment cash flows.
The period over which cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by the Board is one year .
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period is 3%.
Management believe that it is unlikely that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying 
value of any of the cash‑generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.

scheme and contributes to independent funds on behalf of certain of the Group’s employees.
The operating charge for pension costs in the year is:
        2008 2007 
        £000 £000
UK defined benefit cost       167 188
Defined contribution scheme costs       325 149
        492 337
The last full funding valuation on the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2005. A qualified independent actuary 
has carried out a valuation for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 March 2008 to obtain the figures in this disclosure note. The figures 
for the year ending 31 March 2007 have also been included for comparison.
The projected unit valuation method has been used. 32

Scheme assets are stated at their bid values at the respective balance sheet dates. The expected long‑term rate of return on 
equities and DGFs of 7.5% pa reflects historic UK equity returns and DGFs and is within the range of assumptions typically used 
by other companies. The expected long‑term rate of return on cash of 4.6% pa is based upon the gross redemption yield available 
on long‑dated gilts.

On 27 November 2006 the shareholders in ACM Shipping Limited entered into an agreement under which each ordinary share 
of £1 each in ACM Shipping Limited was acquired by ACM Shipping Group plc in consideration of 1,000 new ordinary shares 
of 1 pence each in ACM Shipping Group plc.
20. Share‑based payments
During the year, the Group made grants under two share option schemes that fall to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme and Sharesave Scheme have been set up to provide executives and employees 
with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company.
Under the EMI Scheme, 48,661 options over ordinary shares of 1 pence each in ACM Shipping Group plc were granted 
to a Director during the year. There are no performance conditions attaching to this grant which vests 50% after three years, 
25% after four years and 25% after five years subject only to the Director remaining with the Group. The exercise price of this 
award is 205.5 pence which was the share price at the time of the grant. The fair value of the award at grant date was determined 
using the Binomial option pricing model at 45.2 pence. The life of the award was assumed to be five and a half years based 
on a discussion of likely exercise dates with the Director granted the award.
Under the Sharesave Scheme, 60,000 options with a three year savings requirement and 157,500 options with a five‑year savings 
requirement were granted over ordinary shares of 1 pence each in ACM Shipping Group plc during the year. There are no performance 
conditions but employees granted options under the award are required to remain employed by the Group and to save agreed 
amounts from their salaries over a three year or five year term respectively. At the end of that term, the saved amount together 
with interest and a bonus can be used to exercise options in the Group in the following six months. The exercise price of the award 
is 160 pence and the share price at grant date was 199 pence. The fair value of the awards at grant date was determined using the 
Black‑Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average fair value of the awards at grant date was 51 pence. The assumed lives 
of the awards used in the option pricing model were three and a quarter and five and a quarter years respectively. 
Other assumptions used in the application of the option pricing models were: 
b Risk‑free interest rate in the range 4.1% – 5.7% for the different grants 
b Dividend yield  3%
b Volatility 20%
Expected volatility was estimated by reference to historical share price movements in both the Group and comparable quoted 
companies with a longer listing history than the Group.
There were no options under either scheme that were outstanding at the beginning of the year or that were exercised, 
forfeited or expired during the period. There were no options exercisable at the end of the year.
The total charge in the consolidated income statement for the year with regard to these awards is £9,000, (2007: £nil).
The Group also has a Long Term Investment Plan which was approved at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. To date no awards 
have been made under this plan. 35

Cash and cash equivalents      566 2,999 3,565
25. Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management policies are designed to reduce the risk of currency, liquidity and credit risk exposure.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and other items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise 
directly from its operations. The Group does not engage in instruments of a speculative nature. An analysis of cash and cash 
equivalents is given in note 24. 
The Group carries out most of its business in US Dollars and hence it is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange 
rates. So as to mitigate this risk the Group places forward contracts for the sale of US Dollars at fixed rates. The purpose of such 
transactions is to manage the currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. At year end the Group had contracts outstanding to 
sell US$6.4 million (2007: nil) and to receive Sterling. These contracts all had a maturity date of less than one year and were contracted 
at rates ranging from $1.92 to $2.03 to £1.
At each balance sheet date, these contracts are restated to their fair value, based on currency contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
At 31 March 2008 the fair value of these contracts was £1,000 (2007: nil).
The rate on the balance sheet date was $1.99 to £1 (2007: $1.96).
The Group has no other assets or liabilities that fall to be classed as derivatives.
The Group finances itself through retained earnings. The Group is fundamentally cash‑generative and manages its liquid resources 
so as to obtain the best available rates of return on cash investments, whilst retaining access to those resources. 
As at 31 March 2008 all amounts were held in Sterling except for bank accounts totalling US$2.4 million (2007: US$2.1 million). 
There is no difference between the book values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial 
assets is represented by the carrying value of receivables as at the balance sheet date. 36

27. Business combinations
On 6 December 2007 the Group acquired 100% of Alchemy Trading Company Limited, which owned the remaining 70% interest 
in ACMSS that the Group did not already own, for a total consideration of £9.6 million.
The provisional fair value of the assets acquired was:

         9,577
In the year ACMSS contributed £588,000 to the net profit of the Group after amortisation of intangible assets. If the combination 
had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit contributed to the Group would have been £1,191,000 and revenue contributed 
would have been £7,484,000.
Included in the £7,408,000 of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and 
reliably measured due to their nature. These items include an assembled workforce and the detailed knowledge and expertise 
of the specialist markets.
£1,958,000 of intangible assets were separated from goodwill as part of this business combination and relate to the forward order 
book and customer relationships. The fair values of these intangible assets were calculated by an independent valuer using the 
net present value of future cash flows.
The Company issued 1,963,003 shares and the fair value of these shares was determined by the closing price on 6 December 2007 
of £1.91. Of the deferred consideration, £2,935,000 has been paid since the year end and an estimated £82,000 is still outstanding. 37

a.  The Group has investments in joint ventures which under UK GAAP were classified as joint arrangements not an entity. 
Balances owing were included within debtors. In accordance with IFRS the balance has been reclassified as an investment.
b.  The pension scheme deficit creates a deferred tax asset. This is included as a non‑current asset under IFRS whereas 
previously it was deducted from pension scheme liability.
c.  The Group takes out forward foreign exchange deals to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. The fair value of those 
deals is recognised in the balance sheet and where those contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting any gains 
or losses are recognise through a currency reserve. 
d.  The currency reserve creates a deferred tax asset or liability which is included as a non‑current asset or non‑current liability 
as appropriate.  38

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Notes:
1.  If you have sold or transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please send this document and the enclosed form 
of proxy (“Proxy Form”) to the stockbroker, or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected, for transmission 
to the purchaser or transferee.
2.  Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders 
are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. 
A shareholder can appoint the Chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not 
be a shareholder. More than one proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, 
the Proxy Form should be photocopied and completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on 
the Proxy Form together with the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is authorised to act. The box on the Proxy 
Form must also be ticked to indicate that the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Proxy Forms 
must be signed and, to be effective, must be lodged with the Company’s registrar so as to arrive not later than 48 hours 
before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours before the adjourned time.
3.  The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes 
to do so.
4.  Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the 
meeting shall be entitled to attend the AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered 
in their respective names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 2 does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in that note can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that 
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in 
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll 
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as 
corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same 
corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as 
its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives 
who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated 
corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. 
The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
7.  In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the 
meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must 
be entered on the Company’s register of members by 6.00pm on 31 August 2008, or if the meeting is adjourned, by not later 
than 48 hours before the time and date fixed for the adjourned meeting.
8.  Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries 
will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, 
Sundays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM, and at the venue of the 
AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
9.  From the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM a version of the Articles of Association showing the changes 
proposed by resolution 10 will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company and at the venue of the 
AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting. 42

Explanatory notes
Annual General Meeting – Business at the Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will see from the Notice of Annual General Meeting that they are asked to consider and, if thought fit, pass a number 
of resolutions as ordinary and special business which are summarised below.
As ordinary business
Resolution 1 – to receive the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Resolution 2 – to approve the directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
Resolution 3 – to declare a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 of 4 pence per share. Subject to approval, the final 
dividend will be payable on 9 October 2008 to shareholders on the register as at close of business on 12 September 2008.
Resolutions 4 and 5 – under the Company’s articles of association and in accordance with Group policy, one third of the Company’s 
Directors retire by rotation and, being eligible, Peter Graham Sechiari and John Lawrence Plumbe offers themselves for re‑election.
Resolution 6 – Auditors
This resolution if passed, will re‑appoint Tenon Audit Ltd as auditors of the Company.
As special business
The following items will be proposed as ordinary resolutions:
Resolution 7 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution, if passed, will authorise the directors of the Company generally and unconditionally to allot ordinary shares of the 
Company up to a maximum nominal value of £57,600 representing approximately one third of the current issued share capital of 
the Company. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company unless previously 
varied, revoked or renewed by the Company in general meeting.
Resolution 8 – Disapplication of pre‑ emption rights
This resolution, if passed, will grant the Directors of the Company power to allot shares wholly for cash pursuant to the authority 
conferred on them by Resolution 7 otherwise than to the existing shareholders of the Company in proportion to their existing 
holdings of ordinary shares. The first part of the disapplication is limited to rights issues, open offers and similar pro‑rata issues. 
In relation to a rights issue, open offer or other pro rata issues the disapplication authority is unlimited and allows the Directors 
to offer shares to existing shareholders other than strictly in proportion to their holdings, where for example, overseas regulations 
make it difficult to offer shares pro rata to existing overseas shareholders or when dealing with fractions of shares. The second 
part of the disapplication is limited to issues of shares pursuant to the terms of the Company’s current share scheme and any 
other share schemes approved by the Company in general meeting. The final part of the resolution also enables your Board to 
allot shares for any purpose up to an aggregate nominal value of £17,300 representing approximately 10% of the current issued 
share capital of the Company.
Resolution 9 – Share buy back 
This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a special 
resolution. If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 1,728,000 of its shares, representing 
just under 10% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this notice of AGM.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any shares purchased under this authority. 
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM.
Whilst the Directors do not currently have any intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, the Directors intend 
to use the authority granted by this resolution to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares as a method of 
returning surplus cash to shareholders. The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase shares where they consider 
that such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per share.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell 
or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to transfer sufficient shares purchased under this 
authority into treasury in order to satisfy the Company’s share incentive schemes and to cancel any excess shares purchased. 43

Resolution 10 – Changes required to be made to the Company’s articles of association
Resolution 10 is proposed in order to adopt new articles of association of the Company (the “New Articles”) to update the 
Company’s existing articles of association (the “Existing Articles”) to take account of changes in English company law brought 
about by the phased introduction of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA2006”). 
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are set out below. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying 
nature and some more minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the CA2006 have not been noted. A copy of the New 
Articles and a copy of the Existing Articles marked to show changes being proposed by this resolution are available for inspection 
as noted on page 41 of this document. Due to the phased introduction of CA2006 it is likely that further related changes to the New 
Articles will be proposed at a later AGM.
Form of resolution
The concept of extraordinary resolutions was not retained and public companies can no longer pass written resolutions 
under CA2006. These provisions will not be included in the New Articles.
Variation of class rights
CA2006 has altered the position regarding proceedings and specific quorum requirements for a meeting convened to vary class 
rights, which will be provided for in the New Articles.
Convening general and Annual General Meetings
The New Articles will contain amended provisions dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of notice 
required to convene general meetings. A general meeting to consider a special resolution can now be convened on 14 days’ 
notice (previously 21 days’ notice was required) and the Chairman of a general meeting no longer has a casting vote.
Votes of members
The New Articles will entitle proxies to vote on a show of hands and on a poll, and provide for amended time limits for the 
appointment or termination of a proxy. CA2006 permits multiple proxies and multiple corporate representatives to be appointed, 
subject to certain conditions, which will be reflected in the New Articles.
Conflicts	of	interest
The duty that a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict with the Company’s interests is now codified by CA2006 and will take effect on 1 October 2008. From that date, 
directors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate and where permitted by the 
articles. The New Articles will give the Directors authority to approve Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty 
in addition to allowing conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position. Directors deciding whether 
to authorise a conflict or potential conflict must have no interest in the matter being considered, and must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, to be most likely to promote the Company’s success. The New Articles will contain provisions to protect 
a Director being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises, although this only applies where 
the position of potential conflict has previously been authorised by the Directors. 
Notice of board meetings
Use of modern communications means there may be no obstacles to giving notice to a director abroad. CA2006 provides that 
a director is treated as having waived his entitlement to notice, unless he supplies the Company with the information necessary 
to ensure he receives notice of a meeting before it takes place.
Distribution of assets otherwise than in cash
The New Articles do not contain provisions dealing with the distribution of assets in kind in the event of liquidation of the 
Company. The previous position is provided for in the Insolvency Act 1986.
Provision for employees on cessation of business
The New Articles will provide that where there is a cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of the undertaking 
of the Company, the Directors may in a general meeting provide for a person employed or formerly employed by the company.  44

Explanatory notes
Electronic and web communications
The New Articles will provide that the Company may communicate with members by means of website communication. 
Recipient members must be asked individually to agree that the Company may send documents or information to them by means 
of a website. The Company will notify the member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) when a relevant document or 
information is placed on the website. Members can always request a hard copy version.
Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund expenditure
CA2006 widened the scope of powers of a Company to indemnify Directors and to fund expenditure incurred in connection with 
certain actions against Directors, and will be provided in the New Articles. 
Dispute resolution
The New Articles provide that the primary procedure for dispute resolution for the Company is arbitration in accordance with 
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Where arbitration provisions cannot be used for a particular 
dispute or in cases where a member is bringing a derivative claim under the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the New 
Articles provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, and the governing law is English. ACM is one of the world’s top independent tanker brokers, providing 
a single point of contact for oil and refined product transportation.
The comprehensive portfolio includes spot/period chartering, derivatives 
brokerage, finance, sale and purchase, new buildings and demolition.

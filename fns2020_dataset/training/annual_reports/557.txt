2,000 tickets The Group has made good progress 
against its stated strategy in the period 
under review. The strategy is focused on 
prioritising growth in the US, the Private 
Jet business in Europe and broking in the 
Oil & Gas and Tour Operating sectors.  
This is resulting in a good diversification  
of broking revenues with strong 
performances seen. In fact, it is pleasing 
to report that revenue in these areas grew 
by 91% to £91.4m. However, growth in the 
continental European private jet market 
remains challenging, reflecting the 
economic conditions in the region.  
Air Partner continues to evolve its  
people and systems, selectively investing 
in skills and initiatives that support the 
strategy and help create a long term 
competitive advantage. In the period 
under review, the Group has added to its 
senior management team, strengthened 
and re-energised the sales force in 
selected growth areas, reviewed and 
refined the Information Technology (IT) 
strategy, while finalising a successful 
transition to a product-led structure. 
 
Dividend
The Board remains confident in the 
Group’s long term prospects and is 
pleased to propose a final dividend  
of 14.0p per share, to be paid on  
16 June 2014, to shareholders on the 
register on 16 May 2014 (subject to 
shareholder approval at the General 
Meeting). Due to the change to the 
accounting reference date, the Group  
paid an increased interim dividend  
of 14.0p in October 2013, equivalent  
to the amount that would have been  
paid as a final dividend prior to the 
change of year-end. This brings the  
total dividend for the 18 months to 
January 2014 to 34.05p, 87% higher  
than the total dividend for the statutory  
12 month comparative period.
Chairman’s statement 
Air Partner has performed strongly  
during the 12 months to 31 January 2014 
with turnover growing by 7% to £224m 
and underlying profit increasing by  
28% to £4.3m. Commercial Jet’s strong 
performance was led by significant 
growth in the tour operating sector and 
successful new business wins helped 
replace the on-going contraction  
in government work, leading to  
a 14% increase in revenue and a 38% 
increase in underlying profit before tax. 
Private Jet’s also performed well, 
particularly in the UK and the US,  
with revenues up by 21% and underlying 
profit before tax increasing by 36%.  
The Group remains cash generative  
and debt free. In the 12 month period, 
cash rose by £1.1m to £18.4m. £8.8m 
(2013: £8.6m) of cash is JetCard clients’ 
deposits, which are segregated and  
held on deposit. 
During the period, the Group undertook  
a fundamental review of its investment  
in new technology systems and, 
additionally moved the business to  
a product led structure. Unfortunately  
the technology review has resulted  
in a significant impairment of the IT 
investment and this, together with  
the restructuring and redundancy costs 
largely associated with the new product 
led structure has led to a charge of £1.4m 
to the income statement. After the impact 
of these non-trading items profit before 
tax was £2.8m (2013: £3.2m). 
During 2013 Air Partner changed its accounting reference date from  
31 July to 31 January. As a consequence the statutory results are in respect  
of the 18 month trading period from 1 August 2012 to 31 January 2014,  
with a 12 month comparative to 31 July 2012. T o aid understanding pro forma  
results have also been provided for the 12 months to 31 January 2014  
with a 12 month comparative to 31 January 2013. The narrative to the results  
is based on the pro forma results with additional comments on the statutory  
results where it aids understanding.
The business pays dividends subject to 
performance and typically they are split 
on the basis of one third interim payment 
and two thirds final payment. In future the 
board anticipates returning to a one-third 
and two third split and intends to continue 
the recent practice of growing the 
dividend by 10% per annum.
Board Changes
Shareholders will be aware of  
Tony Mack’s intention to retire from  
the Board at the forthcoming General 
Meeting. Under his initial leadership  
and subsequent guidance, Air Partner  
has become the successful business  
that it is today. The whole Company owes 
him a debt of gratitude and we wish him 
well for the future, while continuing to 
draw on his unique experience as  
Life President of the Company.
Elsewhere we have added to the  
Board and in September 2013 we 
welcomed Grahame Chilton as a  
Non-Executive Director. Grahame brings  
a wealth of global business experience, 
particularly in broking businesses.  
As previously announced, Gavin Charles 
will be leaving on 30 April. Neil Morris was 
appointed interim Chief Financial Officer 
on 1 April 2014 to allow for a transitional 
handover period. Neil was Air Partner’s 
Group Financial Controller, a position  
he held since July 2013. Before joining  
Air Partner, Neil was Group Finance 
Director of All Leisure Group PLC,  
the niche cruise and tour operator listed  
on AIM, and prior to that he spent 11 years 
at Deloitte LLP , primarily working in the 
aviation and travel sector. We continue  
to work with Odgers Berndtson, one of the 
UK’s pre-eminent executive search firms, 
to assist in the search process for a 
permanent Chief Financial Officer and will 
provide an update as soon as practical. Strategic report

Outlook
Current trading is in line with the  
Board’s expectations, and while  
the economic environment continues 
slowly to improve, our experience leads  
us to balance such optimism with  
a degree of conservatism in our outlook 
and planning. Our focus on areas of 
strategic importance continues to 
produce results, and we are confident  
that further improvements in IT , efficiency 
and productivity combined with the 
opportunities we are seeing across  
the business, will generate further gains. 
We are a well-funded group with a trusted 
brand and an enviable reputation.  
We have a clear strategy and a strong 
product offering with a depth of 
management experience that positions  
us well for the future.
Richard Everitt, Chairman
9 April 2014 Chief Executive’s review 
This is a strong performance  
with revenue growing by 7% and 
underlying profit before tax up 28%. 
However after the impact of the one-off, 
non-trading items, profit before tax  
was £2.8m (2013: £3.2m); please refer  
to the Chief Financial Officer’s Review  
for further details. Pleasingly on an 
underlying basis, profit before tax  
grew by 28% to £4.3m (2013: £3.3m). 
This reflected good trading in both 
Commercial Jets and Private Jets which 
have performed well and benefitted  
from the recent restructuring into 
product lines. Our close management  
of the areas of strategic focus (USA, 
Private Jets in Europe, Oil & Gas and  
T our Operators) has continued to deliver 
excellent results, with revenue up across 
these areas by 91%.  Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 09
Strategic report
This growth is significant for the business and 
marks excellent progress against the Group’s 
aim to further diversify its revenues and clients.
“

Mark Briffa, CEO
This growth is significant for the  
business and marks excellent progress 
against the Group’s aim to further 
diversify its revenues and clients.
The Freight division, a small but 
important part of the Group, has started  
to show some signs of improvement. 
However, the results reflect a tough 
comparable period due to the conclusion 
of a large government contract and  
the on-going difficulties in the market. 
While revenues contracted, pleasingly 
underlying profit before tax remained 
unchanged due to the early management 
action on cost control.
The Group’s transition to a product led 
structure enabled synergies to be better 
captured, and has improved the ability  
to direct skills, expertise and knowledge 
across borders in an inclusive and 
integrated approach. The restructuring, 
announced in March 2013, has 
significantly contributed to the  
strong Private Jet and Commercial Jet 
performances in these results.  
The restructuring associated with 
delivering this change resulted in  
the need to make a number of roles 
redundant and the costs associated  
with this are included in the £646,000  
of restructuring and redundancy costs 
incurred in the period. 
The transition to a product led 
restructure required a strengthened 
senior management team, capable  
of developing business divisions in 
multiple territories and furthering  
growth across the company’s areas  
of strategic focus. Significant progress 
has been made on this front, and in 
August 2013 Paul Richardson was 
appointed as Director of Private Jets.  
Paul previously worked in the wealth 
management, sports and entertainment 
sectors, both at Coutts and Barclays 
Wealth and his experience and insight 
working with high net worth individuals  
is proving valuable.  
The revenue from Inclusive Tour 
Operating has increased by 200% 
against the prior period, with significant 
new contracts won. The team was further 
strengthened in September 2013 with 
the appointment of Alan Murray as 
Director of Inclusive Tour Programmes. 
Alan was previously MD and COO  
of Voyages of Discovery and Director  
of Monarch Airlines; his wide range  
of experience is already making a 
positive impact.
Marketing helps drive both the existing 
and new areas of strategic focus and last 
December Kiran Parmar joined as Global 
Director of Marketing.  Kiran previously 
held senior international marketing roles 
at Bentley Motors and Ford Motor 
Company, enabling him to understand 
both the luxury side of our Private Jets 
business and the Commercial Jets and 
Freight divisions too.  
Air Partner has historically 
underinvested in technology  
and as part of a step change in IT,  
Colin Jowers was appointed Global 
Director of Business Technology in 
January. Until recently, Colin was  
global Chief Operating Officer  
of Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global 
Banking and Markets Research  
and Strategy division.  He has also  
been involved in numerous broking 
service industry initiatives,  
focused on maximising technology  
and operational efficiencies.  
Colin’s appointment is a direct 
reflection of the Group’s desire  
to place technology at the heart  
of Air Partner’s offer, enabling the 
Group to better understand its 
customers, putting their needs first, 
while more accurately measuring 
performance against these aims.  
With that objective in mind I am 
pleased to announce the start of 
Project Connect, a multi-year global  
technology project, which will include  
the deployment of Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM across the business.  Our JetCard continues to perform well with  
sales and renewals up 29% for the period. 
“
“
Mark Briffa, CEO
Chief Executive’s review continued
Colin’s deep knowledge and  
experience are already proving 
themselves and having reviewed  
the Group’s IT systems, he is  
already transforming the way  
we work. As part of his review,  
Colin recommended Air Partner  
continue with its planned CRM 
development, but discontinue the 
integrated broker and finance tools. 
Subsequently, the CRM element  
will go live this year, but the £77 4,000 
investment in the broker and finance  
tool will now not be utilised and has 
been fully impaired.  However, we are 
confident that the revised system,  
under Colin’s management and 
combined with the new systems  
will be better placed to help drive  
future growth.
Colin will be responsible for all of  
Air Partner’s global IT going forward, 
Project Connect being the initial  
focal point for this. Phase one  
includes a global IT infrastructure 
upgrade, enabling the CRM to be 
delivered in the second half of this 
financial year, and thereafter, the  
critical introduction of the platform to 
support our new technology strategy 
and product roadmap across the Group.  
As a result of the increased strategic 
focus on technology and Project 
Connect, going forward we expect  
the annual technology cost for the 
Group to increase, albeit off  
a low base. We are confident  
that this is strategically the right  
investment to be making and the 
increased cost will better position  
the Company for the long term.  
Private Jet Broking
Revenue increased in the period  
by 21% to £55. 9m (2013: £46.4m)  
with underlying profit before tax 
increasing by 36% to £1.5m  
(2013: £1.1m). Significant growth  
was achieved in the UK and US,  
which was driven by investment  
in high calibre talent that has added 
a new dimension to the private jet 
division, with an increased focus  
on sales and improved tailoring  
of products to suit local markets.
We are seeing particularly strong 
interest from high net worth individual 
leisure traffic, and in line with this,  
our JetCard continues to perform well. 
Sales and renewals are up 29% for the 
period with card utilisation up by 84%.  
The product continues to provide  
the flexibility that both corporates  
and high net worth individuals demand. 
This flexibility has been improved 
further with the launch of our new  
card product aimed specifically at  
the corporate market. As the economy 
continues to improve, we are well 
placed to benefit from further HNWI 
flying as potential clients seek to 
enhance their air travel preferences. 
The traction gained in the  
Continental European private jet  
market has not been as great as 
expected. The market conditions 
remain challenging, reflecting the 
economic conditions in the region,  
but we continue to build our talent  
and skill set in our European private  
jet offices. We are confident that  
the recruitment and steps taken  
to date leave the division well  
placed for the future, as continental 
economies improve. 
 
Commercial Jet Broking
Revenue in the 12 months to  
31 January 2014 increased by  
14% to £148.7m (2013: £130.7m)  
with underlying profit before tax  
38% higher at £2.3m (2013: £1.7m).  
The growth has been driven by excellent 
performances in the UK, US and France, 
resulting from an increased sales 
focus and the development of closer 
relationships with clients. These strong 
results have been achieved despite the 
slowdown of government business.
The recruitment of key individuals into 
the division has had a positive impact, 
strengthening our specialist expertise 
and capabilities in our strategic areas, 
for example in Tour Operating and 
Oil & Gas. Today, we have an even 
better understanding of customers’ 
requirements and have improved  
our ability to provide the bespoke 
solutions our clients require. Tour 
Operating in Europe has delivered 
strong results and has contributed  
35% of the revenue in the division. 
While our established presence in 
Aberdeen and Houston has enabled  
us to gain good traction in the  
Oil & Gas sector and revenue has 
increased by 54%. The team in the 
US carried out several successful 
evacuations, rescuing stranded  
cruise line passengers and also won  
the prestigious programme to fly 
the World Cup Trophy to 90 different 
countries before the World Cup 
tournament starts in Brazil in June. 
The Conference and Incentive market 
remains slow to come out of recovery 
and the sector remains extremely 
competitive with low margins.  Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 11
Strategic report
In conclusion, I am pleased to report 
that the Group has delivered a strong 
performance for the year and continued 
its positive progress against our 
strategic objectives. While the global 
macro environment continues slowly 
to improve, over 50 years’ aviation 
experience reminds us to balance 
optimism with a healthy degree of 
conservatism in our outlook and 
planning.  We are well funded with  
a robust cash balance sheet and  
intend to deliver a growing dividend  
for our shareholders into the 
foreseeable future. This strong  
position enables Air Partner to  
invest in  areas such as new IT , product 
development, recruitment, training, 
brand marketing and in strengthening 
the global office infrastructure.
I would like to thank all of my Air Partner 
colleagues for their hard work and 
commitment through the year.  
Our company is trusted by customers  
to respond quickly and deliver the 
highest standards of service and  
I am proud that we achieve these  
high standards day in, day out.

Freight Broking
Although revenue was down by  
26% to £11.7m (2013: £15.9m), 
underlying profit before tax was  
level with the comparable 12 month 
period at £0.2m, due to early 
management of the cost base.  
The lower revenues reflect on-going 
challenging conditions in the freight 
sector, and the comparative period, 
which still included a large government 
contract which ended in March 2012. 
However, over the last 6 months,  
a positive upturn has been seen 
in the market and the level of new 
business has increased. Two significant 
flying programmes were completed; 
delivering humanitarian aid to the 
Philippines and flying equipment  
to the Winter Olympics in Sochi.  
Freight remains a core product  
offering and to support this,  
investment has been made in 
experienced industry specialists  
based in Cologne and Istanbul.  
Progress building new business around 
the Air Partner Time Critical offering 
is being made and this is helping to

28% underlying profit growth.  
The results were driven by strong 
performances in the two key divisions – 
Commercial Jets and Private Jets. 
Commercial Jet revenues improved  
by 14% to £148.7m and Private Jet 
revenues were 21% stronger at £55. 9m.  
This contrasted with Group revenues, 
which showed year on year revenue 
growth of 7%, reflecting continued 
Freight weakness, and the Group’s 
Operations divisions (Fuel and Ops24) 
transitioning from revenue seeking 
business units to smaller support 
services functions.
 
There were two significant non-trading 
expenditures in the period, which 
negatively impacted profit before tax  
and earnings per share. Firstly,  
the capital cost associated with  
the CRM, resulting in a £774,000 
impairment charge, leaving an asset 
value of £260,000. This represents  
the CRM element of the new system 
which is being retained as part of Project 
Connect and will go-live in the second 
half of this financial year. Secondly,  
the restructuring and redundancy  
costs, largely associated with delivering 
the transition to a product led focus, 
resulted in restructuring costs of 
£646,000 in the period.
After the impact of non-trading items,  
the performance of the divisions is  
as follows: 
 
Dividend
The Board has recommended  
a final dividend for the period  
of 14.0p per share which together  
with the interim paid in April 2013  
of 6.05p and the increased interim 
dividend of 14.0p paid in October 2013 
respectively represent a total dividend  
for the period of 34.05p per share.  
If approved by shareholders the  
dividend will be paid on 16 June 2014  
to shareholders on the register on  
16 May 2014.
The business pays dividends subject  
to performance and typically they  
are split on the basis of one third interim 
payment and two thirds final payment.  
In future the board anticipates returning 
to a one-third and two third split  
and intends to continue the recent 
practice of growing the dividend  
by 10% per annum. 
Cash
During the period from 31 January 2013  
to 31 January 2014, cash rose by £1.1m  
to £18.4m. The Group’s short term cash 
balances show high levels of short term 
volatility due to the timing differences  
in the receipt of funds from clients and 
payment to aircraft operators. It should  
be noted that £8.8m (2013: £8.6m) of the 
cash balance is due to JetCard clients’ 
deposits with the Group and to improve 
the visibility of this split, it is now  
shown separately as a footnote on the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

After the impact of non-trading items, the performance of the divisions is as follows: Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 13
Strategic report
Business model 
Air Partner is a global aviation  
charter specialist with customers 
spanning governments, individuals, 
corporate and other organisations.  
The business has 20 offices in  
17 countries and employs about  
200 people. 
The business is managed on a  
divisional basis, with a product led 
focus. The divisions are as follows:
—  Commercial Jets covers the charter  
of passenger aircraft with over 20 
seats. The division has a wide range  
of clients including governments,  
tour operator businesses, oil & gas 
and automotive companies and  
sports organisations. The business 
has successfully diversified its client 
base over the last three years, with the 
reduction of government business  
and an increase in tour operator and 
oil & gas work. 
—  Private Jets provides charters  
of aircraft with 20 seats or less.  
Clients can charter aircraft on an  
ad hoc basis or purchase hours in 
advance (a JetCard) and benefit from  
an all-inclusive fixed price and various 
aircraft availability commitments. 
Whilst predominantly bought by 
private individuals, Air Partner has 
recently launched a new card aimed 
specifically at corporate clients. 
—  Freight provides whole aircraft  
charter for freight usage. Clients  
are typically transporting cargo  
not suitable for scheduled freight 
services – often due to the size,  
the weight or the destination.  
Freight provides an ad hoc service  
and a Time Critical product meeting 
the need for urgent, tracked delivery.
—  Other Services comprises an in house 
travel agency and an Emergency 
Planning department. The travel 
agency enables Air Partner to meet  
the needs of clients combining 
scheduled flying and private charter. 
The Emergency Planning department 
provides large companies with 
employees working in volatile  
parts of the world with detailed 
evacuation plans.
The business also provides 24/7  
tracking of flights, 365 days of the year. 
This enables Air Partner to address 
operational issues and respond to 
additional client requests at any time  
of the day.
The aircraft charter broking market  
has low barriers to entry and a large 
number of competing businesses, 
including many sole traders. Air Partner  
is one of the largest charter brokers in  
the world. This gives it a number of 
advantages when tendering for larger 
pieces of work, including:
—  The expertise, capability and contacts 
that have been built up over the last  
50 years of trading.
—  A reputation for providing a high 
quality product and excellent 
customer service.
—  Financial reassurance for the client.  
Air Partner is the only quoted air 
charter broker and this provides 
clients with the highest level of 
financial transparency and rigour.  
Air Partner also has an extremely 
strong Balance Sheet with 
approaching 20m of cash  
and no debt. Principal risk and uncertainties
Lead times for ad hoc bookings are 
measured in days or weeks, rather 
than months. Forward bookings 
can be impacted very suddenly 
by changes in financial markets, 
political instability and natural events 
affecting the movement of people or 
cargo from one country to another. 
Economic uncertainty affects corporate, 
government and individual clients and 
affects the quality of supply of aircraft 
as operators consolidate or leave the 
market. These are trends outside the 
Group’s control but the strategy remains 
to diversify to address seasonality  
and changes in the client mix. 
Aircraft charter broking on the  
Air Partner model can be classed as  
a relatively low financial risk business,  
in that the broker sells capacity on 
aircraft owned and operated by a  
third party and contracts are normally 
placed as mirrored transactions.  
The Group does not have any 
contractual arrangements with any 
significant individual or company  
which are essential to continuation  
of the business. 
The profile of risks fluctuates from 
time to time and not all risks can be 
listed in full, nor can the actions being 
taken to manage and control risks be 
guaranteed to mitigate completely their 
effects on the business or to reduce 
risks absolutely.
The Board has not delegated 
its responsibility for financial 
risk management, including the 
management of treasury activities. 
Further information on interest rate risk, 
credit risk and liquidity risk is given in 
note 20 to the financial statements. 
Other risks and uncertainties which  
the Board considers to be material  
to Air Partner’s ability to continue 
in business are summarised in the 
chart below. The principal risk to the 
Group’s business stems from the 
general economic conditions in which 
our clients operate, affecting their 
willingness to charter. Ad hoc charters 
are likely to continue to be impacted  
by serious economic instability in  
the major world markets.

Diversification of the client base across governments  
and non-governmental organisations, commercial enterprises  
and individuals and across geographic regions allows for  
some smoothing when there are seasonal or sectorial  
changes in demand.
High quality standards apply to the choice of aircraft and carrier 
for each charter. Air Partner maintains non-owned aircraft liability 
insurance which can also be extended to clients. All flights are 
watched in operation by the in-house operations team.
The in-house operations team monitors external conditions  
very closely and will advise clients of any potential problems. 
There is potential upside if private charters can use smaller 
airfields or ad hoc freight charter can recover deliveries  
otherwise delayed by a lack of scheduled flights.
Management reviews policies and processes at  
Leadership Team level. The business has a range  
of policies to minimise these risks and reviews  
and updates them on a regular basis. 
Air Partner deals with many different operators worldwide  
and is not reliant on a single supplier or contractor.
The Group undertakes client surveys to ensure it remains 
responsive to client demands and within acceptable market  
price levels for the quality and standards of service provided.
International scope reduces reliance on a single  
office location. Back-up operating systems are provided  
for this and employees can work remotely if necessary.
The Group invests in recruitment, talent management,  
learning and development programmes to maintain staffing  
levels and improve performance on a continuing basis. 
Remuneration and motivational incentives are reviewed  
regularly and regular social events are provided to encourage 
family feeling across the Group.
Air Partner’s brand values of honesty, truth and reliability  
are treated very seriously. Discretion is key to our customer 
service and its importance is communicated to all members  
of the team.
Economic uncertainty, including 
Eurozone volatility, reduces the 
demand for ad hoc aviation solutions.
Failure of aircraft chartered  
by Air Partner.
Adverse weather conditions or  
external incidents outside Air Partner’s 
control (eg earthquake, ash cloud, 
terrorist alerts) closed airports or  
meaning flying is prohibited.
The Group has to comply with a 
large number of different laws and 
regulations, including tax and civil 
aviation authority requirements.  
Such regulations are subject to 
continual change and there is a risk 
that Group does not comply with 
applicable laws and regulations,  
or inadvertently breaches regulations. 
Suitable aircraft are not available  
for charter in key sectors /  
geographic areas.
Air Partner falls behind competitors  
in product development, standards  
of service or cost effectiveness.
Systems for sourcing and booking 
aircraft and for client management  
and administration fail or cannot  
be accessed by employees.
Failure to attract, retain and  
motivate high quality employees.
Air Partner’s reputation is damaged  
by an incident or inappropriate action, 
causing client losses.

Key performance indicators
The Group’s Key Performance  
Indicators (“KPI’s”) are shown here. 
The financial indicators are designed 
to help management and investors to 
assess performance and are capable  
of being measured over the longer term.
Operational indicators relate to the 
number of people with Air Partner 
whose efforts drive performance. 
All KPI’s are based on total rather 
than underlying measures, except 
for underlying profit before tax and 
underlying basic earnings per share.
A high percentage of the Group’s 
business is driven by the short term 
needs of the client. A long forward  
order book is therefore not available 
and not appropriate to use as  
a measure of the Group’s longer  
term prospects.
Detailed segmental reporting is set out

Corporate social responsibility
Air Partner regularly reviews and 
identifies ways in which its impact  
on the environment and its  
contribution to the community 
as a whole could be improved. 
Sustainability and Corporate Social 
Responsibility are an important part  
of Air Partner’s vision, mission and 
values and are key to achieving  
our goals.
The Group’s Business Ethics  
policy implemented last year  
contains a separate statement on 
Corporate Hospitality and can be 
downloaded from the corporate 
website: www.airpartner.com/
investors/corporate-governance.
Environmental awareness
The Group seeks to reduce its  
carbon footprint year on year,  
and the move to new offices at  
Gatwick has improved energy  
efficiency and reduced road usage 
as staff and visitors utilise excellent 
local transport connections. Rail travel 
for staff and local buses for staff and 
visitors alike are subsidised by the 
Company. A waste monitoring and 
reduction programme has also been 
instigated. For information on the 
Group’s output of greenhouse gases, 
please see the Directors’ Report  
on page 28.
Jet travel does have significant 
environmental consequences. 
Although we do not operate aircraft 
directly, we work with our clients,  
our suppliers and our service partners  
to monitor and review the impact of  
our operations. 
Many clients are conscious of, and 
would like to reduce, the environmental 
impact of their flights and we are happy 
to recommend aircraft which have a 
lower fuel burn profile, though this is 
not always available for large freight 
flights in particular. We can calculate 
automatically the carbon footprint of 
every flight and can provide clients  
with the data they need to make 
realistic decisions about both costs  
and emissions. We also include 
optional carbon offset costs as standard 
in our proposals. The number of tonnes 
offset can only be decided upon by our 
clients. The amount of carbon offset 
has shown a significant increase over 
the last three years but this remains a 
very small proportion in terms of the 
number of flights undertaken each year. 
Air Partner also offers a Carbon Neutral 
JetCard for frequent fliers.
Carbon offsets are used to help fund 
climate-friendly technology projects 
in less developed parts of the world 
which make use of renewable energy 
sources or improve energy efficiency, 
also providing socio-economic 
benefits. Projects this year, which 
have been vetted and endorsed by 
The CarbonNeutral Company, have 
included the installation of wind 
turbines in Maharashtra, India. This 
project involves the development of 
25 x 800kW wind turbines with a total 
installed capacity of 20 MW located in 
the village of Panchpatta. The project 
provides 35GWh of renewable electricity 
to the Western regional electricity grid of 
India per year, reducing CO2 emissions 
by displacing electricity from fossil 
fuel-based electricity generation plants 
(particularly coal-based generation). 
This project is validated to the Verified 
Carbon Standard (VCS). Strategic report

A six year old boy from Lambeth had his 
dream come true when he had the chance 
to take the controls of a helicopter before 
enjoying an incredible flight over the 
London skyline.
Abel Seleshi, who has spina bifida 
and hydrocephalus, which has left him 
unable to stand or walk and reliant on 
a wheelchair was given the opportunity 
to hold the controls of Elite Helicopters’ 
Agusta A109 helicopter before enjoying  
the trip of a lifetime.
Taking off from the grounds of his  
primary school in West Dulwich,  
Abel was given the chance to enjoy  
a bird’s eye view of London flying as  
low as 500 feet over the Olympic Stadium 
and the London Eye by Air Partner. 
In association with WellChild,  
the national charity for sick children,  
Air Partner carefully planned and 
orchestrated this special trip for Abel  
and by sponsoring the PLC Awards  
we raised money to help the charity 
continue to provide essential support  
for seriously ill children, young people  
and their families across the UK.
Dream flight over the  
London skyline for inspiring  
boy with Spina Bifida
There are occasions when air transport 
is the only solution and environmental 
damage has to be set against the 
undoubted benefit of being able to 
deliver fast, targeted help for those 
in need. Air Partner has expertise in 
chartering air ambulance and organ 
transplant flights and is proud of its 
involvement in providing humanitarian 
relief flights to deliver much needed  
aid and support to victims of war, 
famine, floods and earthquakes  
around the world. 
Employees
The efforts of every single person in 
the business count towards Group 
performance. Investment in people has 
been targeted by the Board as a priority 
and a number of key appointments 
have been made during the financial 
year. Whether those people are 
experienced professional support staff, 
brokers or sales team all are expected  
to produce returns in the form of 
aircraft charters successfully delivered 
for clients. Remuneration is linked to 
performance throughout the business. 
Air Partner is proud of its  
commitment to learning and 
development. The Group provides 
induction training in the UK for every 
new member of staff, followed by 
short courses designed to increase 
knowledge, develop new ideas  
and promote and strengthen 
relationships between international 
teams and offices. We also encourage 
continued professional development. 
There are regular updates on the 
Group’s performance, through regular 
team and Divisional briefings and  
with individual office summaries  
and commentaries available on the 
staff intranet. Talent management  
and learning and development 
initiatives were implemented within  
the year to encourage personal success, 
to ensure that Air Partner people are 
“best in industry”.
The Group is committed to  
providing equal opportunities  
and ensuring that employees are  
able to work without discrimination.  
Full and fair consideration is given  
to employment applications from 
persons with a disability. If an employee 
were to become disabled while in 
employment, the Group would make 
every effort to enable the employee to 
continue in employment and would 
make arrangements for additional 
equipment, support and training  
as appropriate.

Going concern basis
Going concern
Having considered the Group’s  
current financial position, the factors 
affecting its cost base, the state of  
the air charter market as a whole and 
budget forecast figures for a period 
of not less than twelve months from 
the date of approval of these financial 
statements, the directors are satisfied 
that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in 
business for the foreseeable future  
and the Company is a going concern. 
The directors have continued to 
adopt the going concern basis in the 
preparation of the financial statements.
Expected future developments 
The Group intends to concentrate  
on the core business of broking  
but will seek to widen and broaden  
its client base, focusing on niche 
areas of business which align  
well with the Group’s strengths.  
In particular, the Group will  
highlight industries and territories 
where different Air Partner offices  
can work together to provide high 
levels of service. 
Air Partner has highlighted its 
intention to continue to invest in 
staff and IT infrastructure. Air Partner 
remains committed to becoming the 
Number One Air Charter specialists. 
The Directors continue to believe that 
the best route to increasing long term 
value for shareholders is to deliver 
excellent service across the product 
range and across the broadest 
possible geographic area.

Share capital structure  
and shareholder rights
The authorised share capital of the 
Company is £750,000 divided into 
15,000,000 ordinary shares of 5 pence 
each. All ordinary shares have equal 
rights to dividends and capital and 
to vote at general meetings of the 
Company, as set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The number of

Annual Report 2014 27
Directors’ report
Options outstanding under all 
employee share schemes amounted 
to 8.76% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at 31 January 2014. 
This includes options granted which 
have not yet vested. No more than 
20% of issued share capital in any 
rolling 10 year period may be taken 
up by employee share schemes. In 
addition options representing 7 .4% 
of the issued share capital have been 
exercised within the 10 years preceding 
31 January 2014. No more than 20% of 
the issued share capital in any rolling 
ten year period may currently be taken 
up by employee share schemes by way 
of dilution but it is proposed to reduce 
this limit to 10% with any excess (up to a 
further 10% of the issued share capital) 
being acquired by purchase in the 
market via an employee benefit trust.
Under the Articles of Association, 
the Company has authority to 
issue 15,000,000 ordinary shares. 
Resolutions to renew the authorities 
given to directors to allot shares, to 
disapply certain pre-emption rights 
and to make market purchases of the 
Company’s own shares, all subject to 
appropriate limits, will be put to the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) to 
replace the authorities granted in 2012.
There are no specific restrictions on 
the size of a holding nor on the transfer 
of shares, which are both governed by 
the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. 
The directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
No person has any special rights of 
control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully 
paid. No individual or corporate entity 
has the right to appoint a director. 
The appointment and replacement of 
directors is governed by the Articles 
of Association, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies  
Act 2006 and related legislation. 
During the period, the Group 
established the Air Partner Employee 
Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) in order to 
satisfy options under the Group’s share 
option schemes. At 31 January 2014 the 
number of ordinary shares held by the 
Trust was 224,932. Shares held by  
the Trust will not be voted.
The issued share capital of the 
Company is £513,000 divided  
into 10,261, 393 ordinary shares  
of 5 pence each.

“ Disabled employees
Applications for employment 
by disabled persons are always 
considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff 
becoming disabled every effort  
is made to ensure that their 
employment with the group  
continues and appropriate training  
is arranged.It is the policy of the  
group that the training, career 
development and promotion,  
of disabled persons should,  
as far as possible, be identical  
to that of other employees.
Greenhouse gas emmissions
The Group is reporting as required 
under the Large and Medium – Sized 
Companies and groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulation 2008 as amended 
in 2013. The GHG Protocol Accounting 
and Reporting Standard and emission 
factors from the UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors have been used for 
calculating the results. The key source 
of emissions is the use of gas and 
electricity in offices located around the 
world. The Group does not operate a 
significant number of motor vehicles.

2008 as amended in August 2013.  
The reporting boundary used for 
collation of the above data is consistent 
with that used for consolidation 
purposes in the financial statements.  
We have used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition), data 
gathered to fulfil our requirements 
under the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, 
and emission factors from the UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2014 to calculate 
the above disclosures.
The Group use of greenhouse gasses 
is restricted to office use and the 
operation of a small number of vehicles. 
In the case of offices occupation 
is usually within a multi occupied 
building without separate metering  
for individual parts where this has 
occurred an estimate has been used.
Directors’ statement of responsibility  
for disclosure of information to auditors
As required by section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006, each director 
serving at the date of approval of the 
financial statements confirms that:
 — to the best of his knowledge and 
belief, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of their 
reports of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and
 — each director has taken all the steps 
a director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken to be aware 
of relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
Words and phrases used in this 
confirmation should be interpreted  
in accordance with section 418 of  
the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ indemnity
The Company has made qualifying 
third-party indemnity provisions  
for the benefit of its directors which 
remain in force at the date of this report.  
In certain circumstances, the Company 
can indemnify directors, in accordance 
with its Articles of Association,  
against costs incurred in the  
defence of legal proceedings brought 
against them by virtue of their office.  
Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance is provided for the benefit  
of all directors, the Company Secretary 
and senior managers.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP have confirmed that they are 
willing to be reappointed as auditor for 
the financial year ending 31 January 2015. 
In accordance with Section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006, a resolution 
proposing the appointment of a 
statutory auditor will be proposed  
at the AGM.

Corporate governance statement
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
For the period year ended 31 January 
2014 the Board considers it complied 
with all aspects of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code June 2010  
(the “Code”).
Diversity
Air Partner is a team made up  
of people with a broad range of 
backgrounds but does not intend 
to adopt a quota system, preferring 
to appoint the best candidate for 
any position. Instructions to any 
external agent appointed for senior 
appointments require that agent  
to provide a list of candidates from  
as many different backgrounds  
as possible.
Performance evaluation 
During the year, an internal review  
of the performance of the Board  
and of individual Directors was carried 
out. As part of the review, objectives 
have been set for the Board for the  
next 12 months. 
These areas include;
 — Succession planning for the Board
 — Review of Group strategy
 Progress in achieving these objectives 
will form part of the next review.
Board constitution
The Board, as shown on pages 22  
and 23, is made up of two executive  
and five non-executive directors, 
including the Chairman who is 
responsible for leadership of the Board. 
The balance of the Board is such that  
no individual or group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision 
making and there is a mix of skills  
and experience. Neither of the 
executive directors is a director of  
a public company outside the Group. 
Clear responsibilities are allocated  
to each of the non-executive  
Chairman, the CEO, the CFO and  
the Senior Independent Director.  
These terms and conditions of 
appointment are set out in  
writing and are available from  
the Company Secretary or at  
www.airpartner.com/investors/
corporate-governance.
The Board carries ultimate responsibility 
for the conduct of the Group’s business. 
A formal schedule of matters is 
reserved for Board decision, including 
formulation and development of 
strategy, major acquisitions or 
disposals, significant bank borrowings, 
Board level appointments, the approval 
of financial reports and price sensitive 
statements and overall business risk 
assessment. A copy of the schedule is 
available online at www.airpartner.com/
investors/corporate-governance.  
The Board receives reports at each 
meeting from the CEO, the CFO and,  
following meetings of Board Committees, 
from their respective Chairmen. Independence of  
non-executive directors
The Board considers all the  
non-executive directors, other than  
Tony Mack, to be independent.  
Tony Mack is a former executive 
Chairman and holds more than  
6% of the Company’s share capital.  
In the case of Mr Everitt, Mr Pollard  
and Mr Wood given their relatively  
small shareholdings, the Board  
does not believe that this impacts  
on their independence.
The Chairman’s other directorships  
are listed in his biography. 
Re-election of directors
In accordance with best practice,  
all directors except for Tony Mack  
(who is to retire from the Board at the 
forthcoming AGM) and Gavin Charles  
(his agreement will terminate with effect 
from 1 May 2014) will resign at this 
year’s AGM and stand for re-election. 
Following performance evaluation,  
the Board confirms its belief that  
all directors bring significant value 
to the business, are effective in 
Board decision-making and show 
the appropriate level of commitment 
to their roles. The Board therefore 
recommends the re-election of all 
directors, as listed in the separate 
Notice of AGM.

Board and committee meetings
The Board meets formally at least six 
times per year, with additional meetings 
to approve the publication of the annual 
and interim results. 
Attendance at Board and Committee 
meetings by each director in the 
eighteen months to 31 January 2014  
is set out below.
A Nomination Committee will be 
constituted for each new director 
appointment and is constituted as  
a formal sub-committee of the 
Board with its own defined Terms of 
Reference. The Committee’s principal 
role is to review the composition of 
the Board and to manage the process 
for nomination of candidates and 
recommendation of a shortlist for 
the appointment of a non-executive 
director or Chairman. Membership will 
vary but the terms of reference for the 
Committee have been agreed by the 
Board and are available online at 
www.airpartner.com/investors/
corporate-governance.
When proposing appointments of 
Directors, the Committee considers 
the skills, knowledge and experience 
that a candidate possesses compared 
to the skill sets and experience of 
the Board as it currently stands. 
Selection of candidates also takes 
into consideration the breadth 
of knowledge that the Board has 
and that it may require to provide 
a well balanced environment 
which encourages scrutiny and 
appropriate challenge of the Executive 
management. Independence of  
non-executive Directors is of paramount 
importance being a cornerstone of good 
corporate governance.
In November 2013 the Nomination 
Committee made up of Richard 
Everitt, Andrew Wood and Mark Briffa 
appointed external search agents 
Odgers Berndtson to provide a shortlist 
of suitable external candidates for the 
position of Chief Finance Officer of  
the Company.

Annual Report 2014 31
Directors’ report
The Remuneration Committee is  
made up of the non-executive directors 
and is chaired by Grahame Chilton. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
remuneration policy on behalf of the 
Board and, in particular, is responsible 
for setting executive remuneration 
levels and making discretionary 
performance-related awards to the 
executive directors. The Remuneration 
Committee’s report appears in full on 
pages 36 to 53.
The Audit Committee is also made 
up of non-executive directors except 
G. Chilton, and is chaired by Andrew 
Wood. Although not members,  
the external auditor and the CFO  
are notified of all meetings and may 
attend by invitation. At each meeting, 
the Committee has the opportunity  
to talk to the external auditor without 
the CFO being present. 
The principal duties of the Audit 
Committee are to monitor the integrity 
of the Company’s financial statements, 
to ensure that appropriate accounting 
policies and standards are being 
followed, to review on behalf of the 
Board the effectiveness of audit 
procedures and the work of the 
independent auditor and to monitor 
on behalf of the Board the systems for 
internal financial control. The Board 
as a whole is responsible for internal 
control and risk management. The 
Audit Committee is required to report 
its findings to the Board, making 
any necessary recommendations for 
action or improvements. The Audit 
Committee’s report appears in full on 
pages 32 to 34.
Leadership T eam
The Leadership Team meets monthly 
to monitor operational performance, 
to consider new developments in line 
with the Group’s strategic aims and 
to discuss issues relating to different 
trading divisions or geographic regions . 
The Leadership Team has its own terms 
of reference and limits of authority, 
below those of the main Board. The 
executive directors report back to each 
main Board meeting. Leadership Team 
members will be invited to attend main 
Board sessions during each year, to 
have the opportunity to present their 
business plans, report on progress 
and give an update on key operational 
activity, future plans and business 
opportunities. In turn, non-executive 
directors attend some sessions of the 
Leadership Team, purely as observers, 
to gain a better understanding of 
current issues across the Group.
Company Secretary
All directors have access to the 
Company Secretary who is charged with 
ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed, that the Company complies 
with applicable rules and regulations 
and that Board members receive 
appropriate and timely information to 
enable them to discharge their duties 
effectively. The Company Secretary 
advises the Board on governance 
matters and can make arrangements 
for the provision of independent legal 
advice for individual directors, on 
request and up to a maximum fee limit 
set by the Board. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is  
a matter for the Board as a whole. “
“
Report of the Audit Committee  
for the eighteen months ended  
31 January 2014
The committee met five times 
during the period. In addition to 
reviewing the interim and annual 
results announcements in advance 
of publication and planning for the 
annual statutory audit, the Committee 
has focused on documenting 
more formally the process for risk 
management and continues to review 
internal control developments.
A formal report was received from 
the statutory auditor, Deloitte LLP , 
in respect of the audit and matters 
arising from the report were discussed 
prior to the Board’s approval of the 
financial statements. The Committee 
has reviewed the external auditor’s 
independence and the effectiveness 
of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK  
regulatory requirements.
Deloitte LLP also provide taxation 
advice to the Group but a clear 
distinction is maintained between  
audit and non-audit work to ensure  
that their independence and objectivity 
is not prejudiced by the level of fees 
received, or the nature of the work 
performed. The total amount paid  
for non-audit work in the eighteen 
month period was £61,000 –  
(2012 – £186,000).
The Committee considered in advance 
the content and scope of audit work and 
the audit fees proposed by Deloitte LLP 
and discussed changes in accounting 
policies and new developments 
within the business which might affect 
financial reporting going forward.
Internal control 
During the year, the full Board was 
responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness, though reports are 
provided in the first instance to the 
Audit Committee by the CFO and  
the statutory auditor. 
During the year, the full  
Board was responsible  
for the Group’s system  
of internal control.  Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 33
Directors’ report
The key internal procedures currently  
in place are as follows: 
 — A detailed and comprehensive 
annual budget is produced and 
formally approved by the Board.
 — The Board maintains a schedule of 
key matters reserved for its approval, 
which include financing and changes 
to banking arrangements, all 
significant capital expenditure and 
all acquisitions and disposals.
 — Both the Leadership Team and the 
main Board receive monthly financial 
reports, showing the performance 
of each Division and country, with 
relevant commentaries to highlight 
variance from budget or particular 
areas of concern.
 — Business performance reports are 
circulated to the Leadership Team  
on a weekly basis for sales bookings, 
and monthly to monitor overall 
performance.
 — Clearly defined authority limits and 
controls are in place over contract 
signing limits and purchasing 
commitments; in particular, 
brokers operate within individual, 
pre-set limits of authority and only 
those staff who have successfully 
completed a six month probationary 
period can sign charter commitments 
on behalf of the Group.
 — Each of the Group’s major offices is 
visited at least once a year by a senior 
member of the Finance team. 
 — Risk registers are reviewed by  
the Audit Committee twice each  
year. Between such meetings,  
any significant risks identified will 
be notified to directors and control 
procedures suggested for their 
approval to mitigate against such 
risks, where possible.
 — The Group does not trade 
speculatively in derivatives.  
Other than forward foreign  
exchange contracts, the Group 
does not use complex treasury 
instruments in the normal course  
of business and any specific projects 
that may involve such instruments 
require Board approval. 
 — Clearly defined authority limits 
and controls are in place over the 
extension of credit to clients.
An internal audit function was 
established in the year. The Audit 
Committee reviewed and approved 
a work programme for the function 
comprising internal audit visits to 
selected offices with a self -review 
programme of work. The largest offices 
receive an internal audit visit annually 
with smaller offices reviewed less 
frequently. The findings of the internal 
audit work programme are presented 
to the Audit Committee for review. 
The internal audit function is not fully 
independent of management as it is 
currently staffed by a member of the 
finance function.
 
In their review, the directors will 
consider the nature of the Group’s 
business, the risks to which that 
particular business is exposed, the 
likelihood of such risks occurring and 
the costs of protecting against them. 
However, such a system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance.
A whistle-blowing policy is in place 
across the Group to enable members 
of staff to bring to the attention of any 
director serious matters of financial 
misconduct which they believe would 
damage the performance or reputation 
of Air Partner plc. Applying the principles of the Code
Improvements have been made in 
corporate governance during the year 
as well as establishing an internal audit 
function. Air Partner’s main market 
listing on the London Stock Exchange 
is valued by clients and suppliers as 
a mark of quality and transparency 
of information and I believe that the 
systems in place for Board governance, 
as detailed above, are appropriate for  
a smaller listed company.
Additional information for shareholders 
Information on share capital and major 
interests in shares, which is required 
to be disclosed under Rule 7 .2.6 of the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
appears within the Directors’ Report  
on page 26.
Communication with shareholders
The Board is keen to ensure that 
effective communication with 
shareholders, analysts and the financial 
press is maintained throughout the 
year. This is achieved through timely 
publication of the annual and half year 
results and other announcements, 
as well as through presentations to 
analysts and significant shareholders. 
The Board seeks to present its strategy 
and performance in an objective 
and balanced manner. Directors 
are encouraged to meet significant 
shareholders and are keen to gain 
an understanding of the views and 
comments of both institutional and 
private individual shareholders.
The Board welcomes the participation  
of shareholders in the AGM and will 
again, this year, count all votes cast, 
whether in person or by proxy, by 
means of a poll on every resolution. 
The Chairmen of Board Committees 
will be available at the AGM to answer 
any questions that might arise. 
In accordance with the Corporate 
Governance Code the votes cast and 
the numbers of shares voted for and 
against each resolution, and any  
votes withheld, will be made public  
by means of an announcement through  
a Regulatory Information Service and  
on the Company’s website.
The AGM will be held at 11:00 am  
on Thursday 5 June 2014 at  
2 City Place, Beehive Ring Road, 
Gatwick, West Sussex RH6 0PA.  
The Notice of AGM is contained  
in a separate document which has  
been sent by post, together with  
a Proxy Form, to those shareholders  
who prefer a paper copy and by  
email where shareholders have  
agreed that Air Partner can 
communicate with them electronically.

Form are available to download at

Directors’ report
Directors’ responsibility  
statement
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Strategic report 
incorporating the business review, 
the Directors’ report, the Directors’ 
remuneration report and the Group  
and parent Company financial 
statements. The directors are required 
to prepare financial statements for the 
Group in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted for use in the European 
Union and have also elected to prepare 
financial statements for the Company in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted for use 
in the European Union. Company law 
requires the directors to prepare such 
financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements 
present fairly for each financial year 
the Group’s and Company’s financial 
position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the 
fair presentation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s “Framework for 
the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements”. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable IFRS. 
Directors are also required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies 
and apply them consistently;
 — make judgments and estimates  
that are reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
 — present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information;
 — provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on 
the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 — prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and of the 
Company, for safeguarding the assets, 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ Report and 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which 
comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group 
website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of the financial 
statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ statement of responsibility  
for financial statements
Each of the directors serving at the  
date of approval of the accounts 
confirms that, to the best of his 
knowledge and belief:
 — the financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position 
and financial performance of the 
Group and Company; and
 — the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Business Review, the Financial 
Review and the Directors’ Report give 
a fair review of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that the 
Group faces.
The responsibility statement was 
approved by the Board of Directors  
on 9 April 2014. Introduction
Process
This report is on the activities of  
the Remuneration Committee for  
the period to 31 January 2014.  
It sets out the remuneration policy  
and remuneration details for the 
executive and non-executive directors 
of the company. This is the first time  
the Company has prepared this report  
in accordance with the Large and 
Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013; the Companies Act 
2006 and meets the requirements 
of the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules. A resolution to approve 
the report will be proposed at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting of 
the Company at which the financial 
statements will be approved.
The report has been divided into 
separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information and is split into 
three main areas; the statement by the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
the annual report on remuneration and 
the policy report. The policy report has 
been approved by the Board and will  
be subject to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting on 5 June and will take effect 
on the day following. The annual report 
on remuneration has been approved 
by the Board and provides details on 
remuneration in the period and some 
other information required by the 
Regulations. It will be subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the  
2014 Annual General Meeting.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the 
auditors to report to the shareholders 
on certain parts of the Director’s 
Remuneration Report and to state 
whether, in their opinion; those parts 
of the report have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Regulations. The parts of the annual 
report on remuneration that are subject 
to audit are indicated in that report. 
The statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the 
policy report are not subject to audit.
Policy report
The Company’s policy in relation to 
executive directors remains unchanged 
from prior financial years and is 
designed to attain, retain and motivate 
individuals of the calibre and expertise  
to manage the Group’s strategic plans 
and lead the management team. 
The policy is designed to achieve 
strategically stretching goals as  
well as aligning their interests to 
shareholders and stakeholders alike. 
The Committee seeks to ensure that  
the Company’s remuneration system 
and policy encourage value creation  
for shareholders, promote responsible 
and safe practices and maintain  
a demonstrably fair relationship  
between pay and performance. Air Partner plc

Annual statement  
of the Chairman  
of Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present the 
remuneration committee’s report  
on director’s remuneration for  
the period ended 31 January 2014. 
The information set out on pages 49  
to 53 of this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report represents the auditable 
disclosures referred to in the  
Auditor’s report on pages 65 to 66  
as specified by the UK Listing  
Authority and the Regulations
The Remuneration Committee’s 
philosophy for remuneration remains 
to attract and retain leaders who are 
focussed and encouraged to deliver 
business transformation, develop a 
sustainable, profitable business and 
increase shareholder value. 
Our policy is unchanged from that in 
force in prior financial years and will 
take effect from the day following the 
Annual General Meeting on 5 June 
2014 and will operate for up to three 
years. Future reviews of future business 
and remuneration strategies during 
this three year period may alter the 
policy. If such alterations are deemed 
by the Remuneration Committee to be 
significant, the policy will be submitted 
to the next available General Meeting 
for shareholder approval.

different performance scenarios
The charts below set out an illustration 
of the remuneration policy for 2014. 
The charts provide an illustration of 
the proportion of total remuneration 
made up of each component of the 
remuneration policy and the value  
of each component.
The bonus scheme for senior  
executives was introduced in 
September 2010 and is  
based on on-target performance.  
The first 30% of the on-target  
bonus depends on individual 
achievement in Key Responsibility  
Areas (KRAs), determined each  
year by the Remuneration Committee.  
The remaining 70% is linked to 
corporate performance, evidenced 
by the reported underlying profit of 
the Group, excluding discontinued 
and exceptional items. Company 
outperformance is rewarded for  
each 1% above target profit, up to  
a maximum amount of the original  
profit target.
Three scenarios are illustrated  
for each executive director. 
CEO and CFO
Maximum 
 — fixed pay plus full vesting of all 
performance related pay;
At expectation
 — fixed pay plus short and long-term 
performance related pay vesting at  
the levels reasonably expected; and
Minimum 
 — only fixed pay (salary, benefits in 
kind and pension) is payable and 
no short or long term performance-
related pay accrues.
Please note that the following 
information is indicative and not final, 
although will be agreed in due course.
Key to charts
 — Salary, benefits in kind and pension 
(as per the remuneration policy)  
are shown as estimated cash cost  
or taxable value to the individual
 — Air Partner’s bonus schemes operate 
so that amounts in respect of the 
current financial period are only 
paid in the following financial year, 
after the completion of the audit 
and Board approval of the accounts. 
The charts reflect the accrual in the 
accounts earned in the period and 
not necessarily the actual amount 
paid in the period.
 — Bonus at below threshold 
performance reflects a position 
where none of the personal or 
corporate metrics where achieved at 
threshold level; expectation reflects 
metrics achieved at target level and 
maximum reflects the position where 
every metric is achieved at stretch  
up to the amount of the bonus cap.
 — L TIP awards are made in the year 
but do not normally vest until three 
years after award. The charts reflect 
the value at the strike price of the 
award made during the financial 
period varied according to company 
performance alone. CEO

Future policy – Non-executive directors
Fees
Fees for non-executive directors are set at an 
appropriate level to recruit and retain directors 
of a sufficient calibre without paying more 
than is necessary to do so. Fees are set taking 
into account the following factors; the time 
commitment required to fulfil the role, typical 
practice at other companies of a similar size 
and salary levels of employees throughout  
the Group.
The non-executive director fees policy is;
—  to pay a basic fee for membership  
of the Board
—  additional fees for chairmanship  
of the Board and 
—  chairmanship of a committee to take  
into account the additional responsibilities 
and time commitment of these roles.
Fees are reviewed at appropriate levels at 
appropriate intervals (normally once every 
year) by the Board. There is no increase  
in fees planned for 2014.
Air Partner’s current fee policy is as follows:
—  Basic fee – £30,000
—  Board Chairman – £30,000
—  Committee Chairman – £5,000

Policy provisions relating to  
directors’ remuneration
Flexibility, discretion and judgment
Every attempt has been made to ensure 
that the majority of situations and 
scenarios that may arise in relation 
to director remuneration have been 
covered in this policy. However, there 
may be times when the Remuneration 
Committee may need a level of 
discretion, judgment or flexibility to 
achieve a fair result. Discretion will be 
required at times where changes to 
business requirements require short 
term incentives to drive appropriate 
behaviours and incentivise. Judgment 
and flexibility may also be needed in 
downgrading, as well as upgrading, 
certain remuneration elements there 
by permitting the Committee to adapt 
to changing situations. Although 
the Committee will maintain a strict 
adherence to the three year policy 
whenever possible, the requirement 
to engage with shareholders each and 
every time a short time measure is 
required can be onerous in time and 
expense. It remains a commitment of 
the Committee to maintain engagement 
with shareholders throughout the 
three year life and, where appropriate, 
formally engage them in placing a 
revised policy to a General Meeting  
for approval before the three year 
period expires.
Such discretion for those key areas  
are detailed as follows;
 — Bonus – Bonus programmes for 
executive directors are unique and 
tailored to their respective roles 
with performance criteria aligned 
to the needs of the Company and 
shareholders. Maximum bonuses 
are capped for the CEO and CFO at 
110.5% and 82.975% respectively. 
The Committee will have the discretion 
(1) to alter the performance criteria 
each year as progress is made 
towards the Group’s strategy  
and the needs of the Group (but in 
no event to exceed the maximum 
capped bonus stated in the policy 
table above without reference to 
shareholders in General Meeting), 
(2) in relation to leavers as provided 
for in the policy table and (3) on a 
change of control of the Company,  
to determine the amount of bonus  
for that year taking into account  
such factors it considers appropriate, 
including performance and time-
apportionment and any additional 
terms which may apply to such 
payment, and (4) whether to settle 
bonus awards in cash or shares.
 — L TIP – Committee will have the 
discretion (1) to determine who is  
to participate each year in the plan 
and the levels of award to be made 
(but not to exceed the levels stated  
in the L TIP Rules), (2) to set or alter 
the performance criteria at the outset 
of each award, (3) in relation to 
leavers as provided for in the policy 
table, and (4) on a change of control 
of the Company, to determine the 
level of vesting of awards taking into 
account performance and such other 
factors as the Committee believes to  
be relevant. Executive director services contracts

 — Make payment proposals on hiring 
a new executive director which are 
outside the standard policy but as 
restricted and stipulated below 
under Recruitment remuneration 
arrangements.
Recruitment remuneration 
arrangements
In the event that the Company recruits 
a new executive director (either from 
within the organisation or externally) 
when determining appropriate 
remuneration arrangements, the 
Committee will take into consideration 
all relevant factors (including but 
not limited to quantum, the type of 
remuneration being offered and the 
jurisdiction the candidate was recruited 
from) to ensure that arrangements 
are in the best interests of both the 
Company and its shareholders without 
paying more than is necessary to recruit 
an executive of the required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to 
align the remuneration package offered 
with Air Partner’s remuneration policy 
outlined in the table above. 
However, the Committee retains the 
discretion to make:
 — proposals on hiring a new executive 
director which are outside the 
standard policy. In the first year 
of appointment, the Committee 
may offer additional remuneration 
arrangements that it considers 
appropriate and necessary to  
recruit and retain the individual  
but shall not be offered in successive 
years. Such remuneration may be 
made in the form of cash or share 
based awards which may vest 
immediately or at a future point 
in time. Vesting may be subject to 
performance conditions selected  
by the Committee.
 —  awards on appointing an executive 
director to “buy-out” remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving  
a previous employer. In doing so  
the Committee will take account  
of relevant factors attached to  
these awards, the form in which  
they were granted (e.g. cash or 
shares) and the time frame over 
which they would have vested. 
Generally buy-out awards will be 
made on a comparable basis to  
those forfeited.
 — in the event of recruitment, the 
Committee may also grant awards 
to a new executive director under 
Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for 
the granting of awards, specifically to 
facilitate, in unusual circumstances, 
the recruitment or retention of an 
executive director, without seeking 
prior shareholder approval.
 No sign-on payments will be made to 
non-executive directors nor shall they 
be offered share options or L TIPs.
Executive director service contracts
Each of the service contracts for 
executive directors:
Mark Briffa entered into a service 
agreement with the Company dated 
8 February 2012. His agreement is 
terminable by either party giving 
not less than 12 months’ written 
notice. If the Company terminates 
employment without due notice, 
other than in circumstances such as 
gross misconduct or other immediate 
justifiable causes, the Company is 
required to make a payment equal 
to the aggregate of the executive 
director’s basic salary and the value of 
any contractual benefits for the notice 
period including any accrued but 
untaken holiday.
Gavin Charles entered into a service 
agreement with the Company on  
23 June 2010. His agreement will be 
terminated by the Company on 1 May 
2014 without due notice. The Company 
is therefore required to make a payment 
equal to the aggregate of the executive 
director’s basic salary and the value of 
any contractual benefits for the notice 
period including any accrued but 
untaken holiday. 
The Remuneration Committee generally 
seeks to apply practical mitigation 
in respect of termination payments 
where appropriate. Under terms of 
reference agreed in September 2010, 
any ex-gratia payments made at 
the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee in excess of statutory or 
contractual obligations will be limited 
to an amount not exceeding one year’s 
bonus plus legal fees, so long as such 
fees do not exceed £5,000.
The service agreements are held at the 
registered office and are available to 
shareholders to view on request from 
the Company Secretary. Air Partner plc

T erms and conditions for the Chairman 
and non-executive directors
Richard Everitt was appointed as a 
non-executive director of the Company 
on 1 January 2005. Mr Everitt’s letter of 
appointment was updated following 
his appointment as Chairman on 
9 February 2012 and his initial 
appointment was for a maximum  
period of three years ending on  
8 February 2015.
The Chairman’s appointment may 
be terminated by the Company 
in accordance with the letter of 
appointment giving three months’ 
notice, the Company’s Articles of 
Association or the Companies Act 
2006. In the event of early termination 
of contract, there will be no payment 
for loss of office or for the unexpired 
appointment term. In addition to 
the time commitment, the annual 
engagement fee and other business 
interests, the Chairman is entitled to 
hold other directorships provided  
such appointment does not interfere 
with his position at the Company.
The non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment from the 
Company covering matters such as 
duties, time commitment, fees and 
other business interests. The non-
executive directors are appointed for 
an initial three year period which may 
be renewed once by mutual consent.  
In exceptional circumstances, one 
further extension may be agreed, but 
no Non-Executive Director may serve 
for a period of more than nine years 
from their date of appointment.
Non-executive director appointments 
may be terminated by the Company 
in accordance with the letter of 
appointment giving three months’ 
notice, the Company’s Articles of 
Association or the Companies Act 
2006. In the event of early termination 
of contract, there will be no payment 
for loss of office or for unexpired 
appointment term. In addition to 
the time commitment, the annual 
engagement fee and other business 
interests, the non Executive Directors 
are entitled to hold other directorships 
provided such appointment does  
not interfere with their position  
at the Company. 
New letters of appointment were 
issued in September 2011 to Mr Mack 
and Mr Pollard, aligning their terms 
of appointment with those agreed for 
Mr Wood in June 2011. The new letters 
confirm a standard term of three years, 
renewable once by mutual consent  
and, in exceptional circumstances,  
by one further period, such that no  
non-executive director may serve  
for a period of more than nine years. 
All appointments are subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association and 
annual re-election by shareholders. Non-executive directors’ Letters of Appointment

Non-executive directors’  
Letters of Appointment
The Company intends to have at least 
two independent non-executives on the 
Board at any time. The Board considers 
each of Mr Everitt, Mr Pollard, Mr Wood 
and Mr Chilton to be independent. 
No director has any direct or indirect 
interest in any contract or arrangement 
subsisting at the date of these financial 
statements which is significant in 
relation to the business of the Group 
and which has not otherwise been 
disclosed.
Policy on payment for loss of office
Notice periods set in executive 
directors service contracts are driven 
by the need to protect shareholder 
value and interests. As noted above, 
both executive directors have notice 
periods of twelve months. A bonus 
is not usually paid to a good leaver 
should they leave before the payment 
date of said bonus and there is no 
mechanism for claw back. 
The principles on which the 
determination for payments on 
termination will be approached  
are as follows:
 — service contracts legally oblige the 
Company to either continue to  
pay salary and pension allowances 
and other contractual benefits 
for any unworked notice period 
or, at the option of the Company, 
to make payment in lieu of notice 
unless where an executive 
director’s employment is summarily 
terminated. The committee reserves 
the right to make discretionary 
payments in lieu of notice which  
may be paid in a lump sum,  
quarterly or monthly;
 — the payment of a performance 
bonus and/or other short term 
incentives may be offered to the 
departing executive director during 
his/her notice period, based on 
an assessment of personal and 
corporate performance up to the  
date of departure. Bonuses will  
not be paid for any unworked  
period of notice;
 — where a role fulfilled by an executive 
director is declared redundant 
then the individual may have 
the legal right to either statutory 
redundancy pay or to a payment 
under the Group’s normal severance 
arrangements applicable to 
employees generally;
 — in case of poor performance, 
contractual termination payments 
may generate undue and potentially 
excessive reward, in such 
circumstances, the Remuneration 
Committee will consider terminating 
a service contract on a fair basis, 
whilst protecting the rights of  
the Company;
 — payments for loss of office as a 
director of Air Partner plc or any  
of its subsidiaries will not be paid; Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 45
Directors’  
remuneration report
“
“
The Company’s various incentive 
schemes are governed by formal 
rules, all of which have been approved 
by shareholders. Directors have no 
contractual rights to the value inherent 
in any awards held under these plans 
and these plans provide for vesting in 
different leaver scenarios.
If employment is terminated by the 
Company, the departing executive may 
have a legal entitlement (under statute 
or otherwise) to additional amounts, 
which would need to be met. The 
Committee retains discretion to settle 
any other amounts reasonably due 
to the executive where the Company 
wishes to enter into a settlement 
agreement. In certain circumstances, 
the Committee may approve new 
contractual arrangements with 
departing executives, potentially 
including settlement, confidentiality, 
restrictive covenants and/or 
consultancy arrangements. These will 
only be used where the Committee 
believes it is in the best interests of  
the Company. 
Consideration of employee  
remuneration arrangements
Air Partner employs a number of 
colleagues in a variety of roles, from 
administration support staff and 
brokers to senior management and 
directors across a range of geographies. 
Its reward structure for all employees 
is built around a set of common reward 
principles on a framework altered to 
suit the needs of the business for our 
different employee groups across the 
Company. Reward packages therefore 
differ, taking into account a number of 
factors including seniority, impact on 
the business, local practice, custom 
and legislation.
The remuneration policy for the 
executive directors reflects the  
overall remuneration philosophy  
and principles of the wider Group.  
When determining remuneration  
policy and arrangements for  
executive directors, the Remuneration  
Committee consider the wider  
pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group to ensure 
pay structures from director to senior 
management are appropriately aligned.
When considering salary increases  
for the executive directors, the 
Committee considers the general level 
of salary increase across the Group. 
Typically, salary increases will be 
aligned with those received elsewhere 
in the Group unless the Committee 
considers that specific circumstances 
require a different level of increase for 
executive directors. 
Considering shareholder views
The Committee is dedicated to an 
on-going dialogue with shareholders 
and seeks shareholder views when  
any significant charges are being made 
to remuneration arrangements.  
Over the last few years the Committee 
has consulted shareholders regarding 
the implementation of the 2012 
Share Option Scheme and 2012 Long 
Term Incentive Plan and applicable 
performance measures.
Air Partner employs a number  
of colleagues in a variety of roles, 
from administration support 
staff and brokers to senior 
management and directors 
across a range of geographies.  Remuneration Committee structure
The Remuneration Committee is 
constituted as a formal sub-committee 
of the Board with its own defined Terms 
of Reference. Its primary role is to review 
and set the remuneration policy for the 
executive directors, within the context 
of salaries and benefits paid across the 
Group as a whole. The full Board agrees 
the remuneration of the Chairman and 
non-executive directors on the principle 
that no individual should be able to 
determine their own remuneration. 
All the non-executive directors  
were members of the Committee  
for the whole year, with the exception  
of Grahame Chilton who was appointed 
in July 2013. The Committee is chaired 
by Grahame Chilton who, upon  
his appointment, succeeded  
Andrew Wood.
The Committee can, and did obtain 
information and advice during the period 
under review from the the Group  
HR Director, the Company Secretary,  
the executive directors and may seek 
advice from any other employees as 
required. It may also obtain, at the 
expense of the Company, any necessary 
legal or professional advice, up to a  
pre-determined limit but has not needed 
to do so in the year under review. 
Individual components  
of remuneration
Share options
Share options were awarded at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion 
under the Company Share Option 
Plan which was first approved by 
shareholders in 2003. This plan is now 
closed and no further grants of options 
may be made under this scheme.
Exercises of options by staff below 
director level and exercises of all 
options granted before 24 May 2010 
are subject only to a service condition. 
Options vest three years from the date 
of grant and expire if not exercised 
within ten years, except in exceptional 
circumstances such as the death of the 
holder. All outstanding options lapse 
upon cessation of employment,  
unless there are special circumstances 
such as redundancy or retirement  
when options must be exercised within  
a six month period. Options may not  
be granted at a discount and the 
aggregate market price for options 
awarded during any one year period 
may not exceed four times the 
individual’s relevant emoluments. 
The vesting of options granted to 
directors on or after 24 May 2010 is 
subject to additional performance 
criteria intended to align directors’ 
interests with those of investors. 
A maximum of 80% of the options 
awarded may vest in 2013 if growth  
in the Group’s undiluted earnings  
per share from continuing operations 
(EPS) has increased by 33% over a 
period of approximately three years. 
Half of this number of options will  
vest if EPS over the same period has 
increased by 22.5%, with a sliding scale 
for growth between 22.5% and 33%. 
None of these options will vest if EPS 
has grown by less than 22.5% over the 
period. The initial measurement of EPS 
was taken from the annual accounts 
of the Company to 31 July 2010 and 
options may vest if the performance 
conditions have been satisfied by 
reference to the annual accounts  
of the Company as at  
31 July 2013. 
The remaining 20% of options shall  
vest completely if underlying profit 
before tax from activities outside the 
UK has increased by 50% over the same 
three year period. This target has been 
set to align with the Group’s stated 
business objective to increase its 
geographical diversification.
In respect of the grants of options made 
on 26 October 2010, 80% of the options 
granted will vest if EPS has grown over 
the three year period from 26.8 pence to 
35.7 pence. None of these options will 
vest if EPS after three years does  
not exceed 32.8 pence.  Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 47
Directors’  
remuneration report
Options granted on 20 April 2012 will 
vest if the following criteria are met 
over a three year period ending 2015;
1  Vesting of 50% of the options 
granted will depend on 
outperformance of Air Partner plc’s 
Total Shareholder Return relative  
to the FTSE UK Small Cap Index,  
ex Investment Trusts (the “Index”). 
 — No options will vest if TSR 
outperformance is less than  
the equivalent of 5% per annum 
(compounded) relative to  
the Index.
 — If TSR outperformance is the 
equivalent of 5% per annum 
(compounded) relative to 
the Index, half of the number 
of options subject to this 
performance condition will vest.
 — If TSR outperformance is the 
equivalent of 10% per annum 
(compounded) relative to the 
Index, all of the options subject 
to this performance condition 
will vest. 
 — Options will vest on a sliding 
scale if TSR outperformance  
is between 5% and 10%.
At the AGM in 2012, shareholders 
approved a new share option scheme. 
Under the 2012 Scheme options  
may be granted to eligible employees 
(including executive directors) within 
the Air Partner Group, subject to defined 
limits. There is no present intention 
of granting options to the executive 
directors of Air Partner plc but if that 
position changes the performance 
conditions set out below will be 
reconsidered to ensure they remain 
appropriate. The 2012 Scheme will 
comply with the institutional guidelines 
relating to employee share incentives. 
Appropriate reference will be made 
to the Company’s Remuneration 
Committee (comprising only  
non-executive directors who are 
ineligible to participate in the 
2012 Scheme) with regard to the 
establishment of performance 
conditions at the time (or shortly before) 
options are granted. These performance 
conditions, which must be met prior to 
the exercise of the options, will be  
designed so that they will only be  
met in the event of a significant 
and sustained improvement in the 
underlying financial performance  
of the Company. It is intended that,  
the first one third of the number of 
shares placed under option to any 
individual will vest if the Company’s 
underlying basic earnings per share 
increases over a fixed period of three 
consecutive financial years by an 
average of at least 3% per annum in 
excess of inflation over the same period 
as measured by reference to the Retail 
Prices Index (“RPI”). Vesting of the full 
number of shares under option will be 
subject to meeting an increased target  
of RPI + 7% per annum over that 
period with straight line vesting in 
between. There will be no re-testing 
of performance conditions if they are 
not met by the end of the relevant 
performance period.
2  The remaining options granted will 
vest if underlying profit before tax 
(“PBT”) for the financial year ending  
31 July 2015 exceeds twice the 
underlying PBT for the financial year 
ending 31 July 2012 or £6 million, 
whichever is the higher. None of  
these options shall vest if PBT for  
the financial year ending 31 July 2015  
is below £6 million. 
Grants of options will generally 
be made within 42 days of the 
announcement of annual or half yearly 
results and the base measurement  
for EPS will be that shown in the  
annual or half yearly accounts of the 
Company most recently published.  
The Remuneration Committee must  
be satisfied at the time of vesting  
that the underlying performance  
of the Company justifies the vesting.  
No options may vest until the 
Committee has written to participants  
to confirm that the necessary 
conditions have been fulfilled.
The Remuneration C ommittee  
is constituted as a formal  
sub-committee of the Board with  
its own defined T erms of Reference.
“
“ Long term incentives
Long term incentives are awarded  
at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion under the Air Partner Long 
Term Incentive Plan 2012 (“L TIP”) which 
was approved by shareholders in 2012.
Awards made under the L TIP will be 
subject to performance conditions 
based on Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) and Earnings per Share (“EPS”) 
as, in the view of the Committee,  
these remain key performance 
indicators of the business.
Individual limits will normally be 
restricted to 100% of basic salary per 
annum. However, in circumstances 
considered by the Remuneration 
Committee to be exceptional, the 
limit may be increased to 150% of 
basic salary on a non-recurring basis. 
These are the maximum annual limits 
and the actual level of awards will be 
considered each year by the Committee 
before they are made. The vesting of 
awards will be subject to challenging 
TSR and EPS performance conditions 
being achieved over a minimum period 
of three years. 
In respect of the grants of L TIPs made on 
22 October 2013, 25% of L TIPs granted 
will vest if EPS has grown over the three 
year period by 5% + RPI. 100% of L TIPs 
granted will vest if EPS has grown over 
the three year period by 10% + RPI. For 
intermediate performance between RPI 
+ 5%pa and RPI + 10% pa vesting will 
occur on a straight-line basis.  Air Partner plc

 * option vested but not exercised
Options are generally exercisable 
between three and ten years from the 
date of grant, subject to continuing 
service. Exercises of options under 
grants (a) (b) and (c) are not subject  
to any additional performance criteria. 
During the period Mark Briffa  
exercised 50,000 share options 
granted in May 2010. These options 
had historically been disclosed as 
having performance conditions 
attached to them, hence, external legal 
advice clarified that the amendments 
made to the options in November 2010 
to incorporate performance conditions 
were ineffective. Accordingly,  
Mark Briffa was legally able to  
exercise these options in full. 
I would like to apologise for the 
inaccuracy in previous Annual Reports 
which stated that the options in 
question had performance conditions 
attached. Following a review of other 
share options in the business I can 
confirm that this was an isolated error. Air Partner plc

The number of shares awarded under 
the L TIP was determined by using the 
closing price of an Air Partner plc share 
on the day preceding the date of grant 
(21 October) as ascertained by the 
Official List which was 502.5p per share.
The market price per share at  
31 January 2014 was 517 .5 pence  
(31 July 2012: 242.0 pence) and ranged 
between 620.00 pence and 240.00 
pence during the 18 months period . 
The average price during the 18 months 
period was 378.26 pence per share.
An independent valuation of the fair 
value of options has been carried out.

As a result of the change of accounting reference date to 31 January, as described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the following  
pages present ‘unaudited pro-forma’ financial information comprising a consolidated income statement, a consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income, a consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of financial position and

P2 Segmental analysis
The services provided by the Group consist of hiring different types of aircraft for charter to its customers and related aviation services. 
The Board reviews the performance of the services that are provided by the Group on the following basis: Commercial Jet Broking, 
Private Jet Broking, Freight Broking and Support Services (which includes fuel, emergency planning and travel services). Each of these 
components has been identified as an operating segment.
Sale transactions between operating segments are carried out on an arm’s length basis and all revenues, results, assets and liabilities 
which are reviewed by the Board are prepared on a basis consistent with those that are reported in the financial statements.
The Board does not review assets and liabilities at a segmental level, therefore these items are not disclosed.
The segmental information, as provided to the Board for the reportable segments on a monthly basis, is as follows:

The Company is domiciled in the UK but, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a significant amount of revenue from  
external customers is derived from overseas countries. The Group reviews revenue based upon the location of the assets used  
to generate those revenues. Apart from the UK, no single country is deemed to have material revenue and non-current asset levels,  
other than goodwill in relation to the French operations. Notes to the unaudited

At the commencement of the prior period, a provision of £1,000,000 was held  
in relation to unpaid Federal Excise Tax due on certain flights contracted by the  
Company outside the US but involving a US destination. During the prior year, the 
Company and its US tax advisors concluded discussions with the relevant authorities, 
resulting in payments totalling £468,000 including interest for late payment and 
professional fees. The remaining provision of £532,000 was written back to the  
income statement, resulting in a gain of £443,000 within administrative expenses  
and a gain of £89,000 within finance expense.
In the prior period the carrying value of the Group’s sole owned aircraft was written  
down by £335,000 to its fair value less costs to sell of £690,000 based on a third  
party valuation. The aircraft was disposed of during the twelve month period ended 
31 July 2013. See note P11 for further details.
 The reorganisation of the Group to report on a product-led basis has resulted in 
restructuring costs of £646,000 in the current period. In the prior period, the Group’s  
cost reduction restructuring exercise resulted in costs of £319,000. These costs in both 
the current and prior periods comprised redundancy payments, external legal advice  
and outplacement costs. These costs were included within administrative expenses.
In the current period, management conducted a review of ongoing intangible asset 
related projects and identified that an impairment was required to write down the  
assets to their recoverable amount, totaling £774,000. For details see note P9.  P4 Dividends

At 31 January 2014, a provision of £465,000 (31 July 2012: £474,000) was held in relation 
to the potential costs of settlement of claims which have been received from third parties 
following the closure of Air Partner Private Jets Limited. All remaining claims within this 
provision are expected to be settled by 31 March 2016.
During the prior financial year, the Group completed a cost reduction restructuring 
exercise. This resulted in a provision of £198,000 for employees who left the Group after 
the year end. Of this amount, £139,000, net of foreign exchange differences, was utilised 
during the current financial period and the remaining £59,000 will still be required. 
Additionally, and as a result of the change to a product-led reporting structure, during  
the current financial period further redundancies were identified and communicated  
to the relevant employees, resulting in a further provision of £210,000 being required.

been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent  
company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Relation  
to the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become  
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 − the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s  
and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 January 2014 and of the Group’s profit  
for the period then ended;
 − the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 − the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 − the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of Air Partner plc Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 − the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been  
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 − the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which  
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 − adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 − the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 − certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 − we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 − the directors’ statement, set out on page 20, in relation to going concern; 
 − the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s  
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
specified for our review; and
 − certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ 
remuneration.

statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued 1 General information
Air Partner plc (“the Group”, “the Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in 
England and Wales under registration number 00980675. The address of the registered office 
is 2 City Place, Beehive Ring Road, Gatwick, West Sussex, RH6 0PA. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 8 to 11.
2 Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted for use in the European Union in accordance 
with EU law (IAS regulation EC1606/2002) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, being the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. Unless otherwise stated, figures are 
rounded to the nearest thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are stated at fair value. 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, 
except as described in the following sections.
Change of accounting reference date 
On 26 July 2013 the Group announced it was changing its accounting reference date  
from 31 July to 31 January. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared  
for the 18 month period ended 31 January 2014. This decision will bring the busier  
part of the year, where most of the profit is generated, into the first six months of the 
Group’s financial year. This will enable better investment planning internally and will  
give shareholders greater visibility, at an earlier stage, of the likely full year result.
Adoption of new and revised standards
No new or revised standards or interpretations have been adopted in the current  
financial period.
New standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards  
have been published and are not mandatory for the current accounting period,  
and have not been early adopted by the Group:
 − Annual Improvements 2009-2011 cycle; effective for periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2013;
 − IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011); effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013;
 − IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011); effective for periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2013;
 − IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011); effective for periods

 − Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32);

There are no standards and interpretations in issue but not yet adopted which,  
in the opinion of the directors, will have a material effect on the reported income  
or net assets of the Group or the Company.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements  
of the Company (including its branch in Dubai) and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. Control is achieved where the Company 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so  
as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included  
in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to  
the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to 
the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
c) Key accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported  
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed  
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to  
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised  
if the revision affects only that period; or in the period of the revision and future periods  
if these are also affected.
Impairment of intangible assets
In the current period, management conducted a review of ongoing intangible asset  
related projects and identified that an impairment of £774,000 was required to write  
down the assets to their recoverable amount. Please refer to the Chief Executive’s  
Review on page 10 for further details about the impairment.
Third party claims
An assessment has been made of the potential costs of settlement of third party claims 
received following the closure of Air Partner Private Jets Limited, based on discussions  
with advisors and the outcomes of similar legal cases. There is no guarantee that such 
claims will be successful, nor that the full amount of the provision will be required. 
See note 5 for further details.
Accruals related to air charter contracts
When revenues and costs for air charter contracts are initially recognised,  
estimates may need to be made in order to accrue items of income and expenditure  
that have not been invoiced. These estimates may not reflect the ultimate outcome.  
During the year ended 31 July 2012, an extensive review of historical accruals  
related to air charter contracts was performed and as a result a number of accruals  
were reversed. See note 5 for further details.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued d) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executive’s Review  
on pages 8 to 11. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity  
position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review  
on page 12. In addition, note 20 to the financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital risk; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to interest rate risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Company has considerable cash resources and no debt. As a consequence,  
the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
e) Foreign currency
i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing 
at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency of the entity 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii) Financial statements of foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
at the reporting date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the 
period. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s 
translation reserve. 
f) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that 
control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum 
of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity 
over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s  
identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount  
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit  
or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.  
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Notes to the  
financial statements
Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 75 g) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation  
and any impairment losses. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life and  
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.  
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite 
useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful  
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate,  
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost of assets  
less their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Software  – 10–20% per annum on a straight-line basis
h) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost of assets  
less their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Short leasehold property – over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis
Leasehold improvements – over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis
Fixtures and equipment – 10–33% per annum on a straight-line basis
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum on a reducing balance basis
i) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible  
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets  
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  
of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets,  
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least 
annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset  
(or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  
but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that  
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount,  
in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
j) Assets in disposal groups classified as held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for 
immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be 
completed within one year from the date of classification. Such assets are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortised.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued k) Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value  
through profit or loss, and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date  
on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are initially 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs, except for financial assets held at fair  
value through profit or loss which are initially recognised at fair value and transaction  
costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when  
the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the Group  
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.  
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless  
they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets  
if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value 
at the date the contract is entered into, and subsequently gains or losses arising from 
changes in their fair value are presented in the income statement within administrative 
expenses in the period in which they arise. The Group’s financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward 
contracts, to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Derivatives not designated 
into an effective hedge relationship are classified as a financial asset or a financial liability. 
The Group has not designated any derivatives as hedging items and therefore does not 
apply hedge accounting.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months at the end of the reporting period.  
These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are subsequently  
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group’s loans and 
receivables comprise ‘trade receivables’, ‘other receivables’, ‘accrued income’ and  
‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the  
ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are  
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Other receivables
Other receivables are other amounts contractually due from third parties, for example 
deposits receivable for leased assets. 
Accrued income
Accrued income is revenue that has been contracted and recognised in accordance  
with the Group’s accounting policies, but not yet invoiced.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates  
their fair value.
Notes to the  
financial statements
Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 77 Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities in the following categories: at fair value through 
profit or loss, and at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which  
the financial liabilities were acquired. Management determines the classification of its 
financial liabilities at initial recognition. Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual agreement of the instrument. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are financial liabilities held for 
trading. A financial liability is classified in this category if acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Liabilities in this category are classified as current 
liabilities if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as 
non-current. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised 
at fair value at the date the contract is entered into, and subsequently gains or losses 
arising from changes in their fair value are presented in the income statement within 
administrative expenses in the period in which they arise. The Group’s financial liabilities  
at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
The Group’s financial liabilities at amortised cost comprise ‘trade payables’, ‘other payables’ 
and ‘accrued costs’. They are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired 
in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as 
current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented 
as non-current liabilities.
Other payables
Other payables that are financial liabilities at amortised cost are certain customer  
deposits which are contractually refundable to customers on demand.
Accrued costs
Accrued costs are costs that have been contracted and recognised in accordance  
with the Group’s accounting policies, but for which invoices have not yet been received  
or payments made, as applicable.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet 
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Equity instruments issued by the Group
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the asset of an 
entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. The Group’s equity instruments comprise ‘share capital’ 
in the balance sheet.
l) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required  
to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal 
plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will 
carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main 
features to those affected by it.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued m) Revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received for the provision  
of goods and services to third-party customers and is stated exclusive of Value Added Tax.  
In respect of the Group’s principal activities (being that of air charter brokers and providers 
of travel agency services), the full contract value is realised as revenue when the economic 
benefits are deemed to have passed to the customer, which is generally the flight date. 
Amounts invoiced to customers in respect of future flights, including amounts related  
to the JetCard product, are deferred at the balance sheet date and only recognized in income  
once the flight has taken place.
n) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible 
for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, is considered  
to be the Board. The nature of the operating segments is set out in note 3.
o) Share-based payments
The Group will from time to time grant options to employees to subscribe for ordinary shares 
in the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over 
the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, based on 
management’s estimate of the number of options which will ultimately vest, adjusting at each 
reporting date for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. 
p) Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense 
in the period in which the employees render service. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes 
where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined 
contribution retirement benefit scheme.
q) Taxation
The tax expense represents current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised  
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised  
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to  
the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill  
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted  
at the reporting date.
r) Non-trading items
Non-trading items are those items that in the directors’ view are required  
to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to assist in  
understanding the Group’s performance. 
Notes to the  
financial statements
Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 79 s) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer all,  
or substantially all, of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. Rental income or expenditure from operating leases 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
t) Dividends 
Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are 
recognised as a liability in the period in which they are paid.
3 Segmental analysis
The services provided by the Group consist of hiring different types of aircraft for charter 
to its customers and related aviation services. The Board reviews the performance of the 
services that are provided by the Group on the following basis: Commercial Jet Broking, 
Private Jet Broking, Freight Broking and Other Services (which includes operations and 
travel services). Each of these components has been identified as an operating segment.
Sale transactions between operating segments are carried out on an arm’s length basis 
and all revenues, results, assets and liabilities which are reviewed by the Board are 
prepared on a basis consistent with those that are reported in the financial statements.
The Board does not review assets and liabilities at a segmental level, therefore these 
items are not disclosed. 
The segmental information, as provided to the Board for the reportable segments  
on a monthly basis, is as follows:

Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued The Company is domiciled in the UK but, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, 
a significant amount of revenue from external customers is derived from overseas 
countries. The Group reviews revenue based upon the location of the assets used 
to generate those revenues. Apart from the UK, no single country is deemed to have 
material non-current asset levels, other than goodwill in relation to the French operation.
The Board also reviews information on a geographical basis based on the parts of the 
world which are considered to be key to operational activities. As a result the following 
additional information is provided showing a geographical split of the United Kingdom, 
Europe, the United States of America and the Rest of the World:

statement. These balances were estimates of invoices and credit notes for revenues and 
costs related to air charter contracts. Following an extensive review, the Group concluded 
that these balances should no longer be retained.
At the commencement of the prior year, a provision of £1,000,000 was held in relation 
to unpaid Federal Excise Tax due on certain flights contracted by the Company outside 
the US but involving a US destination. During the prior year, the Company and its US tax 
advisors concluded discussions with the relevant authorities, resulting in payments totalling 
£468,000 including interest for late payment and professional fees. The remaining provision 
of £532,000 was written back to the income statement, resulting in a gain of £443,000 
within administrative expenses and a gain of £89,000 within finance expense.
In the prior year, the carrying value of the Group’s sole owned aircraft was written  
down by £335,000 to its fair value less costs to sell of £690,000 based on a third  
party valuation. The aircraft was disposed of during the current financial period;  
see note 14 for further details.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued The reorganisation of the Group to report on a product-led basis has resulted in 
restructuring costs of £646,000 in the current period. In the prior period, the Group’s 
cost reduction restructuring exercise resulted in costs of £319,000. These costs in both 
the current and prior periods comprised redundancy payments, external legal advice 
and outplacement costs. These costs were included within administrative expenses.
In the current period, management conducted a review of ongoing intangible asset 
related projects and identied that an impairment of £774,000 was required to write 
down the assets to their recoverable amount.

Goodwill has been allocated entirely to one cash generating unit,  
being Air Partner International SAS.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit was measured on the basis of its value in use, by applying cash flow projections 
based on financial forecasts covering a three-year period. The key assumptions for  
the value in use calculation were those regarding the discount rates, growth rates  
and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the forecast period.  
The estimated growth rates were based on past performance and expectation of  
future changes in the market. The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow  
projections beyond the period covered by the financial forecasts was 2% (2012: 2%). 
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14% (2012: 10%).
The directors do not believe that there are any reasonably possible changes  
to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment of goodwill.

In the prior year, the Company disposed of its investment in the entire issued share 
capital of Air Partner Leasing USA, Inc., to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary  
Air Partner, Inc., for consideration of one ordinary share issued by Air Partner, Inc.
The Company tests its investments for impairment if there are indications that the 
investments may be impaired. The recoverable amount of each investment was 
measured on the basis of its value in use, by applying cash flow projections based 
on the financial forecasts covering a three-year period. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculation for each subsidiary were those regarding the discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
The estimated growth rates were based on past performance and expectation of future 
changes in the market. The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections 
beyond the period covered by the financial forecasts was 2% (2012: 2%). The rate used 
to discount the forecast cash flows was 14% (2012: 10%). The directors do not believe 
that there are any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions that would 
result in a further impairment of the Company’s investments.

A provision of £465,000 (2012: £474,000) was held in relation to the potential costs 
of settlement of claims which have been received from third parties following the 
closure of Air Partner Private Jets Limited. All remaining claims within this provision 
are expected to be settled by 31 March 2016.
During the prior financial year, the Group completed a cost reduction restructuring 
exercise. This resulted in a provision of £250,000 for employees who left the Group 
after the year end. Of this amount, £191,000, net of foreign exchange differences, 
was utilised during the current financial period and the remaining £59,000 will still 
be required. Additionally, and as a result of the change to a product-led reporting 
structure, during the current financial period further redundancies were identified and 
communicated to the relevant employees, resulting in a further provision of £428,000,  
of which £218,000 was utilised during the period and the remaining £210,000 will 
still be required.

Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 93 20 Financial instruments
The objectives of the Group’s treasury activities are to manage financial risk,  
minimise adverse effects of fluctuations in the financial markets on the value  
of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and to ensure that the working  
capital requirements fit the needs of the ongoing business.
The Group has various financial instruments such as cash, trade receivables and trade 
payables that arise directly from its operations, along with forward currency contracts 
undertaken to minimise risk on future business. 
a) Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to manage interest rate risk and to maximise its return from  
its cash balances. The Group’s main interest rate risk is related to variable rates  
on cash held at the bank. Certain cash balances are deposits on fixed interest terms, 
but are never lodged for more than three months to ensure that the Group does not 
suffer unduly from the risk of interest rate variation.

    18,419   15,716   10,899   7,459 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of cash held on variable interest rates  
on profit before tax for the year to a reasonably possible change in interest rates,  
with effect from the beginning of the year. There was no additional impact on 
shareholders’ equity. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based 
on observation of current market conditions. The rate range on which interest was 
receivable during the year was 0.0% to 0.5% (2012: 0.0% to 10.4%).

continued b) Credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the reporting date, as 
summarised below, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk:
   Group Company
   2014 2012 2014 2012 
   £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents    18,419   15,716   10,899   7,459 
Trade and other receivables    13,622   18,853   8,125   11,546 
    32,041   34,569   19,024   19,005 
The Group constantly monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties and 
incorporates this information into its credit risk controls. It is the Group’s policy that 
all counterparties who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to an external credit 
verification process.
The directors consider that all of the above financial assets that are not impaired for  
each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, including those  
that are past due.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk to commercial customers,  
as credit risk is predominantly government based. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because  
the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit 
rating agencies.
Refer to note 16 for details of impairment losses for financial instruments.   
       
  
Notes to the  
financial statements
Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 95 c) Liquidity risk
The Group faces liquidity risks in paying operators before a flight occurs or before payment is received from the client. 
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by, where possible, making payments to operators only once payment from  
the client has been received.
The Group manages cash within its operations and ensures that cash collection is efficiently managed. Any excess cash is placed  
on low-risk, short-term interest-bearing deposits or distributed to shareholders through dividends, although the Group retains 
enough working capital in the business to ensure that the business operations can run smoothly.
As at 31 January 2014, the Group’s financial liabilities had contractual maturities which are summarised below:

The Group has invested in foreign operations outside the United Kingdom and also buys and sells goods and services  
denominated in currencies other than Sterling. As a result the value of the Group’s non-Sterling revenue, purchases, financial  
assets and liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates in general and in US Dollar and Euro rates  
in particular. The Group’s policy on foreign currency risk is not to enter into forward contracts until a firm contract has been signed.
The Group considers using derivatives where appropriate to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  
The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group operations. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in financial 
instruments will be undertaken.
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into Sterling at the closing rate, are as follows:

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in the Euro  
and US Dollar exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on profit before tax and equity. It assumes a 10% change  
of the Sterling/Euro exchange rate for the year ended 31 January 2014 (2012: 10%). A 10% change is also assumed for the  
Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate (2012: 10%). Both of these percentages have been determined based on the average market 
volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months. The sensitivity is based on the Group’s foreign currency financial  
instruments held at each reporting date and also takes into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from  
changes in currency exchange rates.

Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued e) Forward contracts
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions  
and cash flows. The Group is a party to foreign currency forward contracts in the 
management of its exchange rate exposures. The instruments purchased are primarily 
denominated in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading 
instruments and any change in their fair value is recognised in the income statement. 
No derivatives qualified for hedge accounting during the year (2012: none).
At the reporting date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign 
exchange contracts that the Group had committed are as below and their related fair 
value was as follows (terms not exceeding three months from 31 January 2014):
     2014 2012 
Group & Company     £’000 £’000
Forward foreign exchange contracts     2,672   4,248 
Financial liability      (46)  (90)
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments amounting to £44,000  
have been credited to the income statement in the period (2012: charge of £46,000).
These derivative financial instruments are not traded in active markets.  
Their fair value has been determined by using valuation techniques which  
maximise the use of observable market data, namely the contract exchange  
rate and the bank’s forward rate. The derivatives are therefore categorised  
as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy.
f) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s  
ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders  
and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group has no debt and capital therefore  
consists entirely of equity.
The Group’s primary tool in managing risk is cash flow analysis. In addition to strategic 
cash flow management the Group performs detailed weekly cash flow modelling.
The schedule of matters reserved for Board decision includes approval of any  
financial instruments or bank borrowings in excess of £2,000,000.

Notes to the  
financial statements 
for the period ended 31 January 2014  
continued 21 Share-based payments 
The Company operates a share option scheme under which options may be  
granted to certain senior staff of the Group to subscribe for ordinary shares in the 
Company. The Scheme rules cover grants under an Approved and an Unapproved 
section of the scheme. According to those rules, options may be granted at an exercise 
price equal to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the  
dealing day immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. 
With certain exceptions, options are forfeited if an employee leaves the Group and 
outstanding options expire if they remain unexercised after a period of 6.8 to 10 years 
from the date of grant.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

Exercisable at the end of the period   425,416   541.8   370,666   603.6 
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding  
at the year end was 6.307 years (2012: 7.56 years).  
The exercise prices of share options outstanding at the year end ranged from  
nil pence to 884 pence (2012: 277.5 pence to 884 pence).  
The fair value received in return for share options granted is measured by reference  
to the fair value of the share options granted. The estimate of fair value of the services 
received for share options granted during the year was measured based on the Monte 
Carlo model. The contractual life of the option (6.8 or 10 years) is used as an input  
into this model.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo model for all options granted during the period are 
as follows:
     7 January 26 October 
     2013 2013
Underlying share price (pence)    290.0p 500.p 
Exercise price (pence)     290.0p 000.0p

Risk-free interest rate      2.15% 2.00% 
Dividend yield     5.0% 5.0% 
The 10,000 options granted on 7 January 2013 were subject to both service and 
non-market performance conditions.
Notes to the  
financial statements
Air Partner plc  
Annual Report 2014 101 One third of the number of shares under option will be exercisable if, in respect of 
the Performance Period, the increase in the Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) has exceeded 
inflation (as measured by the RPI) by an average of at least 3% per annum. 
The total number of shares under option will be exercisable if, in respect of the 
Performance Period, the increase in EPS has exceeded inflation (as measured by  
the RPI) by an average of at least 7% per annum.
Between one third and the total number of shares under option, determined on a 
straight-line basis, will be exercisable if the performance falls between these two target 
levels. If the performance is below the minimum target level above, options will lapse 
and cease to be exercisable. 
The 191,151 options granted on 26 October 2013 were subject to both service and 
performance conditions, with half of the options being subject to an EPS growth 
performance condition and the other half subject to a Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) condition.
For the EPS condition, all shares will vest if, in respect of the performance period, 
the increase in EPS with reference to the base year (31 July 2013) exceeds RPI by at 
least 10% per annum. If the increase in EPS exceeds RPI by between 5 and 10% over 
the performance period, then 25% of the share will vest. However, if EPS growth is 
lower than RPI plus 5% per annum over the performance period then none of the 
options awarded will vest.
For the TSR condition, vesting will be determined by comparing the Group’s TSR 
against the TSR of the FTSE Small Cap Total Return Index in accordance with the 
following conditions:
 − if the Group ranks below the 50th percentile, no options will vest;
 − if the Group is at the 50th percentile, 25% of the options will vest;
 − if the Group is at the 75th percentile, or above, 100% of the options will vest; and
 − there will be proportionate vesting where performance falls between the 50th  
and 75th percentile rankings. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the 
Group’s share price over the ten years prior to the grant date, along with six other 
quoted companies that were considered to exhibit some degree of comparability  
with Air Partner.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was  
£3.95 (2012:£0.86).
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans 
was £192,000 (2012: £151,000), all of which related to equity share-based 
payment transactions.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting 
purposes:

   £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Deferred tax assets    247   469   149   30 
At the balance sheet date the Group had undistributed earnings in respect of overseas 
subsidiaries that would be subject to overseas withholding taxes on remission to the 
UK. No liability has been recognised in respect of these earnings because the Group is  
in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it  
is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses totalling £317,000 
(2012: £404,000) for which no deferred tax asset was recognised, as it is not 
considered probable that there will be future taxable profits available.

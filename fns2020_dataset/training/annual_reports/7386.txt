Overview Annual report 2008
Results
Our businesses in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA ”) region 
continued to thrive and the successful integration of two important acquisitions
signiﬁcantly strengthened our position as the leading regional pharmaceutical
manufacturer. In line with our commitment to become a leading global speciality
pharmaceutical company, we also made excellent progress in our Injectables
business, where revenues grew by 23.2%. W e are making good progress in
implementing our oncology strategy. Against these areas of progress, we faced
some difﬁculties in our US Generics business, where the extremely competitive
trading environment made it difﬁcult for us to offset the completion of a large
government contract. I am pleased to report that we took prompt management
action and successfully restored this business to proﬁtability by the end of 
the year.
For the year we delivered record revenues of $580.7 million and total revenue
growth of 29.4%. The impact of the difﬁculties in our US Generics business 
in the ﬁrst half of 2008 resulted in a lower gross margin for the Group of 
44.2%, compared with 49.4% in 2007, and a decline of 12.7% in our operating
proﬁt to $80.7 million. However, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by only 1.7% to $113.8 million and 
on an adjusted basis operating proﬁt decreased by 1%. Proﬁt attributable 
to shareholders for the period declined by 8.7% to $57.1 million, but on an 
adjusted basis increased by 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share declined by 16.4% to
29.6 cents per share. Impressively, our operating cash ﬂow reached $75.0 million,
an increase of 40.7%, through a strong focus on working capital management.  
Dividend
In order to pursue our growth strategy and mindful of the difﬁcult economic
times in which the world ﬁnds itself, the Board has recommended that the
dividend should be held this year. Therefore the Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 4.0 cents per share (approximately 2.8 pence per share), which will
make a dividend for the full year of 7.5 cents per share, the same as paid in 2007. 
The proposed ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 2 June 2009 to shareholders on 
the register on 1 May 2009, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting.
Chairman’s review
2008 was both a rewarding and challenging year at Hikma.
Looking forward, I am conﬁdent in the Company’s prospects 
for this year and the years to come.

Balance sheet developments 
In January 2008 we raised gross proceeds of £81.6 million (approximately 
$160 million) through the placing of 17 million ordinary shares to fund the
December 2007 acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co. Ltd
(“ APM”). W e ended 2008 with net debt of $170.9 million, compared with 
$306.8 million at the end of 2007, reﬂecting not only the equity issue but also
higher operating cash ﬂow from improved management of our working capital.
W e are well invested and as a result our balance sheet is strong, with over 
$63 million in cash at the year-end and unutilised loan facilities of $121 million
across multiple geographies.  
Outlook
With 60% of our sales generated in the MENA region, Hikma should continue to
beneﬁt from the overall pharmaceutical market growth in this region, which we
expect will remain much higher than the global market. Our share of the MENA
market should also continue to increase as we further penetrate existing markets,
expand into new markets and grow our portfolio of own-brand and in-licensed
products. With new products and entry into new markets, we believe that there
remains considerable scope for us to grow our global Injectables business,
particularly in the MENA region but also in the US and Europe. W e expect our
performance in our US Generics business, which returned to proﬁtability in the
fourth quarter of 2008, to continue to improve.  
In summary, I am highly conﬁdent in the Company’s prospects for this year
and the years to come. This conﬁdence is based on the strength of our Branded
and Injectables businesses, the recovery in the Generics business that we have
already begun to experience, and the excellent management team that we have 
in place.

Hikma has been a market leader in anti-infectives in 
the MENA region for more than 15 years. 
First introduced by Hikma in Jordan in the early
1990’ s, Amoclan continues to be widely prescribed
across the region. Amoclan is a combination product
containing the broad spectrum penicillin amoxicillin
and clavulanic acid, an inhibitor of the enzyme 
beta-lactamase that is secreted by resistant bacteria,
rendering many penicillins ineffective. Amoclan’ s strong
brand recognition, efﬁcacy and affordability have
helped to sustain a high market share in numerous
countries across the MENA region.

Cephalosporins
Our Injectables business has a long history in producing
high quality cephalosporins. Cephalosoprins are
bactericidal antibiotics that have the same mode of
action as other beta-lactam antibiotics such as
penicillins. We are very proud to have in our portfolio
Samixon (ceftriaxone) which is a potent third generation
cephalosporin with a broad spectrum activity against
both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 
In our cephalosporin manufacturing facility in
Portugal, we produced 22 million vials for our markets
in the US, MENA and Europe in 2008.

Through the acquisition of APM in December 2007,
Hikma added Actos

(pioglitazone), a leading treatment
for type 2 diabetes to its MENA product portfolio.
Actos

is sold under-licence from T akeda.
Actos

, along with healthy eating and physical
activity , works by treating insulin resistance, an
important defect of type 2 diabetes. Actos

helps the
body use insulin more effectively by making cells more
sensitive and controlling blood sugar levels. Hikma’ s
strong sales team across the MENA region have nearly
doubled Actos

leading brand names are T argoplanin (teicoplanin) and
Prizma (piperacillin/tazobactam). 
Both are recommended for treatment of resistant
pathogens and life threatening infections and both
products were the ﬁrst generic versions introduced to

Strengthening our leading position in the MENA region

Our strategy Annual report 2008
In 2008, we made signiﬁcant progress towards delivering on some of these
priorities, particularly in the MENA region and in our speciality Injectables
business. In our Generics business in the US, however, we found delivering on our
priorities more challenging. Importantly, we ended the year on a stable footing 
in the US and better placed to drive each of our businesses forward in 2009.
Strengthening our leading position in the MENA region
Our degree of focus on the fast-growing MENA region is unique and we
increased our penetration of this valuable market in 2008 both through organic
growth and the integration of two major acquisitions. T otal MENA sales reached
$366 million in 2008, or 63% of Group sales – an increase of 60% over 2007.
Clearly our business in the MENA region beneﬁted from the fast growing local
pharmaceutical markets, which grew by an average of 18.5% in 2008, four times
as fast as the global market.
Acquisitions also played an important role in the growth we achieved.
Following the integration of Hikma Egypt (previously Alkan) we are now ﬁrmly
established in the Egyptian market, the second largest of the 17 private pharmaceutical
markets in which we operate in the MENA region. Hikma Egypt’s sales grew by
58% over the year reﬂecting the beneﬁts of applying our sales and marketing
expertise and substantial improvements in operating efﬁciency. The acquisition 
of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (APM) brought us valuable additional
manufacturing capacity in Jordan and also licences for a number of patented
products that we are now selling throughout MENA. Our sales effort has proven
very successful, with APM’s revenues growing by 38% in 2008.
Developing our global product range in growing therapeutic areas 
Further growth in the MENA region as well as in Europe and the US came from
the development of our product portfolio. W e increased our product range in
2008, from 353 to 369 products, enhancing our potential in core markets and
bringing opportunities in newer markets across all regions.
Importantly, we continued to increase our focus on higher margin, value-
added products in targeted therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular, CNS and
oncology. W e also increased our emphasis on “quality sales” to ensure that we are
getting the most in terms of proﬁt and cash collection from the very strong
Hikma brand name and reputation.
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s strategic review
In this year’s report to shareholders, we’ve set out our vision – to build 
Hikma into a world-class, leading speciality pharmaceutical company – 
and the strategic priorities to achieve this vision, against which we can 
measure our progress.

Said Darwazah Chief Executive  Ofﬁcer
12751_p26_p57.qxp  27/3/09  22:33  Page 28 Extending our reach and diversity through partnerships
W e seek to strengthen our relationships with all stakeholders within the healthcare
value chain. Expanding our in-licensed business with research-based multinational
companies is a key part of this growth strategy and will enable us to continuously
launch new innovative medical treatments valued by patients and physicians.
Our in-licensed products performed extremely well in 2008, with sales growing
by 63%. Sales of in-licensed products acquired through acquisitions exceeded
expectations and the T akeda products in particular, which include Actos™ and
Blopress™, grew by 64% in 2008. This growth was achieved in APM’s existing
markets. As we begin to launch these products in new markets such as Egypt 
and Algeria we expect to see incremental sales coming through in 2009.
Increasing the scale of our speciality Injectables business 
Our speciality Injectables business experienced rapid growth in sales in MENA
and the US in 2008, up 43% and 29%, respectively. This helped to compensate for
the increase in pricing pressure in Germany. 
W e feel that our presence in the MENA region truly differentiates us from our
global competitors. As MENA sales increase as a percentage of overall Injectable
sales, our proﬁtability in this business should also improve.
Our developing presence in the ﬁeld of oncology is also a key strength and
should help to drive future growth and improve proﬁtability. The global oncology
and cancer care market is growing rapidly, with an increasing number of specialist
hospitals and clinics focused on treating this growing disease. Oncology is targeted
to represent an increasing percentage of Injectable sales in 2009 as we launch our
oncology products in the MENA region and continue to roll out our oncology
portfolio across Europe.
Leveraging our expertise and capacity in the US market 
Sales in our Generics business in the US were adversely affected by the completion
of a major Government supply contract at the end of 2007. The absence of these
revenues in 2008 was coupled with deteriorating market conditions and intense
competition and pricing pressure. W e have responded with a thorough overhaul 
of the business that has involved improving our ability to obtain cost-effective
supplies of APIs from multiple sources, raising prices where possible, terminating
unproﬁtable supply arrangements, improving manufacturing and distribution
efﬁciencies and raising service levels. W e have also made several management
changes.

Our strategy Annual report 2008
These actions, as well as the FDA-enforced withdrawal of some suppliers from the
US market, helped the Generics business return to proﬁtable trading in the last
quarter of 2008 and we are conﬁdent that the business, which has an exemplary
compliance record, will regain full year proﬁtability in 2009. 
Maintaining our world-class manufacturing capabilities 
In 2008 we invested approximately $57 million in expanding and upgrading 
our capacity to meet growing demand. Although the acquisitions we made 
in 2007 raised our capacity (and also brought some new manufacturing
processes), certain facilities have required upgrading to ensure the highest 
quality of manufacture.
Acquisitions 
Much of 2008 was spent integrating the four acquisitions we completed in 2007.
Looking forward, we are conﬁdent that there remains considerable scope for
further acquisitions, particularly in the MENA region, where the pharmaceutical
market is highly fragmented and where many countries require or prefer a local
manufacturing presence. W e are focusing efforts on acquisitions in countries
where we do not currently have a direct presence or where we can accelerate our
penetration of existing markets.
Management evolution 
Hikma has grown rapidly over the past couple of years, both organically and
through our acquisitions. This has brought a need to ensure that our increased
size and complexity does not hinder our growth prospects and our ﬂexibility to
quickly capture new revenue opportunities. Furthermore, in our competitive
industry and the current economic environment, we need to increase our focus
on productivity, supply chain efﬁciency and returns on investment for our
shareholders. As a result, we will be adapting our management structure in order
to facilitate these important priorities.
Our revenue generation functions of sales and marketing, business development,
R&D and registration in both MENA and Europe will now be overseen by
T aghreed Shunnar, who previously managed our Branded Business. Freeing
T aghreed and her team from production and operational activities will enable
them to dedicate their efforts towards maintaining our top-line growth, creating
new business opportunities and capitalising on them quickly. T aghreed has
demonstrated considerable success in growing our Branded business, both
through Hikma products and licensing partnerships, and I am sure that she will
maintain this track record for our sales in both MENA and Europe.

12751_p26_p57.qxp  31/3/09  00:19  Page 30 The growing signiﬁcance of the MENA region in the Injectables business model
has led to an increasing overlap between our Injectables and Branded supply
chains. W e have signiﬁcant manufacturing capabilities in 12 facilities across seven
countries in MENA and Europe and we are sure that there is signiﬁcant room for
improvement if these facilities and their supply chains are managed in a more
uniﬁed manner. As a result, our operations teams in Europe and MENA will now
be working together in order to realise that potential. 
This will lead to enhanced working capital management, realisation of
manufacturing, supply and distribution synergies, and help our sales function 
by efﬁciently delivering products to their customers – when they need them 
and where they need them. Bassam Kanaan will be heading our efforts in this
regard in addition to his role as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. Bassam has been with 
us for seven years now as Group CFO and his thorough understanding of our
global operations will enable him and his team to make this change a success.
The sales and operations aspects of the Generics business will continue to be run
by Mike Raya, given the unique characteristics of the US market and the management
changes that we have made there that have already proved successful.
Majda Labadi, who previously led our Injectables segment,
will now be heading up the critical function of Group Human Resources, 
so that we can attract and retain the talent Hikma needs to grow.
Our position in growing markets and broad geographical spread, combined
with our strong brands and reputation for quality, gives us great conﬁdence that
we can deliver on our objective to become a leading global multinational
speciality pharmaceutical company.

Our strong position in the MENA region is unique with
operations in 17 MENA markets and more than 1,200 sales

Key performance indicators
The Board measures progress on our strategic objectives by reference to ﬁve 
key ﬁnancial performance indicators (“KPIs”) applied on a Group-wide and
segmental basis. These same indicators are used by executive management to
manage the business. Performance in 2008 against these indicators is set out 
in the table below left, together with the prior year performance data.
It is important to note that the 2008 ﬁgures were impacted by the difﬁculties
experienced in the US Generics business.
For 2009 and onwards, the Board will measure Group performance by
reference to an amended set of key performance indicators that better reﬂect 
the Group’s focus on continued revenue growth and operational excellence. 
These indicators will be measured on both a Group-wide and a segmental basis.
These new performance indicators are:
1. Revenue growth
2. Operating proﬁt growth compared with revenue growth
3. Cash to cash cycle time
4. Return on invested capital
5. New product launches
Group performance
Revenue for the Group increased by 29.4% to $580.7 million, compared with
$448.8 million in 2007. The revenue contribution from Hikma Egypt (previously
Alkan), APM and Thymoorgan – the acquisitions completed since the beginning
of 2007 – was $102.5 million. Underlying organic revenue growth (excluding the
impact of these acquisitions) was 9.5%, driven by strong performances in both
the Branded and Injectables businesses but offset by a 14.9% decline in revenues
in our US Generics business. As a result, the Branded and Injectables businesses
accounted for 81% of revenues in 2008 compared with 71% in 2007.
The Group’s gross proﬁt increased by 15.8% to $256.5 million, compared with
$221.5 million in 2007. Group gross margin was 44.2%, compared with 49.4% 
in 2007, primarily due to the impact of the signiﬁcant decline in gross proﬁt in 
the Generics business.
Group operating expenses rose by 36.1% to $175.8 million, compared with
$129.1 million in 2007. This reﬂects primarily a strategic increase in sales and
marketing expenses and control of our general and administrative and research

grew by 19.7%. On an adjusted basis

, operating expenses as a percentage of sales
increased by 0.3 percentage points to 28.5%, up from 28.2% in 2007.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by 48.5% to $90.6 million, 
largely reﬂecting the consolidation of APM and Hikma Egypt and the higher
amortisation costs related to intangible assets arising on these acquisitions.
Excluding the 2007 acquisitions of APM, Hikma Egypt and Thymoorgan, sales
and marketing expenses rose by 19.8% as we invested in the promotion of our
leading own-brand and in-licensed products. W e expect to see further beneﬁts
from this in 2009. Sales and marketing expenses represented 15.6% of Group
revenue in 2008, compared with 13.6% in 2007. W e expect sales and marketing
expenses as a percentage of sales to begin to decline slightly in 2009.
The Group’s general and administrative expenses increased by 23.6% to 
$56.9 million, compared with $46.0 million in 2007. This increase partially 
reﬂects the consolidation of APM, Hikma Egypt and Thymoorgan and includes
exceptional acquisition integration costs of $1.6 million. Tighter control of
corporate general and administrative costs meant that there was only a slight
increase of $1.3 million, bringing total corporate general and administrative costs
to $19.4 million, compared with $18.0 million in 2007. Overall, general and
administrative expenses represented 9.8% of Group revenue in 2008, compared
with 10.3% in 2007.
Investment in R&D increased by 14.6% to $22.2 million, with total investment
in R&D now representing 3.8% of Group revenue, compared with 4.3% in 2007.
This decline mainly reﬂects an increase in the proportion of our development
projects in the MENA region where development costs tend to be lower than in
the USA or Europe. It also reﬂects a strategic shift towards the acquisition of
product ﬁles and related product intangibles.
Other net operating expenses, consisting mainly of provisions against slow
moving items of $8.6 million partially offset by foreign exchange gains of 
$1.2 million, were $6.2 million, compared with $2.8 million in 2007. The major
reason for the increase in 2008 was the provision that we made in our US
Generics business for slow moving items due to deteriorating market conditions.
Operating proﬁt for the Group decreased by 12.7% to $80.7 million,
compared with $92.4 million in 2007, and Group operating margin decreased to
13.9%, compared with 20.6% in 2007. This decline reﬂects, for the most part, the
loss incurred in our Generics business where operating proﬁt fell by $37.4 million
from 2007 to 2008.
Adjusted operating proﬁt for the Group, deﬁned as operating proﬁt before 
the amortisation of intangible assets (other than software) and exceptional items,
which include acquisition integration costs and revisions to estimates for charge-
backs, rebates and returns, was largely unchanged in 2008 at $94.3 million,

The Group’s product portfolio continues to grow. During 2008, we added 
17 new products to the Group portfolio that now includes 369 products in 
767 dosage strengths and forms. W e manufacture and/or sell 40 of these products
under licence.
In 2008, Hikma received 154 regulatory approvals of which 91 approvals were
for the Branded business, 60 for the Injectables business and three for the
Generics business. Over the same period, 168 products and line extensions were
launched across the Group, including the 17 new pharmaceutical compounds not
previously marketed. 
T o ensure a continuous ﬂow of new products from our pipeline, we submitted
46 regulatory ﬁlings for new products, and a total of 233 submissions across all
regions and markets. As of 31 December 2008, we had a total of 107 pending
approvals for new products and 647 pending approvals across all regions and
markets. 
W e estimate the approximate addressable market for our portfolio of pending
approvals to be approximately $24 billion, based on estimates by IMS Health for
the 2008 full year sales of the currently marketed equivalent products in the
markets covered by the pending approvals. 
At 31 December 2008, we had a total of 111 new products under development.

Branded Pharmaceuticals
The Branded business is our largest business in terms of revenue and operating
proﬁt. Branded revenues increased by 61.3% to $320.8 million in 2008, compared
with $198.9 million in 2007, reﬂecting strong organic growth of 22.4% enhanced
by the acquisitions we made in the MENA region in 2007. T rading continued to
be strong across all our MENA markets, particularly Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia
and the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Both of the acquisitions in 2007 in the MENA region performed ahead of 
our expectations in 2008.
Sales at APM, acquired in December 2007, grew by 38% to $61.3 million in
2008 compared with reported sales of $44.4 million in 2007. This performance
demonstrates how successful the integration process has been. W e have improved
APM’s organisational structure by creating a new sales operation and logistics,
supply chain, budgeting and production planning functions and we have
integrated the Hikma and APM distribution channels in many markets.
These changes are bringing synergies and will reduce future sales and marketing
expenses. In order to improve working capital management, we have applied
Hikma’s standard terms of trade wherever possible. W e have upgraded APM’s
manufacturing facilities to bring them into line with Hikma’s demanding levels 
of quality and compliance standards. Through this process we nearly doubled
production on most lines. Further capacity upgrades were made towards the end
of the year that required a scheduled suspension of production at the APM plant
for almost two months. Production has since restarted.
Sales at Hikma Egypt, acquired in September 2007, grew by 58% to 
$28.8 million (2008) compared with $18.2 million (2007). This acquisition
signiﬁcantly enhanced our exposure to the fast-growing Egyptian market.
Hikma Egypt has now been fully integrated, with key functions such as ﬁnance,
marketing and R&D incorporated into Hikma’s global systems. W e have also
made signiﬁcant process improvements, nearly doubling production output and
units sold compared with 2007. W e also made a signiﬁcant investment in sales
and marketing to launch the Hikma brand in the Egyptian market and to
promote key products.
In 2008 our largest markets were Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt.
More focused sales and marketing efforts have helped to drive customer demand
and increase sales across these and most other Branded markets. Signiﬁcant
attention was paid to promoting new and recently launched products,
strengthening our market position in key therapeutic areas and building brand
recognition.
As a result of these efforts, Hikma is now the ﬁfth largest pharmaceutical
manufacturer in the MENA region, with a market share of 3.4%
6
. For the top 
nine retail pharmaceutical markets in MENA in which we operate, the total
private market was worth approximately $7.3 billion in 2008 with year-on-year
growth of 18.5%.
Algeria is the largest private pharmaceutical market in the MENA region.
The private market in Algeria was worth over $1.7 billion in 2008, when it grew 
at a rate of over 30%. In 2008, we raised our market share in Algeria to 6.4%
compared with 6.1% in 2007. W e are now the fourth largest pharmaceutical
manufacturer and the largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer by value in
the Algerian market.

Hikma seeks to strengthen its partnerships with all stakeholders
within the healthcare value chain. Expanding our under license
business with research based multinational companies is a key
part of this strategy and will enable us to continuously launch
new innovative medical treatments valued by patients and
physicians. In 2008, we signed three new agreements with
originator pharmaceutical companies.
In order to differentiate ourselves from other local generic
companies in the MENA region, we are forging strong lasting
relationships and loyalty with physicians and the medical
community by providing medical education programs and
scientiﬁc workshops and conducting clinical studies.

Our strategy Annual report 2008
Egypt is currently the second largest private pharmaceutical market in MENA.
In 2008 it grew by 19% and was worth over $1.6 billion in retail sales. Our market
share in Egypt, while still well below our strategic target of 5%, has increased
signiﬁcantly and currently stands at 1.4%. W e expect further strong growth in
2009 as we launch more Hikma products through our Egyptian sales network.
Saudi Arabia is the third largest private pharmaceutical market in MENA.
The retail market was worth in excess of $1.5 billion in 2008 when it grew by 6%.
The acquisition of APM in 2007 has helped to strengthen Hikma’s position in 
the Saudi market where we are the ﬁfth largest pharmaceutical manufacturer, 
with a market share in value terms of 4.9% in 2008, compared with 4.8% in 2007. 
Although the Jordanian pharmaceutical market is still comparatively small, 
we remain the clear market leader with a market share of 12.4%, up from 7.7% 
in 2007, and more than twice the share of the second largest pharmaceutical
company operating in this market. The increase in our market share is due to 
our expanding product range and the consolidation of APM.
In-licensing remains an important part of our growth strategy in the MENA
region and our portfolio of licensed products continues to deliver excellent
results. In 2008 revenue from our 40 in-licensed products (including in-licensed
products that we acquired from APM and Hikma Egypt) grew by 63% and
accounted for one-third of total Branded sales. Our long-term strategic target is 
to raise this proportion to 50%. W e are conﬁdent that our strong market position
in the MENA region and our excellent track record with licensed products will
continue to attract leading multinational partners. This is demonstrated by the
excellent performance of the T akeda products that entered our portfolio in 2007.
Sales of the antidiabetic Actos®, the antihypertensive Blopress® and the other
products in-licensed from T akeda in 2007 grew by more than 64% in 2008 as we
captured greater market share.
Gross proﬁt in the Branded business increased by 60.0% to $172.8 million,
compared with $108.0 million in 2007. The Branded business’s gross margin
remained stable at 53.9%, compared with 54.3% in 2007.
Branded operating proﬁt increased by 41.8% in 2008 to $87.5 million.
Operating margin in the Branded business was 27.3% in 2008, down from 31.0%
in 2007. On an adjusted basis, excluding the amortisation of acquisition related
intangible assets and exceptional items, operating margin in 2008 was 29.2%
against 31.2% in 2007. The decline in margin primarily reﬂects the additional
investment in sales and marketing activities and research and development to
support the strong growth in Branded sales. This investment in sales and
marketing relates in particular to the promotion of key products including the
new in-licensed products acquired from APM.
In 2008, the Branded business received 91 regulatory approvals, including 
17 new products in Jordan and Egypt, 67 in other MENA markets and seven 
in Europe and the rest of the world. In line with our strategic objectives for the
Branded business, we launched a total of six new products in 2008, four in 
Jordan and two in Egypt. The total number of Branded sales and marketing staff
operating across our 17 MENA markets at year end was 1,090, including 296 in
Egypt, 222 in Saudi Arabia, 149 in Jordan and 164 in Algeria.

Revenue in our global Injectables business increased by 23.2% to $149.3 million.
Excluding the contribution from the acquisitions of Thymoorgan and APM that
we made in 2007, organic growth was 14.2%, driven by a strong performance in
the MENA region and our growing business in the US. 
Injectables revenue grew by 43.0% in the MENA region with Jordan and
Algeria performing particularly well. This growth is attributable to the strength 
of our product portfolio, the quality of our sales force and a 50% increase in
attractive tender business. The MENA region now represents 36.6% of Injectables
sales, compared with 31.5% in 2007. W e continue to see excellent prospects for
growth in Injectables sales in the MENA region which we expect to account for 
an increasing percentage of our future Injectable sales.
Despite intensifying competition in the US injectable market, our US
Injectables sales grew by 29.2% compared with 2007 and represented 16.7% of
our global Injectables business. W e saw strong demand in both our own product
and private label business in the US. W e beneﬁted from a number of new product
launches that resulted in a US product portfolio that was signiﬁcantly more
diverse than in 2007. W e are also achieving higher sales volumes across a broader
portfolio of cephalosporin antibiotics and have seen excellent growth in some of
our liquid products. 
In Europe, which includes our oncology business, we saw increasing pricing
pressure in the German market. Overall European injectable sales reached 
$69.8 million, compared with $63.7 million in 2007, an increase of 9.6%.
Excluding a $7million decrease in the year for non-recurring sales relating to 
2 in-licensed products. European injectable sales rose by 25.7%. Europe now
represents 46.7% of our Injectables business compared with 52.5% in 2007.
W e have appointed a new management team for the oncology business that will
be expanding our product portfolio and also marketing these products in markets
outside Germany in 2009, particularly in the MENA region.
Injectables gross proﬁt increased by 17.0% to $63.4 million, compared with 
$54.2 million in 2007, but gross margin decreased to 42.4% compared with 44.7%
in 2007. The decrease in gross margin reﬂects, in part, the inclusion for a full 
year of the Thymoorgan contract manufacturing business that has a lower 
gross margin than the rest of Hikma’s Injectables business. It also reﬂects the
consolidation of some low margin injectable sales contracts at APM that will not
be renewed on completion. Excluding the acquisitions of Thymoorgan and APM,
the Injectables gross margin was 45.1%, slightly below the 2007 level of 45.7%.
Injectables operating proﬁt increased by 8.0% to $22.1 million, compared with
$20.5 million in 2007. Injectables operating margin decreased to 14.8% in 2008,
down from 16.9% in 2007, primarily as a result of the consolidation of APM’s
lower margin injectable sales. Excluding the consolidation of APM and
amortisation of intangibles (excluding software), the Injectables operating 
margin was slightly higher at 17.3%.
During 2008, the Injectables business received 60 regulatory approvals across
all markets, including 37 in the MENA region, 16 in Europe and the rest of the
world and seven ANDA approvals in the US. A total of 61 products were
launched, including nine new products.

Increasing the scale
of our speciality
injectables business.
W e see considerable scope to develop our market positions in
each of our injectables markets. In MENA, we have an excellent
opportunity to gain market share in both existing and new
markets by leveraging our extensive product portfolio and
pipeline. In Europe and the US where we beneﬁt from expanding
product pipelines and expect a steady stream of new product
launches, we also have scope to continue to develop our growing
market positions. 
Building our oncology business will be a key priority across
all our markets. In 2009 we expect to launch a number of these
products in MENA and Europe and we will begin to register these
products for the US market.
A leading injectables supplier in MENA
In the MENA region, we are the sole generic supplier of 
six injectable products. This has helped us to build brand
recognition and gain market share, while at the same 
time bringing a lower cost alternative to the originator 
into the market. Sales of our injectables in MENA grew by
more than 40%. Our aim is to differentiate ourselves from
our competitors by focusing on high value added products
such as Iyophilised, oil suspension and oncology products
where we beneﬁt from a growing expertise.

Our strategy Annual report 2008
Generic Pharmaceuticals
Our Generics business is entirely focused on the US market for oral generics. Sales
of injectable generics in the US market are included in our Injectables segment.
Revenue in our Generics business decreased by 14.9% to $105.7 million,
compared with $124.2 million in 2007. This decline resulted initially from lower
sales of the antihypertensive lisinopril following the completion, in December
2007, of our contract to supply the Department of V eterans Affairs. The absence
of these revenues in 2008 was exacerbated by continued price erosion across other
product lines and lower than expected demand for new products. In addition, 
as reported in our interim results, we made a one-off provision of $4.8 million
relating to revisions in our estimates for chargebacks, rebates and returns. 
All of these factors, as well as higher than expected production and API costs,
led to a 67% decline in the Generics gross proﬁt to $19.3 million, compared with
$58.6 million in 2007. The Generics gross margin was 18.3%, compared with
47.2% in 2007. Consequently, the Generics business realised an operating loss of
$5.8 million compared with an operating proﬁt of $31.6 million in 2007.
W e focused on stemming the losses in this business as quickly as possible and
made several management changes. These included the appointments of a new
General Manager and a new Vice-President, Sales and Marketing for all US
operations.
This strengthened management team undertook a comprehensive review 
of the business in the second half of 2008 and identiﬁed a number of approaches
to improving operating performance. Following an in-depth examination of
proﬁtability by product and by customer, we withdrew from the supply of some
low margin products, implemented price increases where possible, secured lower
cost sources of APIs, improved our manufacturing and distribution efﬁciencies,
raised service levels and renegotiated our standard terms of trade.
W e are pleased to report that these actions resulted in the Generics business
returning to proﬁtability in the closing months of 2008, although the proﬁt
achieved was not sufﬁcient to offset losses incurred earlier in the year. W e expect
proﬁtable trading to be sustained during 2009 as we continue to focus on
implementing these actions. W e have also noted a recent improvement in the
prices of certain products in the US following the FDA-enforced withdrawal of
some non-US suppliers in 2008.
During 2008, the Generics business received three regulatory approvals, of
which two were new products. A total of seven products were launched, including
two new products.
Other business 
Our other business segment consists primarily of Arab Medical Containers, 
a manufacturer of plastic specialised packaging, and International
Pharmaceuticals Research Centre, which conducts bio-equivalency studies.
These businesses, which supply third parties as well as other Group operations,
had aggregate revenues of $4.8 million in 2008, compared with aggregate revenue
of $4.5 million in 2007. This represented 0.8% of Group revenues in 2008.
These Other businesses delivered an operating loss of $3.7 million in 2008,
compared with an operating loss of $3.4 million in 2007. This loss can be
attributed primarily to corporate research and development costs that cannot 
be allocated to speciﬁc business segments.

Metoprolol is part of the beta-blockers’ group which
affect the heart and circulation. This drug is used to
treat angina (chest pain), hypertension (high blood

was the highest selling new product for 2008.
12751_p26_p57.qxp  1/4/09  23:41  Page 46 Financial performance
Finance income and costs Net ﬁnancing cost for the year was $16.7 million
compared with $8.8 million during 2007. The increase is due to higher average debt
levels during 2008 compared to 2007.
Proﬁt before tax Proﬁt before taxes for the Group decreased by $19.8 million, or
23.6%, to $64.0 million, compared with $83.8 million in 2007. 
Tax The Group had a tax expense of $6.9 million in 2008. The effective tax rate
was 10.8%, a year-on-year decrease of 12.7 percentage points. This improvement
reﬂects the absence of proﬁts in the USA and a further increase in the proportion
of sales and proﬁts generated in the MENA region.
Minority interest Hikma’s minority interest was nil in 2008, compared with $1.6
million in 2007. This was primarily due to a decline in the proﬁtability of Hikma’s
51% owned subsidiary in Sudan. 
Proﬁt for the year The Group’s proﬁt for the year attributable to equity holders of
the parent decreased by 8.7% to $57.1 million for the year ended 31 December
2008, compared with $62.6 million in 2007. 
Adjusted proﬁt for the year Excluding the amortisation of intangible assets (other
than software) and exceptional items, which include integration costs and
revisions to estimates for charge-backs, rebates and returns, the Group’s adjusted
proﬁt for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 4.5% to
$67.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2008, compared with $64.5 million
in 2007. 
Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share for the year to 31 December 2008
were 29.6 cents, down by 16.4% from 35.4 cents in 2007. 
Dividend The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 4.0 cents per share
(approximately 2.8 pence per share), which will make the dividend for the full year
of 7.5 cents per share, the same amount paid in 2007. The proposed ﬁnal dividend
will be paid on 2 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on 1 May 2009, subject
to approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Operating cash ﬂow and investment Net cash inﬂow from operating activities was
$75.0 million, compared with $53.3 million in 2007. The previously reported 2007
operating cash ﬂow has be reclassiﬁed and increased by $8.1 million. This
improvement came as a result of our focus on effective working capital
management where, excluding acquisitions, receivable days decreased by nine
days and inventory days decreased by 21 days. 
Net cash used for investing activities was $66.1 million, compared with 
$348.9 million in 2007. The latter included just under $300 million of expenditure
on acquisitions ($71.7 million for Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan, $58.7 million
for Alkan Pharma in Egypt and $163.4 million for Arab Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing in Jordan). Capital expenditure amounted to $56.2 million,
compared with $50.4 million in 2007. This expenditure related primarily to
expansion projects in the Branded and Injectables businesses. During the year the
Group also made regular investments to upgrade and maintain existing facilities. 
On 17 January 2008 we successfully raised gross proceeds of £81.6 million
(approximately $160 million) in an equity placing of shares, funding the acquisition
of APM, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our ﬂexibility to ﬁnance
future growth.

Outlook Given the prevailing economic conditions, in 2009 we are expecting
Group revenues to grow by 10-15%, with an improvement in our gross margin 
of 1-2%. This will be driven by organic growth and supported by the acquisitions
and investments we have made over the past two years. The higher end of these
ranges is based on constant exchange rates while the lower end can be expected 
if the 2009 average exchange rate is at the current level.

With over 60% of sales now generated in the MENA region, we should
continue to beneﬁt from the growth in that pharmaceutical market, which
remains much higher than the global market. Our share of the MENA market
should also continue to increase as we further penetrate existing markets, expand
into new markets and grow our portfolio of own-brand and in-licensed products.
With new products and new markets, we believe that there remains
considerable scope for us to grow our global Injectables business, particularly in
the MENA region where we will be starting to launch our portfolio of oncology
products. In our US Generics business, which returned to proﬁtability in the
fourth quarter of 2008, we will continue to implement the changes that helped 
to turn this business around and beneﬁt from improving market conditions 
in the US.
Our solid balance sheet and continued focus on operating cash ﬂow
generation will give us the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions 
that will enhance our strong organic growth.

enable us to deliver a strong performance in 2009 and the years ahead.

Regulatory Hikma is subject to extensive regulation on the approval, manufacture
and distribution of its products in all its markets. There is no single worldwide
harmonised set of regulations relating to the development, manufacture and sale
of pharmaceutical products and the Group is therefore subject to different laws,
regulations and codes depending on the regions or countries in which products
are marketed. This is particularly relevant in the MENA region where there is no
mutually-recognized regional regulatory body. Speciﬁc jurisdictions can therefore
refuse to register a product or may require additional information even though it
is approved in another jurisdiction. This can create signiﬁcant compliance costs,
and can also increase the time it takes to realise the full penetration of products
into all markets. 
The Group operates in diverse markets and geographic regions and is
therefore subject to a broad range of industry, economic and political dynamics.
The laws and regulations governing the manufacture and supply of our products
are subject to change, which may lead to unanticipated business interruption or
increased costs for compliance. Whilst the cost of such disruption of compliance
can be signiﬁcant, we believe that the wide geographic spread of our operations
gives the Group the strength and ﬂexibility to lessen the impact on the Group’s
results and ﬁnancial condition of any such disruption.
Economic and political dynamics The Group operates in emerging markets, 
some of which have less developed political and legal systems, or which have 
a history of political volatility and therefore present greater challenges to the
conduct of business than more developed markets. Whilst the Group has a wide
geographical spread of operations, the failure of control, a change in the economic
conditions or political environment or sustained civil unrest in any particular
market or country could adversely affect the ﬁnancial condition of the Group.
Risk of interruption of production Product manufacture is subject to continual
regulatory control, and products must be produced in accordance with good
manufacturing practice regulations. Our manufacturing sites are subject to
approval and ongoing inspection by a large number of regulatory agencies. In
addition, small changes in manufacturing processes may require further
regulatory approval. These issues could result in additional compliance expense,
and compliance failure could result in interruptions to production, product
recalls, closure of manufacturing sites and other sanctions, which could adversely
affect our business and its ﬁnancial condition. 
Regulated and other suppliers A compliance failure by any of our regulated
suppliers – for both active and bulk ingredients – could lead to delays in
production, product recalls, the potential for product liability claims and other
regulatory sanctions. The business undertakes supply chain planning, and
alternative sourcing of key products. However, for some components we may have
to rely on single sourcing, which creates a greater risk of disruption to production
in the event of regulatory non-compliance or interruption of supply. While the
Group does not believe that any third-party supplier relationship is individually
signiﬁcant in terms of the entire Group, a failure in supply could disrupt
production and restrict sales. 
Government tender bids Whilst the majority of Group sales are to the private
sector, each of our three businesses participates in government tenders. 
The timing and outcome of these tenders are unpredictable, and the Group’s
results could be affected by the gain or loss of a signiﬁcant government contract.

Our strategy Annual report 2008
Research and development and commercialisation of new products The Group’s
results of operations may be impacted signiﬁcantly by the timeliness of its
research and development and product commercialisation activities. In order to
bring a pharmaceutical product to market successfully, the Group must identify
products for which it can generate attractive margins and growth, undertake the
required research and development and obtain regulatory approvals. Additional
costs may be incurred, and sales opportunities lost, if there is any signiﬁcant delay
in any of these steps. Given the importance of research and development, Hikma
has expanded its investment in research and development, particularly in Jordan
where it can beneﬁt from lower labour and bio-equivalency costs. 
API and other raw material costs Raw material costs represented over 30% of the
Group’s net sales in the year ended 31 December 2008, with the most signiﬁcant
portion of these costs relating to APIs. Whilst the prices of the APIs that the
Group uses have in general fallen in recent years, these prices are volatile and can
vary signiﬁcantly from supplier to supplier. In some cases, increase in API and
other raw material costs may not be able to be passed on to customers and can
therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s results of operations. Hikma
has a dedicated API sourcing function that has been successful in sourcing lower
cost API’s through more competitive suppliers in Asia.
Seasonality The Group’s business, in particular the Branded Pharmaceuticals
business, is seasonal, and it generally experiences higher net sales and net proﬁt in
the ﬁrst half of each ﬁnancial year, as compared to the second half of its ﬁnancial
year. Accordingly, the Group’s outstanding borrowings historically have been
higher during the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year in order to ﬁnance the working
capital requirements of the Group. 
Acquisitions and strategic alliances Acquisitions remain a key part of the Group’s
strategy to develop and grow its business. The Group also seeks long-term
licensing arrangements and strategic alliances to expand its product portfolio and
geographical presence. The risks associated with this strategy include the
availability of suitable acquisition candidates and assimilating and integrating
acquired companies into the Group. Other risks include delays in implementation
or unexpected costs or liabilities. The Group may be at risk of failing to realise
operating beneﬁts or synergies from completed acquisitions. The Group mitigates
these risks by implementing a structured integration process which can include
placing experienced management into the acquired company to effect the swift
installation of internal controls and by subjecting management processes to close
monitoring and review by internal audit and senior management. In respect of
long-term licensing arrangements, a failure to agree appropriate commercial
terms on renewal of such agreements could lead to a reduction in revenues as
replacement products are sourced. 
Risk management: Financial risks
Group T reasury is responsible for Financial Risk Management and setting the
appropriate controls and risk policies. Group T reasury is supported by treasury
departments at the operating company and segmental levels and reports to the
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and
is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements, primarily in the European,
Algerian, Sudanese and Egyptian currencies, that could materially affect the
Business and ﬁnancial review
continued
12751_p26_p57.qxp  1/4/09  23:47  Page 54 Group’s ﬁnancial results. Group T reasury attempts to mitigate this risk through
various methods: entering into currency derivative contracts where possible,
foreign currency borrowing and matching foreign currency revenues and costs.
Using these methods has not had a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial
position at 31 December 2008. See Note 29 to the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial
statements for a description of the Group’s Foreign Exchange risks.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by
changing the proportion of ﬁxed rate debt and variable rate debt in its total debt
portfolio. T o manage this mix the Group may enter into interest rate swap
agreements, in which it exchanges the periodic payments based on notional
amounts and agreed upon ﬁxed and variable interest rates. Using these swap
agreements has not had a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position at 
31 December 2008. See Note 29 to the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for a description of the Group’s interest rate risks.
Credit risk In most cases, the Group grants its buyers credit terms for settlement
of sales invoices. Credit risk is managed through the Group Credit policy and the
use of various ﬁnancial instruments such as letters of credit, factoring and credit
insurance arrangements. Further details are set out in Note 29 of the Group’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Liquidity risk The Group has constant ﬁnancing requirements, both for 
short-term working capital needs and for long-term strategic plans. Corporate 
T reasury ensures the Group debt/capital structure and banking arrangements 
can accommodate these ﬁnancing needs. Corporate T reasury also endeavours to
efﬁciently utilise excess liquidity from one subsidiary to another, while complying
with any foreign currency, legal or tax restrictions.
Going concern Although, the current economic conditions may affect short-term
demand for our products, as well as place pressure on customers and suppliers
which may face liquidity issues, the Group’s geographic spread, product diversity
and large customer and supplier base substantially mitigate these risks. In
addition, the Group operates in the relatively defensive generic pharmaceuticals
industry which we expect to be less affected compared to other industries that are
subject to greater cyclical changes.
The Group has $229 million of banking facilities of which $121 million were
undrawn as at 31 December 2008. These facilities are well diversiﬁed across the
operating subsidiaries of the Group with a number of ﬁnancial institutions. 
The majority of these facilities are short term, uncommitted working capital
related. See Notes 24, 27 and 29 for details. However, we continue to expect 
them to be renewed annually. In addition the Group maintained cash balances of 
$63.5 million as at 31 December 2008. The Group’s forecasts, taking into account
reasonable possible changes in trading performance, facility renewal sensitivities
and maturities of long-term debt, show that the Group should be able to operate
well within the levels of its facilities and their related covenants. 
After making enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group is adequately
placed to manage its business and ﬁnancing risks successfully despite the current
uncertain economic outlook. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the annual report and accounts, as stated in the Directors’ report.
Inﬂation risk Hikma believes it is not subject to material risk due to inﬂation in
any of its core markets at present.

Taxation 
Almost all of the Group’s earnings are derived in jurisdictions other than the
United Kingdom and are taxed there. Some of these overseas countries offer 
more favourable tax rates in comparison to each other and the United Kingdom. 
In addition to the United Kingdom, tax laws and regulations in many of the
countries where the Group operates include international rules that aim to
protect the tax base of such country. Any change to such rules could negatively
affect the effective tax rate of the Group or could create costly compliance
requirements. Therefore, the management maintains close observation of 
any intended or proposed changes to such rules, both in the United Kingdom 
and in other key countries where the Group operates.
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
The Group’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the Group’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. However, certain of the Group’s accounting
policies are particularly important to the presentation of the Group’s results and
require the application of signiﬁcant judgement by the Group’s management.
In applying these policies, the Group’s management uses its judgement to
determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain
estimates used in the preparation of the Group’s results. These estimates are based
on the Group’s previous experience, the terms of existing contracts, information
available from other outside sources and other factors, as appropriate.
The Group’s management believes that, among others, the following
accounting policies that involve management judgements and estimates are 
the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Group’s ﬁnancial results.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents sales of products to external third parties and excludes inter-
company income and value added taxes. Sales of goods are recognised when the
risk of loss and title are transferred to customers and reliable estimates can be
made of relevant deductions. The Group’s revenue recognition policies require
management to make a number of estimates, with the most signiﬁcant relating 
to charge backs, product returns, rebates and price adjustments which vary by
product arrangements and buying groups.
Charge backs The provision for charge backs is the most signiﬁcant and complex
estimate used in the recognition of revenue. In the US, the Group sells its
products directly to wholesalers, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains 
and mail-order pharmacies. The Group also sells its products indirectly to
independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and group
purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as “indirect customers. ” 
The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish 
pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select 
a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices. 
The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the
agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price.
This credit is called a “charge back” . The provision for charge backs is based on
historical sell-through levels by the Group’s wholesale customers to the indirect
customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales are made to the
large wholesalers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for charge backs
and makes adjustments when it believes that actual charge backs may differ 
from estimated reserves.
Business and ﬁnancial review
continued
12751_p26_p57.qxp  31/3/09  00:52  Page 56 Accounts receivable and bad debts The Group estimates, based on its historical
experience, the level of debts that it believes will not be collected. Such estimates
are made when collection of the full amount of the debt is no longer probable.
These estimates are based on a number of factors including speciﬁc customer
issues and industry, economic and political conditions. Bad debts are written 
off when identiﬁed.
Goodwill and intangible assets The Group has signiﬁcant investments in goodwill
and intangible assets as a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of
assets such as product development and marketing rights. 
Under IFRS, goodwill and intangibles with indeﬁnite useful economic lives are
held at cost and tested annually for impairment, whilst the remaining intangibles
are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are reviewed
annually and impairment reviews are undertaken if events occur which indicate
impairment to the carrying values of the assets. 
Purchases of intellectual property and product rights to supplement our R&D
portfolio are capitalised as intangible assets. Such intangible assets are amortised
from the launch of the underlying products and are tested for impairment. This
policy is in line with practice adopted by other major pharmaceutical companies.
The critical area of judgement is in relation to the useful economic life of these
product-related intangibles and the impairment tests for that are performed at
least annually.
Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from product-
speciﬁc and general legal proceedings, from guarantees or from environmental
liabilities connected with our current or former sites. These potential liabilities are
considered to have a remote probability of crystallising and are therefore treated
as contingent liabilities in the Group ﬁnancial statements, and accordingly
disclosed in Note 36. Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome
of legal proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on
our ﬁnancial position or proﬁtability. 
Tax
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations
prevailing in the countries where it operates and the likelihood of settlement. 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax and the tax
currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. T axable proﬁt differs from
net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

Responsibly Annual report 2008
Introduction
Acting responsibly has been a core value of Hikma since its foundation and a
value we strive to bring to life in our day-to-day work. In 2008 we continued to
formalise our CSR programme and reporting, and remained focused on working
to integrate sustainable behaviour into our business.
This report demonstrates how we continue to extend our engagement with 
the communities in which we operate, support our people, develop our business
practices, and improve awareness of how to minimise our impact on the
environment. Acting responsibly exists at the core of the way Hikma does
business, with the ultimate intention of improving the well-being of the patients
using our products and building strong relationships with other stakeholders.
Aligning business and CSR
The year ended with a signiﬁcant review of our CSR governance structure in 
line with our ongoing aim of embedding CSR throughout the Hikma group 
and driving the CSR programme from the Board and senior management, to
operational functions. The changes seek to ensure that our CSR activities are
consistently aligned with the Company’s ongoing business objectives. 
This new structure provides for a Board-level Steering Committee and an
expanded W orking Committee. The Steering Committee, is chaired by Hikma’s
Vice Chairman, and comprises an independent Non-Executive Director (Ronald
Goode) the Corporate Vice President of Finance and the General Counsel. It is
responsible for oversight of the Group’s CSR activity, its strategic direction 
and implementation and reporting to the Board of Directors. The W orking
Committee is composed of key executives – covering VP Regional Operations,
supply chain and ﬁnance – together with the Director of Investor Relations, the
Director of Corporate Communication, and the Group CSR Manager.
These new committees will bring consideration of social, economic and
environmental issues to a wider audience within Hikma, deliver implementation
of CSR policies and practice throughout the Group and improve feedback 
from business units to ensure the continued relevance of the CSR programme.
The committees have set goals for Hikma’s 2009 CSR programme in the areas of
reporting, the Hikma V olunteering Day and the appointment of CSR Champions.
In 2008 we saw increasing levels of activity from our CSR Champions. 
Based in six of Hikma’s manufacturing units, the Champions play a critical role 
in implementing CSR practice within the operating units and attaining employee
engagement for our growing number of initiatives. In early 2009 we appointed
CSR Champions at our manufacturing sites in Egypt, APM (Jordan), Italy and
Thymoorgan (Germany). 
Reporting
W e are guided by the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G3 guidelines, in
particular focusing on data gathering on: 
community investments;
environmental impacts; and 
employee and labour practices.

Through GRI reporting, we have started to identify performance improvements
on some key metrics. Measurement of this data will not only help to identify the
beneﬁts derived in our targeted units but also to benchmark good performance
between business units.
2008 was our second year of GRI data gathering. W e saw improvements in
both the quality and consistency of data gathered, but with only two data points
available, establishing trends remains at a preliminary stage. During 2009 we will
implement a dedicated software system to improve data gathering and analysis, to
gain better and more consistent data and enable analysis of trends in our business.
W e continue to review the need for additional indicators – for example, on
emissions – to ensure that reporting is aligned with our overall business strategy. 
People
W e value our employees as our most important asset, ensuring that we recruit and
retain the quality of people that distinguishes us from our competitors. W e aim to
be recognised as a leading employer and repay our employees’ loyalty by investing
in their future.
With our commitment to GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes), technical
training has always been very strong across the business. GRI data has shown that
non-GMP training represents approximately 25% of all training, helping us identify
areas of need for further non-technical training. In 2009 this will include additional
training for the CSR Champions and employee training on CSR Policies and the
Code of Conduct. In 2008, we also continued our Continuing Education Scheme
which supports employees in fully funded further education programmes.
W e continue to focus on employee welfare. In November 2008, we celebrated
W orld Diabetes Day, raising employee awareness by the distribution of posters
throughout our business, e-mails to employees and hosting an internal lecture in
Jordan. W e also undertook a breast cancer awareness day, which alerted employees
to issues and preventative screening, and have implemented a life insurance
scheme for all employees in Algeria.
Community: A Core V alue
W e remain resolute in our belief that investment in our communities brings
beneﬁt both to us and to those around us. This idea was embedded at the
foundation of Hikma as a family-owned company. In many cases, our community
involvement focuses on supporting young people with the aim of developing their
professional skills, while at the same time providing a broader pool of talented
recruits for Hikma.
W e have continued to build our university partnerships by providing student
scholarships. Following on from our 2007 acquisition in Egypt, 150 students 
from Egyptian universities were supported through cross-departmental training
at Hikma. In 2008 we launched a collaboration with the German Jordanian
University in Amman, whereby three students will receive six-month technical
training scholarships at Hikma’s German plant. 
W e continue to give signiﬁcant donations both ﬁnancial and in kind. In 2008,
the total value of our community investments was US$2,490,632. W e also
encourage employees to donate their time through volunteering to add capacity
to the ﬁnancial donations made by the Group.

12751_p58_p65.qxp  31/3/09  19:48  Page 61 University Partnerships Hikma has
continued to build partnerships with
universities in MENA, this enables students to
engage in valuable work experience whilst
encouraging future graduates to consider
Hikma as an employer of choice.
12751_p58_p65.qxp  31/3/09  14:35  Page 62 W e have chosen to focus our community support on helping those with cancer
and diabetes, because of the increasing recognition of the effect of these diseases
in MENA and in Hikma’s developments in therapeutic areas. During the year we:
signed an agreement with the King Hussein Cancer Foundation in Jordan,
providing US$140,000 of funding which has helped with the reprinting of Cancer
Awareness Booklets for public distribution.
introduced Hikma’s breast cancer awareness day – with more than 50% 
of our employees being female, we chose to undertake this project to raise
awareness and encourage dialogue around the risks that we face. 
In April 2008 we undertook a group-wide V olunteering Day which focused 
on raising cancer awareness and supporting patients suffering from cancer. 
W e encouraged employees across the business to spend one day giving their time,
and 500 employees were involved in the projects. Activities ranged from assisting 
a ﬁeld survey related to early detection of breast cancer, to spending the day at
pediatric oncology hospital units with child cancer patients, to renovating and
painting a cancer hospital ward.
W e also continued to work with charities in our communities helping to 
ﬁght poverty. In Jordan we: 
sponsored an SOS Children’s Village home. Our donation of US$17,000 covered
the costs of the home for 12 children.
donated US$ 350,000 to the King Abdullah 2nd Fund to Fight Poverty, which
supports the building of houses for underprivileged people in a number of
locations in Jordan.
Hikma Algeria was the key sponsor for Algeria’s ﬁrst Scientiﬁc Forum on Health,
Sport and Food, which brought together students for sporting events and
provided advice on balanced nutrition and awareness-raising of diseases to which
young people can be susceptible.
Finally, we continued to use our experience to inﬂuence business and social
development in the Middle East. Hikma was a regional partner for the W orld
Economic Forum Middle East summit in May and was invited to speak on the
panel at sessions focused on identifying and building opportunities to improve
the global competitiveness of businesses operating in the Middle East.
Health and Safety
Hikma’s dedication to quality extends across all areas of our business. It cannot 
be upheld without a continued commitment to providing a safe working
environment and ensuring that the health and safety of our employees is given
critical attention.
Following its development in 2007, 2008 brought the initial implementation 
of Hikma’s Health and Safety Policy, which requires the appointment of an HSE
supervisor in each business unit. In 2008 we saw the ﬁrst appointments to this
role, but fell short of our target of appointments in all main business units. 
The necessary additional appointments will be made during 2009. During 2008,
many of our units implemented the necessary health and safety processes through
the use of external HSE advisors. The process of employee education on the
Group Health and Safety Policy, which was not fully realised in 2008, remains a
key priority for 2009.

Health and Safety Policy delivered results during the year. New health and safety
initiatives developed during 2008 include the opening of a weekly health clinic at
our Algerian factory. Attended by local GP , this enables all employees to be given
an annual general health check.
W e were also delighted to receive external recognition for our commitment to
health and safety. Firstly this was gained through the award of the OHSAS 18001
certiﬁcation at our AMC facility in Jordan, with the main Hikma Jordan facility
also working towards this certiﬁcation. Secondly, Hikma Jordan was granted the
Award of Excellence in Health and Safety as the best private sector pharmaceutical
company in Jordan, a prestigious award granted by the country’s Social Security
Corporation, the most comprehensive ofﬁcial body tracking occupational injuries
in Jordan. 
During 2008 we focused on the collection and analysis of GRI data on
absenteeism and occupational injury rates to enable a clearer understanding for
ongoing policy development. 2009 will see further emphasis on employee training
on the Health and Safety Policy and target a zero level of occupational injuries
across all business units.
Environment
Our Environmental Policy states that we will manage our operations to minimise
our impact on the environment where possible. Our critical priorities remain the
reduction of: 
energy consumption; 
water usage; and
waste production.
W e aim to improve our performance through integrating our Environmental
Policy into all activities at Hikma, and our key performance metrics reﬂect 
these priorities.
A signiﬁcant achievement during the year, incorporating all three of these
areas, was the certiﬁcation of our main Hikma Jordan and AMC Jordan
manufacturing plants to ISO14001 standard. 
Energy consumption
GRI data collection has heightened awareness of energy usage and is helping us to
identify ways to drive energy reduction across the units. New initiatives that have
helped to reduce energy usage in 2008 include:
The installation of a solar system for hot water usage in Jordan – assessment is
ongoing for Algeria and Portugal.
The calibration of the Hikma Jordan boiler system to reduce diesel consumption
and reduce CO2 emissions. 
Amending overnight lighting procedures at W est-ward’s warehouses in the US. 
The use of low energy light bulbs in Saudi Arabia and Portugal.
ISO 14001
Hikma Jordan and AMC Jordan plants achieved 
ISO 14001 certiﬁcation in 2008.

Initial reporting from our manufacturing site in Portugal, which was designed to
operate to high environmental standards, indicates a reduction in electricity and
gas usage which we hope will be conﬁrmed with further data. Whilst investigations
during 2008 into renewable energy sources for our US business were not successful,
we continue to seek ways to implement our Environmental Policies in this business.
During the year we worked in Jordan with the Royal Scientiﬁc Society’s
Environment Research Centre and at AMC Jordan started an energy saving 
study in association with National Energy Research Centre (NERC) to identify
additional methods for reducing energy consumption. The primary data suggest
that AMC can save up to 25% of its total energy costs.
Water usage With a signiﬁcant manufacturing presence in the Middle East water
scarcity continues to be a major concern. A number of new initiatives have
quickly led to signiﬁcant improvements in our water usage. Water usage decreased
by just over 50% at our main Hikma Jordan plant, attributable to the installation
of new external cleaning pumps, replacement of corroded pipes, and employee
education on water resources.
Waste production W e continue to measure our waste and focus on reduction. Our
Environmental Policy commits us to encourage the reuse or recycling of all non-
hazardous waste and initial GRI data collected indicates that there has been
success in this area, in particular with the introduction of employee led recycling
initiatives. ISO 14001 certiﬁcation in Jordan also mandates speciﬁc procedures for
processing hazardous and specialised waste.
Central to all of these changes are education, communication and awareness-
raising, and we remain committed to communicating our Environmental Policy
to employees, customers and other stakeholders. For example, at AMC a booklet
was developed for contractors, employees and visitors that contains an overview
of, and advice about, the Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety Policies.
Ethics 
Honesty and integrity lie at the core of our business values. Ethical issues continue
to be overseen by the Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Ronald Goode an
independent non-executive Director, and reports to the Board of Directors.
Through our partnership with PACI (Partnering Against Corruption Initiative)
we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to all forms of bribery and corruption.
W e have also committed to developing and implementing internal systems and
controls for that policy, which are supported by the ongoing delivery of anti-
corruption training. 
W e previously committed to all Hikma management signing the Company-
wide Code of Conduct, and this undertaking continues. The Company continues
to operate a whistle-blowing policy – to encourage reporting of activities that 
are not in compliance with the Code of Conduct, ethics or ﬁnancial reporting
guidelines – which along with Share Dealing Code and Disclosure Policies will 
be the subject of further education in 2009.
W e have continued to work with our suppliers to understand their ethical
policies (including human rights and environmental behaviour), targeting certain
key suppliers with a questionnaire to investigate this further. During 2009 the 
CSR Committee will work to identify where action may need to be taken with
suppliers to align their values with those of Hikma.

Governance Annual report 2008
Combined Code
The Board is responsible for, and committed to, meeting 
the standards of good corporate governance set out in the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published by 
the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (as revised)
(the “Combined Code”) and the corporate governance
principles set out in the Markets Law of the Dubai Financial
Services Authority (the “Markets Law”) (together the
“Corporate Governance Principles”). This report, the 
Audit Committee report set out on pages 75 to 77 and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 81 to 91
describe how the Board applied the Corporate Governance
Principles during the year under review. 
During the year under review, the Company applied 
the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code,
including both the main principles and the supporting
principles, and the corporate governance principles. 
At the year end the Company was in full compliance 
with the Corporate Governance Principles. 
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
and the Markets Law require the Group to report on their
application of the principles of good governance and the
extent of their compliance with the Corporate Governance
Principles. This statement provides details on how the 
Group has applied these principles.
The Board
The Group is led and controlled by the Board of Directors.
The Board’s role is to determine the Group’s long-term
strategy; to monitor the achievement of its business objectives;
to ensure the Group has adequate resources available to 
meet these objectives; to promote good corporate governance;
and to ensure that the Group meets its responsibilities to
shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and other
stakeholders. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved
to the Board for consideration and decision, which is
reviewed and, if necessary updated annually. This includes
approval of strategic plans, approval of ﬁnancial statements
and the annual Group budget, approval of material
investment decisions, acquisitions and divestments, 
and review of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal control. No individual or group of individuals
dominates the Board’s decision making process.
Except for the matters formally reserved for the 
Board, and in accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association, the Board has delegated responsibility for the
management of the Group, through the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer, to its executive management team.
Corporate Governance report
Composition of the Board 
The Board currently comprises eight members: a 
Non-Executive Chairman, four independent Non-Executive
Directors, one Non-Executive Director not classiﬁed as
independent for the purposes of the Combined Code and
two Executive Directors. The names of the Directors and 
their biographical details are set out on pages 68 and 69. 
The Chairman and the Executive Vice-Chairman were
appointed to the Board on the incorporation of the
Company on 8 September 2005. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2007, and save for
Ronald Goode, who joined the Board on 12 December 2006,
each of the Non-Executive Directors joined the Board on 
14 October 2005. The Non-Executive Directors, who have
diverse business backgrounds, skills and experience, bring
independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy,
performance, resources, key appointments, standards 
of conduct and other matters presented to the Board. 
The Chairman, Executive Vice-Chairman and each of 
the Non-Executive Directors except Ronald Goode, offer
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
are separate, and their responsibilities are deﬁned in writing
and approved by the Board. These guidelines are reviewed
annually by the Board. Prior to the appointment of the
current Chief Executive Ofﬁcer the Board undertook
consultation with its major shareholders and external
advisers regarding the continuation of Samih Darwazah in
his role as Chairman. The Board concluded that his former
executive role should not prevent him from remaining as
Chairman, thus enabling the Group to continue to receive
important guidance through the Board in his capacity as
Non-Executive Chairman. 
The Board does not classify Ali Al-Husry, as an independent
Director for the purposes of the Combined Code as a result
of his close links to the Darwazah family through Darhold
Limited, the Company’s largest shareholder. However, he
continues to bring broad ﬁnancial experience to the Board 
as well as a detailed knowledge of the MENA region which 
is signiﬁcant to the Group’s business.
The Senior Independent Director is Sir David Rowe-Ham.
Sir David is Chairman of the Nomination Committee and
responsible for chairing the meetings of Non-Executive
Directors conducted without the presence of the Chairman
or executive management. He is also the key contact for
shareholders, should they have concerns that they do not
wish to raise with the Chairman.
12751_p66_p98.qxp  27/3/09  22:44  Page 72 Information ﬂow
Board and committee papers are circulated to members in
advance of the meetings. In addition to formal meetings, the
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors maintain regular
contact with executive management. The Chairman also
holds informal meetings with Non-Executive Directors
without the executive management present to discuss issues
affecting the Group. Senior executives attend Board meetings
and make presentations on the results and strategies of their
business units. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that
good Board procedures are followed and for advising the
Board through the Chairman on all matters of corporate
governance. The appointment and removal of the Company
Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board. T o the extent
necessary, the Directors are able to obtain independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense in the
performance of their duties as Directors.
Board training/continuing professional development
The directors maintain a close dialogue between board
meetings, ensuring that, amongst other things, the 
Non-Executive Directors are kept up to date with major
developments in the Group’s business. The Board is also
encouraged to visit the major business units and to meet 
the senior management teams in order to facilitate a better
understanding of the key issues facing business. In the year
under review, Board meetings were held in Egypt and the
USA. The company’s brokers also present industry and
market updates to the Board. These sessions are in addition
to the written brieﬁngs on areas of regulatory and legislative
change presented at each Board meeting.
Board meetings
During the year under review, the Board held eight
scheduled meetings and ﬁve other meetings. The Company
Secretary attended all Board meetings and Committee
meetings. A table showing attendance at these meetings is 
set out below. Whilst in 2008 all Directors attended meetings
of the Board and committees of which they are members, 
to the extent they are unable to attend additional meetings
called on short notice, or where prevented from doing so by
prior commitments, Directors receive and read the papers 
for consideration at that meeting, relay their comments in
advance and, where necessary, follow up with the Chairman
on the decisions taken.

Board performance evaluation 
All Directors other than Said Darwazah who was appointed
on 1 July 2007 and elected by shareholders on 15 May 2008,
and Ronald Goode who was appointed on 12 December
2006 and elected by the shareholders at the AGM held on 
6 June 2007, were elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual
General Meeting, held on 25 May 2006 and will therefore be
subject to re-election by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 14 May 2009. All Directors are subject
to re-election at intervals of no more than three years. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term 
of three years, which can be renewed and extended for not
more than two further three-year terms.
As required by the Combined Code, a formal evaluation
of the performance of the Board, the Chairman, the
Committee Chairmen and the individual Non-Executive
Directors was undertaken during the period under review. 
The evaluation process was led by the Senior Independent
Director, who met with each of the Directors and the
Committee Chairmen to undertake a formal appraisal of the
performance of the Board, its committees and each of the
individual Directors. These discussions focused on Board
and Committee performance, membership, timetabling,
internal and external support, the quality and timely
availability of relevant Board information and the contribution
of, preparation for and performance by individual Directors
at Board and Committee meetings. The results of the
evaluation process and feedback were reviewed with the
Chairman and formed part of his appraisal of the overall
effectiveness of the Board and its members. Overall the
review concluded that the Board functions well, with good
communication, and with issues raised in good time to allow
for consultation, debate and effective decision-making.

In addition to the matters set out above in respect of all
Directors, the Senior Independent Director met with the
Non-Executive Directors to undertake a formal appraisal 
of the performance of the Chairman. This review also
addressed the effectiveness of his leadership, the setting 
of the Board agenda, communication with shareholders,
internal communication and Board efﬁciency.

on pages 87 and 88.
Board committees
In accordance with the principles of good corporate
governance and in compliance with the Combined Code 
and the Markets Law, the Board maintains three committees
– the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and
Remuneration Committee. The Group also has an Executive
Committee, an Ethics Committee and a Corporate Social
Responsibility Committee. All draw their members from 
the Board and the senior management of the Group.
Each of the three Combined Code committees has terms
of reference, which were reviewed during the year. Copies are
published on the corporate website at www.hikma.com.
Their Chairmen give regular reports of the committees’
business to the Board.
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee consists of two independent
Non-Executive Directors – Sir David Rowe-Ham
(Committee Chairman) and Michael Ashton – and the
Executive Vice-Chairman, Mazen Darwazah. As required 
by the Corporate Governance Principles, the majority of the
members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive
Directors and an independent Non-Executive Director 
holds the Chairmanship of the Committee. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for succession
planning and for ensuring that all appointments to the
Board are made on objective criteria. In accordance with its
terms of reference, the Committee is required to take into
account the skills, knowledge and experience of the Board in
making its decisions and is able to use external search ﬁrms
or open advertising to compile shortlists of candidates for
the Board. It is also charged with reviewing the appropriateness
of the size, structure and composition of the Board.
The Nomination Committee met once during the year,
with full attendance.
Corporate Governance report 
continued
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Company’s
four independent Non-Executive Directors – Michael Ashton
(Committee Chairman), Breffni Byrne, Sir David Rowe-Ham
and Ronald Goode. The Remuneration Committee therefore
complies with the membership requirements laid out in the
Corporate Governance Principles.
The Committee met ﬁve times during the year with full
attendance. The Committee is responsible for setting and
reviewing executive remuneration and that of the Company
Secretary and is able to take advice from external consultants
when required. A full report on the role of the Remuneration
Committee is set out in the Directors’ remuneration report
on pages 81 to 91. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee consists of four independent 
Non-Executive Directors – Breffni Byrne (Committee
Chairman), Michael Ashton, Sir David Rowe-Ham and
Ronald Goode. The Audit Committee therefore complies
with the membership requirements laid out in the Corporate
Governance Principles. 
The Committee met eight times during the year with full
attendance. A full report of the role of the Audit Committee
and the details of how it carried out its duties is set out in 
the Audit Committee report on pages 75 to 77.
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee is made up of the Executive
Directors and senior management of the Group. 
The Committee oversees the Group’s operations and
implements the decisions of the Board.
Ethics Committee 
The Ethics Committee is chaired by Ronald Goode and
draws its members from the Board and senior management
across the Group. The Ethics Committee aims to monitor
ethical behaviour and integrity across all areas of the Group’s
business. Thus, the Committee is responsible for the review
and approval of statements and policies on ethics, conduct,
values and principles within the Group.
CSR Steering Committee
The CSR Steering Committee is chaired by the Executive
Vice-Chairman, Mazen Darwazah and draws its members
from the Board (Ronald Goode) and senior management.

12751_p66_p98.qxp  27/3/09  22:44  Page 74 Internal control
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the
Group’s systems of internal control and risk management
and has complied with the requirements of the Corporate
Governance Principles in establishing a continuous process
for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks the 
Group faces. The Board is responsible for monitoring the
effectiveness of these systems on an ongoing basis and, at
least annually, conducting a formal review of the Group’s
policies on internal control. The system of internal control
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements are as follows:
a reporting structure with clear procedures, authorisation
limits, segregation of duties and delegated authorities;
annual budgets, updated forecasting, and long-term business
plans for the Group that identify risks and opportunities
which are reviewed and approved by the Board;
a comprehensive system of internal ﬁnancial reporting
which includes regular comparison of ﬁnancial results and
key performance indicators against budget and forecast,
informed by management commentary;
a clearly deﬁned process for controlling capital expenditure
and other ﬁnancial commitments, including appropriate
authorisation levels, which are monitored and approved by
the Board as appropriate;
written policies and procedures for all material 
functional areas with speciﬁc responsibility allocated 
to individual managers. 
During the year under review, Ernst & Y oung continued its
management and execution of the Group’s internal audit
function on a global basis under a three year contract which
commenced in 2006. This involves a risk-driven approach 
to internal audit which is overseen by the Audit Committee.
The internal audit process focuses on reviewing areas of
business risk, internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting and
other systems in the Company’s main subsidiaries and at 
the corporate level, with regular reports of its ﬁndings made
to the Audit Committee. Ernst & Y oung have direct access to
the Audit Committee and the Board Chairman.
The Board conﬁrms that, in accordance with the
requirements of the Corporate Governance Principles, a
review of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal
controls was conducted during the year.
Insurance
The Company maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and
Ofﬁcers’ insurance in respect of action taken against Directors.

Governance and ﬁnancial results
12751_p66_p98.qxp  27/3/09  22:45  Page 75 76 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC
Governance Annual report 2008
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed by
the Audit Committee during the period under review and
amended to include responsibility for the operation of the
Company’s policies for monitoring directors’ conﬂicts of
interest. The terms of reference were subsequently reviewed
and approved by the Board.
Composition
Hikma’s Audit Committee comprises four members –
Breffni Byrne, Michael Ashton, Sir David Rowe-Ham, and
Ronald Goode – all of whom are independent Non-Executive
Directors, and whose biographical details are set out on 
page 69. The Committee is chaired by Breffni Byrne, who is a
chartered accountant and who is considered by the Board to
have recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. No members
of the Committee have links with the Company’s external
auditors. The Company therefore considers that it complies
with the Corporate Governance Principles regarding the
composition of the Audit Committee. The Committee
Chairman receives additional remuneration to compensate
him for his additional responsibilities.
Responsibilities 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its
responsibilities with regard to ﬁnancial reporting, external
and internal audit and internal control. This includes
reviewing the Company’s annual ﬁnancial statements,
interim report, interim management statements and trading
updates, reviewing and monitoring the extent of non-audit
work undertaken by external auditors, and monitoring the
effectiveness and output of the Company’s internal audit
activities, internal controls and risk management systems.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, as 
well as the effectiveness of the audit process. The ultimate
responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual 
report and ﬁnancial statements and the half-yearly reports
remains with the Board. This year the Board delegated
responsibility for the operation of the Company’s policies 
on monitoring directors’ conﬂicts of interest to the Audit
Committee. This responsibility has been included in the
terms of reference. 
Meetings
The Audit Committee met eight times during the year under
review, with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and the Company
Secretary in attendance. The Audit Committee reviewed the
2007 annual report and ﬁnancial statements, the 2008 interim
report the two interim management statements released by
the Company and each of the regulatory statements made by
the Company in respect of trading and results issued during
the year. The Committee also reviewed and approved the 
Corporate Governance report 
continued
audit plans for 2009 for both internal and external auditors
and the related scope of internal audit work to be undertaken.
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal controls and risk management processes and the
disclosures made in the annual report and ﬁnancial
statements on these matters. The Committee also reviewed
its own terms of reference and general effectiveness, both
speciﬁcally and in the context of the overall annual review of
corporate governance matters conducted by the Company. 
The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte LLP , attended
four Audit Committee meetings for the purposes of
presenting their 2007 audit results and ﬁndings, the results 
of the 2008 interim review and their audit plan for 2009. 
The internal auditors, Ernst & Y oung presented the results 
of their audit programme for 2008 to the Audit Committee
together with their proposed audit plan for 2009. The Audit
Committee continues to review the response by management,
proposed action plans and the overall effectiveness of the
internal audit function. In accordance with the Combined
Code, the Audit Committee also met with the Group’s
external auditor and internal auditor without executive
management present. 
In addition, during 2008, the Audit Committee met 
with the external auditor in the United States and the Audit
Committee Chairman met with external auditors in Jordan
and Algeria. The Audit Committee Chairman also met with
Ernst & Y oung in Jordan to discuss the results of the 2008
internal audit programme. 
Attendance of members at Audit Committee meetings 
is shown on page 73 of the report on corporate governance.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on
external audit, and has adopted a policy in relation to the
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors. 
Fees paid in respect of audit, audit-related and non-audit
services are outlined in Note 6 to the Group Financial
Statements. Audit-related services are services carried out 
by the external auditor by virtue of its role as auditor 
and principally include assurance-related work and
accounting advice. 
In line with audit independence requirements the
external auditor does not provide services such as
information system design and valuation or advocacy 
work which could be considered to be inconsistent with 
the audit role. In addition audit related and non-related
services provided by the external auditor in excess of 
certain monetary limits require prior approval by the Audit
Committee. The Committee has reviewed the non-audit
services provided by the external auditor and is satisﬁed 
that the nature of these services has not compromised the
auditors’ independence. 
12751_p66_p98.qxp  27/3/09  22:45  Page 76 A policy has also been adopted whereby prior approval by
the Audit Committee is required before the recruitment 
of a senior member of the audit team or the recruitment 
of an employee of the external auditors to a senior ﬁnance
position within the Group. 
The Group Whistleblowing Policy contains arrangements
for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Senior
Independent Director, and Ronald Goode (as a US-based
member of the Audit Committee) to receive, in conﬁdence,
complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal control 
and other instances of allegedly improper behaviour by
Group employees. 
Overview
The Audit Committee concludes that it has acted in
accordance with its terms of reference and ensured the
independence of external auditors. The Audit Committee 
also reviewed the effectiveness of the external auditors 
and recommends to the Board that they be re-appointed. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at
the Annual General Meeting to answer questions on the
work of the Committee.
Dialogue with shareholders
Ongoing communication with shareholders is a high

The T akeover Code – Rule 9 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 6 June 2007, a vote
of the independent shareholders of the Company approved
the award of up to an aggregate of 437,141 Ordinary Shares
pursuant to the Company’s 2006 Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan to Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah (the “L TIP
Holders”). Because of the relationship of the L TIP Holders
with Darhold Limited, who at the time of the Annual General
Meeting held 52,649,972 Ordinary Shares (at 25 April 2007
representing 31.129%. of the issued share capital of the
Company, and as at 16 March 2009 being the latest
practicable date prior to the publication of this document,
holding 57,183,028 Ordinary Shares, representing 30.22% 
of the issued share capital of the Company), each of the L TIP
Holders (together with certain other identiﬁed individuals 
at that date) was treated as acting in concert with Darhold
Limited for the purposes of the T akeover Code (the “Concert
Party”). As at 25 April 2007, the Concert Party held, in
aggregate, interests in 60,550,416 Ordinary Shares in the
capital of Hikma (then representing 35.800% of the then
issued share capital of the Company). As at 16 March 2009
being the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of this document, the Concert Party held, in aggregate,
interests in 66,097,758 Ordinary Shares in the capital of
Hikma (representing 34.917% of the then issued share
capital of the Company). On full exercise of the options
under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals 2004 Stock Option Plan
(the “2004 Plan”) and full vesting of the L TIPs, the Concert
Party would potentially have, in aggregate, interests in
67,077,258 shares in the capital of the Company
(representing 35.252% of the enlarged issued share capital of
the Company, on the basis that no Ordinary Shares were
issued other than pursuant to the exercise of such options or
vesting of L TIPs). 
During the period from the Annual General Meeting 
in 2007 to 16 March 2009, the L TIP Holders together 
with other members of the Concert Party who hold 
options over Ordinary Shares pursuant to the 2004 Plan 
(the “Option Holders”) have exercised, in aggregate, options
over 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the
Company, of which 200,000 Ordinary Shares were sold
immediately upon exercise, and 480,000 Ordinary Shares
were retained and 320,000 were retained but subsequently
disposed of by the Options Holders.
Auditors
Each person who was a Director of the Company at the date
when this report was approved conﬁrms that: 
so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware;
and
the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of section 234ZA of the
Companies Act 1985.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue
in ofﬁce as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at
88 W ood Street, London, EC2V 7RS on Thursday, 14 May

This report has been prepared in accordance with 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, 
(the “Regulations”). The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
principles and complied with the provisions of the
Combined Code and the Markets Law relating to directors’
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, an advisory
resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the
ﬁnancial statements will be approved. 
The auditors are required to report on the “auditable”
part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
that part of the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended 
by the Regulations). The report is therefore divided into
separate sections for unaudited and audited information. 
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee 
The Directors who were members of the Committee 
during the year under review are set out on page 74 in the
Corporate Governance report. 
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration
policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the 
advice of the Remuneration Committee. The ongoing
recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have
been approved without amendment by the Board for
submission to shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing
policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining speciﬁc remuneration
packages for each of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee members have no personal ﬁnancial interest
other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no
potential conﬂicts of interests arising from cross directorships
and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 81
Annual report 2008
The Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the
Chairman, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Executive Vice
Chairman on matters relating to Directors’ performance 
and remuneration in respect of the period under review. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Executive Vice
Chairman and General Counsel may attend meetings by
invitation except when their individual remuneration
arrangements are discussed. No Director takes part in
discussions relating to his own remuneration or beneﬁts. 
As detailed below, during the year the Remuneration
Committee received wholly independent advice on 
executive compensation from Halliwell Consulting. 
Halliwell Consulting also provided administrative support
for the operation of the Company’s share plans. No services
other than those detailed in this report were provided to the
Company by Halliwell during the year under review. 
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted
with written terms of reference with the full remit of the
Committee role described. The terms of reference are
available on the Company’s website or on request by
shareholders in writing from the Company Secretary. 
Philosophy behind Remuneration Committee’s approach
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to
encourage, reward and retain executives and the
Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders’
interests are best served by remuneration packages which
have a large emphasis on performance related pay, thus
encouraging executives to focus on delivering the Group’s
business strategy. By providing meaningful incentives to
executives the Company’s policy seeks to ensure that the
appropriate balance between ﬁxed and performance 
related pay is maintained.

Remuneration policy 2008
Overall policy 
The Remuneration Committee’s policy during the year under review was to set the main elements of the remuneration
package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Company’s Comparator Group:
Potential total short-term Potential annual Potential total 
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Beneﬁts in kind remuneration available share awards compensation value
Lower quartile Upper quartile [Lower quartile Median to Upper quartile Median to 
to median to median] upper quartile upper quartile
This supports the performance-based culture of the Company. Fixed costs are minimised and total short-term remuneration The policy in respect of long-term incentives and
will only reach and exceed the median if the performance-based bonus is earned for the relevant ﬁnancial year. potential compensation value is an extension
of the policy on total short-term remuneration. 
Executives will only receive a market competitive 
package if the annual bonus and long-term
incentives are earned.
2008 Comparator Group 
The constituents of the Company’s Comparator Group (“CG”) for benchmarking remuneration during 2008 were 
as follows:
Name Name Name
Acambis Plc Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc Protherics Plc
Alizyme Plc Forest Laboratories Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC
Allergan Inc King Pharmaceuticals Inc SkyePharma Plc
Alpharma Inc Mylan Laboratories Inc Vernalis PLC
AstraZeneca PLC Oxford Biomedica Plc Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc
Axis-Shield Plc
Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the Comparator Group included:
the industry within which the Company operates, speciﬁcally taking into account both the international nature of the
Company’s business and its competitors;
the international nature of the Company’s current executive team and potential recruits to that team;
the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company; and
the UK listing environment of the Company. 
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
Neutec Pharma Plc and CAT Group PLC were removed from the 2008 Comparator Group due to their acquisition 
during 2007. T owards the end of 2008, Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc, Acambis Plc, Protherics Plc and Alpharma Inc were also
acquired by other companies. 
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee will take the opportunity in 2009 to review the constituents of the whole
Comparator Group to ensure a Comparator Group which is appropriate for 2009 and on an ongoing basis. It is currently
anticipated that the core of the 2009 Comparator Group will be based on those companies remaining from the 2008
Comparator Group. 
The new 2009 Comparator Group will be used as the total shareholder return performance condition comparator 
group for awards granted in 2009 under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”). 
The Company has historically used the same comparators for both benchmarking remuneration and the performance
condition for awards granted during the relevant year. 
The Remuneration Committee will also consider whether to introduce a control benchmarking group based on the
FTSE 250 due to the international nature of the 2008 Comparator Group and its likely successor.
12751_p66_p98.qxp  27/3/09  22:45  Page 82 Ongoing review
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains
appropriate for the ﬁnancial year under review. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
market conditions affecting the Company;
the recruitment market in the Company’s sector;
changing market practice;
changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies; and 
the current economic climate.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2008 policy in 2009. 
2008 balance between ﬁxed and variable performance-based compensation
The chart below demonstrates the balance between the potential ﬁxed and variable performance-based compensation for
each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2008.

Elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Base salary
Policy 2008 and 2009 – Lower quartile to median The Company’s remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the
Executive Directors below the median to support a performance-based culture.
When determining the base salary of the Executives the Committee takes into consideration:
the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly
similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within
the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group;
the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
the individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; and
pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The following tables summarises the base salary of Executive Directors:
Median rise
in Comparator
Name 2008 salary 2009 salary Rise Group
Said Darwazah $630,000 $630,000 0% 8.8%
Median $886,000
Lower quartile $574,000
Mazen Darwazah $420,000 $420,000 0% 5.0%
Median $458,000
Lower quartile $345,000
After reviewing the above criteria, the Committee has elected not to increase Executive Directors’ salaries for 2009. It remains
the Committee’s ongoing policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only modest rises in base salary should be required.

Policy 2008 and 2009 – Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable. The following tables summarise
the main features of the Company’s executive bonus plan.

The maximum target bonus potential is 100% of salary. It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total
maximum bonus of 200% of salary. The maximum bonus potentials for 2009 will remain the same as those applied for 2008.
The bonuses for 2008 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets. The table
below shows the principal performance targets used for 2008 and their percentage satisfaction.

The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that 
they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company in order to ensure that they continue to
remain challenging. Underlying performance targets for Executive Directors’ bonuses were reviewed during 2008 as a part 
of an overall review of key performance indicators within the Group to ensure that they remained in line with the Group’s
overall business strategy in 2009. It is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains
appropriate for the requirements of the Group in 2009. 
Share incentives
Policy 2008 and 2009 –  upper quartile The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to provide annual share grants to senior
executives at a maximum of the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group. Ongoing share incentives are
provided to the Executive Directors solely through the L TIP . The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under
the L TIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of
both shareholder dilution and income statement expense. Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached
performance condition ensures that the Company’s comparative T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR” )
1
performance against
the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives will receive the full beneﬁt of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committee’s desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the
achievement of substantial performance.
The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to Executive Directors during 2008.

1 T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”) – is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period (the return is the value of the capital gain and
reinvested dividends). It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
Remuneration Committee report 
continued
12751_p66_p98.qxp  31/3/09  07:48  Page 84 The Remuneration Committee granted lower levels of L TIP awards to Executive Directors than indicated in its 2007 report,
due to a wider population being granted awards than was originally envisaged and the Company wishing to manage the
overall cost of the programme. This resulted in a scaling down of awards including those made to Executive Directors. 
In 2009 the Company will introduce a new Management Incentive Plan (detailed later in this report), and will therefore
consider L TIP award levels in 2009 in conjunction with the introduction of this new plan, and the consequently smaller
population of participants in the L TIP .
The following table summarises the main features of the L TIP in 2008 and its proposed operation during 2009.

Maximum annual grant 300% (current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200%) 
The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group. 20% of Awards will be released for median
performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance. The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that 
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance. When considering this underlying ﬁnancial
performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include proﬁt after tax, revenue growth and the achievement
of operational milestones.

2 Face Value for awards under the L TIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be
dependent upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisﬁed at the end of the three year performance
period and the share price of the Company at this time.
Basis of performance condition selection and measurements
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as 
it ensures that the executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value
before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions. The Remuneration Committee
will provide a full explanation and justiﬁcation at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying
ﬁnancial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisﬁed. 
The Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with
the rules of the L TIP . The Committee will approve these ﬁgures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution
In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers (“ ABI”) the Company can issue a maximum
of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans. Under the L TIP rules,
grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the ﬁrst 
three years following the Company’s IPO, undertaken in 2005. 
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO:
Share awards as a percentage Share awards as a percentage 
of issued share capital as at of issued share capital as at

T ype of plan ten year period during the year
All Employee Share Plans 0% 0%
Discretionary Share Plans 1.375% 0.965%
The Company has not implemented any all employee share incentive arrangements.
It is the Company’s current intention that the awards granted in 2009 will be satisﬁed by newly issued shares. No awards
will be issued to satisfy awards under the MIP (a summary of which is set out below) without prior shareholder approval. 
Post employment beneﬁts
Policy 2008 and 2009 – Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Deﬁned
Contribution Retirement Beneﬁt Plan (the “Beneﬁt Plan”) in accordance with the Rules of the Beneﬁt Plan relevant to
employees of the Group based in Jordan. Under the Beneﬁt Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the
Beneﬁt Plan. These are ﬁxed at 5% of applicable salary. Participants are entitled to 30% of the Group’s contributions to the
Beneﬁt Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year. The participant’s
interest in the Group’s contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.

Other remuneration matters
Directors’ shareholding policy
The Company does not currently have a formal Directors’ shareholding requirement due to the substantial shareholdings 
of the Executive Directors. The Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a
minimum level of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of
a formal shareholding requirement.
All employee share arrangements
During 2008, the Company reviewed the overall structure of management and employee share-based incentives, including
the potential beneﬁts of operating an All Employee Share plan. The Remuneration Committee assessed the potential cost 
of implementation of an all employee plan against its anticipated take-up by employees within the Group. Following this
review, the Remuneration Committee resolved that, given the geographical diversity of the Group’s employees, the costs 
of implementation would not be justiﬁed by the potential beneﬁts that could derive from such a plan. Consequently,
implementation will be placed on hold, though the matter will be kept under ongoing review. As part of the review of
management and employee incentive structure, the Remuneration Committee resolved to implement a targeted
programme to reward the management who are the key value drivers in the business. Details of this plan are set out below. 
Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”)
Under the MIP , the Company will make grants of nil cost option awards to executive management across the Group based
on the satisfaction of annual performance targets. The key features of the MIP are as follows: 
the MIP is open to management level employees across the Group below senior executive level;
participation in the L TIP will preclude participation in the MIP;
participants will be notiﬁed of a maximum monetary entitlement, (the maximum award level is currently anticipated 
to be 50% of salary p.a.) the value of which will be awarded to participants in the form of nil cost options over shares, 
based on annual performance against individual and Group KPIs;
nil cost options will vest two years after the date of award (being approximately three years after the commencement 
of the ﬁnancial year to which the award relates), subject to the participant remaining in employment with the Group during
this period. Once the options have been awarded, the continued employment requirement is the only condition for vesting; 
awards are expected to be satisﬁed out of shares held for the purpose in the Group’s Employment Beneﬁt T rust. 
no shares will be issued by the Company to satisfy awards without prior shareholder approval in general meeting.

12751_p66_p98.qxp  31/3/09  15:29  Page 86 Executive Directors’ contracts
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review 
are as follows:
Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment
Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary 
and beneﬁts
Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary 
and beneﬁts
The Executive Directors’ contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months’ written notice. 
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies. In the event of the termination of an
executive’s contract, salary and beneﬁts will be payable during the notice period (there will, however, be no automatic
entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the 
rules of the relevant incentive plan). The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustiﬁed
payments for failure on an Executive Director’s termination of employment. There are no special provisions in the contracts
of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment. 
Mazen Darwazah, who has an executive service contract with the Company as detailed above, will be proposed for 
re-election at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company, to be held on 14 May 2009. 
External appointments 
The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector
appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the Director, from which the Company can
beneﬁt. Executive Directors may therefore accept non-executive appointments as long as they do not lead to a conﬂict of
interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments. During the year under review, Said Darwazah 
and Mazen Darwazah received fees of US$11,850 and US$26,100 respectively, in respect of such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Policy 2008 – Upper quartile The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon
recommendations from the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the 
Articles of Association. 
The nature of the Company’s business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA,
Middle East and Europe. The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both 
in the UK and internationally. The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some
extent internationally. However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate 
to grant options to the Company’s Non-Executive Directors. T o ensure that the Company remains able to attract the
appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee 
policy at the upper quartile. 
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in £Sterling, are as follows:

Governance Annual report 2008
A review of the level of Non-Executive Director fees was conducted during 2008. As no review was undertaken in 2007, 
in 2008 NED fees fell below the benchmark set by the Group remuneration policy. The Board therefore commissioned
Halliwell Consulting to conduct a study of non-executive remuneration against the Comparator Group, which showed that,
in relation to the overall NED fee policy set by the Group, Hikma’s NED fees were signiﬁcantly out of step with those of its
peers. The Board has therefore resolved that from 1 January 2009, the fees of Non-Executive Directors should be increased.
Given the current economic climate, it was resolved to grant Non-Executive Directors’ fees for 2009 in the amounts set out
above, which represent an approximately 5% increase in the annual fees for all Non-Executive Directors. The increases move
non-executive fees back towards the Group’s stated policy, though overall non-executive fees remain below the level set by
Group policy. The Board continues to believe that it is important to ensure that the fees paid to non-executives remain
competitive, that they reﬂect the increasingly important role played by non-executives and allow the Nomination Committee
to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning. 
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company
and are not entitled to pension contributions or other beneﬁts provided by the Company. The Non-Executive Directors do
not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company. Each appointment is terminable on one
month’s notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months,
subject to the terms of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the ﬁnancial statements. The Directors are required to
prepare ﬁnancial statements for the Group in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the EU (IFRSs) and have also elected to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for the Company in accordance with IFRSs.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs, the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial
statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the
Company’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and
cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the
effects of transactions, other events and condition in
accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for
the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements” . 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; 
present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs is insufﬁcient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and
ﬁnancial performance.
The Directors responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the Company, for safeguarding 
the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for 
the preparation of a Directors’ report and Director’s
remuneration report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements differs from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
W e conﬁrm to the best of our knowledge:
the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; and
the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’
report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties they face.

judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
Group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
W e planned and performed our audit so as to obtain 
all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited.

In the current year, two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are
effective for the current period. These are: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and T reasury Share T ransactions and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 –
The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The adoption of these
Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Group’s accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not 
been applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted 
by the EU):
IFRS 1 (amended)/IAS 27 (amended) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate
IFRS 2 (amended) Share-based Payment – V esting Conditions and Cancellations
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IAS 1(revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements
IAS 23 (revised 2007) Borrowing Costs
IAS 27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 32 (amended)/IAS 1 (amended) Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2008)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material
impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group except for the following, which may have impact depending on the future
activities of the Group:
additional segment disclosures when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009; and
treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries when IFRS 3 comes into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition
date is on or after the beginning of the ﬁrst annual period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The ﬁnancial statements have also
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the
EU IAS Regulation. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the
revaluation to market of certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. 
Comparative ﬁgures for 31 December 2007 have been adjusted for revisions to the provisional acquisition balance sheet of
the companies acquired by the Group in 2007. Further details are provided in Note 33. In addition, in the consolidated cash
ﬂow statement and supporting Notes interest paid has been reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancing activities and ﬁnance income has been
reclassiﬁed to investing activities to better reﬂect the nature of the ﬂows, following the recent acquisitions.
Going concern risks are discussed in the risk management section of the Business and Financial Review.
The Group’s previously published ﬁnancial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards. 
The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US Dollar as the majority of the
Company’s business is conducted in US Dollars ($).
The signiﬁcant accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (the “Company”) and entities
controlled by the Company (together the “Group”) and the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its associates.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies either directly or
indirectly of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date
of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity
therein. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are
allocated against the interests of the parent. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as
appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the
income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

12751_p99_p152.qxp  27/3/09  22:49  Page 100 2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint
control, through participation in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of
accounting except when classiﬁed as held for sale. 
Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but not
control or joint control over these policies.
Investment in joint venture
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and a third party undertake an economic activity that is
subject to joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity, and exists only
when the strategic ﬁnancial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties
sharing control (the venturers).
Each venturer contributes cash or other resources to the jointly controlled entity. These contributions are included in 
the accounting records of the venturer and recognised in its ﬁnancial statements as an investment in the jointly 
controlled entity.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using proportionate consolidation. The application of proportionate
consolidation means that the balance sheet of the Group includes its share of the assets that it controls jointly and its share
of the liabilities for which it is jointly responsible. 
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill: arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair
value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an
asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised
immediately in proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units. Cash-generating
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequent when there is an indication
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the
unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss 
on disposal.
(b) Marketing rights: are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights ﬁrst generate sales.
(c) Customer relationships: represent the value attributed to the long-term relationships held with existing customers at the
date of acquisition and are amortised over their useful economic life.
(d) Product related intangibles: 
(i) product ﬁles and under-licenced products are assigned indeﬁnite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment 
at least annually; and
(ii) under-licence agreements and product dossiers are amortised over their useful lives in the year of acquisition.
(e) Purchased software: is amortised over the useful economic lives when the asset is available for use.
(f) In process research and development recognised on acquisition: is amortised over the useful life in the year of acquisition.
(g) Trade name: some trade names are assigned indeﬁnite useful lives and others have ﬁnite useful lives over which they are
amortised where applicable, in the period from acquisition.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each Group company are
expressed in US Dollars, the functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and the presentation at currency of the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
T ransactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net proﬁt or loss for the period, except for exchange differences
arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are
recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on
the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such cumulative
translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers
against orders received and when title and risk of loss has passed.
Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, and
allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate
rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and historical information and past
experience. 
Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most signiﬁcant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.
In the USA the Group sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and
mail-order pharmacies. The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations,
hospitals, and Group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as “indirect customers” . The Group enters into
agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently
select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices. The Group will provide credit to the
wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price.
This credit is called a chargeback. The provision for chargebacks is based on historical sell-through levels by the Group’s
wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales are made to the large
wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes
that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves.

continued
12751_p99_p152.qxp  27/3/09  22:49  Page 102 2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Returns and rebates In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that
allows selected customers to return the product within a speciﬁed period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in
exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases. 
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and
credit terms. While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an
accurate indicator of future returns.
The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that actual
product returns may differ from established reserves.
Price adjustments Price adjustments, also known as “shelf stock adjustments, ” are credits issued to reﬂect decreases in the
selling prices of the Group’s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.
Decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by Group management to reﬂect competitive market conditions.
Amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon speciﬁed terms with direct customers, estimated
declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers. The Group regularly monitors these and other
factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets,
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
T o the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to ﬁnance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash ﬂow
hedge of interest rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is deferred in equity and released to proﬁt or loss when the
qualifying asset impacts proﬁt or loss. T o the extent that ﬁxed rate borrowings are used to ﬁnance a qualifying asset and are
hedged in an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reﬂect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged
to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease. Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included
in the balance sheet as a capital lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of
the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income
statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.

Research and development
Research and development expenses are fully charged to the income statement, as the Group considers that the regulatory
and other uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38
“Intangible assets” are not met. Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be recognised and
amortised over their useful economic life.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to
state-managed retirement beneﬁt schemes are dealt with as payments to deﬁned contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme.
Tax
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group
operates. Furthermore, the Group computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according to IAS 12 “Income
Taxes” .
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. T axable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the
income statements because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).

Share-based payments
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for
share or rights over shares (“share-based payments”) or in exchange for other equivalent assets. 
The cost of share-based payments’ transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at
which the share-based payments are granted. The equity settled stock options scheme fair value is determined using a
binomial model. The long-term incentive plan fair value is determined using a MonteCarlo valuation model. The expected
life used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations (further details are given in Note 37). In valuing share-based payments,
no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma
Pharmaceuticals PLC. 
The cost of share-based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards
that do not ultimately vest. Where the terms of a share-based payments are modiﬁed, as a minimum an expense is
recognised as if the terms had not been modiﬁed. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the
transaction as a result of the modiﬁcation, as measured at the modiﬁcation date. Where a share-based payments award is
cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is
recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁcation of the original
award, as described in the previous paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based payments is reﬂected as
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment have been valued at cost on acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-
line basis at the following depreciation rates:
Buildings 2% to 4%
V ehicles 10% to 20%
Fixtures & equipment 8% to 33%
Projects under construction are not depreciated until construction has been completed.
Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment which are ﬁnanced by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum
lease payments at the inception of the lease, and depreciated in the same manner as other property, plant and equipment
over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life. 
Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the
impairment loss is taken to the income statement. Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised
impairment loss. 
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their
intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Purchased products are valued at acquisition cost and all
other costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost of own-manufactured products
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, directs labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the balance sheet, inventory is primarily valued at
standard cost, which approximates to historical cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is used to
determine the cost of sales in the income statement. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Provisions are made for inventories with net realisable value lower than cost or for slow moving inventory.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. 
The principal derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option
contracts. The Group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then remeasured at subsequent
reporting dates to fair value. Hedging derivatives are classiﬁed on inception as fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges or net
investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the income
statement, with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash ﬂow hedges are recognised in equity. Amounts deferred in equity
are transferred to the income statement in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash ﬂow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately
in the income statement. 
Investments Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and 
remeasured to their fair values at year-end. Gains or losses on remeasurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders’
equity until the investments are sold, disposed of, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss
relating to these investments previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement. Available for sale ﬁnancial
assets without market prices and the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, less a provision for
any impairment loss, which is taken to the income statement.
The fair value of quoted ﬁnancial assets represents the closing price in the ﬁnancial markets at the date of the ﬁnancial
statements. However, the fair value of unquoted ﬁnancial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing
the fair value of a similar ﬁnancial instrument or through a discounted cash ﬂow method.
Accounts receivable T rade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are
recognised in proﬁt or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the
effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an
accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables T rade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset
with an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be
impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or income-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (income-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The critical accounting policies and 
key estimates are set above.

**Hikma Germany comprises the combined operations of Ribosepharm GmbH and Hikma Pharma GmbH, which were merged during 2008.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may 
be impaired.
Each company is considered as a cash generating unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The recoverable
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations
are those regarding the discount rates and short-term growth rates. Management estimates discount rates using 
W ACC rates that reﬂect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the CGUs. 
The discount rates used varied between 8% and 13%. The short-term growth rates are in line with historical performance
and/or forecast budget with growth rates of 2% in perpetuity. Short-term growth rates used varied between 13% and 26%.
Other intangible assets
Amortisation of all intangibles assets with ﬁnite useful lives is charged on a straight-line basis.
Marketing rights Marketing rights are amortised over their useful lives commencing on the year in which the rights ﬁrst
generate sales.

T ax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised total USD 6,647,000 (2007: USD 4,506,000) due to the
unpredictability of the related future proﬁt streams. These losses may be carried forward for ﬁve years before expiry. 
In addition, there are unused foreign tax credits of USD 10.4 million (2007: USD 5.0 million) for which no deferred tax
asset is recognised due to the unpredictability of the related future dividend streams.
As at 31 December 2008, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to USD 246 million (2007: 
USD 195 million). No income taxes have been provided on the Company’s share of these undistributed earnings due to
management’s ability and intent to reinvest such amounts indeﬁnitely. A determination of the amount of the unrecognised
deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so. A portion of these earnings can be distributed
without incurring additional taxes.

As at 31 December 2007, the Group was in a net current liabilities position and as a result it was in breach of certain
ﬁnancial covenants related to its short-term debt. The breach arose as a result of short-term debt taken out to fund the
acquisition of APM on 27 December 2007. 
The relevant ﬁnancial institution was made aware of this fact prior to the breach and gave its consent. The proceeds of the
equity placing on 17 January 2008 were applied to repay short-term debt and as such the breach was remedied as at the 
31 December 2008, the Group is not in breach of any of its covenants.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its ﬁxtures and equipment under ﬁnance leases. The average lease term is ﬁve years
(2007: ﬁve years). For the year ended 31 December 2008, the average effective borrowings rate was between 3.9% and 7.0%
(2007: between 3.9% and 7.5%). 
29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives
Credit and concentration of risk
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net
of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks in the US, expired goods and without recourse discounts. A provision for
impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction
in the recoverability of the cash ﬂows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with
high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to
clients in Europe and the US. As at 31 December 2008, the Group’s largest three clients in the MENA region represented
respectively 15% of Group turnover (located in Saudi Arabia); 3% of Group turnover (located in Algeria) and 2% of 
Group turnover (located in Algeria). The amount of receivables due from customers based in Algerian market at 
31 December 2008 is USD 32,784,000 (2007: USD 34,979,000) and Saudi Arabia is USD 18,453,000 (2007: USD
13,719,000). The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies and procedures and
certain credit insurance agreements.
T rade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise. Credit limits are set as deemed
appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a
particular customer. The Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging from government backed agencies and large
private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across the Group. Typical
credit terms in the US range from 30– 60 days, in Europe 60–120 days, and MENA 180–360 days. Where appropriate, the
Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade ﬁnance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Market risk
The Group’s objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, ﬂuctuations in earnings and cash ﬂow associated
with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety
of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the USD as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in
Euro and Algerian Dinar. Consequently, where possible the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as
foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

12751_p99_p152.qxp  27/3/09  22:51  Page 124 29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives continued
Interest rate risk
The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is ﬁxed by entering into
interest rate swap agreements. Using these derivative ﬁnancial instruments has not had a material impact on the Group’s
ﬁnancial position at 31 December 2008 or the Group’s results of operations for the year then ended.
The table below shows the split of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, including ﬁnance leases:

Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents – 62,727 62,727 – 28,905 28,905 
An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from
their levels at 31 December 2008, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at
31 December 2008, a 1% increase/decrease in interest rates would result in an additional USD 2.0 million in interest
expense/income being incurred per year. 
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value:
cash and cash equivalents – approximates to the carrying amount;
short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments;
long-term loans – approximates to the carrying amount in the case of ﬂoating rate bank loans and other loans;
forward exchange contracts – based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date; and
receivables and payables – approximates to the carrying amount; and lease obligations – approximates to the carrying value.
Management considers that the book value of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities do not materially differ from their
fair value.
Currency risk
Currency risks as deﬁned by IFRS 7 arise on account of ﬁnancial instruments being denominated in a currency that is other
than the functional currency of the booking entity and being of a monetary nature. 
The currencies that have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group accounts and the exchange rates used are as follows: 
Period end rates Average rates
2008 2007 2008 2007
USD/EUR 1.4097 1.4729 1.4713 1.3707

USD/Egyptian Pound 0.1806 0.1823 0.1833 0.1821

US Dollar.

primarily as a result of repayment of short-term debts during 2008 subsequent to the funds raised.
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had undrawn facilities of USD 120,800,000 of this USD 33,000,000 was committed

12751_p99_p152.qxp  2/4/09  00:05  Page 127 30. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge signiﬁcant future transactions and cash ﬂows. The Group is party 
to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures. 
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was
committed to, are translated at December 31 exchange rates as below.
2008 2007
$000’s $000’ s
Foreign exchange forward contracts and options (Euro) 3,552 1,471
Foreign exchange forward contracts (Yen) 443 578
These arrangements are designed to address signiﬁcant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2008 the fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives all of which are designated as effective cash ﬂow
hedges was an asset of USD 382,000 (2007 liability of: USD 25,000). The movement in fair value resulted in a gain of
USD 407,000 (2007: USD 25,000 net loss) has been reﬂected in equity. These amounts are based on market values of
equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of cash ﬂow hedges of currency and interest rate ﬂuctuations is not
signiﬁcant and will not materially affect the ﬁnancial position of the Group.
Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. 
These contracts have nominal values of USD 22.8 million (2007: USD 23.8 million) and have ﬁxed interest payments at
rates ranging from 3.9% to 4.75% for periods up until 2017 and have ﬂoating interest receipts at LIBOR or EURIBOR. 
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of USD 896,000 (2007: liability of USD 82,000).
These amounts are based on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent
instruments at the balance sheet date. Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash ﬂow hedges and 
the movement in fair value totalling a loss of USD 485,000 (2007: USD loss of 231,000) has been reﬂected in equity. 
The ineffective element of the cash ﬂow hedges are taken to the income statement. A loss of USD 329,000 has been
recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: USD nil). 
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate ﬂuctuations will not materially affect
the ﬁnancial position of the Group.

36. Contingent liabilities
The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling USD 23.6 million 
(2007: USD 17.8 million).
The integrated nature of the Group’s worldwide operations, involving signiﬁcant investment in research and strategic
manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets,
gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the proﬁts on which individual Group
companies are liable to tax. Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in
particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax
jurisdictions, can produce conﬂicting claims from revenue authorities as to the proﬁts to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industries the Group is subject to certain legal and product
liability claims from time to time. Whilst provisions have been made for probable losses that management deems to be
reasonable or appropriate there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates. 
The Group does not expect the resolution of uncertainties to have a material effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

Equity settled share option scheme
During the year ended 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Company had two stock option compensation schemes settled by
equity instruments with three separate grant dates. The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.
Details of the grants under the scheme are shown below:
2008
T ype of arrangement General employee share option plan
Date of grant 29 April, 2008 
Number granted 1,041,500 
Contractual life T en years
Vesting conditions 20% per year for ﬁve years beginning on the ﬁrst anniversary of the grant date
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $2.61. This was calculated
by applying a binomial option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $9.19, exercise price of
$9.19, expected volatility of 31.5%, expected dividend yield of 0.08%, expected average contractual life of 3.8 years, and a
risk-free interest rate of 4.54%. It was assumed that each Option tranche will be exercised within one year of the date of
vesting apart from the ﬁnal Option tranche which will be exercised immediately on vesting given the ﬁve-year time scale.
2005
T ype of arrangement General employee share option plan
Date of grant 13 October 2005

$4.50, expected volatility of 26.2 %, expected dividend yield of 6.67%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free
interest rate of 4.54 %. T o allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options
immediately after vesting date.
2004

Date of grant 12 October 2004
Number granted 9,520,000
Contractual life T en years
Vesting conditions 20% per year for ﬁve years beginning on the ﬁrst anniversary of the grant date

$0.91, expected volatility of 44.8%, expected dividend yield of 3.85%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free
interest rate of 4.22%. T o allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options
immediately after vesting date.

statement as part of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was USD 8.18. 
The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of one to two years. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three
to four years.
Long-T erm Incentive Plan 
During 2008 and 2007 year, the Company granted awards under Hikma Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”) to certain
employees. Under the L TIP , conditional awards of nominal cost share options are made which vest after three years subject
to a total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance condition. This condition measures the Group’s TSR relative to a
comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies. In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for
median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance, with pro-rata vesting in between these points. No awards
vest for performance which is below the median. 
Details of the grants under the plan are shown below:

The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the L TIP is $5.46. This was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo
Simulation methodology for estimation of the fair value. The model inputs were as follows: 
(a) the exercise price of the share award of nil;
(b) the life of the share award of three years;
(c) the current price of the underlying shares on the date of grant of $9.22;
(d) the volatility of the Company’s share returns of 31.47%;

41. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plan
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC has deﬁned contribution retirement plans in two of its subsidiaries: W est-ward
Pharmaceuticals Corp and Hikma Pharmaceuticals Limited – Jordan. The details of each contribution plan are as follows:
Hikma Pharmaceuticals Limited – Jordan:
The Group currently has an employee saving plan wherein the Group fully matches employee’s contributions, which are
ﬁxed at 5% of salary. Employees are entitled to 30% of the Group contributions after three years of employment with the
Group and an additional 10% for each subsequent year. Employees fully vest in the Group contributions after ten years of
employment. The Group’s contributions for the year ended 31 December 2008 were USD 613,000 (2007: USD 618,000).
W est-ward Pharmaceuticals Corp: (401 (k) salary saving plan)
Prior to 2001, W est-ward Pharmaceuticals Corp established a 401 (k) deﬁned contribution plan, which allows all eligible
employees to defer a portion of their income through contributions to the plan. All employees not covered by any collective
bargaining agreement are eligible after being employed for one year. Employees can defer up to 25% of their gross salary
into the plan, not to exceed USD 15,500 and USD 15,500 for 2008 and 2007, respectively, not including catch-up
contributions available to eligible employees as outlined by the Internal Revenue Service. The company matches 40% of the
employees’ eligible contribution. Employer contributions vest 0% after one year of service, 50% after two years of service
and 100% after three years of service. Employees are considered to have completed one year of service for purposes of
vesting upon the completion of 1,000 hours of service at any time during a plan year. Employer contributions to the plan 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 were USD 365,000 (2007: USD 315,000). 
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the
retirement beneﬁt plans is to make speciﬁed contributions.

Directors’ responsibility statement
Governance and ﬁnancial results
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the ﬁnancial statements. The Directors are required to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs)
and have also elected to prepare ﬁnancial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRSs. Company law requires 
the Directors to prepare such ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulations.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s
ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and condition in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements” . In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable
IFRSs. Directors are also required to:
Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs is insufﬁcient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and
ﬁnancial performance.
The Directors responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report and Director’s remuneration report which
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
W e conﬁrm to the best of our knowledge:
The ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the company and the undertakings
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
The Business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

9. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives
Currency risk: Currency risks as deﬁned by IFRS 7 arise on account of ﬁnancial instruments being denominated in a
currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature. The following table illustrates ﬁnancial assets
and liabilities for the Company in different currencies:
Liabilities Assets

$000’s $000’ s $000’s $000’ s
Euro 88 – 162 31

Trade payables (976) – (976)
(196,572) – (196,572)
The Company believes that given the Group’s forecast operating cash ﬂow during 2009, it has the ability to satisfy its liability
commitments.
Interest rate risk
An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from
their levels at 31 December 2008, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at
31 December 2008, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional USD 400,000 in interest expense being
incurred per year.
Further details on how the Company manages the currency risk are given in Note 29 to the Group accounts.

Boiler room scams
The Financial Services Authority has issued a number of warnings to shareholders regarding boiler room scams. Over the
last year many companies have become aware that shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly
known as boiler rooms. These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised to be very
cautious of unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive any
unsolicited investment advice:

Chairman’s statement
Business and Financial Review 
2009	w as	a	y ear	of	tr ansi tion	f or	GoI ndustry	Do v eB id.	F ol lowing	the	global	financial	crisis	in	the	autumn	of	2008,	we	
took	steps	in	the	first	f ew	months	of	the	y ear	to	cut	£6	mil lion	of	annual ised	costs,	ensuring	the	gr oup	w as	able	to

adjusted	EBITDA*	w as	posi tiv e	in	the	second	quarter ,	and	we	del iv er ed	adjusted	pr ofit	bef or e	tax*	in	the	second	hal f .	
I n	S eptember ,	we	str engthened	the	gr oup’ s	financial	posi tion	b y	r aising	£4 .1	mi l lion	(net	of	expenses)	in	cash	thr ough	
the	placing	of	251	mi l lion	new	or dinary	shar es	at	1.8p	per	shar e,	and	b y	con v erting	£4 .5	mi l lion	of	con v ertible	loan	notes	
into 241 million new ordinary shares. 
I n	the	y ear	to	31	December	2009,	the	gr oup	r ecor ded	an	adjusted	loss	bef or e	tax*	of	£1.4	mi l lion	(2008:	adjusted	loss	
bef or e	tax*	£4 .3	mi l lion),	and	a	loss	bef or e	tax	of	£4 . 7	mil lion	(2008:	loss	bef or e	tax	£28.9	mi l lion),	on	Dir ect	Pr ofit	 
of	£25.3	mi l lion	(2008:	£23.2	mi l lion)	and	gr oss	asset	sales	of	£116	mil lion	(2008:	£115	mi l lion).	Ex ceptional	costs	of	 
£2.2	mi l lion	(2008:	£23.8	mi l lion)	r elated	primarily	to	the	cost	cut ting	ex er cise	r ef err ed	to	abo v e	and	r estructuring	the	
group’s debt into equity. The adjusted loss per share* was 0.3p (2008: 1.0p) and the loss per share was 0.8p (2008: 
6.9p)
Board Changes
I n	Ma y ,	the	compan y	announced	the	appointment	of	Jack	R einel t	as	Chief	Ex ecutiv e	Officer .	Jack	has	30	y ears	of	
management and executive responsibility in the Information Technology industry, including software, Internet, database 
and services companies.
In September, we strengthened the Board with the appointment of Max Steinkopf as a Non-Executive Director. Max has 
had over 20 years of experience in mergers and acquisitions, operational management and fund raising.
As previously reported, both David MacNamara and John Allbrook stood down from the Board in 2009; we thank them 
for their contributions.
Employees
We continue to strengthen our global management team, with two key appointments made. In March 2009, Glenn 
B ishop	joined	as	Chief	T echnology	Officer .	Glenn	has	25	y ears’	experience	managing	international	IT	teams	and	
developing complex systems architecture and web-enabled technologies. In January 2010, Mike Sorensen joined as 
Senior Vice President, North American Sales and Corporate Solutions. Mike has over 30 years of experience in sales and 
sales management roles in the corporate software, supply chain and outsourcing markets.
On behalf of the board and the shareholders I would like to thank all GoIndustry DoveBid employees for their sterling 
ef f orts	during	a	v ery	di fficul t	y ear .	B y	continuing	to	pr o vide	the	highest	lev els	of	service	to	our	cl ients,	they	demonstr ated	
their critical importance to the group and they will continue to be a key factor in our future success.
Share consolidation
The board intends to undertake a 1:100 share consolidation of its existing ordinary shares. Further details will be 
included in a notice to shareholders.
Current Trading and Outlook
T r ading	activities	impr o v ed	in	the	second	quarter	of	2009,	f ol lowing	the	late	2008	financial	crisis,	and	ha v e	appear ed	
to	stabi liz e	thr ough	the	r emainder	of	2009	and	into	2010.	T r ading	in	the	first	quarter	of	2010	has	been	in	l ine	wi th	our	
expectations. 
Business volumes were relatively steady throughout 2009, and we are seeing an uptick in activity in 2010, from several 
large corporate clients. Our core strategic focus is on increasing the depth of our relationships and the volume of 
business we undertake with major global manufacturing companies, many of which are seeking to improve their control 
over capital costs and to better utilise their existing asset base. Using our proprietary software, particularly AssetZone 
that is integrated with our online auction engine, these clients are better able to buy, sell, redeploy and value their 
assets. These systems have been at the heart of the group’s capital expenditure programme, and we continue to invest 
in them. We will also continue to serve our other clients, including corporations, insolvency practitioners, asset based 
lenders and dealers.

www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 3 
 
This	is	m y	first	r eport	to	shar eholders	since	joining	GoI ndustry	Do v eB id	as	Chief	Ex ecutiv e.	I	am	pleased	to	be	a	part	of	
this organisation and am very excited by the opportunities. I am fortunate to have an opportunity to lead a talented and 
highly experienced group of employees who are dedicated to growing the business by providing industry-leading services 
throughout the world. Customer satisfaction is high and many customers are interested in a deeper partnership with the 
group.
The	gr oup	is	now	well	positioned	f or	gr owth	and	impr o v ed	pr ofitabi li t y	after	experiencing	extr emely	adv erse	business	
conditions as a result of the unprecedented global economic turmoil in late 2008 and early 2009. We are pleased that  
f or	the	second	half	of	2009	the	business	achiev ed	oper ating	pr ofitabi li t y ,	which	w as	our	top	priorit y ,	and	also	had	
posi tiv e	cash	flow	f r om	oper ations.	W e	wer e	also	able	to	gr ow	Dir ect	Pr ofit	of	the	gr oup	in	2009	to	£25.3	mi l lion	
(f r om	£23.2	mi l lion)	whi le	pr o viding	a	high	qual i t y	of	service	to	cl ients,	despi te	significant	r eductions	of	personnel	and	
consolidation of some operations. 
I n	the	first	half	of	2009,	the	gr oup	r educed	oper ating	costs	dr amatical ly	to	be	able	to	achiev e	pr ofitabi li t y	at	a	r educed	
lev el	of	r ev enues.	I n	the	second	hal f ,	we	str engthened	the	gr oup’ s	financial	posi tion	b y	suc cessf ul ly	r aising	addi tional	
capi tal	of	£4 .1	mi l lion	(net	of	expenses)	and	con v erting	£4 .5	mi l lion	of	debt	into	equi t y ,	r educing	our	inter est	expense	
significantly .	The	impr o v ed	second	hal f	r esul ts,	coupled	with	the	lower	cost	structur e	and	str onger	financial	posi tion,	puts	
the	gr oup	on	a	sol id	platf orm	financial ly	to	gr ow	the	business	and	continue	to	impr o v e	our	pr ofitabi li t y .	
Looking forward, we expect to continue to grow revenues in 2010, primarily from increased corporate customer 
penetration, improvement in asset values, and from an expansion of activity in the insolvency market, where we are well 
positioned. 
We believe that the group has several compelling differentiators upon which we will capitalise:
l
  Our exceptional knowledge of the used equipment market, combined with a broad service offering and global 
coverage, has put us in the forefront of helping large companies to pro-actively manage their surplus industrial 
assets.
l
  We offer them a comprehensive platform to recover value from used assets through our appraisal services, 
our	AssetZ one	r edeplo yment	tool,	onl ine	or	l iv e	auctions,	and	b y	participating	in	our	industry	specific	onl ine	
marketplaces, such as our highly successful BioPharma Exchange.
l
  Typically, our clients can achieve outstanding results through our platform, including Capex savings and cash 
generation from asset sales of several million dollars each year.
l
  Evidence of our success can be found in our winning Supplier Awards from both PepsiCo (2010 Supplier of the 
Year) and Proctor & Gamble (2009 Corporate Supplier Excellence Award) demonstrating GoIndustry DoveBid’s 
industry leadership and commitment to customer satisfaction. 
The global corporate market will continue to be an important area of focus for future growth, providing more recurring 
revenues than the traditional auction business, which is more transactional in nature. In late 2009 and early 2010 we 
made some substantial enhancements to our service offerings for corporate clients, as well as expanding our corporate 
sales team to better penetrate this market. 
Another area of focus is Asia, where we have operations in ten countries and where we had many successful 
engagements	f or	mul ti-national	companies	in	2009	comprising	o v er	£5	mil lion	in	Gr oss	Asset	Sales,	as	wel l	as	local	and	
regional auctions. We have substantially increased our marketing efforts to attract both Asian buyers and sellers, and 
are now seeing much greater participation of Asian buyers in online auctions. In particular, in 2009 we enjoyed excellent 
success in China, holding what we believe are the largest online auctions ever for used industrial goods in that country; 
these	highly	suc cessf ul	auctions	gener ated	o v er	£3	mil lion	in	cash	f or	our	client,	a	global	electr onics	manuf actur er .
GoIndustry DoveBid is committed to continually improve the quality of our services to clients and to improve our 
oper ational	ex cel lence,	efficiency	and	financial	r esul ts.	F or	example,	in	2009	our	gr oup	r eleased	major	upgr ades	to	our	
customer-facing systems to improve the user experience for both new and old customers, including our external website, 
AssetZone redeployment tools, and auction systems. These enhancements continue on a monthly basis, and are an 
important priority in 2010. 
Final ly ,	I	would	l ik e	to	thank	our	customers	and	shar eholders	f or	their	continued	confidence	in	our	business,	and	to	our	
employees for their dedication in providing outstanding services for our customers and improving our group every week. 
I	look	f orw ar d	to	a	suc cessf ul	and	pr ofitable	2010.

Business review 
In addition to the commentary contained in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review, the directors set 
out their review of the business as follows: 
Review of Business Performance
The split of business performance in 2009 shows growth in North America and Asia and a decline in Europe. The year-
on- y ear	gr owth	in	both	North	America	and	Asia	is	due	to	a	combination	of	thr ee	f actors:	the	2008	figur es	only	include	
10 months of results from the DoveBid acquisition; changes in exchange rates; and organic growth.

Financial Review 
As	noted	in	the	Chairman’ s	Statement	and	the	Chief	Ex ecutiv e’ s	R eview ,	the	gr oup	achiev ed	an	adjusted	pr ofit	bef or e	tax	
of	£0.2	mi l lion	in	the	second	hal f	of	2009,	f ol lowing	completion	of	the	cost	r eduction	ex er cise	carried	out,	al though	the	
f ul l- y ear	r esul ts	show	an	adjusted	loss	of	£1.4	mi l lion	(2008:	£4 .3	mi l lion).
The	f undr aising	and	con v ersion	of	debt	to	equit y	in	September	2009	str engthened	the	gr oup’ s	financial	posi tion.	The	
gr oup	ended	the	y ear	wi th	bank	borr owings	of	£3.4	mi l lion	(2008:	£6. 7	mil lion)	dr a wn	against	total	f aci li ties	of	£6.9	
mil lion.	Other	borr owings	comprised	con v ertible	loan	notes	of	£0.5	mi l lion	(2008:	£3.0	mi l lion)	and	subor dinated	loan	
notes	of	£0.5	mi l lion	(2008:	£0.8	mi l lion).	Since	the	end	of	the	financial	y ear	the	gr oup	has	r e-negotiated	i ts	main	bank	
facilities for another year.
Risks and uncertainties
GoIndustry-DoveBid operates in a market where deals are awarded on an individual basis. Although the strength of our 
relationships often mean that customers award deals to the group on a regular basis, there are few guaranteed revenue 
str eams	 and	 i t	 is	 di fficul t	 to	 f or ecast	 the	 business	 r esul ts	 mor e	 than	 a	 f ew	 months	 into	 the	 f utur e.	 Addi tional ly ,	 the	 impact	
of	major	auction	sales	can	be	significant	on	the	gr oup’ s	r esul ts,	al though	our	r egularly	scheduled	Ex change	auctions,	
which	ar e	mainly	sour ced	f r om	corpor ate	f orw ar d	flow	clients,	help	to	mi tigate	this	risk.
An	incr easing	portion	of	GoI ndustry -Do v eB id’ s	gr oss	asset	sales	and	dir ect	pr ofit	is	deriv ed	using	our	IT	inf r astructur e	
and	the	internet.	An y	downtime	in	ei ther	of	these	can	disrupt	sales	in	mid- auction	and	undermine	buy er	confidence.	
Short-term service interruptions can affect sales realisations on individual jobs, whilst long-term service interruptions 
would	material ly	af f ect	the	financial	r esul ts	of	the	gr oup .

Directors’ report continued
One of our key competitive advantages is our database of potential buyers located in over 200 countries around the 
world. Guidelines and regulations about marketing practices and data protection laws vary from country to country and 
can change at short notice. Substantial changes may prohibit us from direct marketing or increase the risk of lawsuits.
There are a number of other organisations that offer similar services to those of GoIndustry-DoveBid. Such organisations 
may be better funded or operate with a lower cost base than GoIndustry-DoveBid. Aggressive competition from such 
or ganisations	could	ha v e	a	negativ e	impact	on	the	financial	perf ormance	of	the	gr oup .
Key performance indicators (KPIs) 
The group measures and monitors a number of performance ratios and statistics, the most important of which are gross 
asset	sales	(GA S),	dir ect	pr ofit	and	pr ofit	bef or e	tax.	
Gross asset sales (GAS) is the sum of the prices of all assets sold at auction or in a negotiated sale. Total GAS in the year

represents the sum of the buyer’s premium, seller’s commission and expenses billed to the seller, less the cost of 
expenses incurred and any commissions paid to third parties.
ii.  Principal sales – In certain circumstances GoIndustry DoveBid acts as principal, either purchasing the equipment 
for sale outright or guaranteeing a minimum price to the seller; this is explained further under Principal deals, 
below .	I n	the	ev ent	of	a	pur chase	deal,	dir ect	pr ofit	r epr esents	the	sum	of	GA S	on	the	job	and	buy er ’ s	pr emium,

of	a	guar antee	deal,	dir ect	pr ofit	r epr esents	the	sum	of	GA S	on	the	job	and	buy er ’ s	pr emium,	less	the	guar anteed	
value of the assets, the seller’s share of any upside realised above the guarantee, expenses incurred and any 
commissions paid to third parties. In both cases, should GAS on the job fall below the purchase or guarantee 
amount	then	it	wi l l	be	deducted	f r om	the	buy er ’ s	pr emium;	if	GA S	is	significantly	lower	we	r ecor d	this	as	a	loss

Future developments
The shifting of industrial production from developed western economies to China, India and the emerging economies 
of Eastern Europe is set to continue for many years. Data published by The Economist shows that 25% of global 
manufacturing output is still produced in North America, and the major economies of the European Union follow close 
behind.
Gr owing	ac ceptance	of	the	internet	as	a	medium	f or	tr ansacting	business	ar ound	the	world	wi l l	also	pla y	a	significant	
part in the future growth of the group, and the group’s regularly scheduled Exchange auctions are a key engine for 
future growth and improved visibility of earnings. 
Principal deals
In certain circumstances, the group will take a principal position in assets that are being offered for sale, either by 
buying them from the seller outright or by guaranteeing a minimum sale price to the seller. The group will then sell those 
assets	on	i ts	own	ac count	and	r ecognise	the	f ul l	financial	impact	f r om	that	tr ansaction.

This	r epr esents	an	addi tional	risk	that	the	gr oup	tak es	on,	in	r eturn	f or	the	expectation	of	a	higher	pr ofit.	GoI ndustry -
DoveBid’s ability to bid for and win principal deals is predicated on continued access to credit facilities. In order to control 
the risks and protect the group from downside exposure, all principal transactions require the approval of an investment 
committee, and transactions above a pre-set amount require the approval of the group’s global investment committee, 
which is made up of both equipment experts from across the group and business professionals.
The expertise of our valuers and appraisers is critical to the success of the group when assessing whether to take a 
principal position. Our global valuation database is a key resource, in addition to the knowledge of the assets and the 
global markets for disposing of those assets held by our valuers and appraisers.

 Directors’ report continued
Corporate Governance
The company is listed on the AIM market and is therefore not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined 
Code. However, the board is committed to ensuring that proper standards of corporate governance operate and has 
established governance procedures and policies that are considered appropriate to the nature and size of the group. 
The board considers that at this stage in the company’s development, the expense of full compliance with the Combined 
Code is not appropriate although it intends, as the company grows, to ensure that it observes the provisions of the Code, 
so far as is practicable.
The	dir ectors	ar e	r esponsible	f or	the	gr oup’ s	and	the	compan y ’ s	system	of	internal	financial	contr ol,	saf eguar ding	the	
assets of the group and the company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. In carrying out their responsibilities the directors have put in place a framework of controls to ensure 
ongoing	financial	perf ormance	is	monitor ed	in	a	timely	and	corr ectiv e	manner	and	risk	is	identified	as	early	as	pr acticably	
possible.	Clear	l ines	of	authorit y ,	r esponsibili t y	and	financial	ac counting	exist	between	the	r elev ant	heads	of	department	
and the directors. The directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Such a system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee is comprised of Neville Davis, David Bailey, Kamal Advani and Max Steinkopf, and is chaired by 
David Bailey. The committee meets not less than three times annually and provides a link between the board and the 
group’s auditors on matters falling within the scope of the group’s audit. These matters include accounting standards 
and	pol icies,	internal	financial	contr ol	pr ocedur es	and	the	gr oup’ s	financial	statutory	r eports,	which	ar e	intended	f or	
publication. A formal statement of independence is received from the external auditors each year.
The Remuneration Committee consists of Neville Davis, David Bailey, Kamal Advani and Max Steinkopf, and is chaired by 
Da vid	B ailey .	The	R emuner ation	Commit tee	tak es	the	f ol lowing	into	ac count	in	determining	the	salaries	and	benefits	of

l
  The need to link individuals to the long-term success of the group through the award of share options with 
amounts allocated determined by importance of the role and performance of the executive concerned

market.
Going Concern 
As	set	out	in	note	2,	the	dir ectors	ar e	of	the	opinion	that	at	the	time	of	appr o ving	the	financial	statements,	the	compan y	
and the group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For 
this	r eason,	they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	in	pr eparing	the	financial	statements.
Dialogue with Shareholders 
The company reports formally to shareholders twice a year, when its half-year and full-year results are announced; 
an Interim Report is made available on our website and an Annual Report is sent to shareholders. The Annual Report 
includes notice of the Annual General Meeting of the company at which a presentation is given and the directors are 
available to take questions both formally during the meeting and informally after the meeting. Management is available 
for dialogue with major shareholders on the company’s plans and objectives and meets with them periodically.
Political and charitable contributions
During	the	y ear ,	the	compan y	and	its	subsidiaries	made	charitable	contributions	of	£2,000	(2008:	£2,000).	The	compan y	
and its subsidiaries made no political contributions during the year (2008: nil). 
Creditor payment policy
The group agrees the terms and conditions under which business transactions with suppliers are conducted. It complies 
wi th	these	pa yment	terms,	pr o vided	that	it	is	satisfied	that	the	suppl ier	has	pr o vided	the	goods	or	services	in	ac cor dance	
with agreed terms and conditions. The average number of days group companies take to pay suppliers, based on trade 
creditors as at 31 December 2009 is 76 (2008: 87).

For the year ended 31 December 2009
www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 15 
 
1. General information
GoIndustry-DoveBid plc (‘the company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the group’) is a global market leader in the 
service, management, and disposal of surplus industrial assets. The group has offices in locations across Europe, North 
America, and Asia.
The company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its 
registered office is 1-6 Lombard Street, London, EC3V 9JU.
The company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GoIndustry-DoveBid plc and all of its subsidiaries made 
up to 31 December each year.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted for use in the EU and IFRIC interpretations as at 31 December 2009 (‘adopted IFRS’) and the 
Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, and have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. The 
areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to 
the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2009
	 l  IAS 1 (revised), “Presentation of financial statements”. The revised standard has introduced terminology 
changes (including revised titles for the financial statements) and changes in the format and content of the 
financial statements. In addition, the revised standard prohibits the presentation of items of income and 
expenses (that is ‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring ‘non-owner 
changes in equity’ to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All ‘non-owner changes in equity’ 
are required to be shown in a performance statement.
   Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the statement of comprehensive income) 
or two statements (the income statement and statement of comprehensive income). The group has elected to 
present one statement: a statement of comprehensive income.
 l  IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’. The group has adopted IFRS 8 “Operating segments” during the period. The 
standard supersedes IAS 14, ‘Segment reporting’ and is effective for the year ended 31 December 2009. IFRS 
8 provides segmental information for the group on the basis of information reported internally to the chief 
operating decision-maker for decision-making purposes. The group considers that the role of chief operating 
decision-maker is performed by the group board of directors. IAS 14 required segmental information to be 
reported for business segments and geographical segments based on assets and operations that provided 
products or services subject to different risks and returns. The adoption of IFRS 8 has not had any impact 
on the performance or position of the group or on the presentation of these financial statements as internal 
reporting is based upon geographical segments.
 l IFRS 2 Share-based payment – amendments relating to group cash-settled share-based payment transactions
 l  IFRS 3 Business combinations – comprehensive revision on applying the acquisition method adopted early by 
the group
 l IFRS 9  Financial Instruments – amendments relating to classification and measurement
 l  IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to 
IFRSs adopted early by the group
 l IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows – amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs
 l IAS 17 Leases – amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs
 l IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures – revised definition of related parties
 l  IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements – consequential amendments arising from 
amendments to IFRS 3 early adopted by the group

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2009
 l IAS 36 Impairment of Assets – amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs
 l IAS 38 Intangible Assets – amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs
 l  IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction 
(endorsed).
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2009 but not relevant
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009 but are not relevant to the group:
 l  IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS – amendments relating to oil and gas assets and determining whether 
an arrangement contains a lease; amendment in relation to the cost of an investment in a subsidiary, jointly 
controlled entity or associate
 l IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – amendment
 l IAS 28 Interests in Joint Ventures – consequential amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3
 l IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation – amendments relating to classification of rights issues
 l IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement – amendments for eligible hedged items
 l  IFRIC 2 Members’ shares in co-operative entities and similar instruments – consequential amendments arising 
from amendments to IAS 32
 l IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements
 l IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programs (endorsed)
 l IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
 l IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owners

statements – Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation’
 l  IAS 40 (amendment), ‘Investment property’ (and consequent amendments to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and 
equipment’)
 l IAS 41 (amendment), ‘Agriculture’.
Going concern
The	gr oup	had	net	curr ent	assets	of	£69	thousand	at	31	December	2009	(2008:	net	curr ent	liabili ties	of	£6,140	
thousand),	gr oss	cash	of	£20, 751	thousand	(2008:	£18,037	thousand)	and	net	cash	after	deducting	borr owings	and	
amounts	due	to	cl ients	of	£150	thousand	(2008:	net	debt	of	£8,658	thousand).	The	dir ectors	ha v e	consider ed	the	
implications for going concern as set out below.
The board remains satisfied with the group’s funding and liquidity position, and in particular notes the significant 
improvement from 2008. The main sources of debt funding are the bank facilities with Barclays Bank plc in the United 
Kingdom, PNC Bank in the United States of America, Hypo Vereins Bank in Germany and the convertible loan notes. The 
group also holds subordinated loan notes that were acquired as part of the acquisition of DoveBid, Inc.
As indicated in note 21 to the financial statements, the group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements from its 
cash and overdraft facilities. Subsequent to 31 December 2009, management has renegotiated the PNC Bank facilities 
to reduce the principal deal facility from $5 million to $3.5 million, with a corresponding increase in the working capital 
facility from $2 million to $3.5 million; the $3 million term loan facility remains unchanged and had a balance of $2.65 
million outstanding at 31 December 2009. In addition to the PNC Bank facilities, the group has facilities with Barclays 
B ank	plc	of	£300	thousand	and	Hypo	V er eins	B ank	of	£300	thousand,	both	of	which	ar e	r epa y able	on	demand.
c102671Book.indb   16 20/5/10   11:45:08 www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 17 
 
The board remains mindful regarding the uncertainties inherent in the current economic climate. The group’s forecasts 
and projections, taking account of reasonable changes in trading performance given these uncertainties, show the group 
operating within its current facilities.
The board has reviewed the bank facilities and believes that they provide sufficient headroom going forward. Forecasts 
reviewed by the board, including forecasts adjusted for worse economic conditions together with appropriate cost 
containment measures already in place show continued compliance with covenants on the PNC Bank facilities. All other 
debt funding is free of covenants. Those forecasts show the group has sufficient working capital facilities.
On the basis of these forecasts, both base case and sensitised as described above, and given the level and repayment 
profile of the facilities, the board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of 
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Investments in associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are included in 
the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.
The group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative post-
acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying value of the investment.
Segment reporting
The group presents segmental analysis by geography. All geographical segments are engaged in providing products or 
services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of 
segments operating in other economic environments. The corporate centre provides support services to the group as a 
whole covering IT, finance, legal and campaign marketing. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to their physical 
location.
Information reported to the group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance is more specifically focussed on the geographical region and not the type of service. 
The group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: North America, Europe, Asia and Corporate. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the group’s accounting policies described in this 
note. Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of central administration costs 
and directors’ salaries. This is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial 
statements	are	presented	in	‘Sterling’	(‘£’),	which	is	the	company’s	functional	and	presentation	currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
c102671Book.indb   17 20/5/10   11:45:08 18 GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 www.go-dove.com
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2009
(c) Group companies
 The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary 
economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
 i.  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
balance sheet;
 ii.  income and expenses are translated at weighted average monthly exchange rates (unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in 
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and all resulting 
exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, 
are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the 
ordinary course of the group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.
The primary business of the group is the provision of services associated with the valuation and sale of used industrial 
equipment. In such circumstances group companies act as an agent on behalf of their clients, and revenues represent 
commissions or fees charged to clients in connection with the provision of these services. Group companies may also 
take a position as a principal whereby they purchase and sell equipment on their own behalf. On these occasions 
revenues represent the percentage ownership of the value of the equipment being sold with the cost of such equipment 
being reported within inventory at the time of purchase and as cost of sales at the time of sale.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group, when the revenues and 
associated costs can be reliably measured and when the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet 
date can also be reliably measured. In addition in the case of principal sales of equipment the group company must have 
transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of those goods, and must retain no significant 
managerial involvement with, nor control over, those goods.
In the case of agency sales a buyer will usually be identified, the sale price agreed and the buyer invoiced on behalf of 
the client before the group invoices the client. Accrued income receivable represents an accrual for such work completed 
on behalf of clients but not yet invoiced to the client. Accruals are estimated based on the expected proceeds from the 
sale of client owned equipment, agreed commission rates and other contractual terms.
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
 The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan 
under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is 
not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and 
compensation.
 The defined benefit plan, the Henry Butcher Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, is operated by GoIndustry UK 
Limited. GoIndustry UK Limited is obliged to make sufficient contributions to an externally administered fund in 
order to satisfy future pension obligations. The Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 January 
2002, and with effect from 31 December 2004 accrual of benefits in the Scheme ceased and active members 
contributed to a defined contribution scheme. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined 
benefit scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value 
of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
 
c102671Book.indb   18 20/5/10   11:45:08 www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 19 
 
 Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
 For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are 
due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
(b) Share-based compensation
 The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-
market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At 
each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity.
 The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the countries where the company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to 
be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred 
income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred 
income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in 
which they are incurred.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2009
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated 
useful lives, as follows:
Buildings 10-25 years 
Vehicles 4 years 
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is 
included in ‘intangible assets’. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of 
an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
 Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. The company allocates goodwill to each geographical business unit.
 Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
(b)  Customer relationships
 Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The 
customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation 
is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship, which is 5 years.
(c)  Brands
 Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The brands have a 
finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-
line method over the expected life of the brands, which is 10 years.
(d) Other intangible assets
 Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use 
the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 3 years.
 In line with IFRS, the group does not recognise internally generated intangible assets arising from expenditures 
such as research, branding or the creation of its customer and equipment databases. Expenditures associated with 
internal systems development and with internally generated goodwill are charged against profit in the period in 
which they are incurred.
Inventories
Inventories comprise used industrial equipment purchased for resale and are stated at the acquisition cost of the assets. 
In some cases dismantling, transportation, or warehousing costs may be incurred, which are added to the inventory 
value. These costs are allocated between the group of assets acquired on a weighted average of the deemed value of 
the assets. Where this allocated cost is in excess of net realisable value the excess carrying amount is written off to 
profit or loss. Borrowing costs are not included in the inventory valuation. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Financial assets
The group’s financial assets comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables comprise trade accounts receivable, accrued income receivable, auction expenses receivable, 
prepayments and other receivables. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. A provision for impairment is established when 
there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of 
the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial 
c102671Book.indb   20 20/5/10   11:45:08 www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 21 
 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss within administrative expense. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, 
it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against ‘administrative expense’ in profit or loss.
Accrued income receivable represents an accrual for work completed on behalf of clients but not yet invoiced. Auction 
expenses represent costs incurred on behalf of and recoverable from clients but not yet invoiced.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, monies held under guarantee, and 
bank overdrafts.
Group companies routinely collect cash from auction sales, the proceeds of which are ultimately payable to the client 
whose assets are being sold. Client money owing is reported within cash on the consolidated balance sheet with a 
corresponding liability reported as amounts due to clients within accounts payable. Client cash that is held together 
with the group’s own cash is reported within own cash on hand and at bank, but if for legal or other reasons it must 
be segregated from company funds it is reported separately as client cash on escrow. Short-term deposits are liquid 
investments that are convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of change in value. 
Monies held under guarantee is cash held in accounts to which the group enjoys legal title, which are used to meet 
specific client liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions for potential future costs such as those arising from the defence of a legal claim are recognised when the 
group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the 
proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (own shares held in trust), the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity 
holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
3. Financial risk management
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest 
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Financial risk management is coordinated at group level and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance.
Market risk
(a) Foreign exchange risk
 The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency 
exposures. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities 
and net investments in foreign operations. In order to reduce the currency risk arising in respect of recognised 
foreign currency assets and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, the group uses direct borrowings in the same

currency. The risk relating to future commercial transactions and recognised liabilities is mitigated through the 
maintenance of cash balances in the same currency.
 The effect of changing exchange rates is regularly monitored by the group and a sensitivity analysis has been 
prepared to show the impact of changes in foreign exchange between Sterling, the United States Dollar and 
the Euro. A decrease of twenty cents in the value of both the Dollar and the Euro would increase consolidated 
loss	before	tax	by	£12	thousand	(2008:	Decrease	£393	thousand)	and	increase	total	equity	by	£5,000	thousand	
(2008:	£5,618	thousand).	An	increase	of	five	cents	in	the	value	of	both	the	Dollar	and	the	Euro	would	decrease	
consolidated	loss	before	tax	by	£1	thousand	(2008:	Increase	£522	thousand)	and	decrease	total	equity	by	£999	
thousand	(2008:	£8,459	thousand).
 Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency.
 The carrying values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in the following currencies:

(b)	 Cash	flow	i nter est	r ate	risk
 Borrowings of the group comprise convertible loan notes issued by GoIndustry-DoveBid plc and bank loans held 
by GoIndustry USA Inc., GoIndustry UK Limited and GoIndustry AG. The group is exposed to cash flow interest 
rate risk only on its bank borrowings as the convertible loan notes attract interest at a fixed rate of 12%. Bank 
borrowings are used mainly for working capital to finance the purchase of assets for resale and therefore are 
generally held only for a short time period.
 Before the purchase of each group of assets a proposal is presented to an investment committee projecting the 
profitability of the investment after the cost of finance and therefore decisions can be taken based upon the 
prevailing interest rate at the time of investment. Due to the short time period for which these assets are held the 
actual finance cost is only likely to fluctuate marginally from the projection. There is also a term loan facility of 
£1,663	thousand	(2008:	nil)	that	is	repayable	over	the	period	to	30	April	2012.

 A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to model the impact on profit before tax of a change in the effective 
interest	rate	for	bank	borrowings.	A	+/-	variance	of	100	basis	points	in	the	effective	interest	rate	would	have	an	
impact	of	£77	thousand	(2008:	£77	thousand)	on	profit	before	tax.	Further	details	on	interest	rate	risk	exposure	
are contained in note 21.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the risk that a counterparty defaults on its liability in relation to financial assets of the group that 
they are holding. The group is subject to credit risk on its bank deposits and trade receivables. Bank deposits are held 
only by institutions rated as investment grade by an independent rating agency; credit exposure is further reduced by 
limiting the proportion of net deposits that can be held by a single institution. Further details regarding the group’s policy 
for the management of trade receivables is set out below.
The table below shows the major counterparties at the reporting date:
In thousands 2009
Counterparty Rating Balance
PNC Bank A 8,289
Barclays Bank plc AA- —
Hypo Vereins Bank AAA 827
LCL AA- 363
HSBC AA 323
Deutsche Bank AAA 246
Other – 10,703
20,751
The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different from the carrying values. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned in note 18, other 
than prepayments, and cash.
Trade receivables management
Exposure to credit risk on trade receivables from commission and principal sales is limited because it is the group’s policy 
not to allow the title to assets to be transferred until payment is received.
Capital risk management
The group manages its capital to ensure that subsidiary operations are able to continue as going concerns, the 
group and relevant subsidiaries remain in compliance with their banking covenants, and the return to shareholders is 
maximised through an appropriate mix of debt and equity funding. The group’s capital structure comprises total equity 
and net debt.
Surplus cash is either reinvested in the business or used to repay debt. The level of debt is monitored through the cash 
flow leverage ratio, which is net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as amounts due to clients, borrowings 
and both convertible and subordinated loan notes less cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA is earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is primarily managed through the maintenance of adequate liquid resources, principally in the form of bank 
deposits. In addition to this, bank facilities to allow financing of working capital are also available in some business units.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and of revenues and expenses during 
the year. Significant items subject to such estimates and judgments include goodwill, the defined benefit pension 
obligation, the equity settled share-based payment charge, and the direct profit margin for principal sales. Actual 
amounts recognised may differ from those estimated. The estimates and assumptions which have a potentially material 
impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
(a) Impairment of goodwill
  The group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable 
amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future 
cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. 
Actual outcomes could vary. See note 16 for further details.
c102671Book.indb   24 20/5/10   11:45:09 www.go-dove.com GoIndustry-DoveBid plc annual report and accounts 2009 25 
 
(b)	 P ost	r etir ement	benefits
 The determination of the defined benefit pension obligation depends upon the selection of certain assumptions, 
which include the discount rate, inflation rate, mortality and expected return on scheme assets. Differences arising 
from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods. See note 22 for 
further details.
(c)  Equity settled share based payments
 The group recognises a charge in profit or loss for the fair value of equity settled share based payments over the 
vesting period. Those instruments vesting in the period are principally options over ordinary shares and the fair 
value of these at the balance sheet date is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. This model is dependent upon 
several assumptions such as the risk free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Actual experience may 
differ from that estimated. Note 23 contains further details on these assumptions.
(d)	 Dir ect	pr ofit	mar gin	f or	prin cipal	sales
 When the group acquires equipment for principal sales an estimate is made of the expected sales value for the 
whole project, and from this a projected margin is calculated. This projected margin is then used to estimate the 
actual margin to be recorded as individual items of equipment are sold. The actual margin achieved may vary from 
this initial estimate. Any incremental losses that are foreseeable at the year-end are provided for, non-foreseeable 
losses and any incremental profits are taken to the income statement in the period in which they occur.

revenue as reported on the Statement of comprehensive income, because the latter can be skewed from one year to the 
next depending on the volume of principal transactions undertaken.

The group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use was determined by 
discounting future cash flows generated from the cash generating units and was based on the following assumptions 
which the board believes to be highly conservative:
•	 Cash	flows 	for	2010	were	forecast	based	on	the	budget	for	2010;
•	 Cash	flows 	for	2011-12	we re	using	forecast	direct	profit	growth	rates	at	7.5%,	and	expense	growth	rates	of	
3.75%.
•	 Cash	flows 	beyond	2012	ar e	extrapolated	using	a	long-term 	growth	rate	of	2.25%;
•	 Central	overheads	are	born e	by	the	CGUs	where	deemed	a ppropriate	by	management	and	allocated	based	on	
management’s best estimates;
•	 Cash	flows 	were	discounted	using	a	rate	of	10%.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2009
It is not practicable or meaningful to produce an analysis of past due trade receivables because the group does not have 
standard credit terms on all its sales. In the majority of auction sales, the group’s receivables form part of the auction 
proceeds that are collected into the client account and settled with the group at the same time as they are settled with 
the client, typically within 4-6 weeks of the auction. However, in more complex cases the payment terms may be linked 
to the dismantling and shipping of an asset from one location to another, such that a drawdown might only be made 
when the assets have reached shipping point. An ageing analysis of trade receivables is shown below:

The group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension plans for UK and overseas employees. Costs relating 
to these arrangements are expensed in full to profit or loss as they occur and are disclosed in note 9.
GoIndustry UK Limited also maintains a defined benefit scheme: the Henry Butcher Pension and Life Assurance Scheme. 
This scheme is closed to new members and with effect from 31 December 2004, active members ceased to accrue 
benefits on a defined benefit basis and salary linkage was broken to their accrued rights. A new money purchase section 
was opened with effect from 1 January 2005 in which existing defined benefit members and new entrants were invited 
to join.

prior to 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by the fair value of those 
instruments. For grants in the current and prior years the pricing models used and inputs into those models were as 
follows:
2009 2008
Valuation method Black-Scholes Black-Scholes
Share price at the date of grant 2p – 10p 3p – 10p
Expected volatility 58.3% – 38.5% 58.3% – 38.5%
Expected option life at grant date (years) 3 3
Risk-free interest rate 1.02% – 4.46% 1.02% – 4.46%
Weighted average fair value per option at the grant date 5p 5p
The calculation of expected volatility is performed taking into account historical movements in the market value of 1p 
ordinary shares in GoIndustry-DoveBid plc.

Notes to the company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2009
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The	compan y	has	elected	to	pr epar e	i ts	financial	statements	in	ac cor dance	wi th	I nternational	Financial	R eporting	
Standar ds	(‘IFRS’)	adopted	f or	use	in	the	EU	as	at	31	December	2009	(‘adopted	IFRS’).	The	financial	statements	ar e	
presented under the historical cost convention.
The accounting policies applied by the GoIndustry DoveBid group are described in detail in note 2 to the consolidated 
accounts. The other important company accounting policies are summarised below.
Loss for the year
The company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and consequently has not presented a 
statement	of	compr ehensiv e	income	f or	the	compan y	alone.	The	compan y	made	a	loss	of	£21,912	thousand	in	the	y ear	
(2008:	£14 ,260	thousand	loss).	Ther e	w as	no	other	r ecognised	income	or	expense	in	the	y ear	(2008:	ni l).
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less any provision for impairment losses.
I n v estments	in	associates	ar e	al l	enti ties	o v er	which	the	gr oup	has	significant	influence	but	not	contr ol,	gener al ly	
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are included in 
the	compan y	financial	statements	at	cost.
2. Financial risk management
The	compan y ’ s	activi ties	expose	i t	to	a	v ariet y	of	financial	risks:	mark et	risk	(including	f or eign	ex change	risk	and	inter est	
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Financial risk management is coordinated at group level and seeks to minimise 
potential	adv erse	ef f ects	on	the	gr oup’ s	financial	perf ormance.
Market risk
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The company’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited as it does not engage in trading activity. The company does 
enter into transactions with overseas group undertakings, but these are denominated predominantly in sterling. Where 
balances with group undertakings denominated in foreign currency do exist these are long-standing and therefore 
changes	in	f or eign	ex change	r ates	do	not	ha v e	an y	impact	on	cash	flows.
(b) Interest rate risk
The	con v ertible	loan	notes	ar e	at	a	fix ed	inter est	r ate	of	12%	and	ther ef or e	the	compan y	is	not	subject	to	cash	flow	
interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Cr edi t	risk	arises	f r om	the	risk	that	a	counterpart y	def aul ts	on	i ts	l iabili t y	in	r elation	to	financial	assets	of	the	compan y	
that they are holding. The company is subject to credit risk on its bank deposits. Bank deposits are held only by 
institutions rated as investment grade by an independent rating agency; credit exposure is further reduced by limiting 
the proportion of net deposits that can be held by a single institution.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is primarily managed through the maintenance of adequate liquid resources, principally in the form of bank 
deposits.

DEVRO’S BUSINESS AT A GLANCE
Our business model
Our business process
Extracting Collagen
Collagen used for casing is taken from 
the hides of carefully selected animals 
– officially approved for human 
consumption.
Applied Technology
The production of collagen casing is a 
complex technological process. Devro 
combines expertise and innovation to 
produce casings that allow our 
customers to make better sausage.
Manufacture 
Devro is a world leader in the 
manufacturing technology of this  
highly sophisticated process. Our 
casings are consistent, reliable and 
versatile to suit the needs of both 
sausage manufacturers and  
consumer preferences.
Why our business exists
Devro’s collagen casings are used to 
manufacture all varieties of sausage. 
Historically, animal intestines were  
used as casings for sausage, but over 
the past 50 years the use of collagen 
casing has increased, as it enables food 
manufacturers to automate production 
and reduce costs. It is better suited  
to contemporary food hygiene and 
traceability requirements, and technical 
specifications can be determined  
in advance. 
What our customers do
Devro’s customers manufacture  
branded and own-label sausage 
products worldwide, reaching 
consumers through retail and food 
service outlets.
How we create value
Devro creates value by converting a  
basic raw material, collagen, from the 
inner layer of cattle and sow hides, into  
a homogeneous gel and extruding it to 
tightly controlled dimensions, before 
being compressed and packed for supply 
to customers. Devro’s manufacturing 
processes are unique, evolved over  
many years of technical development. 
Who we sell to
Devro’s revenue comes primarily from 
the sale of collagen products directly 
to food manufacturers and, in some 
markets, local distributors. Devro sells to 
over 1,500 customers in more than 100 
countries, with a product range in excess 
of 500 individual items, covering eight 
principal types of application. 
Approximately one-third of Devro’s sales 
are in emerging markets and two-thirds 
are in developed markets. Over 100 
Devro employees work in customer-
facing operations as sales and technical 
advisers.
WE USE OUR COLLAGEN 
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE 
CASINGS THA T ARE 
CONSISTENTL Y BETTER 3 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Sales, Marketing & Distribution
Devro products are sold across all 
continents in over 100 countries. We sell 
directly to food manufacturers and via 
agents and distributors.
Customer Products  
to Consumers
Devro’s innovation and casing 
performance allow our customers to 
produce differentiated products for  
the consumer. Our casings consistently 
score highly for appearance, colour, bite 
and overall acceptance in independent 
research and consumer testing.
The market we are in
Devro is one of five significant global 
producers of collagen casings in the 
world market, with a number of smaller 
local or regional competitors. Additional 
value is created for the customer  
by collaborating with specialist food 
machinery manufacturers and suppliers 
of food ingredients, to optimise  
product performance.
What makes us different
Devro differentiates itself from 
competitors by developing innovative 
new products, by working closely  
with customers to enhance their 
manufacturing efficiencies, and by 
providing high-quality technical  
support to customers.
Why our customers 
choose Devro
Getting the balance
To satisfy our customers’ 
demands, we use our knowledge 
of how to manipulate the  
complex chemistry of collagen  
to balance the requirements  
of food producers for  
strength and size stability  
with consumer preferences  
for tenderness and bite.  4 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

UNDERSTANDING  
OUR MARKETS
Introduction
There have been many improvements in edible 
collagen casing over the past 50 years; some as  
a result of technical developments and others as  
a result of improved plant manufacturing systems. 
The significant investment over many years by 
Devro has enabled the provision of a unique, 
modern edible collagen casing that runs more 
efficiently on sausage production lines at much 
higher speeds and produces products that are 
widely accepted by consumers. 
Today, Devro products are sold by our dedicated 
commercial teams, in association with our experienced 
distributor network, to over 100 individual markets 
and are used in the production of a huge variety  
of regional and national sausage types.
Maintaining a detailed understanding of our markets 
and our customers has been, and continues to be,  
a key aspect of our business philosophy. 
Growth
Cost savings opportunities for sausage producers 
and consumer acceptance continue to drive strong 
demand for edible collagen casings. 
Over the past ten years there has been a steady 
increase in the global market share of edible 
collagen casing used in sausage production.
Trends
There are numerous social and demographic factors 
that are contributing significantly to the growth in 
the consumption of sausage, and consequently an 
increased growth in the use of edible collagen casings, 
across both developing and emerging markets.
The growth in global population is a key driver, 
particularly in relation to the rapid increase  
in the rate of urbanisation. Consumers are  
being exposed to a much wider choice and  
better availability of sausage within the urban 
environment, compared to those who are  
living in rural areas.
The global population living in an urban environment 
has surpassed that of rural and is forecast to continue 
to rise steeply. This urbanisation trend contributes 
significantly towards improved living standards and 
rising incomes which in turn influence the affordability 
of sausage and processed meat products.
The improvement in the availability of sausage and  
processed meat products gives rise to increased  
average meat consumption across both developing 
and emerging markets.
A GLOBAL 
FOOTPRINT IN 
CHANGING TIMES
From our creation over 50 years ago,  
Devro has evolved into an established 
leading supplier of edible collagen  
casing throughout the world.

Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) 
EMEA continues to be a major market for the use  
of edible collagen casing and remains a market 
where there is excellent potential for future growth, 
including further conversions of animal intestines 
(gut) to edible collagen casing. Many regions within 
Western Europe, including Germany, are highly 
developed, sophisticated and mature markets  
for sausage manufacture. However, traditional 
techniques are still widely employed, and many  
of the premium products remain in gut. As Devro’s 
new generation of edible collagen products are 
introduced, more and more producers and retailers 
are looking closely at the savings to be made by 
converting to edible collagen casings.
Asia/Pacific
In Asia and the Pacific region, growth in the use  
of edible collagen casing continues strongly. The 
fastest growing market, and now the largest single 
edible collagen casing market, is China. Use of the 
product has grown considerably, primarily due  
to the increase in urbanisation and the growing 
popularity for Western-style sausage. The need  
for efficient manufacturing of quality sausage has 
driven producers to explore more urgently the 
benefits of edible collagen casing.
Americas
The Americas remains a strong market for edible 
collagen casing, particularly small calibre sausage 
production in North America. Rapid growth in 
demand in a number of Latin American countries 
continues, driven by increasing meat consumption 
and improving economic conditions.

What we did in 2013
In a year when revenue was broadly flat, 
Devro had some notable successes in 
key strategic markets.
Germany
Volumes sold in Germany increased  
30% as we continued to introduce our 
premium Select range to manufacturers 
of wiener sausages and Devro Stix 
casing was strongly promoted to the 
snack sector, following a change in 
distribution arrangements and a more 
focused approach to customers. Sales 
revenues from the German market  
have doubled since 2010.
Latin America
Increased product availability and sales 
activity enabled a 23% annual growth in 
sales to the Latin American market in 2013. 
Since 2010, volumes to the region have 
increased 61% whilst the average price 
has grown 12%. Appointment of a new 
sales director in 2012 and additional Czech 
capacity have supported this growth.
 
Japan
Volumes grew in Japan following  
the expansion of capacity in Australia, 
enabling more supply and inventory 
build in Tokyo, and the promotion  
of advantages of collagen over gut,  
led by a recently appointed General 
Manager and stronger sales team.  
Sales volumes in Japan have more  
than doubled since 2010.
China 
Volumes continued to increase as we 
built our market presence, sourcing  
from capacity in Scotland and the  
Czech Republic and building upon  
the relationships developed by the  
new Beijing sales team since 2011.
South East Asia
Additional Czech capacity and specific 
product enhancements supported 
volume growth.
Co-extrusion gel
Following capacity expansions at the 
South Carolina plant in 2012 and 2013, 
we have supported key accounts in the 
USA as they use collagen gel to convert 
from cellulose casing.

What we did in 2013
Established a global approach  
to R&D worldwide
During the year, a focused group of  
R&D specialists was brought together  
to prioritise and co-ordinate near-term 
product developments around the  
world and to allocate resources for 
longer-term product development.
Significant developments
Development of a Fresh Select product 
for the UK market, with greater clarity 
and translucency, attributes that 
customers normally associate with gut.
Extension of our FINE Processed product 
range for Bratwurst applications. 
Line speed and raw material processing 
have both progressed further in the year.
Knowledge capture
Working with a leading UK university,  
we are undertaking a major programme 
of systematically recording and 
documenting our unique knowledge, 
developed over the past 50 years. MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE
We monitor our performance against  
our strategic objectives by means of key 
performance indicators (KPIs). The most 
important of these KPIs at a group level 
focus on the following areas:
Key Performance Indicators
Sales volume growth* Revenue growth*
Operating profit* Return on capital employed*
Operating profit before exceptional items (£m) 
While the group aims to take a long-term perspective on 
shareholder value, it also monitors the financial performance of 
each of its businesses in the shorter term. The KPI used in this 
monitoring process is operating profit before exceptional items. 
This measure is used to evaluate the performance of each business, 
including sales price, manufacturing efficiency and overhead and 
operating cost control.
*  Continuing operations, and restated for new pensions accounting rules (IAS 19R) where relevant.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) represents operating profit 
before exceptional items as a percentage of average capital 
employed. Capital employed is defined as fixed assets plus current 
assets less current liabilities, excluding all balances related to 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, any derivative financial 
instruments, any deferred tax balances, and any pension assets  
or liabilities. It is a key indicator of how the company is making use 
of its available capital, and is a good reflection of the performance 
of the company in terms of both earnings and cash flow.
Operating profit before exceptional  
items/average capital employed (%)
A key element underpinning the group’s strategy is to deliver growth in sales revenue. There are several components to revenue growth, including changes  
in sales volumes and in price/mix. As a result, the group monitors sales volume growth separately, and changes in price/mix are monitored through revenue  
growth. Devro sells to markets around the world from strategically located commercial operations and through an extensive network of distributors and agents. 
Revenue is monitored on the basis of operating segments as follows: Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe.

various ways at a local level. At group level, it is measured by the 
rate of injuries requiring treatment by a health professional, which 
is calculated as the number of injuries per million hours worked.
The principal measure used to monitor the strength of the group’s

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Steve Hannam
DURING THE YEAR, WE MADE MAJOR 
NEW INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHICH 
WILL FURTHER DEVELOP OUR GLOBAL 
MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT.
Devro made considerable progress in 2013, despite 
a more difficult trading background, as we completed 
the upgrade at our world-class facility in the Czech 
Republic and established the programme of 
investment at our plant in the USA. In addition,  
we have now announced plans to invest £50 million 
to build a manufacturing plant in China. These key 
investments will ensure Devro is in a strong position 
to benefit from the significant opportunities in the 
growing global casings market, and the increase in 
the dividend reflects the Board’s confidence in the 
group’s strategy and its future prospects.
Financial highlights
Profits were maintained despite, as previously 
announced, a number of challenges during the first 
half of 2013, including slow demand in some of our 
key markets, manufacturing issues in the USA and  
a sharp rise in raw material costs. However, in the 
last six months of the year Devro achieved an uplift 
in earnings. Although sales were slightly behind 
prior year levels, we benefitted from price increases 
introduced earlier in the year and also from some 
stability returning to the market for hides, our main 
raw material. Production volumes increased by a 
further 11% compared to 2012, generating improved 
profitability whilst enabling us to build inventories 
ahead of the current year.
Earnings per share for the year has shown growth 
over the past six years, with an increased proportion 
of group profits now coming from the Czech Republic, 
where we benefit from a relatively low tax rate.
Strategic outlook
During the year, we concluded a review of our 
five-year plan and made major new investment 
decisions which will further develop our global 
manufacturing footprint. This will better position 
the business for continued growth for the future.
Over the past three years Devro has invested  
£70 million in upgrading technology and creating 
20% additional capacity. We are now moving into  
a new phase of targeted strategic investments  
to reduce our manufacturing cost per unit and  
to extend our reach into emerging markets.
In November 2013 we announced a £40 million 
investment at our plant in South Carolina, USA,  
in order to reduce manufacturing costs from 2016, 
with full benefits of c. £8 million per annum from 
2017. The project is progressing well with the 
relevant permits now approved, contracts for  
the civil work signed and plans to break ground  
this month. 17 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
On 4 March 2014 we announced that we have 
approved plans to establish a manufacturing plant 
in China, which is now the world’s biggest collagen 
casing market. We will build a new facility in Nantong, 
near Shanghai, with work planned to start in the 
first half of 2014. This investment of £50 million 
over two years will see commissioning during  
2015, with space to expand in line with future 
market demand.
These two projects represent an unprecedented 
level of investment for Devro and demonstrate both 
the Board’s confidence in the opportunities before 
us, and the company’s ability to address them. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 6.10p  
per share (2012: 5.85p) bringing the total for the 
year to 8.8p per share (2012: 8.5p), an increase of 
4%. Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in April, the dividend will 
be paid on 16 May 2014 to those on the register  
on 28 March 2014. 
Employees
Our employees are key to Devro’s success and,  
on behalf of the whole Board, I pay tribute to them 
and thank them for their efforts across our global 
business. The challenges of 2013, and the changes 
across the group, required considerable 
commitment from our people. 
I believe that Devro has a highly skilled, motivated 
workforce ambitious for future success. To ensure 
we use this talent pool and have the right resources 
in place as the company grows, we are continuing 
our programme of employee development.
Board
In July 2013, we strengthened the Board further 
with the appointment of Gerard Hoetmer as a 
Non-Executive Director. A Dutch national, Gerard 
brings a wealth of experience of the international 
food sector.
Our Senior Independent Director, Paul Neep,  
was appointed in 2005 and therefore has served  
as a director for nine years. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code requires that Paul’s independence 
is confirmed by the rest of the Board, if he is to 
continue as an Independent Director. This they 
have done and we are delighted that Paul will 
continue his valuable service to the group.
At the AGM in April I shall have completed five 
years as Chairman of Devro plc. During this period 
we have seen a recovery in the business, an 
upgrading and expansion of manufacturing, the 
launch of new products, the strengthening of the 
Board and a further increase in the professionalism 
of the company. Our recently completed five-year 
plan has established the foundations on which we 
will build an exciting future for Devro. Personal 
circumstances dictate that this is an appropriate 
time for me to stand down as Chairman and  
I shall relinquish the post as soon as a suitable 
replacement can be appointed. Paul Neep, as 
Senior Independent Director, is leading the search 
process and an announcement will be made once 
the new Chairman has been appointed. 
Outlook
We expect growth in total sales in 2014, particularly 
in Germany, China, Japan and parts of Latin 
America. The outlook for other important markets, 
such as the UK, Russia, USA and Australasia, is less 
clear. In order to limit any further increase in the 
inventory levels that had been increased during 
2013 in anticipation of stronger demand in 2014, 
Devro will lower production volumes during the 
year to balance short-term supply and demand. 
Currency is also likely to have a negative impact  
on results in 2014 with the strengthening of sterling 
and other currency changes. If the 2013 operating 
profits had been translated at current exchange 
rates they would have been approximately  
£5 million lower.
Looking further forward the Board remains confident 
in the opportunity for supplying a dynamic and 
growing global market for edible casings. Our 
major capital investment programme involves 
installing high-technology equipment in the USA  
to reduce manufacturing costs and building new 
capacity in China to supply a significant part of  
the global market. These projects will progress  
our plan to transform Devro’s global manufacturing 
footprint and, together with our investment in 
research & development and people, will position 
us well to compete in the market and create 
long-term growth.

Profits were maintained, despite raw material  
cost increases and challenging conditions in some 
markets. As a result of these activities, Devro is 
building a sound base for growth in the future.
Market overview and Devro’s strategy
During 2013, the global market for edible collagen 
casings grew by 7%, and the total value of the 
market worldwide is now estimated to be 
approximately £650 million. 
In emerging markets, the total volume of casings 
sold increased by 10%, most markedly in China, 
South East Asia and Latin America. This occurred 
as the result of a growing urban population, with 
higher disposable incomes, consuming greater 
quantities of protein per person.
In many developed markets, the demand for edible 
collagen casings was flat or declining for a variety 
of reasons. In the USA, total volumes of sausage 
sold increased by 2%. In the UK, although total 
sales value increased, actual volumes of sausage 
sold declined 5% over the two year period 2012-
2013, attributable to the rise of pork prices to 
all-time high levels. Demand in Western Europe  
was subdued, as a result of the general economic 
climate adversely affecting consumer spending 
patterns, particularly during the first half of the 
year. The market in Japan improved in 2013, but 
Australia saw a decline in volumes of processed 
sausage consumed and therefore a lower demand 
for collagen casings.
Devro’s strategy is to ensure that the business  
is well-positioned to supply growing demand in 
emerging markets, to continue to displace gut  
with more efficient casings in developed markets, 
and to lead the category worldwide with product 
innovations such as Select casings and co-extrusion 
gel. This strategy will ensure that Devro continues 
to grow long-term sales.

CHINESE MARKET. 19 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Devro sales in 2013
Overall sales volumes were marginally down,  
with emerging markets growing 6%, offset  
by developed markets, which reduced by 5%.
Emerging markets now account for 41% of total 
sales, up from 38% in 2012. Volumes increased 
most significantly in Latin America (volume +21%; 
local currency value +22%), South East Asia 
(volume +16%; local currency value +25%) and 
China, which grew rapidly from a low base. In all 
these markets, strong support for local distributors 
and greater availability of product in the second 
half of the year enabled further growth.
Sales volumes in Eastern Europe, Russia and 
Ukraine fell by 9% reflecting subdued demand 
compared to previous years, higher levels  
of competitor activity and, in some markets,  
a reaction to Devro’s price increases at the  
start of the year. 
Developed markets now account for 59% of total 
sales. Whilst overall sales were 5% down on 2012, 
there was an impressive increase in sales in 
Germany, with both volume and revenue in local 
currency up 30%. This growth came from activities 
to promote Select casing for wiener sausage 
applications, a new Bratwurst casing, and growing 
use of the standard FINE product range. Germany 
is a key market for developing Devro’s sales.
Sales volumes in Japan increased 6% as the 
demand for Select and Devro’s regular casings 
remained strong. Availability of product increased 
with the completion of capacity upgrade projects 
at Devro’s plant in Australia at the end of 2012.
UK and Australia/New Zealand sales volumes  
both reduced, by 6% and 9% respectively, in  
part reflecting lower market demand, but also  
due to significant cost pressures on customers.  
Sales volumes in USA and Canada were down 6%, 
where manufacturing challenges restricted 
capacity available for sale.
One example of developing innovative products  
is our co-extrusion gel business which expanded 
during the year, principally attributable to a key 
customer bringing on additional capacity in the 
Americas as they transfer from cellulose 
applications to collagen co-extrusion.
Overall, in constant currency, the price per unit  
of edible collagen sold increased by 2%. In some 
markets prices were raised to recover input costs, 
in others they were held constant in order to retain 
volumes, particularly in instances such as Japan 
where exchange rates changed significantly. The 
overall average price was also affected by changes 
in market, product and customer mix. 
Manufacturing in 2013
The highlight of 2013 was the completion, on 
budget and on time, of a three-year, £25 million 
investment project at our plant in Jilemnice in the 
Czech Republic. This added 9% to the group’s  
total manufacturing capacity and will lead to 
further unit cost reductions at this site, which has 
now benefitted from over £100 million of capital 
expenditure in the past decade. 
The factory in Bathurst, Australia manufactured 
higher volumes than the prior year following  
a partial upgrade during late 2012, enabling 
increased supplies to key markets in Asia.
Both factories in Glasgow, Scotland ran well, 
benefitting from recent capital investment  
projects and an ongoing programme of  
continuous improvement which is being 
implemented at all plants.
The plant at Sandy Run, South Carolina, USA,  
which is 35 years old and uses a markedly different 
technology to our other factories, tends to 
experience more operational difficulties. This  
was particularly evident in the first half of the year 
and total group operating profit for the year was 
adversely impacted by an estimated £2 million.  
The £40 million investment project is based on  
the well-proven and dependable manufacturing 
technology used at our plants in Europe, and is 
expected to give cost savings of c.£8 million per 
annum, which will start to come through from  
mid 2016. 20 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
(continued)
Since the announcement in November 2013, this 
project has progressed well. Permits have been 
approved, contracts for the civil work have been 
signed and we expect to break ground this month. 
A global project team, including colleagues from 
the USA, UK and Czech Republic, has been 
established to harness the expertise and 
knowledge that have been built over many  
years of successful investment projects.
As in 2012, the biggest challenge to manufacturing 
operations was the rise in hide costs, with a total 
increase of £4 million during the year. This is due to 
an increase in the overall global demand for food 
grade collagen from trusted sources of cattle hides.
Group activities
Safety is a priority and the overall group 
performance reflected further progress in 2013, 
with the number of days lost due to injury at work 
being the lowest recorded since 2000. Devro 
Scotland had a particularly commendable year 
where, with over 500 employees, there were no 
lost working day injuries nor working days lost due 
to an incident in previous years, and the rate of 
recordable incidents per million hours worked was 
the lowest ever seen at Devro.
The successful management of a five-year product 
development pipeline is the key to supporting 
future growth of the group. A global Research & 
Development team has been brought together 
from existing resources during 2013 to ensure that 
the whole group benefits from product innovations 
and that all development resources are used to 
best effect. 
One new product to emerge from this is Fresh 
Select, which will be introduced to customers in the 
UK in 2014. Fresh Select is based on our successful 
Select technology, achieving high levels of clarity 
and translucency in its appearance, attributes that 
DEVELOPED MARKETS
INVESTMENT
IN THE USA
Background
The USA & Canada market  
for all sausage casings is 
estimated to be in excess  
of £80 million in value. Edible 
collagen casings are used  
for three types of sausage: 
processed, snack stick and  
dinner sausage. Skinless hot  
dogs manufactured using 
cellulose remain a very large  
part of the category. Branded 
products lead the market.
Currently Devro has a 35% share 
of the market, employing over 
400 people and supplying 398 
customers in North America, 
including the major brands. 
Devro’s plant at Sandy Run, 
South Carolina is now 35 years 
old and uses a markedly different 
technology to our other factories. 
As a result it tends to experience 
more operational difficulties, 
which was particularly evident  
in the first half of 2013. 21 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
customers normally associate with gut. These are 
combined with high elasticity and wall strength, 
whilst having a thin wall which gives a light bite.
Following a programme launched in 2012 to establish 
a single global Devro marque, the benefits of the 
strong brand were evident at the triennial IFFA show, 
the meat industry’s biggest international gathering, 
which was held in 2013 at Frankfurt Messe. 
People
The commitment and dedication of over 2,000 
colleagues at Devro is critical to the group’s 
success. Eleven people completed the Open 
University Business School Certificate in 
Management on a course specifically tailored to 
Devro’s needs. The Devro Academy consolidated 
the group’s proprietary knowledge in a programme 
facilitated by Strathclyde University. Five people 
completed their apprenticeships in 2013. 
Worldwide 20 people are on accredited 
apprenticeship and technical skills development 
programmes. 
At the end of 2013, Graeme Walford joined the 
Executive Board, principally to take responsibility 
for the group’s major capital investment projects. 
He brings over 30 years’ experience of engineering 
and project management in global businesses.
During 2012 and 2013 a strong team covering sales, 
finance and human resources has been recruited  
in China, to lead the development of Devro’s 
presence there.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
(continued)
Background
China’s economy has grown strongly over the past 
decade, with increasing demand for many types  
of protein: beef, dairy, poultry, fish and pork. As 
urbanisation has progressed and disposable incomes 
have increased, the per capita consumption of sausage  
has grown significantly and it is estimated that half  
of the global demand for edible collagen casings  
will be in China from 2015. This growth in protein 
consumption has led to the development of many  
major food manufacturing businesses in China.
Devro has been active in China since the early 1990s, 
selling imported product through a Hong Kong sales 
office. In 2011 a Devro sales company was established  
in Beijing, with a local team that has developed strong 
customer relationships and increased sales in China. In 
December 2013, Devro registered a new manufacturing 
company in China and land has now been secured in an 
industrial development park, in Nantong, near Shanghai, 
for the construction of a new collagen casings plant.
The investment opportunity
The collagen casings market in China is estimated to have  
a value in excess of £200 million and has grown by more 
than 40% per annum on average since 2002. Following 
substantial market research and ongoing discussions with 
current and potential customers, it is clear that there are 
attractive opportunities for Devro to gain a greater share  
of this growth. We expect to achieve this through sales  
of differentiated casings to food manufacturers, as the 
various market categories, including premium products,  
are developed. 
We now have plans to construct a manufacturing plant in 
China in 2014 and expect lines to be commissioned during 
2015 for production in 2016. The priorities will be to ensure 
that local raw materials can be successfully converted into 
quality casings, and to establish a local management team 
capable of expanding the business in the future.
This initial investment provides the necessary infrastructure 
for the future and is expected to provide an internal rate  
of return of 13% as the business attains sufficient scale to 
operate efficiently, and the ability to supply larger volumes 
enables us to develop valuable customer partnerships.  
We would expect substantial growth in earnings from  
this market in the long term.
Additional debt funding will be sought in the first half  
of 2014 to fund this investment in China.

Price rises were implemented in 2013 and 
successfully recovered the significant increases 
in input costs, although this may have held back 
volume growth. These price increases were 
particularly focused on low margin business.
Exchange rate movements were adverse to last

Price/mix
The price rises implemented in 2013 have more 
than recovered the input cost increases this year, 
which has helped to recover part of the shortfall  
in 2012. This was partially offset by the adverse  
mix effect as a result of a higher proportion  
of the group’s sales volumes now being sold  
into emerging markets such as Latin America  
and China. 
Manufacturing efficiencies
Devro has expanded output by 11% during the  
year following the completion of the upgrade 
programme in the Czech Republic, as well as  
the full year effect of investments in Scotland  
and Australia in 2012.
The manufacturing efficiencies reflect the lower 
unit cost of production as the group’s fixed 
overheads are absorbed over higher production 
volumes. Given the broadly flat sales volume 
growth, the increased production volumes resulted 
in higher inventory levels at the end of the year.
Within the USA, there continue to be some 
challenges in manufacturing, which negatively 
impacted the results but will be addressed by the 
new US investment programme already initiated.
Foreign exchange
Devro has operations around the world in multiple 
currencies. The net foreign exchange gain in 2013 
can be analysed as follows: 
£’m
Exchange rate movements (3.3)
Hedging gains 4.0
Net foreign exchange gain 0.7
Sterling has generally strengthened over the course 
of the year which has resulted in exchange losses  
of £3.3 million. This has been mitigated in 2013 
through gains on forward contracts used to hedge 
this exposure, but will adversely impact 2014.
Input and other costs
Input costs rose by £4.0 million reflecting the 
second year of significant increases in hide and 
energy costs. However these have been more  
than recovered through higher selling prices.
Further depreciation of £2.0 million was incurred 
following the capital investment programme 
undertaken in the last three years, including the 
capacity expansion in the Czech Republic which 
was completed in the second half of 2013. Other 
costs increased by £2.7 million mainly due to wage 
and salary inflation.

to invest in the business.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
(continued) 25 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Exceptional items
Exceptional items amounted to £1.3 million and 
reflect the incremental costs of establishing new 
manufacturing plants in USA and China. Given  
the significance of these projects, these costs  
have been shown separately to avoid distorting  
the underlying results and include accelerated 
depreciation, project management, product 
development, reorganisation costs, legal and 
professional fees. The projects are part of a two 
year development plan of the group’s global 
manufacturing footprint and further exceptional 
costs will be incurred in 2014 and 2015.

completed on time and on budget.
Capital expenditure in 2014 and 2015 will be 
significant, including £40 million related to  
the USA investment and £50 million in respect  
of China. This is in addition to approximately  
£15 million of ongoing replacement and 
improvement capital expenditure per year.

Inventory levels have grown significantly during  
the year and reflect the 11% increase in production 
levels compared to the relatively flat sales volumes. 
At the start of 2013, inventory levels were 
particularly low for certain regions and this has  
now been addressed. The higher stock will allow 
the business to better service its customers and 
was increased in anticipation of further sales 
growth in 2014, particularly in emerging markets 
such as China. 
Cash outflow from exceptional items amounted  
to £1.1 million for 2013 (2012: £nil).
Financing and net debt
Other financial measures (all shown before 
exceptional items) are as follows:

Gearing 22.7% 17.8%
Return on capital employed 
(ROCE) 17.6% 19.1%
Net debt increased during the year principally 
reflecting the capital investments made, but also 
funding the short term increase in inventory levels.
The bank revolving facility was increased by  
£10 million in June 2013 to £61 million and levels  
of debt were well within these limits throughout  
the year.
In order to fund the planned investment in China, 
additional debt funding will be sought in the first 
half of 2014. The intention is for the business  
to maintain a prudent level of gearing and any 
additional debt assumed is not expected to  
impact future dividends.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) reduced from 
19.1% to 17.6% which reflects the significant capital 
investments made in the business, the full benefits 
of which have yet to be realised. 26 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

The net finance cost on pensions has been 
calculated for both 2013 and 2012 under the new 
pensions accounting rules of IAS 19R. The small 
increase over 2012 reflects the increase in the 
opening net pension liability. 
Change in pensions accounting
The restatement under the new pensions accounting 
rules (IAS 19R) involved the reclassification of 
administration costs of the defined benefit pension 
schemes from finance expense to operating profit 
and a change in the calculation of the interest 
income on plan assets, which is now calculated 
using the same rate used to calculate the interest 
expense on the pension liability, being the discount 
rate. Previously interest income on plan assets was 
calculated using a rate based on the expected 
returns on the various asset types held within the 
investment portfolio. Details of the restatement  
are disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements.
We operate a number of defined benefit schemes 
around the group, although all of these are now 
closed to new entrants. The net pension liabilities  
of these schemes can be analysed as follows:

increase in discount rates. The group has also made 
additional contributions of £4.6 million during the 
year to fund the deficit.

at varying rates. The overall rate has reduced partly 
as a result of an increasing proportion of our profits 
being generated in the Czech Republic where there 
is a benefit from an investment incentive scheme 
that is due to continue until 2016/2017, whilst the 
proportion of profits earned in locations with 
higher tax rates has declined. Additionally the 
group benefitted from certain one-off tax credits 
during 2013 that contributed 5% to the overall 
reduction in the effective tax rate.

Risks and uncertainties
There are risks and uncertainties inherent in the 
group’s operations which could have a significant 
impact on our business, results and financial position. 
The group’s risk management processes identify, 
assess, monitor, manage and mitigate the risks 
involved in our operations. The more significant 
risks to which the group is exposed are:
• Loss of market share/profit margins due  
to increased competitive pressures
• Delays or cost overruns on major projects
• Disruption to supply or increase in price of  
key raw materials
• Product contamination
• Foreign exchange rate movements
• Shortage of people with relevant technical 
expertise
• Customer credit risks
• Impact of changes in regulations affecting  
food production
• Increases in energy costs
• Increased funding requirements of  
pension schemes
• Development of non-casing technologies
• Constitutional change
Most of these risks were detailed in the  
2012 Annual Report.
Going concern
As at 31 December 2013 the group was operating 
comfortably within the £61 million revolving bank 
facilities negotiated in June 2013 and due to expire 
in September 2016.
In order to fund the planned investment in China, 
additional debt funding will be sought in the first 
half of 2014.
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company and  
the group have adequate resources to continue  
in operation for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
There are risks and uncertainties inherent in the group’s 
operations which could have a significant impact on our 
business, results and financial position.
The group has established risk management processes  
to monitor, manage and mitigate the risks involved in  
our operations. 
The Board has established a committee specifically to address 
the risks to which the business is exposed. This committee, 
which consists of the executive management of the group, 
met four times in 2013. The responsibilities of the committee 
are to identify the most significant risks facing the business, 
and to develop policies and actions to mitigate such risks. 
Particular attention is paid to those risks which may have  
an impact on the achievement of group strategy. Senior 
managers throughout the group are consulted to identify 
likely risks.
Details of the most significant risks faced by the group are  
set out on pages 28 to 31. This year we indicate where the 
Board has “appetite” for risk. At its simplest, risk appetite  
can be defined as the amount of risk on a broad level, that  
a company is prepared to take on in the pursuit of value.

Loss of market share/
profit margins due to 
increased competitive 
pressures
The group operates  
in competitive markets 
throughout the world. 
High A major change in the production 
capacities, pricing policies or 
behaviour of our competitors,  
or consolidation between either 
competitors or major customers, 
could have a significant adverse 
effect on sales revenues and 
profitability.
In addition to substantial 
capital investment, the 
group invests over £7 
million in research and 
development activities 
each year to extend and 
differentiate the product 
range and improve the 
quality of our products. 
We also expand the total 
collagen casings market 
by developing products 
which convert gut casing 
applications to collagen. 
Devro provides a high 
level of technical support 
to key customers.
Increased
Delays or cost overruns  
on major projects
The group is embarking 
on two major projects  
in South Carolina, USA 
and Nantong, China. 
Unexpected delays or  
cost overruns would 
reduce returns.
High The project costs are estimated at 
£40 million (USA) and £50 million 
(China). Cost overruns would reduce 
the returns on these investments  
and use more cash resources.
A delay in completing the 
commissioning of these plants  
could significantly impact earnings  
in 2016 and 2017.
Dedicated project teams  
have been set up for 
each project. A new 
Technical & Operations 
Director, with previous 
experience of building  
a factory in China, was 
recruited in 2013.
Experienced external 
engineers and 
contractors have  
been engaged.

Disruption to supply or 
increase in price of key 
raw materials
The group’s most 
important raw material  
is collagen, a naturally 
occurring animal protein 
obtained from cattle  
and sow hides.
There is a risk that 
changes may occur  
in the supply or demand 
for food grade collagen, 
resulting in significant  
cost increases for the 
group’s business.
Low Raw collagen represents 
approximately 15% of the group’s 
total operating costs.
Increase in price would adversely 
impact the group’s operating costs.
Disruption to supply could adversely 
affect manufacturing performance.
The group manages the 
collagen sourcing risk  
by, where possible, 
entering into long-term 
arrangements with 
specialised suppliers  
in various parts of  
the world. 
We monitor 
developments and 
changes in the global 
abattoir and leather 
industries to maintain 
and develop appropriate 
relationships.
Unchanged
Product contamination
Raw materials and 
ingredients may contain 
impurities, contamination 
or disease. 
Low Contamination could lead to a 
product recall, loss of reputation, or 
significant costs of compensation.
All of our manufacturing 
sites have achieved 
FS22000 approval.  
This requires a Hazard 
Analysis and Critical 
Control Point 
programme to be 
implemented with the 
aim of preventing 
contamination.
Unchanged
Foreign exchange  
rate movements
As an international 
business, with costs being 
incurred and revenues 
earned in several different 
currencies, the group  
is exposed to the risk of 
changes in the relative 
strengths of currencies. 
This risk increases in times 
of international economic 
uncertainty. 
Medium This may result in adverse impacts  
on revenues, costs and the sterling 
value of reported profits. Almost 
90% of the group’s revenues are 
currently invoiced in currencies  
other than sterling.
The financial impact  
of exchange rate 
fluctuations within  
our operating units is 
mitigated by a policy  
of hedging a substantial 
portion of transactional 
foreign exchange risk for 
periods of up to fifteen 
months using forward 
contracts. The group 
does not hedge the risk 
arising from changes  
in the rates at which 
oversees earnings are 
translated into sterling. 
Unchanged
People
Shortage of people with 
relevant technical expertise.
Medium There is considerable competition  
for highly trained staff in certain 
areas. Devro’s strategy of significant 
investment in the company’s 
manufacturing base requires the 
recruitment and retention of highly-
skilled technical managers and 
employees.
Following the 
recruitment of the  
Group Human Resources 
Director in 2012, a 
number of internal 
programmes have been 
introduced to train and 
develop key employees. 
In addition, recruitment 
initiatives are underway 
in order to ensure that 
major capital projects 
will be managed 
effectively.

Customer credit risks
The group is exposed to 
financial risks arising from 
its trading with customers 
and distributors in a large 
number of countries 
where prevailing payment 
terms are diverse. This 
includes not only 
customer risk, but also  
the risk of failures in the 
banking system and may 
increase in times of 
economic uncertainty.
Medium Customer credit default may 
adversely affect the group’s 
business, results or financial 
condition, particularly during 
periods of difficult global 
economic conditions.
The group has established 
internal procedures and controls 
to mitigate the risk of non-
payment wherever we do 
business. For example, we 
require either payment in 
advance or confirmed letters  
of credit before releasing 
product to customers or 
distributors in parts of the  
world considered to be at risk.
Unchanged
Impact of changes in 
regulations affecting food 
production
As a food manufacturer, 
the group complies with 
all relevant food safety 
regulations. These 
regulations are not only 
those of the jurisdictions 
where products are 
manufactured (the 
European Union, the USA 
and Australia), but also  
the regulations of the 
many countries in which 
products are sold. 
Regulatory authorities 
routinely enact changes  
to food safety legislation. 
Medium Changes to food safety 
regulations could result in 
restrictions on the movement 
of the group’s products, or 
its raw materials, between 
territories, or necessitate 
changes to the production 
processes at one or more of 
the group’s manufacturing 
facilities. 
The Global Quality and 
Regulatory Affairs Director 
actively monitors planned and 
actual changes to regulations in 
all relevant jurisdictions in order 
to minimise disruption to its 
business. 
The group is a founder member 
of the Collagen Casings Trade 
Association, which represents 
the industry and promotes its 
excellent record in regulatory 
and health issues. Supplier 
approval and traceability  
are under constant review. 
Increased
Increases in energy costs
Energy represents a major 
element of the group’s 
manufacturing costs,  
but may be subject to 
significant price volatility.
Medium There is a risk that significant 
additional costs may be 
incurred in future as a result  
of increased energy prices. 
Energy costs currently 
represent approximately  
9% of the group’s total 
operating costs. 
There is a strong focus on 
measures aimed at reducing 
usage and cost per unit of 
output. An example is the 
investment in the co-generation 
plant at our Australian factory.  
In addition, costs are actively 
managed by entering into 
fixed-price contracts where 
these are considered 
appropriate. As the group 
replaces old fixed assets, energy 
consumption tends to reduce,  
as new machines are generally 
more energy efficient.

APPETITE
IMPACT MITIGATION TREND
Increased funding 
requirements  
of pension schemes
Estimates of the amount 
and timing of future 
funding obligations for the 
group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes are 
based on various 
assumptions, including  
the projected investment 
performance of the 
pension scheme assets, 
future bond yields, 
changes to assumptions 
about the longevity of the 
schemes’ members, and 
statutory requirements. 
Low Any significant deterioration 
in the schemes’ asset values 
or unforeseen increases in 
scheme liabilities might 
increase the group’s funding 
obligations and could 
adversely affect the group’s 
profits and financial strength.
The position and performance  
of each of the pension schemes 
are continually monitored  
by the group, in conjunction  
with pension trustees and 
professional advisers.
All defined benefit schemes are 
closed to new entrants, and the 
group is actively working to 
match assets to expected future 
cashflow.
Unchanged
Development of  
non-casing technologies
More than 85% of the 
group’s revenue  
is derived from the 
manufacture and  
sale of edible collagen 
casings, primarily  
for sausages. For  
many years, several 
manufacturers of 
machinery used in  
the food industry have 
been promoting “co-
extrusion” systems for 
sausages which do not 
require casings. 
High If there were to be a 
significant conversion to 
co-extrusion, there could  
be an adverse effect on the 
sales of casings and profits 
of the group’s operations.
The group makes substantial 
investments in product 
development and manufacturing 
processes to sustain competitive 
advantage. 
Where there have been 
conversions to co-extrusion  
in the past, the group has often 
been successful in obtaining  
the business to supply the 
collagen gel required for such 
applications, and continues  
to be a world leader in this 
specialist category.
Unchanged
Constitutional change 
A referendum is planned 
on Scottish Independence 
in 2014. One political party 
is promising a referendum 
on the UK’s continued 
membership of the 
European Union in 2017  
if they win the 2015 UK 
General Election. Either 
could result in significant 
constitutional change. 
Low The Scottish referendum 
could result in an 
independent Scotland 
outside of the European 
Union. The proposed 2017 
referendum could result in 
the UK exiting the European 
Union. Devro has two 
factories in Scotland  
with significant trading links 
to Europe. Trading and 
regulatory relationships 
beyond Europe are in many 
cases facilitated by EU 
membership.
The situation is uncertain  
and is being monitored.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
As a global manufacturing business, we inevitably have an 
impact on the wider world. We take our responsibilities to 
society seriously and make sure they are reflected in all our 
group policies and statements. 
Being a responsible business
As a global manufacturing business, we 
inevitably have an impact on the wider 
world. We take our responsibilities to 
society seriously and make sure they  
are reflected in all our group policies  
and statements. Health and Safety,  
the Environment, Food Safety, Quality 
and People – policies on all these topics 
are reviewed annually and the latest 
versions were fully updated and 
endorsed by the Board at the end  
of 2013. They are available to read  
on our website (www.devro.com).
Safety
We believe that all accidents are 
preventable. Health and safety are 
fundamental to our operations as a 
manufacturing business. Our aim is  
to do everything safely and we have a 
goal of zero injuries. Safety is a regular 
agenda item at Board meetings, and the 
Board Health and Safety Committee met 
7 times in 2013 to review progress and 
hear from Regional Safety Committees.
We focus on three main aspects of safety:
• Process safety: ensuring safe 
equipment and processes
• Procedural safety: ensuring that we 
have adequate procedures for the 
safe operation and maintenance  
of our equipment
• Behavioural safety: helping our 
employees to act in a safe way
We ensure process safety by means  
of regular risk assessments in existing 
operations and whenever we make any 
changes to our processes. In 2013 we 
instigated a Management of Change 
Global Standard to be followed by all  
of our sites.
Since 2010, local safety procedures have 
been guided by the Devro Golden Rules 
for Safety, which cover 17 common 
practices and procedures of potential 
risk. During 2013 we began auditing 
each plant to ensure compliance with 
the Golden Rules. This will be completed 
in 2014.
During 2012 we introduced the ‘Safety 
Family’, a description of the behaviours 
which support and enable safe working. 
In 2013 the Safety Survey was issued to 
all colleagues to measure support for 
our Safety Family principles. 33 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

How we did in 2013
Safety performance at Devro  
continues to improve. We measure our 
performance by looking at the number 
of recordable injuries, those which  
need more attention than basic first  
aid and require the attention of a health 
professional. There was a marked 
improvement in our recordable injury 
rate in 2013.
The reported rate of lost working day 
injuries (LWDIs) increased in the past 
year, but the severity of incidents 
continues to decline. Following every 
LWDI a full report is drafted with all 
remedial actions put in place as soon  
as is practical, with the circumstances 
shared at all sites to ensure the chance 
of recurrence elsewhere in the group is 
minimised. The Chief Executive meets 
personally with every colleague who  
has been involved in a LWDI.
The number of working days lost due 
to injury in 2013 was at the lowest level 
since 2000, when Devro started keeping 
records of safety statistics.
Whilst there has been considerable 
progress in safety over the past  
9 years, there is still scope for further 
improvement. Managers and all 
colleagues remain committed to 
making Devro a safe place to work. 34 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Environment
Protecting the environment is one  
of the cornerstones of responsible  
and successful business practice.  
We take pride in what we do and  
we are committed to complying with  
the regulations, permits and consent 
limits that apply to our various  
activities, just as we are committed to  
avoiding pollution and reducing our 
environmental impact in the countries 
and communities in which we operate.
Devro’s operations around the world are 
subject to a variety of regulatory regimes 
and cultures. As a consequence, we deal 
with environmental issues through a 
network of specialists operating within 
the business units.
The main environmental impacts of our 
processes are the emission of carbon 
dioxide and the solid waste we send to 
landfill or incineration. We operate our 
own waste water treatment plants in 
three of our locations. In the fourth, 
Scotland, we discharge directly into  
the public sewerage system where  
our waste is combined with domestic 
effluent and treated by Scottish Water.
We monitor three measures at group 
level:
• carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions  
from the use of fuels and electricity  
in our factories
• water consumption
• solid waste to landfill or incineration
Our major concern is climate change 
and the twin issues of fuel consumption 
and electricity-related CO
2
 emissions. 
In 2011 we set ourselves the target of 
making 10% reductions in each of these 
measures per kilometre-equivalent-
product by 2015. 35 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Environmental management systems
All our major manufacturing sites 
employ Environmental Management 
Systems based around the ISO 14001 
model. Four of the plants have now been 
accredited with the ISO 14001 standard 
while the other is currently evaluating 
the accreditation process.
Site specific issues
In addition to the main environmental 
impacts monitored at group level, two of 
our sites have to meet local compliance 
targets for discharges and emissions.
Discharges to water
Of the four main manufacturing 
locations, only two discharge to a 
waterway. Our Czech factory in Jilemnice 
sends liquid effluent to the Jizerka River, 
and our US factory in South Carolina 
discharges to the Congaree River.
The effluent from both has to meet  
a range of limits; and across both sites 
there were only three minor incidents 
where consented levels were exceeded 
but all were quickly remedied.
In addition, the pH of the discharge for 
our South Carolina plant was within the 
permitted range of 6 to 9; there is also a 
minimum dissolved oxygen requirement 
which was comfortably exceeded.
Carbon dioxide
During 2013 our absolute emissions of 
carbon dioxide reduced by 7% due to the 
continued shift to burning gas in the 
United States, as the wood fired boilers 
were decommissioned. The tonnes CO

Discharges to atmosphere
The same two locations have consents 
they have to meet for discharges to air.
In South Carolina these relate to the 
waste treatment operation for ammonia 
and volatile organic carbon; and in the 
Czech Republic they relate to carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen oxides.
For both sites the consented levels were 
not exceeded during the year.
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions
Our emissions of greenhouse gases are 
mainly due to the use of energy in our 
factories. In addition we use HFCs and 
HCFCs in refrigeration equipment, own  
a number of vehicles and rent offices. 
The figures below cover all of these 
activities except where we rent an office 
where the energy use is not measured 
separately. The impact of this on our 
numbers is not material.
We started collecting information in this 
format in 2012:

Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG 
emissions from sources owned by the 
group. Scope 2 emissions result from the 
generation of electricity, heating, and 
cooling or steam operated off site, but 
purchased by the group.
People and human rights
The group places considerable value  
on the involvement of its employees  
and has continued to keep them 
informed on matters affecting them  
and on the various factors affecting  
the performance of the business.  
This is achieved through regular 
communications, and formal  
and informal meetings. Financial  
results are circulated throughout  
the organisation on the day of  
their announcement. Employees’ 
representatives are consulted regularly 
on a wide range of matters affecting 
their current and future interests.
Devro is an equal opportunities employer 
and our employees and applicants are 
treated fairly and equally regardless of 
their age, colour, creed, disability, full or 
part time status, gender, marital status, 
nationality or ethnic origin, race, religion 
or sexual orientation. Applications  
from disabled people are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes 
of the applicant concerned. In the event 
of members of staff becoming disabled 
every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the group continues 
and the appropriate training is arranged.  
It is the policy of the group that the 
training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should,  
as far as possible, be identical to that  
of other employees.
We employed 2,269 people, on average, 
around the world during 2013. As at  
31 December 2013 the group employed 
2,290 people.
As of 31 December 2013 the gender 
breakdown was as set out in the table  
on the next page.
We encourage the development of 
employees through training and invest 
both time and money in this which 
provides benefits for both the group 
through a more highly skilled workforce, 
and the individual employees who gain 
both qualifications and experience that 
they can use to further their careers 
whilst with the group and in any future 
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.
These sources fall within our consolidated 
financial statements. We do not have 
responsibility for any emission sources 
that are not included in our consolidated 
statements.
We have used emission factors from UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting.
Notes:
1.  Overseas electricity conversion factors taken 
from DEFRA’s tables refer to tes CO
2
 rather 
than tes CO

roles elsewhere. As at 31 December 2013 
we were training 20 apprentices across 
the world. During the course of the year 
5 apprenticeships were completed. As at 
31 December 2013, 21 people who have 
successfully completed apprenticeships 
with us were still employed by the group.
The group has supported 29 of its 
employees through a programme 
with the Open University Business 
School. In 2013, 11 employees achieved 
a Professional Certificate in Management 
through this programme. 
Devro does not have a specific human 
rights policy. However, the principles 
underlying a number of our key policies, 
ranging from business conduct to health 
and safety, reflect our commitment to 
run our business responsibly and ensure 
that all our employees, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders are 
treated fairly and with respect. We will 
continue to behave responsibly in all 
regions that the group may base 
operations in the future, and adhere to 
the highest standards, even where local 
regulatory requirements are not as 
advanced as those the group currently 
operates within.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
An Introduction by Steve Hannam, Chairman
THE LEADERSHIP AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BOARD  
ARE PRIMARIL Y THE CHAIRMAN’S 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
WE RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND ARE 
COMMITTED TO, HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE, ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF  
THE COMPANY AND THE INTERESTS OF ALL OUR 
STAKEHOLDERS. MY FELLOW DIRECTORS AND  
I FULL Y APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND 
GOVERNANCE IN THE EFFICIENT RUNNING OF  
THE COMPANY, AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE 
EFFECTIVENESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
BOARD AND THE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS FACED  
BY THE GROUP. 
THE FOLLOWING REPORT SETS OUT HOW WE  
DO THIS. IT COVERS HOW THE BOARD AND ITS 
COMMITTEES OPERATED IN 2013, AND EXPLAINS  
THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN TO INCREASE 
EXPERIENCE AND DIVERSITY AT BOARD LEVEL  
AS WE SEEK TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE RUN  
THE BUSINESS. 
From 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2013,  
the company applied the 2012 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
1. Board composition
Mr S J Hannam, Chairman, Mr P W B Page, Chief 
Executive, Mr S C Webb, Group Finance Director, 
Ms J A Lodge, Non-Executive Director, Mr P A J 
Neep, Non-Executive Director, and Mr P N Withers, 
Non-Executive Director, served as directors 
throughout 2013. Mr G J Hoetmer joined the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director on 30 July 2013.
The Non-Executive Directors are considered to be 
“independent” directors. This opinion is based 
primarily on careful consideration of their character 
and judgement and their contribution to the work 
of the Board and its committees. None holds any 
external position which would impinge upon his  
or her independence or objectivity, nor are there 
any relationships or circumstances such as are 
envisaged by Provision B.1.1 of the Code, other  
than as set out in the following paragraph.
Mr P A J Neep has held the position of “Senior 
Independent Director” since October 2005. The 
Board recognises in terms of Provision B.2.3 of the 
Code that the independence of any Non-Executive 
Director may be compromised if he or she has been 
in that role for a long period of time. The Board, 
with the assistance of the Nomination Committee, 
has therefore rigorously evaluated Mr P A J Neep’s 
performance, and the Chairman is satisfied that he 
continues to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to the role. The Board has therefore 
decided to recommend the re-election of Mr P A J 
Neep at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Board views the Senior Independent Director’s 
role generally as a passive one, but acknowledges 
that there can be occasions where there may be  
a need for shareholders to convey concerns to the 
Board other than through the Chairman or the 
Chief Executive. The company’s major shareholders 
are reminded that the Senior Independent Director 
is willing to meet with them if they wish.
Mr G J Hoetmer was appointed to the Board  
on 30 July 2013. A Dutch national, he started his 
career with Unilever in 1980, holding a number  
of positions there until 2005, latterly as Senior  
Vice President Supply Chain Unilever Foods  
and he was a member of the Unilever Foods 
Executive. He is currently Chief Executive of 
Corbion, a Dutch-listed bio-based company.
All directors will stand for election or re-election  
at the 2014 AGM. As in previous years, brief 
biographies of Board members, giving details  
of their experience and other main commitments, 
can be found on pages 38 and 39, allowing 
shareholders to make an informed decision on the 
question of election or re-election. All the directors 
have had their performance reviewed recently, as 
described on page 43 below, and the Chairman  
is satisfied that each continues to be effective and 
to demonstrate commitment to the role.  41 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Division of Board time
There is a clear division of authority and responsibility through the separation of the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive.  
This demarcation is set out in writing and has been agreed by the Board. 
Directors of the company and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy.
The directors believe that it is essential that the group should be led and controlled by an effective board. The Board has 
adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it including:
 
• the setting of corporate strategy;
• approval of the annual budget; and
• major decisions on capital expenditure.
In 2013, the Board broadly divided its time as follows:
The day to day management of the business is the responsibility of executive management.
Balance and diversity 
The Chairman and the Board understand the need to ensure that the balance of the Board is appropriate for the requirements 
of the business, and the benefits of diversity in its broadest sense are clearly understood. However, for a relatively small Board, 
it remains difficult to set targets for members of any particular background, and this applies to the issue of women on the 
Board. The Board’s policy is therefore to actively encourage women to apply to join the Board whenever a vacancy exists, and 
the report from the Nomination Committee on page 44 sets out how we do this. Ultimately, however, any appointments must 
be made on merit, taking account of the specific needs of the business at the relevant times, for the benefit of the company and 
its stakeholders.
Information flow
On appointment to the Board, directors are provided with an induction programme to familiarise themselves with the group’s 
businesses and the risks and strategic challenges facing the group, as well as the economic, competition, legal and regulatory 
environments in which the group operates.
The directors are supplied with detailed papers covering the group’s operating functions in advance of all Board meetings and 
a secure web-based portal is used to disseminate additional relevant information on a regular basis. 
Members of the executive management team attend and make presentations as appropriate at meetings of the Board.  
A programme of strategic and other reviews, together with training provided during the year, ensures that the directors 
continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the group’s businesses, as well as their awareness of industry,  
risk, legal, regulatory, financial and other developments to enable them to fulfil their role effectively on the Board and 
committees of the Board.
In addition, the Board arranges for its non-executive directors to visit the group’s principal locations to discuss operations  
with local management. The Board plans to visit at least one of the group’s principal locations each year, where they receive  
a presentation and tour of the facility. During the course of 2013, the Board visited the group’s US operations. 
The directors can obtain independent professional advice at the company’s expense in performance of their duties as directors, 
although none has done so in the period under review. In addition, all directors have access to the service of the Company 
Secretary, who is also responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are observed and for advising the Board on Corporate 
Governance matters. 42 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Board and committee proceedings
The Board acknowledges that it is collectively responsible for the success of the company by providing entrepreneurial 
leadership, setting the company’s strategic aims, ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place 
and reviewing management performance.
A number of committees carry out detailed independent oversight on behalf of the Board in relation to the audit of the 
company, health and safety issues, the remuneration of directors and the risks facing the group.
In order to discharge these responsibilities, the Board and its committees meet on a regular basis throughout the year.  
In 2013, the Board held 8 meetings. Full details of the Board and committee attendance are shown in the table below:

2  Mr P N Withers joined the Nomination Committee on 11 December 2013
Board papers are generally circulated one week before the meetings. Monthly management accounts in an agreed format  
are also sent to directors in a timely manner.
The Audit, Remuneration, Nomination, Health and Safety and Risk Committees, all appropriately resourced, met a total  
of 25 times during the year.
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors met informally during the year, providing an opportunity to review  
the business without the Executive Directors being present.
Board evaluation
In 2012, the Board retained the Zygos Partnership to facilitate the evaluation of its performance. The process involved extensive 
interviews with each director and the Company Secretary which were then reviewed with the Chairman. Formal feedback  
on the Board Review was then presented to, and discussed by, the Board in December 2012. The areas specifically covered 
included the Board structure, the Company Secretariat, number and locations of meetings, Board culture, risk and strategic 
analysis, all of which were considered in the context of the company’s performance and growth since 2007 and the significant 
opportunities and challenges facing it.
A number of options for developing the strength of the Board were considered, and the Nomination Committee were asked  
to consider the recruitment of an additional Non-Executive Director. As a result, Mr G J Hoetmer joined the Board in July 2013, 
after an external search.
In 2013, the Board reverted to its previous evaluation process based on a detailed questionnaire which is distributed to the 
directors for their consideration. Results are collated confidentially by the Company Secretary, and reviewed by the Chairman. 
Individual and collective discussions on the Board’s performance then followed. 
The questionnaire examines the balance of the skills of the directors, the operation of the Board in practice, including governance 
issues, and the content of Board meetings. Feedback from the process is used to identify opportunities to improve the 
performance of the Board and the directors. 43 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
This process also addresses the effectiveness of the Board committees, covering such matters as meeting arrangements, and 
information provision. The results of the 2013 process were discussed by the Board and, where areas of improvement were 
identified, actions were agreed. 
A number of actions resulted including the appointment of Mr P N Withers to the Nomination Committee and the appointment 
of Mr G J Hoetmer to the Audit Committee and the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee. 
 
A review of the performance of the Chairman was completed by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director.
2. Relationship with shareholders
The company communicates with institutional investors primarily though analysts’ briefings and meetings with major 
shareholders, as well as timely Stock Exchange announcements. The Board, and in particular the Non-Executive Directors, are 
kept informed of investors’ views in the main through distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings. The Chairman is willing to 
meet with shareholders to discuss matters such as strategy and governance and, as mentioned above, the Senior Independent 
Director is available in the event of shareholder concerns which cannot be addressed through the usual channels.
Broader shareholder communication takes place through the company’s website, which contains significant company 
announcements and other relevant information, and also through the Annual Report and AGM. All directors attend the AGM, 
and shareholders have the opportunity to hear presentations on the group’s financial and business performance as well as to 
question any member of the Board on any relevant topic.
Votes at the AGM are conducted by way of a poll to ensure that the votes of shareholders who are unable to attend may be 
taken into account. The results are announced to the Stock Exchange.
Each substantial issue is proposed as an individual resolution of the AGM. The notice is sent to shareholders at least twenty 
working days before the meeting.
3. Directors’ remuneration
Details of the level of remuneration received by the directors in 2013 are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 63. 
The Board believes that the current levels of remuneration are at the right level to attract and retain the directors needed to run 
the company successfully, without being excessive. Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed against those paid for 
similar positions in comparable companies. Professional advice from independent advisers is sought each year in this regard by 
the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee.
An explanation of the company’s incentive schemes, including how these are linked to the company’s strategy, is set out in  
the Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 63. The provisions of Schedule A to the Code are applied when incentive schemes  
are discussed.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for notice periods of one year. Due to the technical nature of the business, 
these contracts contain restrictive covenants which will be rigorously applied and, taking this into account, the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee believe that the notice periods are reasonable and in the best interests of the 
company, having regard to prevailing market conditions and current practice among public companies.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed from time to time by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee, taking independent external advice as appropriate.
Mr P A J Neep chaired the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee throughout 2013. The other members of the 
Committee were Mr S J Hannam, Mr P N Withers and Ms J A Lodge for the full year. Mr G J Hoetmer joined on 11 December 
2013. This Committee met three times in 2013. 
Throughout 2013, the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mr P W B Page, with Mr S C Webb  
as the other member. This Committee met three times in 2013.
The Remuneration Report contains a detailed statement of the remuneration of each director for 2013, including details  
of the company’s pension policy for Executive Directors.
The written remit of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee is available on the company’s website. 44 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

4. Report from the Nomination Committee
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr S J Hannam, Ms J A Lodge, and Mr P A J Neep, with Mr P N Withers 
joining on 11 December 2013. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website. These include the regular review 
of the structure, size and composition of the Board.
During 2013, the Committee met formally on one occasion.
The question of succession planning for senior management below Board level is primarily the responsibility of the Chief Executive.
In the course of the year under review, one Board appointment was made. Mr G J Hoetmer was identified after a formal process 
using the Zygos Partnership as independent consultants. His extensive background in the international food industry made him 
an ideal candidate for the role. The Zygos Partnership also assisted in the Board review process in 2012 as mentioned above.
Following a review of the Davies Report by the Board in the course of 2011, the Committee will continue to facilitate the 
candidature of women for Board appointments, and recruitment consultants will be instructed to ensure, whenever possible, 
that a significant proportion of any long list put forward should be women. Short lists will also be drawn up in a way which 
forces diversity amongst the final candidates.
5. Report from the Health and Safety Committee
This Committee was formed in 2009, reflecting the Board’s commitment to health and safety matters.
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr P N Withers, who chaired the Committee, Mr S J Hannam,  
Mr P W B Page and Dr M H Cooke, the company’s Strategic Development Director. 
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website.
The Committee convened seven times in 2013 and on four of these occasions met (either by video, telephone or in person)  
with representatives of the Safety Committee of one of the group’s main manufacturing facilities. In October 2013, the 
Committee members visited the facility at Sandy Run, South Carolina, and conducted a plant tour with members of the  
local Safety Committee.
The safety performance of the group is reviewed at each meeting, and the Committee receives and reviews reports on all 
serious safety incidents. The Committee also reviewed and endorsed the safety plans for each of the main sites at the beginning 
of the year.
Dr M H Cooke retired from the company in December 2013, with the thanks of the Committee for his excellent contribution  
to the safety effort over the years.
6. Financial reporting
The Board acknowledges its responsibility to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s 
position and prospects. The Annual Report contains a Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. Including a Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. The Board believes that this additional narrative sets the accounts in context 
and promotes a better understanding of the current status of the business and its outlook.
To ensure consistency of reporting, the group has an established consolidation process as well as formal financial and 
operational procedures manuals. Management monitors the publication of new reporting standards and works closely  
with the external auditors in evaluating the impact of these standards.  45 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
7. Internal control and risk
An ongoing process is in place to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks the group faces, which accords with the 
Turnbull Guidance. A Risk Committee was formed in 2010, comprising the Executive Directors and other members of the 
Executive Board, as listed on pages 38 and 39. This Committee meets four times a year and is charged with reviewing risk 
throughout the group. As part of the process, the Group Risk and Control Manager has responsibility for the application  
of risk assessment procedures, including an assessment of non-financial risks across the group. Each group operating company 
prepares a risk assessment for its business. This involves each company preparing a report identifying the relevant risks  
to both current operations and future strategy, the process for managing and mitigating these risks and the means by which 
management might be assured that the processes are effective. A similar exercise is also conducted at group level, taking 
account of any significant risks identified by each of the individual operating companies. The risk assessment reports are 
collated and considered by the Risk Committee, and then the Audit Committee, before being reviewed and finalised by the 
Board. The Board also chooses a number of key risks for in-depth review by the Risk Committee in the course of the following 
year. The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The principal 
risks and uncertainties identified as part of the group risk assessment process, and how they are managed or mitigated,  
are summarised on pages 28 to 31.
The Board of Directors, being ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal control, has established an internal 
financial control structure which is designed to provide the Board with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that it can rely 
on the accuracy and reliability of the financial records.
The structure, which is based on an assessment of material financial risks, can be described under the following headings:
Financial reporting 
There is a budgeting system in place which includes an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly actual results are 
reported against budget. Revised forecasts for the year are prepared regularly. The company reports formally to shareholders 
twice a year, with two additional Interim Management Statements.
Operating controls
Financial and operational policies and procedures are set out in formal procedures manuals. Business directors and senior 
financial staff are responsible for ensuring that all relevant staff are familiar with their content and application. All Board 
members, Business directors and senior finance staff have been issued with Internal Control Guidelines.
Treasury 
Formal written treasury procedures are in operation, covering banking arrangements, hedging instruments, investment of cash 
balances and borrowing procedures. Individual staff responsibilities and levels of delegated authority in relation to treasury 
matters are defined.
Internal Audit
The company has an internal audit function, which has a reporting line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and also direct 
access to the Chairman of the Board. The Group Risk and Control Manager, who is responsible for internal audit, normally 
attends Audit Committee meetings and makes a formal report to the Committee annually.
Capital investment appraisal 
The company has clearly defined guidelines for the approval and review of capital expenditure projects, which include annual 
budgets and designated levels of authority.
Integrity of personnel
The company has a Policy on Business Conduct which sets out specific requirements for all staff to meet the company’s 
standards of conduct and integrity in their business dealings.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control and considers that the group has an established 
system of internal control which the directors believe to be appropriate to the business. 46 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
(continued)
8. Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and borrowing facilities.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include:
• As at 31 December 2013 the group was operating comfortably within the £61 million revolving bank facilities negotiated in 
June 2013 and due to expire in September 2016.
• In order to fund the planned investment in China, additional debt funding will be sought in the first half of 2014.
9. Share capital 
The Takeover Directive disclosures regarding the company’s share capital structure are included in the share capital section  
of the Directors’ Report on pages 64 to 67 of this report. 
10. Statement on compliance
This statement, together with the Remuneration Report set out on pages 50 to 63, describes how, in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2013, the company has applied the provisions and principles of corporate governance as set out in the Code.  
The company has complied with all the Code’s provisions throughout the period in question, with one exception. The 
company’s Remuneration Committee structure does not fully comply with Provision D.2.2, as the remuneration of the Chairman 
is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee comprising the Executive Directors’ instead of by a committee 
of Non-Executive Directors, as proposed by the Code. The company’s two-committee approach, which is more fully described 
and explained in the Remuneration Report, is designed to ensure that no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration, 
thus avoiding any potential conflict of interest, while ensuring that the experience of the Chairman is available to the Executive 
Directors’ Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that this arrangement is an appropriate and effective use of the 
available resources and is fully aligned with the spirit of the Code.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
An Introduction
DEAR SHAREHOLDER, 
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT 
COMMITTEE, I AM PLEASED  
TO PRESENT THE REPORT  
IN RESPECT OF 2013.
The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) has 
written terms of reference, which are available  
on the company’s website, and include the 
responsibilities set out in Provision C.3.2 of  
the Code.
Ms J A Lodge chaired the Committee throughout 
the period under review. The other members of the 
Committee in 2013 were Mr P A J Neep and Mr P N 
Withers, throughout the year, and Mr G J Hoetmer 
who joined on 11 December 2013. The Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board views Ms J A Lodge as the Committee 
member with both recent and relevant financial 
expertise as stipulated in Provision C.3.1 of the Code.
In the course of the year there were seven 
meetings. all of which were attended by the Group 
Finance Director, management, and the Group Risk 
and Control manager, as invitees. Representatives 
of the auditors also attend as required.
The Committee and the external auditors operate 
procedures to ensure that the auditors remain 
objective and independent. These procedures 
include the pre-approval of the scope of the audit 
by the Committee.

External audit
There are a number of processes used to judge the effectiveness of the external auditors of the group:
• A survey is coordinated by Internal Audit of all businesses within the group to assess the effectiveness of the group and  
local external audit teams. A summary of the results of this survey is reported to the Committee for its consideration. 
• The Committee receives a detailed audit plan from the external auditors at the beginning of the annual audit process which 
includes an outline of the proposed scope of the audit, identification of key audit risks and areas of focus. This is discussed 
and agreed with the Committee.
• The Committee challenges the work done by the external auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates in 
relation to the significant issues.
• At the completion of the external audit the Committee receives feedback from the Group Finance Director on how 
effectively issues were addressed at the external audit clearance meetings.
• Each member of the Committee completes an external auditor effectiveness questionnaire, the results of which are collated 
by Internal Audit and reported to the Committee for its consideration.
Based on the above processes and feedback, and its own on-going assessment of the external auditors’ performance (for 
example through consideration of the external auditors’ reports and interaction with the group audit partner) the Committee 
remains satisfied with the effectiveness of the external auditors.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have acted as the group’s external auditors since its formation in 1991. The current group audit 
partner is due to rotate off the audit following the 2016 reporting cycle. In accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Guidance to Audit Committees issued in September 2012 and the findings of the Competition Commission issued in October 
2013, the company intends to put the audit out to tender at least once in each ten year period and intends the next tender 
process to occur no later than the date of the next group audit partner rotation.
Each year the Committee considers carefully the external auditors’ independence and objectivity, taking into account the 
appropriate guidelines. The external auditors also report annually to the Committee on the actions they have taken to comply 
with professional and regulatory requirements, as well as current best practice, in order to demonstrate their independence. 
There are no contractual commitments restricting the Committee’s choice of external auditors, and the Committee will continue 
to periodically review their performance.
As part of the formal annual review of the independence of the external auditors, the Committee also looks carefully at the level 
of non-audit work conducted by the auditors and the detailed safeguards which they have in place. In 2013 the policy covering 
the pre-approval of non-audit work was reviewed and clarified. The Committee is satisfied that there is no risk to the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditors arising from the level of non-audit fees. The fees paid to external auditors in 2013 are 
set out in Note 9 to the financial statements on page 86. Almost all of the non-audit fees relate to tax and pension advice. The 
Committee appreciates the sensitivity of the non-audit fees being higher than the audit fee, but believes that there are sound 
commercial and practical reasons for the tax and pension work being conducted by the relevant departments of the firm which 
conducts the audit. This will be kept under careful review.
The company’s “whistleblowing” procedures are also reviewed annually. In 2013, the Committee requested that consideration 
be given to an external whistleblowing system, and in the course of the year a new, confidential, multi-language system, entitled 
“Speak Up”, was set up and communicated to everyone in the group. The Committee believe that these arrangements will 
facilitate a proportionate and independent investigation of such matters.

Significant issues
The significant issues considered by the Committee during 2013, and how these were addressed, are as follows:
Carrying value of inventory
The group has invested significantly in manufacturing capacity in recent years which has increased production volumes,  
with the expectation of significant sales growth. This has resulted in short term increases in inventory levels. The Committee  
has assessed the judgements of management over the carrying value of inventory and challenged assumptions over the 
recoverability of the carrying value by reviewing data on stock ageing and future sales projections. Additionally the Committee 
has discussed with management the continued appropriateness of the group’s accounting policy with respect to provisioning 
for stock obsolescence, as well as reviewing the application of the policy during the year. This was also an area of focus 
identified by the external auditors, and accordingly they provided detailed reporting on this area to the Committee.
Development programme
The group has embarked on a two-year development programme and as part of this has approved significant capital 
expenditure to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China. This gives rise to a number of areas of judgement 
including whether related amounts should be expensed as incurred or capitalised, and whether any existing assets should be 
impaired or useful lives should be amended. Where amounts have been expensed, judgement is also required to determine 
whether these amounts should be disclosed as exceptional items, taking account of their nature and size, and in particular 
whether they are incremental to normal operations. The Committee has addressed these matters through reviewing and 
discussing reports from management outlining the nature and amount of the relevant costs and the proposed accounting 
treatment. Additionally, the Committee has been provided with information in relation to the existing assets that will be replaced 
as a result of the investment, including the proposed revised useful economic lives, to enable it to assess and challenge 
management’s judgement related to accelerated depreciation or potential impairment. The external auditors have also focused 
on this area and have reported their assessment to the Committee.
Valuation of net pension obligations
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes across the world. Valuation of these schemes is dependent 
on certain key assumptions and complex calculations. External actuaries are engaged to assist in advising on key assumptions 
and determining the value of the pension obligations. In addition there have been changes to pensions accounting (IAS 19, 
“Employee benefits”) which have been adopted by the group during the year. These areas have been addressed by the Committee 
through receiving reports from management outlining the key assumptions, the resulting valuations from actuaries and the 
accounting changes made following the adoption of the revised pension accounting requirements. The Committee discussed 
these topics with management and challenged the key assumptions, including the degree to which these were supported by 
professional advice from the actuaries. The external auditors have also focused attention on this area and provided reporting  
to the Committee on this matter, following consultation with their own actuarial experts.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee acknowledges that, taken as a whole, the annual report and accounts need to be fair, balanced and understandable 
in order to provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee advises the Board on whether it believes that the annual report and accounts meet this requirement. 
In order for the Committee to make this assessment it considers reports from management received during the year, 
monitoring financial performance and at year end in support of the financial statements, and also reports from the external 
auditors on the findings of their annual audit. Formal review processes are in place to ensure the annual report and accounts  
are factually accurate.

REMUNERATION REPORT
An Introduction
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD,  
I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION  
REPORT FOR 2013.
This report explains the group’s remuneration 
policy and provides details of the remuneration 
paid to Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
for services to the company during the year. 
Overview
The Committee sets the strategy, structure and 
levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors 
and reviews the remuneration of other members  
of senior management in the group generally. 
It does so in the context of the group’s overall 
strategy and performance to align the financial 
interests of the Executive Directors and other 
management and employees with achievement  
of the group’s objectives.
Base salary
Our longstanding policy is for base salaries of 
Executive Directors to be around mid-market 
levels. Salary increases for Executive Directors 
in 2013 were limited to 2.7%. This was consistent 
with the average of other pay rises elsewhere 
in the group.
Annual bonus 
The Committee believes annual bonus targets 
should be genuinely challenging, clearly linked 
to the company’s strategy and performance,  
and designed to align the interests of executives 
and shareholders.
In 2013, our business plan sought profit growth 
in a challenging economic environment. The 
Committee decided on two performance 
measurements: (i) Operating Profit; and (ii) 
Operating Cash Flow. 
The Committee considers that some measure 
of earnings should always be part of the annual 
bonus targets. Earnings growth is one of the 
ultimate aims of our strategy, and drives 
shareholder value.
The company encountered difficult trading 
conditions, particularly in the first half of 2013,  
and performance for the full year did not meet  
the targets set. As a result, no annual bonus was 
paid. Full details are set out on page 59.
Paul Neep 
Chairman, Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee 51 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Long-term incentive scheme
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director received conditional awards under the 2003 Performance Share Plan in 2011. 
The performance targets for these awards were partly based on EPS growth and partly on relative Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”), measured across a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2013. The Committee reviewed the 
performance of the company against these conditions in February 2014, and concluded that, while the TSR threshold had  
not been met, the EPS growth target was partially satisfied, and as a result limited vesting was approved. A full explanation  
of the performance metric is shown on page 59. 
The existing 2003 Performance Share Plan expired in 2013, and was replaced with a new scheme in substantially the same 
form but taking into account minor changes to bring it in line with current best practice. The Committee consulted with the 
company’s major shareholders and investor representative bodies regarding the new plan, and its introduction was well 
supported at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. Details of the new plan in terms of award limits and performance targets  
are set out in the policy table on page 53.
Summary
We continue to monitor our approach to remuneration to ensure it remains relevant and consistent with our strategy and 
performance. The Committee believes the current policy, as set out above and as more fully explained in the attached report, 
remains appropriate.
The Board will be submitting this report, and our policy for executive pay, for approval by shareholders at our Annual General 
Meeting on 30 April 2014.
We continue to monitor our 
approach to remuneration to ensure 
it remains relevant and consistent 
with our strategy and performance. 52 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

REMUNERATION REPORT
(continued)
Policy Report
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the company directors and has been 
prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and the policy will take formal 
effect from 30 April 2014. 
The Remuneration Policy
The company’s remuneration policy must enable it to attract and retain leaders with the skills, experience and drive to  
execute the company’s business strategy within a framework which is aligned to the interests of the company’s shareholders, 
for example, through the deferral of bonuses and the requirement to hold shares. The Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”) believes that a significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration should be 
performance related. 
Each year, the Committee conducts a formal review of risk in the context of remuneration. A review of pay for other employees 
across the group, particularly salary increases, is also carried out each year when reviewing overall remuneration policy and this 
is taken into account when setting policy for the Executive Directors. No consultation process with employees was conducted 
in 2013 in respect of the directors’ remuneration policy.
The Committee welcomes dialogue with shareholders and consults with its major investors and investor bodies regarding 
changes to Executive Director remuneration policy. Any views and feedback on arrangements from our investors will be 
considered by the Committee as part of its annual review of directors’ remuneration. 
Remuneration of Executive Directors 
The following table summarises each element of the Executive Directors’ remuneration package, the policy for how these are 
operated and their link to the company’s strategy.

REMUNERATION REPORT
(continued)
Notes to the Policy Table
1. Annual Bonus Plan performance metrics 
Performance measures, the weighting between them and stretching targets will be set at the start of each year by the Committee, 
based on the company’s financial KPIs and strategic priorities for the year and taking account of the business plan, budget  
for the year, and market conditions. At least 80% will be based on relevant financial targets and up to 20% may be attributed  
to a relevant non-financial target. Together, these targets are intended to incentivise and reward shorter-term performance, 
consistent with the interests of the shareholders and the overall strategy of the company.
2. PSP metrics
The Committee selects performance measures for the PSP awards that are aimed at incentivising and rewarding performance 
over the medium term, aligned with the interests of the shareholders and consistent with the group strategy. For a comparative 
TSR measure, the targets are as set out in the policy table with the Committee selecting the most appropriate comparator 
group at the time awards are made. For EPS growth and any other relevant financial targets, the Committee will set stretching 
targets based on the company’s budget, business plan, and external economic environment at that time.
3. Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan contains no additional performance conditions as any awards arise from an Annual Bonus which 
was itself subject to performance conditions.
4. Comparison with employees’ remuneration policy 
The key differences between Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and that of employees generally is that, for the Executive 
Directors, there is significantly more weighting to variable performance-related pay. Variable pay is seen as more relevant for 
senior executives because of their greater ability to influence the overall performance of the company.
Shareholding guidelines
To provide alignment between shareholders and directors, the Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of 100%  
of salary over time. Any shares vesting from share incentive plans must be retained (subject to sales to meet tax and incidental 
costs of sale) until the target is reached.
Remuneration awarded prior to the effective date
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports 
including those share plan awards set out on pages 61 and 63. Details of any payments to former directors will be set out  
in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Annual Bonus Plan and PSP policy
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to the rules of each respective plan and consistent  
with normal market practice and the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, including flexibility in a number of aspects. 
How the Committee will retain flexibility includes (albeit with quantum and performance targets restricted to the descriptions 
detailed above): 
• Who participates in the plans.
• When to make awards and payments.
• How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest.
• How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the group.
• Whether a director is a “good/bad leaver” for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest  
at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s).
• How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring  
or for special dividends). 
• What the weighting, measures and targets should be for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings 
for the Annual Bonus Plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events happen that cause it to determine that the metrics are unable 
to fulfil their originally intended purpose, provided the new metrics are not materially less difficult to satisfy. Any adjustments will 
be fully disclosed in the following year’s Annual Report on remuneration.
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company but remain 
outstanding (detailed on page 61, remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms. 55 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Service Agreements and payments for loss of office of Executive Directors
It is the company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one year’s 
notice by the company and the director. In the event of early termination (including following a change of control in the company), 
the directors’ contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period. In summary, the contractual 
provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed Terms
Notice period 12 months by the company, 12 months by the director.
Termination payment There is no provision for specific payment. If any existing 
contract is breached by the company, it would be liable to  
pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of 
salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, 
subject to mitigation and phased payments where appropriate. 
Any statutory amounts would be paid as necessary.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period  
of active service along with vesting for outstanding share 
awards (in certain circumstances – see below).
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions 
in respect of change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the company’s share plans will be determined based  
on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the Performance Share Plan is that any outstanding awards lapse  
on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, redundancy, 
retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. For good leavers, 
awards will normally vest on cessation, or on the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three-year period actually served. However, the 
Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and/or to disapply time pro-rating. 
The default treatment under the 2009 Deferred Share Bonus Plan is that any awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, good leavers are entitled to retain their awards, and to vest after leaving, subject to the rules of the plan.

Recruitment and promotion policy for directors
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the 
market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate. It may be set initially at  
a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance  
has been proven and sustained. The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary, and conditional awards  
under the Performance Share Plan may be up to the plan maximum of 150% of salary or 200% on recruitment in exceptional 
circumstances. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred  
or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these  
awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed  
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree on the recruitment of a new executive, to a notice period in excess of 12 months but  
to reduce to 12 months over a specified period.
The fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be reflective of experience, time commitment, responsibility and 
scope of the role, and will be consistent with the approved remuneration policy at the time.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for fixed terms, with no notice period, with an entitlement to accrued fees and 
expenses only up to the date of termination. These appointments are subject to the Articles of Association. All directors  
submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The dates of the initial letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:
Name Date of letter of appointment Date term due to expire

Annual Report on Remuneration 
How the policy will be implemented in 2014
Salary: 
Current salaries for Executive Directors at the date of this report are as follows:
Chief Executive: £451,880
Group Finance Director: £285,609 
The Group Finance Directors’ salary will be raised by 2% with effect from 1 April 2014, to £291,321.
The Chief Executive declined an increase, and his salary for 2014 will remain at £451,880. 57 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The fees for Non-Executive Directors in 2014 are as follows:
Name Base
Additional for  
Committee 
Chairmanships Total
S J Hannam £110,000 – £110,000
P A J Neep £40,000 £5,000 £45,000
P N Withers £40,000 £5,000 £45,000
J A Lodge £40,000 £5,000 £45,000
G J Hoetmer £40,000 – £40,000
These fees are unchanged from 2013. The Chairman’s remuneration is below that paid to those in similar roles with comparable companies. He has declined 
an increase.
Annual bonus
For 2014 80% of the annual bonus for Executive Directors will be determined by growth in group Operating Profit and 20%  
by Operating Cash Flow. The Board considers that the targets for the 2014 bonus are commercially sensitive and full details  
will not therefore be fully disclosed until the 2014 report.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Awards will be made in 2014 for the Chief Executive, to the extent of 110% of base salary, and to the Group Finance Director,  
to the extent of 100% of base salary. The performance measures for these awards (relative TSR, and EPS growth) will be the 
same as those which applied to grants made in 2013, as set out on page 60.
Pension and other benefits
The pension and benefits arrangements are as set out in the policy table above.
External appointments
Neither of the Executive Directors has any external paid directorships. Executive Directors are permitted to accept external 
board or committee appointments provided they do not interfere with the Executive Directors’ obligations to the Company.  
The Board will decide at the time of appointment whether the Executive Director may retain the fees for such appointments.
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) throughout 2013 were Mr P A J Neep 
(Committee Chairman), Mr S J Hannam, Ms J A Lodge and Mr P N Withers. Mr G J Hoetmer joined on 11 December 2013.  
All are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee received advice from:
• The Company Secretary (as Secretary to the Committee) and the Chief Executive.
• New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited being a group company of Aon plc) as independent adviser  
to the Committee. New Bridge Street were appointed as advisers by the Committee.
No director is involved in any part of a meeting of the Committee when their individual remuneration or contractual terms  
are being decided.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee, whose members in 2013 were Mr P W B Page and Mr S C Webb. The two-committee approach ensures that  
no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration.
Advisers to the Committee
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has confirmed to the Committee  
that it adheres in all respects to the terms of the Code. The Committee has satisfied itself that advice from New Bridge Street  
is objective. The total fees paid to New Bridge Street for the advice provided to the Committee during the year were £69,726. 
This included advice and guidance on the introduction of the new Performance Share Plan, and advice on compliance with the 
Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Fees are charged 
predominantly on a ‘time spent’ basis. Neither New Bridge Street, nor its parent company Aon plc, has provided any other 
services to the company during the year.
Engagement with investors
In the year under review the Committee continued to engage with major investors in connection with the introduction of the 
new Performance Share Plan which was approved at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. The Committee found the feedback  
received from investors useful and constructive. As a result of the feedback the Committee made certain changes to the 
original proposals, including capping the exceptional award limit in the plan rules. 58 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Total Shareholder Return
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2013, of £100 invested in Devro plc on 31 December 2008 compared with the  
value of £100 invested in the FTSE Small Cap excluding Investment Trusts and the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts. 
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
General FTSE indices have been used as the number of comparable UK-listed food producers is too small to form a sufficiently 
broad-based index for this purpose. Under legislative requirements, the graph shows Total Shareholder Return over the last  
five years.

1  Mr S C Webb was awarded two tranches under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan, as part of his recruitment arrangements in 2011. One of the 
awards is for the usual 3-year performance period, and the other for a 4-year period, with the targets extended pro rata. No awards were made to him  
in 2012.
2 These awards were exercised on 23 April 2013.
3 These shares lapsed following a review of the relevant performance conditions by the Committee in February 2014.
4 These shares are vested but unexercised at the date of this report.
Conditional nil-priced options under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan are considered annually, with earliest vesting 
occurring generally after three years and normally being dependent on both continued employment with the group and  
the extent to which the performance conditions set out below are met. For awards made to Executive Directors in the year 
under review and the two prior years, vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the group’s earnings per share before 
exceptional items (“EPS”) growth over the relevant performance period, with the other 50% being dependent upon the group’s 
total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance measured over the same period against the one hundred listed companies 
(excluding Investment Trusts) closest to the company in terms of market capitalisation (i.e. fifty higher and fifty lower).
The awards made in the year under review were granted as nil-priced options subject to the performance conditions below. 
These conditions will also apply to the awards to be made in 2014:
Annual EPS growth during the performance period Performance shares vesting percentage
Less than 6% per annum 0
6% per annum 12.5%
Between 6% and 14% per annum On a straight-line basis between 12.5% and 50%

All awards made between 2008 and 2010 shown in the table on page 61 were subject to a three year performance period,  
and the targets were as above. The comparator group consisted of the companies in the FTSE Small Cap Index, excluding 
Investment Trusts. 
The movement in the group’s EPS is calculated on a consistent basis over the performance period, comparing EPS after 
exceptionals for the base year – i.e. the calendar year prior to the award date – with the final year – i.e. the calendar year  
three years after the base year.

Introduction
The directors present their Report and the audited consolidated financial statements of the entire Devro group of companies 
(including the company) (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Corporate Governance Report, which can be found on pages 40 to 46 also forms part of this Directors’ Report as do other 
disclosures elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts and these are cross-referenced in this Directors’ Report where 
appropriate. 
A review of the performance of the group’s business during the year, the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group  
and its future prospects are included in the discrete Strategic Report set out on pages 1 to 37 which should be read in 
conjunction with this Directors’ Report. 
The company
The company is a public limited company and is incorporated in Scotland under number SC129785.
The company’s principal subsidiary undertakings and branches, including those located outside the UK, are listed in Note 16

Any amendments to the company’s Articles must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  
(the ‘Act’) by way of special resolution.
Directors

the year ended 31 December 2013 are set out on pages 38 and 39. 
Directors shall be no less than two and no more than eleven in number. Directors may be appointed by the company by

or more directors to hold employment or executive office for such period (subject to the Act) and on such terms as they may 
determine and may revoke or terminate any such appointment.
In line with the recommendations of the Code, the company requires every director to stand for election or re-election by the 
shareholders at each AGM, if he or she wishes to continue being a director.
The company may by ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiration of his or her term of office. The office of 
director shall also be vacated if (i) he or she resigns; (ii) where he or she has been appointed for a fixed term, the term expires; 
(iii) he or she ceases to be a director by virtue of a provision of the Act, is removed from office pursuant to the company’s 
Articles or becomes prohibited by law from being a director; (iv) he or she becomes bankrupt or compounds with his or her 
creditors generally or he or she applies to the court for an interim order under section 253 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in 
connection with a voluntary arrangement; (v) he or she has been suffering from mental ill health or becomes a patient for the 
purposes of any statute relating to mental health or any court claiming jurisdiction on the ground of mental disorder makes an 
order for his or her detention or for the appointment of a guardian, receiver or other person to exercise powers with respect to 
his or her property or affairs, and in any such case the Board resolves that his or her office be vacated; (vi) he or she is absent, 
without the permission of the Board, from Board meetings for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his or her 
office be vacated; or (vii) he or she is removed from office by notice addressed to him or her at his or her last-known address 
and signed by all his or her co-directors.
The company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the benefit of personnel throughout its group including  
its directors and the directors of its subsidiary undertakings in respect of their duties as directors. Following shareholder 
approval, the company has also provided an indemnity for its directors and the Company Secretary which is a qualifying third 
party indemnity provision for the purposes of the Act. This indemnity was in force throughout the year and remains in place  
at the date of this report.
None of the directors had during the year ended 31 December 2013 or has an interest in any material contract relating to the 
business of the company or of any of its subsidiary undertakings.
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the company as at 31 December 2013 are shown on page 63. As at 18 March 
2014, no changes in the directors’ interests have been reported to the company.

The share capital of the company consists entirely of ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The company had 166,779,230 shares  
in issue at 31 December 2013 (2012: 165,633,564) as shown in Note 26 to the financial statements. 65 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Dividends 
The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2013 of 6.1 pence per share (2012: 5.85 pence), making a total 
dividend for the year of 8.8 pence per share (2012: 8.5 pence) an increase of 3.5%. If approved, the final dividend will be payable 
to shareholders on the register as at 28 March 2014. Based on the recommendation for the full year, dividend cover will be  
2.3 times (2012: 2.3 times).
Shareholders’ rights
Subject to applicable laws and the Articles, holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive all shareholder documents, 
including the Annual Report and notice of any general meeting; attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general meetings, 
either in person or by proxy; and to participate in any distribution of income or capital.
Subject to applicable laws and regulations, there are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of shares  
and no requirements for prior approval of any transfers.
None of the shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the company. 
The company is also not aware of any agreements between its shareholders which may restrict the transfer of their shares  
or the exercise of their voting rights. 
Shares acquired through company share schemes and plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have no special rights.
During the year 1,145,666 shares were issued under the rules of the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan (2012: 625,000)  
and nil shares were issued under the rules of the Devro plc Performance Share Plan (2012: Nil).
Powers of the directors
The business of the company is managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the company, subject to the 
provisions of the company’s Articles and applicable legislation.
At the company’s AGM on 18 April 2013, shareholders renewed the authority for the directors to exercise all powers of the 
company to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £11,000,000.
At the same AGM, shareholders granted the company authority to make market purchases of up to 16,500,000 of its issued 
ordinary shares, provided that: the minimum price which may be paid for any such ordinary share is 10 pence (exclusive of 
expenses), its par value; the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share is an amount  
equal to not more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the 
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the date on which that ordinary 
share is purchased. Except in relation to a purchase of ordinary shares, the contract for which was concluded before this 
authority expires and which will or may be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of such authority, the authority granted 
shall expire at the conclusion of this year’s AGM.
Employees
As of 31 December 2013, the group employed 2,290 people at locations across the world. The group places considerable  
value on the involvement of its employees, recognising that it depends on their skills and commitment in order to achieve  
its objectives. Employees are kept informed on matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the 
performance of the group. This is achieved through regular communications, the group’s means for which were enhanced 
during 2013 with the launch of a group wide intranet. Financial results are circulated throughout the organisation on the day 
of their announcement. Employees’ representatives are consulted regularly on a wide range of matters affecting their current 
and future interests.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always given full and fair consideration, bearing in mind the aptitudes and 
abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the group that the training, 
career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with that of other employees.
Research and development
The group is committed to research and development activities principally in relation to product and process development,  
in order to secure its position as a world leader in the casings industry. The research and development expenditure incurred  
in the year is set out in Note 9 to the financial statements.
Greenhouse gas emissions
All disclosures concerning the group’s greenhouse gas emissions (as required to be disclosed under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013) are contained in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report forming 
part of the Strategic Report on pages 32 to 37.
Political contributions
The company and its subsidiary undertakings made no contributions for political purposes in 2013 (2012: £nil).  66 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

of Meeting is set out on pages 126 to 127. Shareholders will be asked for their approval of the items of business which are 
explained in the notes on pages 128 to 131. These notes form part of this Directors’ Report and are incorporated into it by 
cross-reference.
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Report is aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the directors has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they  
be re-appointed will be proposed at the AGM. 67 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the remuneration report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss 
of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company  
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Act and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulations. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s website (www.devro.com). Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.1
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 38 and 39, confirms that, to the best of his or her 
knowledge and belief:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and of the group included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
• the management report required by DTR4.1.8R (contained in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report) includes  
a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and group included  
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
In addition, each of the directors considers that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable  
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.

1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union endorsed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and pension scheme assets.
The group’s reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest  
£0.1 million.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position  
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and  
borrowing facilities.
In addition, Note 23 includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and  
liquidity risk.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include:
• As at 31 December 2013 the group was operating comfortably within the £61m revolving bank facilities negotiated in June 
2013 and due to expire in September 2016.
• In order to fund the planned investment in China, additional debt funding will be sought in the first half of 2014.
Critical estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect  
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues  
and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best assessments of amounts, 
events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The key uncertainties that have a significant risk of 
causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the carrying value 
of inventory, accounting for the group’s development programme, measurement of pension obligations and tax.
Carrying value of inventory
Determining the carrying value of inventory involves a degree of judgement as to whether the group will be able to sell the 
stock it has on hand for more than the value recorded in the balance sheet, which is typically the cost of production. The group 
adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain age, and also for any inventory where there are specific 
concerns. These estimated provisions are based on management’s best assessments of future sales volumes and the likely 
selling prices, and actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Development programme
The two year development programme announced in 2013, to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China, 
requires judgement including whether related costs should be expensed as incurred or capitalised, and whether any existing 
assets should be impaired or their useful lives amended. Where amounts are expensed, judgement is also required to determine 
whether these amounts should be disclosed as exceptional items, taking account of their nature and size, and in particular 
whether they are incremental to normal operations. An analysis of exceptional items recognised is included in Notes 4 and 5.
Pension obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension schemes is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves certain 
key assumptions and complex calculations. The key assumptions include discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates 
and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. 
An analysis of the sensitivity of the pension obligation to changes in key assumptions is provided based on movements in key 
variables that could reasonably occur. Further details are provided in Note 25. 76 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 (continued)
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Tax
The group’s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates effective at the balance sheet date. In addition to 
corporation tax, the group is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across the tax jurisdictions in the 
countries in which it operates. The varying nature and complexity of these tax laws requires the group to review its tax positions 
and make appropriate adjustments at the balance sheet date. In addition the recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent 
upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of such deferred 
tax assets in future years. Further details are provided in Notes 10 and 24.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective in 2013
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became mandatory for the first time during the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2013. With the exception of IAS 19 (revised) and IAS 1 (amendment) they either were not 
relevant for the group or had no material impact on the financial statements of the group:
      
 Effective date
IFRS 11 – Joint arrangements 1 January 2013
IFRS 13 – Fair value measurement 1 January 2013
IAS 1 (amendment) – Financial statement presentation 
  regarding other comprehensive income 1 January 2013
IAS 12 (amendment) – Income taxes regarding deferred tax 1 January 2013
IAS 19 (revised 2011) – Employee benefits 1 January 2013
IAS 27 (revised 2011) – Separate financial statements 1 January 2013
IAS 28 (revised 2011) – Associates and joint ventures 1 January 2013
IAS 19 (revised) “Employee benefits” has been adopted in the year and the comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2012 
have been restated accordingly. Further details are provided in Note 2. IAS 1 (amendment) has been adopted and the 
presentation of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income updated accordingly. 
The introduction of IFRS 13 has not resulted in any change to the basis of valuation for assets and liabilities measured  
at fair value. 
(b) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following amendments to standards and interpretations were in issue 
but have not been applied in these financial statements:
 Effective date
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments 1 January 2015
IFRS 10 – Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2014
IFRS 12 – Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2014
It is expected that the group will adopt these amendments to standards on their effective dates. The directors do not anticipate 
that the adoption of these amendments to standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 31 December 2013. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. The purchase method of accounting 
is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the group. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired 
or disposed of are consolidated for the period from or to the date on which control passed. Uniform accounting policies are 
applied across the group.
The subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. The cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred. Any identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at 
the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Any unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets within the group principally comprise computer software and certain types of development costs. 
Computer software costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, 
normally 4-5 years. Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. 77 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a 
success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably. Development costs are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, normally 15 years. External and internal 
costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.
Intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Research and development
In general, research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it occurred. 
However, as set out above, under certain conditions development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment  
is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition and directly attributable costs. Provision for depreciation  
is made so as to write off the costs of the assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives.
Principal useful economic lives
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 8-15 years
Computer equipment 4-5 years
Motor vehicles   4 years
Fixtures and fittings 10 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or on assets under construction.
Assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they come into use. Depreciation on assets 
so transferred is provided with effect from the month following the date of transfer.
Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, or more frequently 
if there have been indications of significant change in either.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with carrying amounts and are recognised within 
other operating income/expense in the income statement. 
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the year in which they are incurred.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to 
depreciation or amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use. 
Grants
Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in current and non-current liabilities as appropriate and credited 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the 
costs they are intended to compensate.
Fixed asset investments
The company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis and includes 
transport and handling costs. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production 
overheads based on the normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which inventories can be sold in the normal 
course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing 
state to a finished condition. Provision is made, where appropriate, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories. 78 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
I 2 3 4
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, less provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience, 
together with specific amounts that are not expected to be collectible. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest 
rate. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturity dates of less than three months 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdrafts. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions in each entity are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  
at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from  
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive 
income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the income statement.
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of  
the group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year. The balance sheets of foreign 
currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange 
differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign denominated subsidiary, the 
deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve (since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1) 
relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement. All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, 
with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to 
provide a hedge against the group’s net investments in foreign enterprises. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal 
of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the 
group’s activities. Sales revenue, which is net of returns, rebates and discounts, and which excludes value added tax and sales 
between group companies, represents the net invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised when the goods have either 
been delivered to or collected by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred  
to them. 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised by the company when payment is made by subsidiary undertakings.
Taxation
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowable.  
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets  
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have  
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related asset is realised 
or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged  
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred tax liability where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 (continued) 79 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Pension 
The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. All defined benefit pension plans are 
now closed to new entrants.
Payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The group’s obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans are valued by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. All group plans are funded externally, with the exception of Germany, where, in line with local practice, 
obligations are supported by insurance policies. Plan assets are valued at fair market value and are held completely separate 
from the group’s assets. Full formal actuarial valuations of obligations are carried out at frequencies of not more than three 
years and are updated regularly for reporting purposes. 
Amounts recorded in the balance sheet represent the fair value of external plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations. 
Amounts recorded in the income statement represent the current service cost over the reporting year, which is included in 
operating profit, and net finance income or cost , i.e. interest income on assets less interest cost on liabilities calculated using 
the discount rate, which is included as a separate component of finance income and cost. Other income statement credits or 
charges can arise for special events, such as a past service benefit improvement or settlement and curtailment of plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses  
on liabilities occur due to changes in actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date and also due to any differences between 
assumptions and actual outcomes. Gains and losses on plan assets represent the difference between interest income over the 
year and the actual return achieved. 
Share schemes
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based incentive plans as consideration for services received from 
employees. The fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised as an expense with  
the total amount to be expensed being determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of the 
awards includes any market performance conditions, but excludes the impact of any service or non-market performance 
vesting conditions and is reduced by any consideration received from employees. Any non-market performance or service 
conditions are included in assumptions over the number of awards expected to vest, and the total expense is recognised over 
the full vesting period in the income statement with a corresponding credit made to equity. At the end of each year the group 
revises its estimates of the number of awards expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions and recognises the 
impact of any revision in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable on share awards granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting 
period and is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Dividends payable
The liability for final dividends is recorded when the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recorded when paid.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred, except where they are directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 80 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
I 2 3 4
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations are initially 
and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market forward rates at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using market forward rates.
Gains or losses arising from the movement to fair value are taken to the income statement except where the derivative  
is designated as a cash flow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item  
being hedged and the hedging instrument, and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.  
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedges
The group has designated forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges, the effective part of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Gains or losses relating to any ineffective part of changes in fair value are taken immediately to the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the hedged transaction occurs, 
for example, when the forecast sale or purchase transaction takes place. 
Any movements in fair value occurring after the time when hedging contracts cease to be cash flow hedges are taken directly 
to the income statement. 
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses relating 
to any ineffective portion are taken immediately to the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to 
the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing the performance of the operating segments. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are incremental to normal operations and are separately disclosed by virtue 
of their nature or size to enable a better understanding of the group’s underlying financial performance.
2. Restatement
The group has implemented IAS19 (revised) “Employee benefits” during the year ended 31 December 2013. This has impacted 
the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income as outlined below:
• Administration costs of the defined benefit pension schemes of £0.8m for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been 
reclassified from interest cost to operating profit;
• Net interest income on plan assets is now calculated using the same rate used to calculate the interest cost on the pension 
liability, being the discount rate. Previously income on plan assets was calculated using a rate based on the expected return 
on the various asset types held within the investment portfolio. This has resulted in an increase in net finance cost on 
pensions of £1.5m for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
There is no change to the net pension liability or net assets as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 (revised), and therefore no 
restatement of the balance sheet is required.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 (revised) on the group’s results for the year ended 31 December 2012 is to reduce profit after tax 
by £1.1m, and to increase other comprehensive income by the same amount.

3. Segment information 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the group’s financial results on  
a geographical segment basis with three identifiable operating segments:
• Americas: which includes North America and Latin America.
• Asia – Pacific: which includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and the rest of South East Asia.
• Europe: which includes Continental Europe, UK, Ireland and Africa.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit. This measurement basis excludes 
the effects of exceptional income and expenditure from the operating segments. 
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. 
Finance income and cost, and net finance cost on pensions, are not included in the segment results that are reviewed  
by the Board.
Segment assets exclude tax assets, which are managed on a central basis.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities and non-current borrowings, which are managed on a central basis. 
Information provided to the Board is consistent with that in the financial statements. 82 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

The reduction in operating profit in the Americas primarily relates to US manufacturing issues, and in Asia-Pacific results  
from changes in sales mix towards emerging markets such as China, and adverse foreign exchange movements.
The lower corporate overheads are the result of increased levels of support for the operations by central teams, meaning  
a larger element of costs are directly attributable to the businesses, and lower Performance Share Plan costs in 2013.

Weighted average number of shares – diluted earnings per share 167,249,213 167,015,865
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent of £33.6m  
(2012: £32.0m) by 166,405,899 (2012: 165,479,397) shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue throughout 
the year.
Shares arising from the Performance Share Plan are only treated as dilutive where the effect is to reduce earnings per share. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £33.6m  
(2012: £32.0m) by the average number of shares, including the effect of all dilutive potential shares, of 167,249,213  
(2012: 167,015,865).
Earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated in order to eliminate the effect of exceptional items after tax  
in 2013 of £1.1m (2012: £nil) on the results. Basic earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated by dividing the  
profit attributable to ordinary shareholders before exceptional items, after attributable tax, of £34.7m (2012: £32.0m)  
by 166,405,899 (2012: 165,479,397) shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue throughout the year.

Formal procedures are in place to minimise, as far as possible, losses from non-collection of receivables. These procedures, 
which include designated levels of authority, cover the opening of new accounts, payment terms and the setting up and review 
of credit limits. Where considered appropriate, payment in advance or confirmed letters of credit are required before product  
is released to customers.
There have been no significant losses due to the impairment or non-collection of receivables in recent years.

23. Financial risk management and financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, 
liquidity and capital. It is the group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. These 
policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below:
Market risk
a) Interest rate risk
The group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps used to 
hedge inter-company loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements or interest rate 
swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Although 
group policy permits the hedging of up to 50% of interest rate exposures on borrowings for a period not exceeding five years, 
no interest rate hedging was in place at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable with any excess cash placed on deposit. Any deposits made 
are for periods of less than three months.
A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the group’s borrowings, cash and short-term deposits at 
31 December 2013, would result in a movement in finance costs of £0.4m (2012: £0.3m) and finance income of £0.1m (2012: £0.1m). 
This would result in a post-tax impact on the group’s income statement of £0.3m (2012: £0.2m) and a post-tax impact on the 
group’s equity of £0.3m (2012: £0.2m).
b) Foreign exchange risk
The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety 
of currencies. Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed 
by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks 
arising. Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for 
periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward. It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart 
from those created by inter-company loans or where foreign currency denominated assets are planned to be returned to the 
UK in the form of a dividend. Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging.

23. Financial risk management and financial instruments (continued)
The table below details the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the group’s post-tax profit for the years ended  
31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 and equity at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 due to the translation  
of receivables, payables, cash and derecognised currency hedges which are denominated in currencies other than each 
group company’s reporting currency. The movements in equity arise from the translation of cash flow currency hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the 
other currencies remain constant. The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the maximum annual percentage 
movement against sterling during the previous four years. In the case of sterling it is based on the maximum percentage 
movement against the US dollar during the previous four years. Results are shown for all currencies where the impact  
on group post-tax profits would be more than £25,000.

23. Financial risk management and financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures with customers. 
The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. These procedures limit the group’s exposure to any one party  
to approved levels. Exposure to banking counterparties is only permitted with approved banks which have one minimum  
short term rating of A1/P1/F1 with rating agencies S&P, Moody’s or Fitch. At the reporting date no single banking exposure  
was greater than £1.1m (2012: £2.5m). The group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk
The group has medium-term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the 
group. The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate local availability. Details of the undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are shown below:
2013 
£’m
2012
£’m
Expiring in more than two years 21.6 21.2
At 31 December 2013, the group had in place unsecured floating rate committed loan facilities totalling £61.0m (2012: £51.0m). 
These facilities are co-ordinated bilateral facilities which were renegotiated with four banks in September 2011. In June 2013,  
the committed facilities were increased by £10.0m. No other significant amendments were made to the committed facilities  
and they remain due to expire on 30 September 2016. 
The covenants related to the group’s loan facilities determine a minimum interest cover ratio, and a maximum gearing ratio. The 
group had significant headroom within both covenants throughout the years ending 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
In addition to the committed facilities, local uncommitted working capital facilities of £7.5m (2012: £7.5m), US dollars 2.0m 
(2012: US dollars 2.0m), Czech koruna 120.0m (2012: Czech koruna 120.0m) and Australian dollars 0.5m (2012: Australian  
dollars 0.5m) were also in place at 31 December 2013. These facilities are renewable within one year.
Capital risk
When managing capital, the group’s objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure. In order to maintain the capital 
structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares 
or sell assets to reduce debt.
The principal measure used to monitor the strength of the group’s balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the 
group’s net debt as a percentage of its net assets. Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Net assets  
are as shown in the consolidated balance sheet. The gearing ratios at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were as follows:
 
2013

Forward foreign exchange contracts – other, shown in the table above, relates to cash flow hedges that have been derecognised 
due to the relevant sales and purchases having already taken place, together with currency swaps used to hedge exposures  
in respect of inter-company loans.
Derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement 
hierarchy:
Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly 
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3   Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
All of the group’s derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value were classified as Level 2 as at 31 December 
2013 (2012: Level 2) and comprise forward foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in the table above. There are no financial 
instruments measured as Level 3. 
At 31 December 2013, the net fair value losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency  
risk of anticipated future sales and purchases amounted to £0.1m (2012: gain of £2.6m). These will be transferred to the income 
statement and recognised in other operating income or expense when the forecast sales and purchases occur during 2014.

The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The major schemes are of the defined benefit type 
and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are 
held in separate trustee-administered funds. The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. The total net pension 
cost for the group was £7.7m (2012: £6.1m), of which £3.5m (2012: £3.4m) related to the overseas schemes. On the advice  
of the actuaries, cash contributions to the group’s defined benefit schemes are expected to be £6.0m for the year ending  
31 December 2014 (2013: £6.3m).
The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited (UK) Pension Plan, which operates in the 
United Kingdom. The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2011. The other major defined benefit 
schemes operate in Australia and the United States. 
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the group’s material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2013

Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan experience. 
These assumptions are under continual review. The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2013 are based on the following tables:

*  Adjusted by -0.2 years for male non-pensioners and -0.6 years for female non-pensioners (no adjustment for pensioners)  
with CMI improvements using a long-term rate of 1.25% per annum.
The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Germany which, in common with typical 
practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies. At 31 December 2013, the value of the insurance asset was £2.4m 
(2012: £2.4m) and the value of the liability was £3.0m (2012: £3.0m). A proportion of the assets and liabilities of the German 
plan, relating to the period when the business operated as a branch of Devro Inc or Devro (Scotland) Limited, was retained  
by the group after the sale of Devro GmbH in September 2011.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the United States for which the group 
has made adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries. There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in 
respect of which appropriate contributions are made annually. The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements  
in the United States and Japan are included under the “other” heading in this note. 
The aggregate fair values of assets in the group’s defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2013 were estimated to be:

Investments in each of the main schemes are well diversified. Strategy is split between liability matching and return generating 
assets determined depending on the duration of the scheme, the funding position and the relevant country’s pension rules. For 
the UK scheme the investment managers are mandated to invest 60% of the portfolio in growth assets with the remainder in UK 
government bonds matched to scheme liabilities. For the US scheme a defensive approach is taken given the shorter maturity 
of the scheme liabilities with around 60% of the portfolio to be invested in fixed income assets and the remainder in growth 
assets, principally equities. For the Australian scheme the strategy is for 70% of the portfolio to be invested in growth assets, 
with the remainder invested in defensive, primarily fixed income assets. In all three schemes, the investment approach will be 
de-risked over time as the funding position improves and market conditions allow. 110 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

The net deficit position has decreased during the year. The value of the scheme assets was relatively stable in the year. 
However, the present value of the pension liabilities decreased predominantly as a result of the rise in discount rates. The UK 
scheme is the largest of the schemes and the discount rate increased from 4.3% to 4.5% in 2013, reducing net liabilities by  
£6.5m. Additional contributions will be made to the schemes in 2014 to reduce the deficit as part of a contribution profile 
agreed with Trustees following the results of the last triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2011. The group 
continues to pay contributions to pension schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and on the advice of 
qualified independent actuaries. The actuaries continually review the funding position of the schemes.

The actual return on plan assets in 2013 was £8.7m (2012: £13.1m). 
The cumulative re-measurements in other comprehensive income are £61.0m loss (2012: £72.3m loss).
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years, with benefit payments over the next ten years 
expected to be as follows:
£’m
In the next year 11.2
In years 2-5 45.1
In years 6-10 63.0
119.3
The schemes’ funds have been invested in a range of assets which are due to be realised in line with the associated liabilities. 
The trustees review the schemes’ assets and adjust the weighting between short-term and long-term assets to combine 
security and growth with the liquidity required to meet the obligations as they fall due.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure defined benefit scheme obligations:
Assumption Change in assumption
Indicative impact on defined benefit 
obligation (before deferred tax)
Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Decrease by £9.2m
Decrease by 0.25% Increase by £9.8m
Rate of salary increase Increase by 0.25% Increase by £0.2m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £0.1m
General inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by £2.1m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £1.8m
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by £6.8m
The above sensitivity analyses are based on the same change in assumption in each of the group’s schemes (except where 
changes are limited through the individual scheme rules), while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined 
benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the projected unit credit method is applied in the same way as for the 
calculation of the pension liability recognised in the financial statements.

25. Pension obligations (continued)
Risks
Through its defined benefit pension obligations, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which  
are detailed below:
  
Market volatility
The accounting estimate of net pension obligations is sensitive to changes in market conditions. The discount rate used  
to estimate the defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, or similar, whilst scheme assets  
are invested in a range of other assets, which are themselves subject to fluctuations in value. Changing market conditions  
and movements in the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension obligation on the group’s balance sheet, in other 
comprehensive income and in the income statement.
Choice of accounting assumptions
The value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial valuations over long-term cash flows. The actuarial 
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension 
schemes. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, and the final 
outcome could be significantly different to the assumptions used. 
However, the risk is limited in certain respects. The Australian scheme allows for a lump sum payment on retirement, so is not 
sensitive to changes in mortality assumptions, whilst the US scheme is frozen so that it is not sensitive to inflation or salary rises. 
Similarly the rate of increase in UK salaries is limited to 1% per annum.

27. Share-based payments
Under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan (“the plan”), the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee can make 
provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including Executive Directors. No payment 
for an allocation is made by a participant. Allocations normally vest over a three-year period, are conditional on the continued 
employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions. These performance conditions relate to 
growth in operating profit of the subsidiary undertaking in which the participant is employed, growth in earnings per share  
of the group, the company’s Total Shareholder Return in comparison to its peer group, or a combination of these. 
For awards where vesting is subject to the growth in earnings per share the fair value of an allocation represents the market 
value of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated 
dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period. A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period. 
The fair value of awards subject to the company’s Total Shareholder Return performance is determined using a Monte Carlo 
option valuation methodology.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year using this method was £2.07 (2012: £2.87) with the 
significant inputs to the model being the share price at the grant date, an expected volatility in the share price of 23.9%  
(based on historic trends), the term of three years, risk free interest rate of 0.77% and expected dividend yield.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations  
being achieved.
During the year 1,145,666 shares vested under the plan (2012: 625,000).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DEVRO PLC 
Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• The financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2013 and of the group’s profit and group’s and parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by 
Devro plc, comprise:
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets as at 31 December 2013;
• the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity and cash flow statements for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and, as regards the parent company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”)  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for  
our report. 120 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DEVRO PLC 
(continued)
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to be  
£1.9 million. This represents approximately 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items. We used profit before tax and 
exceptional items as we considered this to be an appropriate measure of recurring performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £95,000 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The group has manufacturing facilities in Australia, Czech Republic, Scotland and USA, supplying markets in Asia-Pacific, 
Europe and North and South America. The group financial statements are a consolidation of eight reporting units, comprising 
the group’s manufacturing locations, sales offices and centralised functions of which the four manufacturing facilities and head 
office are the most significant. 
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under 
our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to 
have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. 
Accordingly, of the group’s eight reporting units, we identified two that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial 
information due to their financially significant contribution to the group’s overall results. We carried out audits of the complete 
financial information of three further reporting units which we considered necessary to achieve sufficient audit evidence over 
the group’s activities. This provided coverage of 85% of revenue and 99% of profit before tax. Specific audit procedures on 
certain balances and transactions were performed at a further reporting unit where the significance of inventory held by this 
reporting unit to the overall group financial statements had increased. This, together with additional procedures performed at 
the group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all 
risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on 
those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 49. 121 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Carrying value of inventory
We focused on this area because of the higher levels of 
inventory in the group due to increased manufacturing  
output of product which had not yet been sold.
We tested the group’s compliance with its accounting policy 
in relation to inventory ageing and provisioning and assessed 
whether the policy is appropriate when considering the 
obsolescence of inventory. We compared the cost of the 
different lines of inventory against expected net realisable 
value, focussing on the higher value lines, to determine if the 
carrying value of inventory was overstated.
Development programme
We focused on this area because of the significant expenditure 
on development projects being undertaken by the group, 
namely in the USA and China, and the impact this can have on  
the carrying value of existing plant and equipment in the USA. 
Certain expenditure has also been classified as exceptional  
and disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
We tested the group’s assessment of the impact of the 
development expenditure project in the USA on the carrying 
value of existing plant and equipment to determine whether the 
carrying values are impaired and useful lives are appropriate. 
We obtained management’s list of identified assets and 
assessment of useful lives against the capital project plan  
and re-calculated the accelerated depreciation charge. 
We also tested the identification and disclosure of exceptional 
costs in relation to the USA and China capital projects by agreeing 
amounts to evidence that supported management’s assessment 
of the incremental and non-recurring nature of the costs.
Valuation of pension obligations
We focused on this area because of the materiality of the 
obligation to the financial statements and the key judgements 
involved in determining the net pension obligation including 
discount rates, inflation rates and mortality rates.
We evaluated the group’s key judgements, taking into account 
the specific characteristics of the group’s pension schemes. We 
challenged assumptions with respect to discount rates, inflation 
rates and mortality rates used by the directors by comparing 
them to our own, independently formed expectations.
Fraud in revenue recognition
ISAs (UK& Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel  
to achieve the planned results.
We tested revenue through confirming the settlement of 
sales transactions to accounts receivable and cash. We tested 
customer rebates by agreeing them to customer specific 
terms. We tested transactions around the year end date to 
check revenue was recognised in the correct period. We 
also identified material journals being posted to revenue by 
understanding the rationale for the adjustments and obtaining 
appropriate evidence.
Risk of management override of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.
We tested key reconciliations over material financial statement 
line items and manual journal entries. We considered whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors in the significant 
accounting estimates and judgments relevant to the financial 
statements that may represent a risk of material misstatement 
due to fraud. We also assessed the overall control environment 
of the group, including the arrangements for staff to “whistle-
blow” inappropriate actions, and held discussions with the 
group’s internal audit function.
Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 46, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the group’s and parent 
company’s financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the group 
and parent company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least 
one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of 
the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s 
and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 122 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DEVRO PLC 
(continued)
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements;
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 45 and 46 in the Annual Report with respect 
to internal control and risk management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law have not been made, and under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the report to 
shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the parent company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”). We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.

Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess 
the group’s performance, business model and strategy. On page 49, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has 
set out the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial statements, and how they were addressed. Under ISAs 
(UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group and parent company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 123 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 67, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group and parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

before publication of this notice); 
• the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is 10 pence, being the par value;

purchased;
• unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting, the authority hereby conferred shall

17.  THAT a general meeting of the Company, other than an AGM of the Company, may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ 
notice, provided that this authority expires at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company after the date of passing  
this resolution.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE AGM NOTICE
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. Appointment of proxies
A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend, speak and vote at  
a general meeting of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that  
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not  
be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in person. 
Members may register their appointment of a proxy either electronically or by returning the hard copy proxy form (where 
supplied) in accordance with the instructions set out below.
To be valid, the instrument appointing a proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it is 
signed (or a copy of such power or authority, certified by a notary) must be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrars, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY, not later than 11:00am on 28 April 
2014. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending or voting in person at the AGM,  
if they wish to do so. 
Shareholders can also register their appointment of a proxy to attend the AGM electronically via the internet by visiting  
https://www.eproxyappointment.com/ where full instructions are given. A proxy appointment made electronically will not be 
valid if sent to any address other than that provided or, if received after 11:00am on 28 April 2014 or, if the meeting is adjourned,  
if received less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is a non-working day) before the time of the adjourned 
meeting. Please note that any electronic communication found to contain a computer virus will not be accepted. 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may  
do so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via  
www.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take  
the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy 
Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with specifications of Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“EUI”)  
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number 3RA50) no later than 48 hours before the time appointed  
for holding the AGM. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied  
to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the 
CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that 
his CREST sponsor or voting service provider take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted  
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
2. Nominated persons
Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights  
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the registered shareholder by whom he/she was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person 
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give 
instructions to the registered shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in section 1 above does not apply to 
Nominated Persons. The rights described in that section can only be exercised by registered shareholders of the Company.
3. Corporate representatives
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of the 
same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member provided they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares. 129 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
4. Entitlement to attend and vote
To be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they 
may cast), shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the Company at 6:00 pm on 28 April 2014 (or, in the 
event of any adjournment, not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day that is not a working day) before the time of  
the adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of members of the Company after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded 
 in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
5. Poll vote
All resolutions at the AGM will be taken on a poll rather than on a show of hands, so as to reflect accurately the view of all of  
the Company’s shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised, including the votes of shareholders who are unable  
to attend the AGM but who have appointed a proxy. On a poll, each shareholder has one vote for each share held.
6. Website publication of audit concerns
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including 
the Auditors’ Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting. The Company may not require the 
shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with section 527 or 528 of the Act. 
Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement 
to the Company’s Auditors not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which 
may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Act  
to publish on a website.
7. Shareholders’ right to ask questions
Any member of the Company attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so 
would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer 
has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the 
Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
8. Documents available for inspection
Copies of all service contracts of the Executive Directors; and all appointment letters of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, Gartferry Road, Moodiesburn, Chryston, G69 0JE and at the offices 
of Clifford Chance LLP, 10 Upper Bank Street, London E14 5JJ during usual business hours. They will also be available at the 
place of the AGM from 10.45 am until the close of the meeting.
9. Issued share capital and total voting rights
At 7 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) the issued share capital of the 
Company consists of 166,779,230 Ordinary Shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company  
as at 7 March 2014 are 166,779,230.
10. Electronic publication
A copy of this notice, and other information required by section 311A of the Act, can be found at www.devro.com.
11. Resolutions
Resolution 1: Accounts and Reports of the Directors and of the Auditors
The Directors of the Company have a duty to present (to shareholders in general meeting) the annual accounts together with 
the Directors’ Report, the Strategic Report and the Report of the Auditors. The Auditors’ Report can be found on pages 119 to 
123 of this Annual Report.
Resolution 2: Final dividend 
The Directors recommend that a final dividend of 6.1 pence per share be paid on 16 May 2014 to shareholders whose names 
appear on the register of members at the close of business on 28 March 2014. Payment of the final dividend will bring the total 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 8.8 pence per share.
Resolutions 3 to 9: Election and re-election of Directors
In line with best practice on corporate governance, each Director of the Company wishing to remain a Director is subject to 
election or re-election by shareholders at each AGM. Gerard Hoetmer has been appointed a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company since last year’s AGM and will, therefore, stand for election to the Board for the first time at this AGM. All of the  
other current Directors are standing for re-election to the Board. All of their biographies are set out on pages 38 and 39  
of this Annual Report.
Resolutions 10 and 11: Reappointment and remuneration of the Company’s Auditors
These are standard resolutions proposing the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Auditors and 
authorising the Directors to determine their remuneration. 130 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE AGM NOTICE
(continued)
Resolution 12: Remuneration Report
Shareholders will be invited to approve the Remuneration Report set out on pages 50 to 63 (other than the part containing the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2013. In line with legislation, this vote will be advisory in nature 
and it will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration.
Resolution 13: Remuneration Policy
Shareholders will be invited to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which is set out in full on pages 52 to 56. This reflects 
a new statutory requirement to seek shareholders’ approval at least every three years (or sooner, in the event of a change in  
the Policy). On the approval of this resolution, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will take effect immediately. The Company 
will not be able to make a remuneration payment to a current or prospective Director or a payment for loss of office to a current 
or past Director, unless that payment is consistent with the Policy or has been approved by a resolution of the members of  
the Company.
Resolution 14: Allotment of new shares
This resolution is to renew, for a further year, the general authority to allot shares given to the Directors at the Company’s last 
AGM, held on 18 April 2013. Paragraph a of the resolution will give the Directors a general authority to allot up to 55,000,000 
Ordinary Shares, representing approximately one-third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding any shares 
held in treasury) as at 7 March 2014, which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. The Company did not 
hold any of its own shares as treasury shares as at 7 March 2014.
Paragraph b of the resolution proposes that a further authority be conferred on the Directors to allot unissued shares or rights 
to subscribe for shares in favour of holders of equity securities (which would include ordinary shareholders) as required by the 
rights of those securities or as the Directors may otherwise consider necessary, up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount  
of £11,000,000 (such amount to be reduced by the nominal amount of any shares or rights to subscribe for shares issued  
under the authority conferred by paragraph a of this resolution). This, the ‘section 551 amount’, represents an amount which  
is approximately two thirds of the aggregate nominal value of the issued and unconditionally allotted ordinary share capital  
of the Company as at 7 March 2014.
This resolution complies with the current guidelines, first issued by the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) in November 
2009, and, if the Directors do exercise the authority conferred by paragraph b of this resolution, they intend to follow best 
practice as regards its use. The Company’s practice of requiring each Director of the Company wishing to remain a Director to 
stand for election or re-election by shareholders at each AGM would already satisfy the ABI’s recommendation that Directors 
stand for re-election at the next AGM following any decision to exercise the authorities sought under this resolution. Other than 
in relation to the Company’s employee share plans, the Directors have no present intention to use these authorities, which will 
expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company and 30 June 2015. As is normal practice, the Directors 
intend to seek renewal of these authorities at subsequent AGMs.
Resolution 15: Pre-emption rights
This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks to renew the authority conferred on the Directors at the 
last AGM to issue equity securities of the Company for cash without application of the pre-emption rights as provided by 
section 561 of the Act. The authorities being sought provide for non-pre-emptive allotments of equity securities (a) to ordinary 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings; (b) to holders of other equity securities as required by, or subject  
to (as the Directors consider necessary), the rights of those securities, and to deal with treasury shares, fractional entitlements  
and legal and practical problems in any territory, for example on a rights issue or other similar share issue; and (c) for cash up  
to an aggregate nominal value of £833,000 which represents slightly less than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 7 March 2014, which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. This authority will expire at 
the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company and 30 June 2015.
The authorities sought and the limits set by the resolution will also disapply the application of section 561 of the Act from a sale 
of treasury shares to the extent also specified in this resolution.
In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles, the Board confirms its intention that no more than 7.5%  
of the issued share capital will be issued for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period. 131 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Resolution 16: Authority for market purchases by the Company of its own shares
The authority for the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares granted at last year’s AGM will expire on the date of the 
forthcoming AGM. The Directors wish to renew this authority and a special resolution will be proposed to give the Company the 
authority to purchase its own Ordinary Shares in the market as permitted by the Act. The authority limits the number of shares 
that could be purchased to a maximum of 16,600,000 (representing less than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 7 March 2014, which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice) and sets minimum and 
maximum prices. This authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company and 30 June 2015.
Although the Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s Ordinary Shares, they 
consider that it is in the best interests of the Company to have available this authorisation, in case of circumstances when it 
would be appropriate to use it. They would only use it when satisfied that this would result in an increase in earnings per share 
and was in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to this authority may either be held as treasury shares or cancelled by the Company, 
depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of shareholders at the time.
As at 7 March 2014, there were share scheme award options over 1,189,108 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company, which 
represents 0.7% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s Ordinary Shares 
were exercised in full, these options would represent 0.8% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at 7 March 2014, 
the Company did not hold any treasury shares in the Company and no warrants over Ordinary Shares in the capital of the 
Company existed.
Resolution 17: General Meeting Notice
Changes made to the Act by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations increased the notice period required for general meetings of 
the Company from 14 clear days to 21 days, unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less 
than 14 clear days, and certain requirements are satisfied. In accordance with the Act, AGMs will continue to be held on at least 
21 clear days’ notice.
At the last AGM, the shareholders approved a notice period of not less than 14 clear days (other than for AGMs) effective until 
the forthcoming AGM. The Directors believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to preserve this ability and this resolution, 
which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next 
AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
It is intended that this flexibility will only be used for non-routine business and where merited in the interests of shareholders 
generally.
It should also be noted that in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. This condition is met if there is a facility to 
appoint a proxy by means of a website. 132 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013

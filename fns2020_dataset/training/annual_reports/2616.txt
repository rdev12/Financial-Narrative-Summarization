Financial Highlights  In 2012/13, the Burberry team navigated a challenging environment making 
excellent strategic progress and achieving another record financial result.
Sir John Peace
Chairman 
Strategically, activity was focused by Burberry’s core 
themes. In product, the team continued to refine the 
offering across categories. Innovative digital marketing 
activity brought a more engaging message to targeted sets 
of consumers. Flagship store openings extended Burberry’s 
presence in key gateway cities. Supported by these 
initiatives, the brand experience continued to be enriched 
and elevated. Burberry’s distinctive culture was further 
nurtured and reinforced, and continued to project externally 
through the work of the Burberry Foundation. These, along 
with the full set of the Group’s strategic initiatives, are 
discussed throughout this report.
This progress was also recognised externally. Interbrand, 
the global brand consultancy, once again named Burberry 
in its list of the world’s 100 most valuable brands. In the 
digital arena, Burberry led media think tank L2’s Fashion 
‘Digital IQ Index’ for the second year. On land, Fast 
Company magazine listed Burberry second in its ranking of 
the world’s most innovative retailers. And, in an indicator of 
cultural strength, professional platform LinkedIn identified 
Burberry as the 29th most in-demand employer globally.
Financial performance was also strong. Total revenue grew 
8% to £2bn, with adjusted operating profit increasing 14% 
to £428m. While overall results are strong, a look at the core 
retail/wholesale business, which excludes the impact of the 
legacy Japan licensed business, is more indicative of the 
modern brand’s progress. Here, retail/wholesale adjusted 
operating profit increased 17% on an 8% revenue gain. 
Adjusted after-tax return on capital was 35%. The Group 
ended the year with a £297m net cash balance, and the 
board has recommended a 16% increase in the full year  
dividend to 29.0p.
In addition to the team’s efforts, these results were also  
a function of investments over the past several years.  
The Group has invested heavily in stores, emerging growth 
markets, technology and new capabilities. While in line with 
Burberry’s growth objectives, it’s worth highlighting that 
some of these are particularly important in a more difficult 
external environment. For example, previous investments  
in information systems and business intelligence expertise 
brought greater visibility and enabled quicker and more 
precise action during the year. Looking forward, although 
the near-term environment presents many uncertainties, 
Burberry plans to continue to invest based upon a 
successful strategy, its distinctive culture and generally 
favourable luxury sector fundamentals. Consistent with  
this, in 2012/13 Burberry committed to one of its largest 
single investments to date with its decision to integrate the 
fragrance and make-up business. Operating as of 1 April 
2013, Beauty offers an exciting growth platform  
for the future.
The year also brought important management changes. 
Stacey Cartwright, Executive Vice President, Chief 
Financial Officer and a director, will stand down in July 2013 
to pursue new interests. Stacey has been an outstanding 
contributor to Burberry during the past nine years, and we 
thank and wish her well in future endeavours. We welcome 
Carol Fairweather as Chief Financial Officer and a director. 
As Carol has been with the Group for six years, most 
recently leading the finance function, this is a natural 
transition. Finally, John Smith, former Chief Executive of 
BBC Worldwide and a non-executive director, joined 
Burberry’s executive team as Chief Operating Officer in 
March. John’s deep experience in digital media is an 
important addition to the Group. In keeping with this 
dynamic, growing business, we expect to continue  
to evolve board composition going forward.
On behalf of the Board, I thank the global team for their 
efforts during a challenging year and congratulate them  
on their achievements. By executing a consistent strategy 
in pursuit of clear objectives – clarity of the luxury brand 
message, sustainable growth and great company –  
the Burberry team has generated substantial value for 
shareholders in this and years past. Similarly, on behalf  
of the Board and team, I thank shareholders for their 
continued support.

Chairman’s Letter
strong 
RESULTS From outstanding performance in 2011/12, Burberry began the year cautiously 
optimistic, our long-range objectives – ensuring clarity of the luxury brand message, 
enabling sustainable growth and being a great company – firmly in sight. 
Angela Ahrendts
Chief Executive Officer
This combination of optimism and determination, fuelled  
by the brand’s wealth of opportunity, suggested continued 
pursuit of the investment-oriented strategic agenda in the 
year ahead. At the same time, this pre-disposition was 
tempered by uncertainties in the macro environment and the 
goal to deliver near-term financial performance. In the final 
analysis, the result was a balance of dynamic management, 
core execution and strategic investment.
Challenging context 
Following standout growth in 2011 relative to the range  
of consumer sectors, luxury slowed dramatically in 2012. 
The ongoing economic crisis in the Eurozone and a 
continued sluggish US weighed on all areas of consumer 
spending. Although most of Asia remained relatively 
healthy, the Chinese consumer – which accounts for  
a majority of luxury consumption growth – was subdued  
by a secularly decelerating economy complicated by 
government transition. Industry experts estimate that luxury 
sector growth declined from 13% in 2011 to 5% in 2012. 
Within that, ready-to-wear brands and businesses were 
disproportionately affected. For Burberry, this climate 
manifested itself in a decline in store traffic and greater 
weekly sales volatility.
Dynamic management
Internally, we talk about managing the business dynamically 
and focusing on the things we can control. 2012/13’s 
external environment tested the team on these dimensions. 
Supported by investments in information systems and 
business intelligence expertise during the past few years – 
which enable monitoring, analysis and implementation –  
we set out to do exactly that. 
Heightened conversion
The traffic decline placed greater emphasis on converting 
consumers entering the stores to customers. This effort 
included service initiatives that maximised time on the selling 
floor of our most skilled associates, increased inventory 
availability and improved selling skills and product knowledge. 
In terms of product, we expedited fashion assortments 
targeted at core luxury customers and refined monthly 
floorset execution to enhance the flow of fresh merchandise.

Chief Executive Officer’s Letter
striking 
the balance Targeted marketing
Aided by deeper consumer insight, we retargeted marketing 
activities in keeping with changing consumer spending 
patterns. The team increased the brand’s presence in  
high-profile outdoor and travel-oriented locations and 
experimented with new digital venues – some of which  
were contracted on a real-time basis. For festive periods,  
a cross-functional group refined programmes across 
product, visual and advertising to better highlight specific 
gift-giving opportunities.
Tactical efficiency
The Group also acted to enhance near-term efficiency. 
Discretionary expenses were tightly controlled and 
inventory was closely managed at all stages of the  
process in keeping with softer sales.
Core execution
Articulated by the five strategic themes, Burberry’s core 
strategy has been consistently executed over the past 
seven years, and actions to navigate immediate conditions 
did not sway us from this course. 
Blurring the physical and digital
Given a world of increasingly ubiquitous mobile internet 
access, we expect dissolution of the boundaries separating 
physical and digital channels. Consumers will see a single, 
continuous space in which to interact with a brand. Through 
a range of activities, we are working to integrate the benefits 
of the physical and digital spheres. Ultimately, the vision  
is to serve completely any consumer on any platform in  
any geography.
 · In this regard, the opening of the London flagship at  
121 Regent Street in September is our most ambitious 
effort to date. Housed in a period building restored in 
partnership with traditional British craftsmen, the store 
expresses burberry.com in tangible space – complete 
product assortment, RFID technology to trigger targeted  
multimedia content, omnipresent digital screens 
continuously projecting brand imagery. Burberry World 
Live, a store of the future, blending heritage and innovation, 
online with offline.
 · Additional integration initiatives included the expanded 
use of iPads to enhance inventory availability, continued 
upgrading of Retail Theatre throughout the store base  
to ensure synchronised delivery of brand content to 
consumers, and experimentation with new payment 
systems to streamline the purchase experience. 
 
 
Enhancing the product proposition
At the heart of the Burberry brand, product was a key  
area of strategic activity.
 · Elevation of the product offering is an ongoing process. 
In the year, we exited selected opening price points  
in heritage rainwear and leather goods categories.  
Exacting a cost in terms of sales, this is consistent with 
the brand’s positioning within the current luxury context. 
Similarly responding to consumer demand, we continued 
to invest in the upper tiers of our product pyramid, the 
Prorsum and London labels. These labels increased their 
share of retail sales during the year.
 · Although founded as a mens brand, Burberry is 
underpenetrated in mens. During the year, outerwear 
benefited from greater emphasis on innovation and 
design. Tailoring developed with broader assortments 
and expanded distribution. Closer attention to in-store 
timing of seasonal merchandise enhanced relevance of 
the offering. And the first fully dedicated Burberry mens 
store was opened in London in October 2012. Achieving 
a 13% revenue increase, mens was the fastest growing 
product division in the year. With mens integration only 
two years old, Burberry is in the early stages of 
capitalising on this heritage.
 · October saw the launch of The Britain watch for women 
and men. The Britain, featuring an advanced Swiss-made 
mechanical movement and more sophisticated design,  
is an important step in realigning Burberry’s watch 
business with the brand’s luxury positioning.
Engaging the Chinese consumer globally
Given their importance, efforts to better understand  
and serve Chinese consumers are an ongoing priority. 
During the year, Burberry conducted proprietary research, 
leveraging the results across functions: to extend product 
sizing and fit, to train sales associates in high-travel markets, 
to formulate occasion-specific marketing campaigns – 
citing a few examples. In the year, Greater China represented 
Burberry’s fastest growing major market and this consumer 
was prominent throughout the retail network.
9
Chief Executive Officer’s Letter Developing growth markets
Outside Asia, the Group continued to develop other  
growth markets. In the directly operated markets of India, 
Latin America and the Middle East, the Group opened  
net six mainline stores during the year. While some offer 
below average profitability today, we believe these markets 
represent important components of future growth.  
In regions operated through franchise partners, including 
Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe, eight stores were 
opened with expansion to five new markets, including 
Georgia and Jordan. New franchise agreements were 
signed for Colombia and Chile.
Expanding the retail presence
In addition to London, the year included flagship store 
openings in Chicago, Hong Kong and Milan. While 
contributing to sales, these brand statements in gateway 
cities present the complete Burberry to diverse groups  
of relevant consumers, many of them new to the brand.  
In total, the Group opened net 14 mainline stores,  
six concessions and five outlets during the year, and 
completed seven major renovations. Average selling  
space increased 13%.
Refining the wholesale presence
Efforts to align the quality of the brand’s wholesale presence 
with that of retail are ongoing. In both the Americas and 
Europe, we continued to concentrate on luxury-oriented 
department and specialty stores – with emphasis on 
dedicated real estate – while exiting legacy doors 
inconsistent with the brand’s positioning. This activity, in 
combination with the channel’s exposure to soft geographies, 
resulted in 1% underlying wholesale revenue growth for  
the year. 
As part of the brand proposition, Burberry looks to be  
a leader in consumers’ digital interaction with brands,  
in both innovation and capability. In marketing, the S/S13 
campaign generated record awareness through social 
media. Total Burberry YouTube video views reached over 
ten million during the year. RFID-enabled personalised 
content was introduced with the A/W13 runway show. 
Experimenting with emerging digital platforms, Burberry 
streamed live images of London weather to prominent 
outdoor sites in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Los Angeles 
and New York during the Olympic period. In commerce, 
burberry.com added Spanish and Korean languages  
and tested new fulfilment options.
Strategic investment
While executing currently, the team invested in strategic 
initiatives with longer-term horizons.
Integrating Beauty
Among the most exciting strategic investments in recent 
years, the transition of Burberry’s fragrance and make-up 
business from a licensed to a directly operated business 
began in the year.
 · Offering luxury’s opening price point and broadest 
distribution, fragrance is the most widely encountered 
expression of the Burberry brand. The category also 
accounts for a large percentage of global brand media 
spend. As a result, direct operation will assist in 
optimising brand presence in every market, further 
enable Burberry to capitalise on the synergistic 
relationship with fashion, and better align the product 
offering with brand architecture. Integration elevates  
this business to true core activity, allowing Burberry  
to capture the full opportunity.
 · In terms of opportunity, despite Burberry’s position 
among the largest luxury apparel and accessories brands 
globally, it is undersized in fragrance. Growth has been 
slow, with fragrance significantly underperforming the 
rest of the Group over the past five years. In make-up, 
the brand has only just started.
 · From the decision to integrate in October, the team 
moved quickly across functions, leveraging existing skills 
and resources while adding external category-specific 
talent and capability. As of 1 April, Beauty had been 
successfully integrated and commenced operating. 
Burberry’s fifth product division, Beauty is a growth 
platform of the future.
Evolving customer dialogue
In a landscape of Big Data and continuous communication, 
we believe information-intensive, deep customer relationships 
which allow an individualised customer dialogue will be 
critical to future success in luxury. As part of this, the Group 
began developing new tools to provide an integrated  
view of a customer’s interaction with the brand across  
all Burberry platforms, with initial piloting of a clienteling 
application commencing at year end. Development work  
to enhance consumers’ ability to engage the brand through 
mobile devices also progressed in the year.
10
Chief Executive Officer’s Letter Transitioning the Japan legacy
In Japan, transition from the legacy licensed business  
to global integration continued. As part of this, Burberry’s 
early stage retail operation achieved strong growth at 
existing stores and concessions, opened a concession, 
added a third store and planned additional openings in 
2013/14; while the effect of licence terminations continued 
to reduce legacy royalty income.
Reinforcing the supply chain
To accommodate future growth objectives, the Group 
reinforced the supply chain. In logistics, Burberry added 
distribution capacity, upgraded existing facilities and 
increased network efficiency. In sourcing, additional 
resources were committed to further develop in-house 
outerwear manufacturing capability and improve raw 
material management.
Strong financial results
This balance of activity delivered record financial results  
in 2012/13 while positioning Burberry well for years ahead. 
Total revenue increased 8% underlying to £2bn. Retail 
revenue grew 12% driven by new space and a 5% 
comparable store gain. Soft European markets particularly 
weighed on wholesale, resulting in a 1% underlying revenue 
increase. The 1% underlying decline in licensing revenue 
was a product of double-digit growth among global licences 
more than offset by declining legacy Japan royalties. 
Adjusted operating profit increased 14% to £428m, with the 
core retail/wholesale segment increasing 17% on 8% 
revenue growth – retail/wholesale operating margin also 
reached a record 17.8%. Capital expenditure totalled £176m 
and the Group ended the year with £297m in net cash. 
Powerful culture
Burberry’s culture is a key ingredient to this success. 
Rooted in the brand’s core values and fuelled by a  
creative-thinking, entrepreneurial spirit, our connected, 
united culture creates an energy that enables innovation, 
coordination and agility. These characteristics are evident 
in the year’s accomplishments. This distinctive culture  
is also expressed externally through ethical trade and 
sustainability efforts, employee engagement with local 
communities and the Burberry Foundation, which contributes 
both human and capital resources to encourage youth  
to realise their dreams through the power of creativity.  
We continued to invest in this powerful culture throughout 
the organisation – communication initiatives, operating 
structures, reward programmes and celebrations.  
The bigger the business becomes, the more connected  
we will need to be. 
A great community
Through the efforts of this great team we largely realised 
our objectives. So I thank them, as well as Burberry’s 
extended community of franchise and licensing partners, 
customers and suppliers, for their passion, commitment 
and hard work during the year. Looking forward, this team 
provides confidence for markets favourable or not.

Strategic Themes  Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Brand momentum
Ensuring the strength, purity and positioning of the 
Burberry brand remained a priority.
Burberry World Live
 · Burberry Regent Street opened in London in September 
2012 as the brand’s most comprehensive expression  
to date. Introducing the concept of ‘Burberry World Live’, 
Regent Street blurred the physical and the digital to bring 
all aspects of burberry.com (‘Burberry World’) to life  
in a meticulously-restored heritage space.
 · Offering the full collection in a digitally-enriched environment, 
Regent Street engaged customers with brand content 
continuously projected on over 100 screens throughout 
the store, including product-specific content triggered by 
RFID-enabled merchandise on mirrors that turn instantly 
to screens. In-store audiences could watch key brand 
moments live from other locations, including the 
womenswear S/S13 and A/W13 runway shows.
 · Regent Street also gave physical expression to the 
brand’s most innovative digital launches. This included 
live music events featuring Burberry Acoustic artists  
and the first in-store Burberry Bespoke experience. 
Beauty
 · In October 2012, Burberry announced the transition  
of its fragrance and make-up business from a licensed  
to a directly operated structure. 
 · As consumers’ most widely encountered expression  
of the Burberry brand, Beauty provides outstanding 
growth opportunities for the Group. Business integration 
was completed during the year with operations 
commencing on 1 April 2013.
Digital
 · Investments in burberry.com continued with expanded 
delivery to over 100 countries, while the introduction  
of Spanish and Korean brought the number of languages 
online to eight.
 · Retail theatre was rolled out to a further 84 stores, 
extending the global streaming of brand content in all 
flagship markets.
Brand recognition
 · Listed in Interbrand’s ‘Top 100 Global Brands’ for the 
fourth consecutive year, Burberry was named the luxury 
fashion brand with the greatest increase in brand value. 
Burberry was cited by Altagamma as the luxury brand 
with the highest digital customer awareness and led 
media think tank L2’s ‘Fashion Digital IQ Index’ for the 
second year, as well as being named by L2 as the fashion 
brand with the highest ‘digital IQ’ in China. LinkedIn ranked 
Burberry the 29th most in-demand employer globally.
Marketing innovation
Continued extension of its reach through marketing 
innovation, leveraging brand content to engage  
and connect global audiences.
Digital engagement
 · Brand excitement was driven globally across a range  
of platforms. The S/S13 main campaign generated  
record awareness through social and traditional media, 
with the launch video generating over 1.7 million views  
on YouTube and Burberry trending globally on Twitter.  
The womenswear A/W13 show was streamed live  
on Twitter for the first time, allowing followers to embed 
the show stream in personal newsfeeds. 
 · Burberry finished the year as the most followed luxury 
brand on Facebook, with nearly 15 million fans. Total 
lifetime YouTube video views reached nearly 24 million 
and the brand’s combined Twitter following was over  
two million. Burberry was also the leading luxury  
lifestyle brand on Instagram.
Outdoor investment
 · Investment was increased in out-of-home marketing  
in key markets. To emphasise the brand’s association 
with weather, Burberry streamed live images of London 
scenes simultaneously throughout the Olympic period  
to prominent outdoor sites in London, Paris, Hong Kong, 
Los Angeles and New York. 
 · The Art Of The Trench social media platform was taken  
to outdoor spaces in London and Chicago in conjunction 
with flagship store launches. 
 · More broadly, the brand secured key airport and iconic 
urban locations on a long-term basis.

Strategic Themes Product excellence
Burberry creates great product through intensive focus  
on design innovation, quality and core heritage icons.
Outerwear
 · Outerwear is the core of the apparel business, 
underpinned by monthly fashion groups and a robust 
replenishment programme. Leveraging the brand’s 
unique heritage together with design innovation and 
excellence, outerwear accounted for about 50% of 
mainline apparel sales. The iconic trench coat continued 
to be a central feature of the brand’s marketing activities. 
Mens
 · Investments in infrastructure saw increased product  
and marketing excellence in men’s outerwear, London 
and Brit. As the fastest growing product division,  
mens represented 24% of retail/wholesale revenue.
 · Retail sales of men’s tailoring, available in over 70 mainline 
stores, grew by nearly 70% year-on-year and the first 
dedicated standalone mens store opened in 
Knightsbridge, London.
Product hierarchy
 · Burberry Prorsum and London continued to outperform, 
reflecting customer preferences and representing about 
half of womens and mens mainline retail sales.
 · An ongoing focus on innovative product, marketing  
and merchandising and a shift in the product pyramid 
mix drove growth in mainline average unit retail prices.
 · Runway Made to Order launched, continuing to put  
the Burberry customer at the centre of increasingly 
personalised luxury experiences. Engraved nameplates 
could be added to custom-made outerwear and bags from 
the womenswear A/W13 collection. Smart personalisation 
technology was introduced to unlock bespoke digital 
content relating to each item on touchscreen devices.

ACCESSORIES
36
Strategic Themes   Accessories remained Burberry’s largest product division, 
contributing 39% of total retail/wholesale revenue and 
recording underlying growth of 8%. 
Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Men’s accessories
 · Continued investments in product design, development 
and marketing drove an increase in sales of over 30%,  
to account for nearly 20% of total mainline accessories 
revenue. Growth in this category was particularly strong 
in Asia Pacific and on burberry.com.
Soft accessories
 · Continued diversification and innovation in fabrications 
and prints, supported by enhanced visual merchandising, 
enabled outperformance in this key category.
 · Scarves, one of the largest trans-seasonal businesses, 
performed strongly, driven by a balanced offer across 
cashmere and lighter-weight blends.
Large leather goods
 · Accounting for around half of all mainline accessories 
revenue, large leather goods remained the backbone  
of this category. Growth was driven by focused 
marketing of key fashion shapes and continued innovation 
in the core leather programme, including the launch of 
the Heritage Grain collection.
 · Following a successful launch in the womenswear A/W12 
collection, the Orchard bag was subsequently introduced 
as a replenishment style and became the brand’s 
second-best selling shape within a year. 
Festive
 · The seamless execution of giftable product was  
a focus throughout the year, with a particular emphasis 
on accessories. New experiences were created on 
burberry.com and brand marketing campaigns were 
synchronised across all platforms to drive awareness  
and sales growth around key global holiday periods.
Watches
 · With the introduction of The Britain, Burberry took  
a major step in realigning its watches with the brand’s 
global luxury positioning.
 · Inspired by the iconic trench coat, the mechanical watch 
collection for men and women celebrated the brand’s 
values of functional design and craftsmanship.
 · The launch included a bespoke mobile experience, 
featuring a to-scale interactive 3D model of the  
watch displaying the user’s time, location and local 
weather conditions.
Eyewear
 · A continued focus on product development  
and distribution drove robust sales growth.
 · Product activity included the addition of two high-profile 
collections in the year. The Aviator sunglasses collection 
was launched with a digitally-led music campaign,  
which included live performances by Burberry Acoustic 
bands in Milan, New York, Paris and Sydney. Splash 
sunglasses were introduced at the womenswear and 
menswear S/S13 runway shows and featured in the main 
advertising campaign.

social and online learning tools to enhance the expertise 
of sales associates in delivering a seamless experience

brand messaging across all customer touchpoints.
Customer focus
 · Investment in customer service continued with  
the opening of a new service centre in Shanghai.  
These facilities supported Burberry customers 24/7  
by phone, email, live chat in 11 languages and via  
a dedicated customer service Twitter account. 
 · Global customer analytics and insight capabilities, 
together with the development of enhanced customer 
intelligence tools, began to drive deeper understanding 
of customer trends.

exceptional service, continued to grow globally,  
with the investment focused in flagship markets.

a three-storey space in the refurbished Macy’s Herald 
Square, New York. 
External recognition

second-largest store in North America, was awarded 
‘2013 Development of the Year’ by the Greater North 
Michigan Avenue Association.

opportunities in both developed markets like the United States and the growth 
economies of China, India and the Middle East. A range of distribution 
channels and business models are used to address these opportunities.

Strategic Themes   Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Engaging the Chinese luxury consumer
 · Leveraging proprietary research into the Chinese luxury 
consumer, Burberry refined services to these customers 
at home and abroad. 
 · Over 150 Mandarin-speaking sales associates were 
integrated into teams across top tourist destinations 
outside Asia. In China, a specialised sales and service 
programme was developed, enhancing the customer 
experience and driving brand consistency. 
 · Bespoke product assortments were developed  
for stores in China, key tourist destinations and  
on burberry.com, to coincide with the Golden Week  
and Chinese New Year holidays. 
 · The brand’s digital presence continued to be 
strengthened, engaging customers with dedicated 
content across multiple Chinese platforms. 
Developing the Middle East
 · The store portfolio in the Middle East was extended with 
the opening of five new stores across Kuwait, UAE and 
Saudi Arabia.
 · Customised Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha campaigns were 
introduced in-market and on burberry.com, engaging 
customers at these peak gifting periods. 
Building Central and Latin America
 · The brand’s footprint in Latin America increased with the 
opening of four new stores in Brazil – São Paulo, Recife 
and two in Rio de Janeiro.
 · Leases were signed to open a planned three further retail 
stores in Antara, Santa Fe and Cancun.
 · New franchise agreements were signed for Colombia, 
Chile and Barbados.
Entering new markets
 · Recognising the potential volatility in emerging markets, 
Burberry continued to work with franchisees and partners 
in countries where it has more limited experience, 
benefiting from local expertise.
 · During the year Burberry opened stores in five new markets: 
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia. 
Elevating wholesale presence
 · Securing appropriate in-store locations and refining 
assortments, Burberry made further progress in aligning 
its wholesale presence with the global brand positioning.
 · North American department stores performed strongly 
with further expansion of dedicated shop-in-shops.

EXCELLENCE

Strategic Themes   Burberry continued to drive operational improvements and 
increased efficiency across all global functions, with a 
particular focus on technology, planning and supply chain.
Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Technology investments
Process innovation
 · Back office finance and HR functions continued to evolve 
with enhanced governance, risk and compliance systems. 
Automated and standardised processes were introduced 
to enable scalable growth and to support the incorporation 
of the Beauty division.
 · Technology was leveraged to enable the rapid delivery  
of consolidated data such as product details, customer 
and transaction information to front-end applications, 
including the development of an iPad-enabled digital 
catalogue for showrooms.
Social entity
 · Continued development and deployment of Burberry’s 
internal communications portal connected and engaged 
employees worldwide with chat forums, video content 
and tailored working groups. 
 · In November 2012, this was rolled out to select external 
partners, reinforcing and enhancing the connections 
between the business and its global constituencies  
and facilitating greater transparency, efficiency  
and responsiveness.
Planning
 · Assortment planning and inventory management 
continued to improve, balanced by product division, 
label, category and price point.
 · The global brand buy, a common product assortment 
across Burberry stores, provided increased supply chain 
efficiency, while maintaining regional flexibility.
Supply chain
Optimising logistics
 · Logistical enhancements were implemented to provide 
capacity for long-term growth. The regional distribution 
hub in Piacenza, Italy was expanded to optimise 
European logistics activities, while in Asia Pacific a new 
distribution centre in Kwai Chung, Hong Kong was 
opened to service China. 
 · Digital commerce operations in Europe moved  
in-house, with all online customer orders fulfilled by  
the recently-enhanced UK distribution centre in Blyth. 
Investment in UK manufacturing
 · Additional capital investments in Castleford, the brand’s 
heritage rainwear manufacturing facility, enabled seamless 
end-to-end product development and production, 
increasing accuracy and efficiency. 
 · The Woodrow facility, where the brand’s iconic gabardine 
fabric is woven, was renamed Burberry Mill to align the 
site more closely with the brand. Burberry Mill benefited 
from the integration of finance, HR and site management 
resources with Castleford during the year.

Retail
71% of revenue (2012: 68%); generated from 206 mainline 
stores, 214 concessions within department stores, digital 
commerce and 49 outlets. 
 · Retail sales increased by 12% on an underlying  
and reported FX basis.
 · Comparable store sales increased by 5%  
(H1: 3%; H2: 7%).
 · New space contributed the balance of growth (7%). 
 · Average retail selling space increased by 13%  
(2012: 14% excluding China acquisition).
During FY 2013, retail trading was uneven, with comparable 
store sales growth of 6%, 1%, 6% and 8% by quarter, achieved 
against double-digit growth throughout the previous year.
Product, marketing and customer service initiatives drove 
strong performance in the second half festive periods 
including Christmas and Chinese New Year. Digital was 
further optimised, with innovative marketing and monthly 
global messages leveraged and synchronised online and 
offline, responding to rapidly changing consumer behaviour.
Overall, store traffic was soft, offset by increased 
conversion rates and higher average transaction values. 
Online traffic and conversion were up significantly.
With continued focus on the execution of proven retail 
strategies, the drivers of growth were consistent with 
previous years.
 · Outerwear and large leather goods remained at about 
half of mainline revenue.
 · Replenishment remained at about half of mainline revenue.
 · Burberry Prorsum and London penetration increased  
by four percentage points to reach 49% of mainline 
apparel revenue.
 · Mens and men’s accessories accounted for over half  
the growth in mainline revenue.
There was positive comparable store sales growth  
in all four regions during the year.
Asia Pacific
Nearly 90% of Asia Pacific revenue came from retail. China 
and Hong Kong both delivered double-digit comparable 
store sales growth in the year, while Korea remained weak. 
A net seven stores were opened in the region, focused on 
upgrading the store portfolio in China and in flagship markets 
including Hong Kong, with new stores in Pacific Place and 
Russell Street. 
Europe
Retail accounted for nearly 70% of Europe revenue. Following 
a strong first quarter, comparable store sales growth was 
broadly unchanged for the remainder of the period. France 
and Germany were robust and Italy remained weak. The 
United Kingdom, Burberry’s home market, accounted for 
over 40% of Europe retail revenue and delivered good 
overall growth, driven by the investment in London stores 
(Regent Street and Knightsbridge mens).
New store openings were largely in flagship markets, 
including London, Milan and Rome, which typically benefit 
more from travelling luxury customers.
Americas
About two-thirds of Americas revenue came from retail. 
Low single-digit comparable store sales growth in the  
year was weighted towards the second half. Approaching 
10% of Americas retail revenue came from outside the 
United States, with five stores in Canada, seven in Brazil 
and two in Mexico at the year end. 
Store openings included the rebuilt Chicago flagship,  
a further store in San Francisco and four openings in Brazil.
Rest of World
Retail accounted for nearly 60% of revenue for Rest of World, 
with 30 stores at the year end (23 in the Middle East  
and seven in India). Although uneven, high single-digit 
comparable store sales growth was achieved in the year, 
led by India. 
55
Financial Review Wholesale 
24% of revenue (2012: 26%); generated from sales  
to department stores, multi-brand specialty accounts,  
65 franchise stores and Travel Retail. 
 · Wholesale revenue increased by 1% underlying  
(down 1% at reported FX).
 · H1: up 5% underlying; H2: down 3% underlying  
as guided.
 · Growth in North America, Asia Travel Retail  
and emerging markets offset by continued planned  
account and product rationalisation.
 · Outerwear and mens outperformed other products.
Asia Pacific
Good growth was achieved during the year in Travel Retail, 
despite weakness in Korea. 
Europe
Europe remains the Group’s largest wholesale region at 
nearly 40% of wholesale revenue. Revenue was impacted 
by weak demand from domestic customers, especially in 
Italy, coupled with continuing planned rationalisation of 
small specialty accounts for brand and credit reasons.
Americas
The Americas is about one-third of Group wholesale 
revenue. Sales to North American department store 
customers again performed strongly, despite the greater 
impact of withdrawing entry price point products in core 
accessories and outerwear than in other regions.  
There was a further expansion of dedicated shop-in-shops  
during the year, reflecting brand segmentation initiatives 
with key customers. 
Rest of World
Wholesale revenue in Rest of World, which is mainly  
to franchise partners, saw good growth. 
At the year end, Burberry had 65 franchise stores,  
a net increase of eight during the year, including  
in Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia. 
 
Licensing 
5% of revenue (2012: 6%); of which just over 60% is from 
Japan (split roughly 85% apparel and 15% from three 
remaining short-term accessories licences), with the 
balance from global product licences (fragrance, eyewear 
and watches) and European wholesale childrens. 
 · Licensing revenue down 1% on an underlying basis  
(up 1% at reported FX).
 · Consistent with full year guidance.
 · Fragrance and beauty taken in-house from 1 April 2013.
At constant exchange rates, royalty income from Japan  
was down compared to last year. Income from the apparel 
licence, which expires in June 2015, increased slightly, 
reflecting higher minimum payments, offset by the planned 
termination and downsizing of the remaining short-term 
accessories licences in Japan.
Global product licences delivered double-digit percentage 
growth. Product launches included Body Tender fragrance, 
the Aviator and Splash sunglasses collections and  
The Britain watch, starting the realignment of Burberry 
watches with the brand’s luxury positioning. 
Burberry began directly operating fragrance and beauty 
from 1 April 2013. The royalty revenue (£27m in FY 2013) 
from this product category will no longer be received. 
56
Financial Review On 8% revenue growth, retail/wholesale adjusted operating 
profit increased 17% to £335.6m, resulting in a 140 basis 
point improvement in operating margin to 17.8%. This 
included a £12m benefit from a lower performance-related 
pay charge, due in part to the external environment being 
more challenging than budgeted. Without this benefit, 
adjusted operating margin would have been 17.1% compared 
to 16.4% in FY 2012. 
Gross margin increased by 250 basis points, driven by 
modest price increases, FX benefits on sourcing, improved 
inventory management and the mix shift to retail. 
The operating expenses to revenue ratio increased by 110 
basis points, driven in part by the shift to retail. Of the £94m 
increase, over half related to net new space. Spending by 
the largest corporate functions (marketing, IT, product  
and design) was tightly controlled, falling marginally as  
a percentage of sales, funding further investment in areas 
including digital.

(77.1) (10.2)
During the year, £82.9m has been recognised as an 
exceptional item relating to the termination of the  
fragrance and beauty licence relationship. 
 · Of the Euro 181m termination payment, £70.9m has been 
capitalised as an intangible asset and will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to  
31 December 2017. This intangible asset relates to the 
present value of the anticipated incremental income from 
fragrance and beauty which will be earned by the Group 
up to 31 December 2017. The annual amortisation charge 
is expected to be £15m.
 · The remaining £71.3m has been recognised as  
an expense, together with related costs of £2.7m.  
It is anticipated that this value will be recovered through 
increased income from fragrance and beauty beyond  
31 December 2017.
 · Set up costs of £8.9m were incurred during the second 
half of the year as Burberry prepared for the transition  
to direct control. These included marketing, product 
registration and headcount costs.
The restructuring credit of £0.6m relates to the release  
of a provision held in respect of the cost efficiency 
programme announced in January 2009.
The China put option liability finance credit/(charge) relates 
to fair value movements on the put option liability over the 
non-controlling interest in the acquired Chinese business. 
The credit in the full year was £5.2m (2012: £10.2m charge).
Taxation 
In FY 2013, Burberry had a tax charge of £91.5m  
(2012: £100.6m), giving a tax rate on adjusted profit  
of 25.8% (2012: 26.7%). Tax on exceptional items has  
been recognised as appropriate. The resulting effective  
tax rate on reported profit is 26.1% (2012: 27.5%).
The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2014 is currently 
expected to be about 25%.
Net cashflow 
Cash inflow from operations was £523m, an increase of 
£40m over last year. This funded significant investment 
during the year, with capital expenditure of £176m  
(2012: £153m) and £144m to terminate the fragrance  
and beauty licence relationship. Other major outflows  
were dividends (£114m) and tax (£99m). Net cash at  
31 March 2013 was £297m (2012: £338m).
Inventory at 31 March 2013 was £351m. Excluding Beauty 
(£9m), this was a 7% increase year-on-year at constant 
exchange rates, compared to 12% retail sales growth. 
58
Financial Review Outlook 
Retail
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry plans to open  
about 25 mainline stores and close about 15, while opening 
about ten concessions and closing about the same number. 
Openings are biased towards the evolution of the portfolio  
in China and further expansion in Latin America. Following 
two years of above average space growth, net new openings 
are planned to contribute low to mid single-digit percentage 
growth to retail revenue in FY 2014.
Wholesale
Excluding Beauty, Burberry expects underlying wholesale 
revenue to decrease by about 10% in the six months to  
30 September 2013 (2012: £253m). Wholesale customers 
globally planned more conservatively for Autumn/Winter 
2013 and there is a continuing impact from Burberry’s 
strategic rationalisation of wholesale accounts (particularly 
in Europe) and entry price products (particularly in  
North America). 
In addition, and as previously guided, with Burberry directly 
operating Beauty from 1 April 2013, wholesale revenue of 
about £140m and incremental retail/wholesale operating 
profit of around £25m is still expected in FY 2014. This will 
be weighted towards the second half, reflecting the impact 
in the first half of the move from licence to direct operation.
Licensing
In the year to 31 March 2013, licensing revenue, excluding 
£27m royalty income from fragrance and beauty, was £82m.  
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry expects growth from 
this level to be slightly positive at constant exchange rates  
and broadly unchanged at reported exchange rates, with  
the difference in growth rates largely reflecting the impact  
of the Japanese Yen hedge rate. 
In FY 2014, royalty income from Japan is expected  
to be broadly unchanged at constant exchange rates  
year-on-year, with higher minimum payments from the 
apparel licence offset by ongoing rationalisation of the  
three remaining accessories licences. The two global 
product licences (watches and eyewear) are expected  
to deliver double-digit percentage growth.
Retail/wholesale profit
For FY 2014, the aim is to modestly increase on the 
operating margin achieved in FY 2013, which was 17.1% 
without the £12m benefit of a lower performance-related  
pay charge. Reflecting the evolution and phasing of the 
business, adjusted PBT for the six months to 30 September 
2013 is currently expected to be below the level of the prior 
year (£173m):
 · Revenue continues to be weighted to the second half.
 · First half wholesale revenue, excluding Beauty,  
expected to be down 10% underlying, as guided.
 · H1 2012 benefited from a £15m lower performance-
related pay charge, as previously disclosed.
 · Beauty is expected to be dilutive in H1 2013, reflecting  
the short-term impact of the transition to direct operation.

Financial Review Effective management of risk is essential to the execution of the 
 Group’s strategic themes, the achievement of sustainable shareholder 
value, the protection of the brand and ensuring good governance.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives (its risk appetite), and  
for ensuring that risks are managed effectively. The Board 
has delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility  
for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management methodology. 
As part of this review, the Audit Committee considers the 
principal risks facing the Group and the nature and extent 
of these risks. The Group’s Internal Audit and Risk 
Assurance function facilitates a risk assessment process  
in each key business area and global support function  
to review the significant risks facing its operations and to 
record the relevant controls and actions in place to mitigate 
these. The detailed assessments are then consolidated  
to provide input into the overall Group risk assessment. See 
the Corporate Governance Report for further details of the 
Group’s risk management processes and internal controls.
The Board and the executive management team use a 
combination of different and complementary skills to assess 
the risks facing the business. In determining its risk appetite 
the Board considers a variety of information when reviewing 
the Group operations and in approving key matters reserved 
for its decision. This information includes:
 · updates provided by senior management on key strategic 
and operational matters;
 · information provided for the purposes of deciding whether 
to approve those significant matters which have been 
reserved for the Board; and
 · Group risk assessments facilitated by the Group’s Internal 
Audit and Risk Assurance Function and the reports of the 
external auditors.
The risks set out in the table on the following pages represent 
the principal risks and uncertainties which may adversely 
impact the performance of the Group and the execution of 
its key strategic themes. Other factors could also adversely 
affect Group performance and so the risks set out should 
not be considered to be a complete set of all potential risks 
and uncertainties.
The key steps the Group takes to address these principal 
risks are described in the table under ‘Mitigation’. It is not 
possible for the Group to implement controls to respond  
to all the risks it may face, and the steps the Group has 
taken to address certain risks (including those listed) may 
not manage these risks effectively.
The principal risks are not listed in order of significance  
and each of the risks should be considered independently. 
If more than one of the events contemplated by the risks set 
out occur, it is possible that the combined overall impact  
of such events may be compounded. 
Since the last annual report, the Group’s assessment  
of its principal risks has incorporated the following:
 · the macroeconomic outlook has worsened with 
expectations for global economic growth reducing, 
adversely impacting consumer confidence and  
sales growth;
 · the expiration of the Japan licence in 2015 will result  
in the loss of significant revenue to the Group. The Group 
is preparing plans for its business in Japan following  
the expiration of the licence; and
 · the Group has been directly operating its Beauty 
business since 1 April 2013. However, ongoing activity  
to integrate this business into the Group could divert 
management resources with an adverse impact  
on the Group’s other businesses.
60
PRINCIPAL 
RISKs
Principal Risks  Risk Impact Mitigation
Sustained economic slowdown. The Group’s performance remains 
strong; however, the sustained 
economic slowdown has: (i) reduced 
consumer wealth leading to a 
reduction in demand; (ii) impacted the 
financial stability of suppliers and their 
ability to secure finance which could 
disrupt the Group’s supply chain  
or lead to an increase in bad debts; 
and (iii) impacted the financial stability  
and recovery of banks and other 
financial institutions, all of which  
could adversely impact sales  
and profitability. 
The global reach of the Group helps to mitigate local economic 
risks. In addition, the Group’s financial reporting and review 
processes are designed to highlight any change in ongoing 
sales performance. Counterparty credit checks are in place  
for all key customers and suppliers, and flexible payment 
terms are used to assist suppliers as required. Group Treasury 
monitors the credit ratings of financial institutions which hold 
Group deposits to enable the Group to take appropriate action 
should there be a downgrade in their credit ratings.
Loss of key management or the 
inability to attract and retain  
key employees.
The loss of key individuals or the 
inability to recruit and retain individuals 
with the relevant talent and experience 
would disrupt the operation of the 
business and adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to deliver its strategies.
Competitive incentive arrangements currently exist, with 
specific initiatives in place designed to retain key individuals. 
Recent regulatory changes may make it more difficult to 
remain competitive in the global market for executive talent. 
Recruitment is ongoing and talent review and succession 
planning programmes are in place and have been updated 
during the year.
A substantial proportion of Group 
profits is reliant upon its licensed 
business in Japan and other key 
licensed product categories.
The licence with Sanyo Shokai and 
Mitsui & Company in Japan expires in 
2015, whereupon the royalty income 
under the licence will cease.
The Group expects licensees to 
maintain operational and financial 
control over their businesses. Should 
licensees fail to manage their 
operations effectively or be affected by 
a major incident, the royalty income 
may decline, directly impacting  
Group profits.
The Group is preparing plans for the transition of its business 
in Japan following the expiration of the licence.
To minimise risks in Japan the Group has its own operations  
in Tokyo.
There are minimum royalty payments specified in its licence 
agreements, including the apparel licence with Sanyo Shokai 
and Mitsui & Company. Under its licence agreements, the 
Group can control product development, marketing and 
distribution. Regular licensee royalty reviews take place to 
monitor compliance with licence terms, which can manage but 
not eliminate non-compliance.
The risk has been reduced due to the integration of the  
Beauty business.
The Group’s operations depend on 
IT systems and operational 
infrastructure in order to trade 
efficiently. Increasingly technology 
is also being used to stream major 
events and to communicate through 
social media.
A failure in these systems or a denial of 
service could have a significant impact 
on the Group’s operations and 
reputation, and potentially result in the 
loss of sensitive information. 
A number of controls to maintain the integrity and efficiency of 
the Group’s IT systems are in place, including recovery plans 
which would be implemented in the event of a major failure. 
The IT disaster recovery plans are tested on a regular basis.  
IT security is continually reviewed and updated and third party 
IT security specialists are used to regularly test these controls.
Failure by the Group or  
associated third parties to act 
in accordance with ethical 
and environmental standards.
A failure to act appropriately could 
result in penalties, adverse press 
coverage and reputational damage 
with a resulting drop in sales and profit.
A number of initiatives are in place, led by the Corporate 
Responsibility function. These include the continuing activities 
set out in the Great Brand, Great Company section. 
Over-reliance on key vendors. The Group relies on a small number of 
vendors in key product categories, and 
for specialist digital and IT services. 
Failure of one of these businesses  
to deliver products or services  
would have a significant impact  
on business operations.
The Group continues to strengthen its supply chain 
management function to enable it to evolve and develop its 
manufacturing base to reduce dependence on key vendors. 
The Group has continued to strengthen its internal digital and 
IT teams and continues to facilitate knowledge transfer to 
internal resources. Annual financial checks are carried out on 
all key vendors.
62
Principal Risks Risk Impact Mitigation
The failure to adequately complete 
the Beauty transition would 
adversely affect the Group’s return 
on investment. In addition, this 
incremental activity could divert 
management resources resulting in 
an adverse impact on the Group’s 
existing business.
A failure by the Group to deliver 
revenue and profit performance.
The Group has established Beauty as the fifth product  
division staffed by industry experts from both within 
and outside the organisation with priority being placed  
on sourcing, distribution and regulatory compliance.
Major incidents such as natural 
catastrophes, global pandemics  
or terrorist attacks affecting  
one or more of the Group’s key 
locations could significantly  
impact its operations.
A major incident at a key location could 
significantly impact business 
operations, with the impact clearly 
varying depending on the location and 
its nature. The impact of the loss of a 
distribution hub would clearly differ 
from a global pandemic, but both 
would impact revenue and profits.
Business continuity plans are in place to mitigate operational 
risks, but cannot ensure the uninterrupted operation of the 
business, particularly in the short-term. The regional spread  
of the Group’s key distribution hubs also helps to mitigate risk. 
There is a Group incident management framework in place that 
addresses the reporting and management of major incidents, 
and this is tested each year using third party specialists in this 
field. Tailored plans have also been produced during the year 
for a number of high impact events.
The significant growth and pace of 
change within the business puts 
pressure on both internal and 
external resources.
Failure to effectively manage the pace 
of change will inevitably adversely 
impact the Group’s operations and 
return on investment.
Governance processes are in place for each major strategic 
initiative and these are supplemented by regular meetings  
with senior management to review operational performance. 
Management and operational structures are continually 
reviewed to ensure that these support the Group’s growth. 
The Group’s operations (including 
now its Beauty division) are subject 
to a broad spectrum of regulatory 
requirements in the various 
jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. The pace of change and 
the consistency of application of 
legislation can vary significantly 
across these jurisdictions, 
particularly in an environment 
where public sector debt is often 
high and tax revenues are falling.
Failure to comply with these 
requirements could leave the Group 
open to civil and/or criminal legal 
challenge, significant penalties 
and reputational damage.
The Group continually monitors and seeks to improve  
its processes to gain assurance that its licensees, suppliers, 
franchisees, distributors and agents comply with the Group’s 
contractual terms and conditions, its ethical and business 
policies and relevant legislation.
Specialist teams at Group and regional level, supported  
by third-party specialists where required, are responsible  
for ensuring employees are aware of regulations relevant to 
their roles. A number of these teams were strengthened  
during the year. Assurance processes are in place to monitor 
compliance, with results being reported to the Group Risk 
Committee and Board Audit Committee.
The Group operates in a number  
of emerging markets which are 
typically more volatile than 
developed markets, and are subject 
to changing economic, regulatory, 
social and political developments 
that are beyond the Group’s control. 
Infrastructure and services also 
tend to be less developed.
Seizure of assets or staff. Related 
party business practice that is 
inconsistent with the Group’s  
ethical standards and the UK 
regulatory environment. Increased 
operational costs due to country 
specific processes driven by the  
regulatory environment.
The Group uses the services of professional consultants  
to advise on legal and regulatory issues when entering new 
markets, to undertake due diligence and to monitor ongoing 
developments. The Group works with franchisees or partners 
who compensate for its relative lack of experience in a number 
of these markets.
Unauthorised use of the  
Group’s trademarks and other 
proprietary rights.
Trademarks and other intellectual 
property (IP) rights are fundamentally 
important to the Group’s reputation, 
success and competitive position. 
Unauthorised use of these, as well as 
the distribution of counterfeit products, 
damages the Burberry brand image 
and profits.
The Group’s global Brand Protection team has continued  
to expand during the year to enable the Group to strengthen  
its brand protection efforts in a number of high risk markets, 
including in the digital environment. Given the Group’s 
emphasis on digital innovation the team places a particular 
focus on this area.
Where infringements are identified these are addressed 
through a mixture of criminal and civil legal action and 
negotiated settlement.
IP rights are driven largely by national laws which afford 
varying degrees of protection and enforcement priorities 
depending on the country. Consequently, the Group  
cannot necessarily be as effective in all jurisdictions  
in addressing IP issues.

Burberry Impact
The Burberry Impact programme, covering ethical trade 
and environmental sustainability, was introduced as  
a five-year commitment to make meaningful and lasting 
improvements to workers’ employment and workplace 
conditions, as well as to significantly reduce the company’s 
environmental impact. These commitments, informed  
by baseline assessments, were developed in partnership 
with Forum for the Future and with support from the Ethical 
Trading Initiative. The programme is supported by  
an advisory committee of external expert stakeholders  
and the Burberry Strategic Responsibility Council. 
Burberry Impact has four areas of focus: people, product, 
process and property.
People
Burberry expects all its suppliers to comply with local 
labour and environmental laws and the Burberry Ethical 
Trading Code of Conduct, providing their workers with  
safe working conditions and fair pay, and allowing them  
to exercise their right to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining. 
Further integration of ethical trade principles into 
commercial decision making continued to be a focus 
across the business, with opportunities identified  
to improve labour standards through strong supplier 
relationships. Engagement activities included announced 
and unannounced audits; monitoring; continuous 
improvement programmes supported by third parties; and 
the provision of training and confidential worker hotlines. 
Burberry continued to provide suppliers with the necessary 
tools and support to ensure compliance with the Burberry 
Ethical Trading Policy, including the Burberry Ethical 
Trading Code of Conduct. The Code is underpinned by  
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the fundamental conventions of the International Labour 
Organisation and the Ethical Trading Initiative base code.

Burberry
Beyond
Great Brand, Great Company Across its supply chain, Burberry endeavours to work 
through multi-stakeholder dialogue to contribute to 
sustainable change. Burberry continued to collaborate  
with peers and stakeholders, including Business  
for Social Responsibility and the UN Global Compact,  
as well as through its membership of the tri-partite  
Ethical Trading Initiative. 
Product
Burberry initiated an environmental baseline assessment  
of both direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) 
impacts from raw materials, energy, water, chemical inputs 
and waste. This detailed analysis enabled the identification 
of risks and priority areas for the business to focus reduction 
efforts at a regional, functional and raw material level.

with the suppliers of these materials is therefore critical  
to achieving Burberry’s product commitments. Working 
closely with other luxury brands and the Leather Working 
Group, Burberry committed to monitoring and improving 
the environmental management and traceability in its 
leather supply chain, working with tanneries supplying  
more than 65%
^
 of accessories leather.
Process
Burberry is committed to driving more sustainable 
outcomes throughout its worldwide operations. 
Reflecting its commitment to reducing energy consumption 
across the supply chain, Burberry conducted energy 
efficiency assessments at key vendor sites and distribution 
centres, which account for almost one-third of CO 2e
^
 
identified in the environmental baseline assessment.
Property
Leveraging the sustainability expertise of the Burberry 
construction team is crucial to the continued pursuit  
of more sustainable construction practices and energy 
efficiency in both existing and new buildings. 
Pilot energy saving schemes were introduced after store 
audits identified up to 65% kilowatt hours
^
 of potential 
energy savings in selected stores. The new Chicago 
flagship store achieved LEED Silver certification, using 
innovative technologies to increase efficiency.
Recognising that associate education and engagement  
is critical to achieving Burberry’s energy efficiency targets, 
a training programme was established and supported by  
a global challenge encouraging the submission of creative 
ideas for sustainable action.

Burberry Invest
Burberry Invest supports innovative organisations  
and programmes in Burberry’s communities worldwide, 
combining associates’ dedication, knowledge and creativity 
with corporate financial support and in-kind donations. 
Burberry donates 1%* of Group profits before tax to 
charitable causes, the majority to the Burberry Foundation 
(UK registered charity number 1123102), an independent 
charity that aims to help young people realise their dreams 
and potential through the power of their creativity.  
The Foundation has partnered with 32 charities to directly  
and indirectly inspire over 75,000 young people since  
it was established in 2008. Today, the Foundation is active  
in 14 cities around the world.
In addition to financial support, the Foundation made  
in-kind donations ranging from non-trademark fabric  
and materials to assist young people enrolled in art  
and design courses, to the annual Christmas Coat  
Donation programme, benefiting disadvantaged young 
people around the world. Total coat donations since  
its launch in 2008 reached 10,000. 
The Foundation launched Burberry Create, a bespoke six  
to eight week creative training and employability programme, 
delivered by Burberry associates at corporate locations 
worldwide. Designed to leverage the full range of Burberry’s 
competences to develop young people’s creative thinking

by the Global Health and Safety Committee, chaired  
by the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.

Great Brand, Great Company Reward
Burberry continued to strengthen the link between reward 
and performance across the organisation, with all 
associates in a bonus or incentive scheme and able to 
share in the success of the business through the All 
Employee Free Share Plan. Accessibility was improved  
for the global SAYE programme, complementing existing 
online applications with the UK launch of text and 
telephone requests, which contributed to a 20% increase  
in global take-up. 
The Icon Awards programme, which recognises exceptional 
performance at all levels of the company, reached its sixth 
anniversary. A record 10,000 nominations were received 
globally and 97 awards were presented across four regions, 
in categories inspired by the Burberry brand, heritage and 
core values. 
The Long Service Awards scheme celebrated the loyalty 
and commitment of around 700 associates who reached 
milestone service anniversaries with Burberry, including  
15 associates with 30 years' service or more. 
Reinvent
A new, fully cross-functional and global team was 
established to integrate Beauty into the wider organisation. 
This was achieved through strategic recruitment of Beauty 
expertise and the reallocation of talent within the business. 
Regional accountability for organisational design and 
development was ensured, reflecting the diverse markets  
in which Burberry operates.
The technology function was also evolved to support  
the Beauty integration, with strategic competences  
brought in-house.
Recruit 
Burberry maintained its commitment to diversity  
and equal opportunities in recruitment. Nearly 10,000 
associates from over 100 countries are now employed 
across all continents, with an age span from 16 to 77  
and a global management team that is 37% female.  
The diversity within the Burberry community underpins  
its energy, vibrancy and connectedness. 
Following the establishment of a new Resourcing  
Centre of Expertise in 2011/12, applications increased  
by 70% year-on-year and 82% of all recruitment globally 
was conducted directly.
Increased use of social media directly impacted these 
results. On LinkedIn, Burberry’s followers increased  
by 250%, leading to applications from the site accounting 
for 6% of global direct recruitment. In addition to being 
ranked LinkedIn’s 29th most in-demand employer globally, 
Burberry was the ‘most-watched’ midsize company  
by UK students.
Retain
Burberry continued to enhance its retail teams and secure  
a talent pipeline for the future. A pilot Retail Management 
Programme was launched to prepare retail associates  
for a career in store management, through a series  
of assignments, masterclasses and mentoring support.
An extended and improved new associate on-boarding 
programme was rolled out in London, New York and Hong 
Kong, including regular and consistent pre-communication, 
defined training modules and in-depth insight into the 
Burberry culture and values over a three-month period.
The Burberry Leadership Council supported the 
development of 75 high potential associates towards 
becoming next-generation leaders through international 
networking opportunities, global strategy off-sites, mentoring 
from senior executives and leadership training workshops.
Burberry recognises that its people are its greatest asset and constantly strives 
to attract the best talent worldwide, to provide meaningful development 
opportunities at all levels and to reward and recognise high performance.

Corporate Governance
Directors’

no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one 
vote at general meetings of the Company. The ordinary 
shares are listed on the Official List and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange. As at 31 March 2013, the Company had 
442,160,331 ordinary shares in issue, of which 30,027  
were held as treasury shares.
In order to retain maximum flexibility, the Company proposes 
to renew the authority granted by ordinary shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting in 2012, to repurchase up to 
just under 10% of its issued share capital. Further details are 
provided in the Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting.
At the Annual General Meeting in 2012, shareholders 
approved resolutions to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £73,000 and to allot shares for cash other 
than pro rata to existing shareholders. Resolutions will be 
proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting to renew 
these authorities.
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of holding nor 
on the transfer of shares which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
voting rights. The directors have no current plans to issue 
shares other than in connection with employee share 
schemes.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note  
26. The Burberry Group plc ESOP Trust has waived  
all dividends payable by the Company in respect  
of the ordinary shares held by it. In addition, the Burberry 
Group plc SIP Trust has waived all dividends payable  
by the Company in respect of the unappropriated ordinary  
shares held by it. The total dividends waived by the  
trusts in the year to 31 March 2013 were in aggregate  
£1.0m (2012: £0.2m).
With regard to the appointment and replacement  
of directors, the Company follows the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and is governed by its Articles  
of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended  
by special resolution of the shareholders.

the year are contained in the Great Brand, Great Company 
section on pages 66 to 71.
Political donations

Company’s approach in prior years, shareholder approval  
is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting,

and its subsidiaries to make donations and/or incur 
expenditure which may be construed as ‘political’  
by the wide definition of that term included in the relevant 
legislation. Further details are provided in the Notice  
of this year’s Annual General Meeting.
Employment policies
Diversity and inclusion
The Group takes a very inclusive approach to diversity.  
As a global business, we value people of all cultures, 
nationalities, races, religions and ethnicities, regardless  
of characteristics such as gender, gender identity and/or 
expression, age, disability or sexual orientation. Burberry  
is passionate about attracting, developing and rewarding 
the most talented and skilled individuals, regardless  
of background. The Group encourages its employees  
to work across functions, geographies and cultures  
to enhance understanding and create a connected global 
community. As the Group continues to grow globally,  
it is building on its long-term commitment to diversity  
and inclusion – embracing the cultures of all the countries 
where we do business. Burberry is committed to making 
79
Corporate Governance the necessary adjustments to support the employment  
of people with disabilities and provide training and 
development to ensure they have the opportunity to achieve 
their potential. In a situation where an employee becomes 
disabled during their employment, the Group will endeavour 
to assist the employee by offering additional training, 
adapting the job if appropriate or by offering a transfer  
to another position.
Health and safety
The Group has a health and safety strategy and policy 
approved by the Board and a Global Health and Safety 
Committee which is chaired by the Executive Vice 
President, Chief Financial Officer. Each region has a local 
Committee which reports into the Global Committee.  
There have been a number of internal and external audits 
carried out to provide assurance. There has been no 
enforcement action following a routine visit by inspectors.
Further information regarding the Group’s employment 
policies are provided in the Great Brand, Great Company 
section on pages 66 to 71.
Employee involvement
Employee communication
The Group believes that employee communication is 
important in enhancing the Company culture and connectivity, 
and in motivating and retaining employees globally. A 
robust global communications programme, incorporating 
various physical and digital methods and channels, enables 
all employees to connect and collaborate closely, and 
ensures they understand key strategies and other matters 
of interest and importance, quickly and efficiently.
Social media platform ‘Burberry Chat’ is the key digital 
channel used to communicate internally. However,  
other methods and channels are also actively leveraged, 
including face-to-face briefings, open discussion forums 
with senior management, email and instant messaging. 
Monthly video updates, highlighting the Group’s performance 
and its ongoing strategic initiatives are broadcast globally, 
as is the monthly creative thinking programme ‘Burberry 
Chat Live’, sharing inspirational interviews with employees 
from around the world. Finally, development of content 
such as videos and digital web pages to communicate key 
initiatives, events and other brand messages, continues to 
enhance internal communication, employee connectivity  
and the Burberry culture.
Employee share ownership
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships 
with employees of all levels and runs incentive schemes 
and share ownership schemes for the benefit of employees. 
Further details of these schemes are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 93 to 104.
The Group again intends to grant during 2013/14 free share 
awards or cash-based awards to all eligible employees.  
The Group also intends, where possible, to invite 
employees to take part in the Sharesave Scheme.
Further details on the Group’s approach to employee 
involvement and communications are provided in the  
Great Brand, Great Company section on pages 66 to 71.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives  
and policies are set out within note 25 to the financial 
statements. Note 25 also details the Group’s exposure  
to foreign exchange, share price, interest, credit  
and liquidity risks. These notes are incorporated  
by reference and are deemed to form part of this report.
Creditor payment policy
For all trade creditors, it is the Company’s policy to:
 · agree and confirm the terms of payment at the 
commencement of business with that supplier;
 · pay in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations; and
 · continually review the payment procedures and liaise 
with suppliers as a means of eliminating difficulties  
and maintaining a good working relationship.
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 March 2013 
(2012: £nil).
Significant contracts – change of control
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006, the directors  
disclose that in the event of a change of control  
in the Company, the Group’s £300m Revolving Credit 
Facility (dated 28 March 2011) could become repayable.
In circumstances of change of control of the Company, 
Angela Ahrendts may terminate her employment. Her 
entitlement in respect of remuneration in such circumstances 
is set out on page 97 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and is the same as it would be if her service agreement is 
terminated where the Remuneration Committee determines 
that Angela Ahrendts’ performance does not meet the 
financial expectations of the Board or shareholders.
Details of the service agreements of the executive directors 
are set out on page 97 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans may 
cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
upon a change of control.
80
Corporate Governance Essential contracts
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements  
with suppliers (both of goods and services), wholesale 
customers, distributors and licensees who manufacture 
and distribute products using the Burberry trademarks, 
subsidiary partners and franchisees. In addition, the Group 
occupies leasehold premises for the purpose of conducting 
its business. Whilst these arrangements are important  
to the business of the Group, individually none of them  
are essential to the business of the Group and do not require 
disclosure under section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act 2006.
Independent auditors
In accordance with section 418(2) of the Companies  
Act 2006, each of the Company’s directors in office  
as at the date of this report confirms that:
 · so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the Company’s auditors  
are unaware; and
 · he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought  
to have taken as a director in order to make himself  
or herself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are  
aware of that information.
The Group’s auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers  
LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Note 5 in the financial statements states the auditors’  
fees both for audit and non-audit work.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Financial Review on pages 54 to 
60, along with details of the Group’s cash flows. Details of 
the Group’s liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in notes 18 and 21. Financial risk management 
objectives, details of financial instruments and hedging 
activities, and exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are 
described in note 25.
The directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and 
projections. These include the assumptions around the 
Group’s products and markets, expenditure commitments, 
expected cash flows and borrowing facilities. Taking into 
account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
and after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly the directors consider it 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held  
at the offices of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row, 
London EC1Y 8YY commencing at 9.30am on Friday,  
12 July 2013. The Notice of this year’s Annual General 
Meeting will be available to view on the Company’s website 
at burberryplc.com.
The directors consider that each of the proposed resolutions 
to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole 
and are most likely to promote the success of the Company 
for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. The directors 
unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour 
of each of the proposed resolutions, as the directors intend 
to do in respect of their own shareholdings.

Corporate Governance Dear Shareholder,
The Board’s role is to provide leadership to the Group  
to assist it in achieving its strategic aims, and to promote 
the long-term success of the Group for the benefit  
of its shareholders and those with whom we connect.  
For an iconic brand like Burberry with a 157 year heritage 
guided by the values – to protect, explore and inspire –  
we believe that this is an important responsibility. 
With the integration of Burberry Beauty as the fifth  
product division and the continued focus on unlocking  
the potential of the Group’s digital platform, the Group’s 
business continues to grow dynamically in a global 
economic environment which remains uncertain. 
Consequently a key focus for the Board during the year  
has been on the execution of the Group’s strategy  
as it has evolved to embrace new opportunities.  
In particular, how the Group needs to manage and evolve 
its governance structures and people to support this 
growth without undue risk to the Group and the Burberry 
brand and culture.
Last year I reported that the Board would be focusing  
on how to build on its relevant skills and competencies  
for the future. This has been a considered focus of the 
Board during the year with the development of a Board 
succession plan. The plan sets out a phased strategic 
approach to refreshing the Board aimed at balancing 
evolution with stability. The plan aims are to maintain 
current core competencies which reflect the evolution  
of the Group’s business and to promote diversity both  
in terms of gender and in the wider sense to reflect  
the global nature of the Group.
In February 2013 we announced the appointment  
of John Smith as Chief Operating Officer. With over  
20 years’ experience in the media industry, John brings  
a unique skill set in global brand management and  
new media, combined with strong financial  
and operational experience. 
We announced separately that Stacey Cartwright, 
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer,  
had decided to resign following over nine successful  
years with the Group in order to pursue new interests. 
Stacey will step down from the Board at the conclusion  
of the Group’s Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2013. 
The Board would like to thank Stacey for her outstanding 
contribution to the Group.
Carol Fairweather will join the Board as an executive 
director on 11 July 2013, and assumes the role of Chief 
Financial Officer on Stacey’s departure. Carol has been 
with the Group for six years, mostly as Senior Vice President 
of Group Finance, where she has led the finance team. 
Carol has a strong track record as an exceptional partner  
to the business and the executive team.
The year ahead will continue to be impacted by  
a challenging external environment. It will also bring 
significant changes to the rules on directors’ remuneration 
and narrative reporting. Regardless of regulatory changes,  
I believe that as a global company it is our responsibility  
to continue to promote high standards of governance and 
reporting transparency. The Board and I will endeavour  
to ensure the Group’s continued success as a dynamic  
and well-governed business over the coming year.
Sir John Peace
Chairman
Governance
 “The Board is collectively responsible for promoting Burberry’s  
long-term success, for setting its strategic aims and ensuring  
a framework of prudent and effective controls.”
This report sets out the Board’s approach and work during 
the financial year 2012/13 and, together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 93 to 104, includes details 
of how the Company has applied and complied with the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code). The directors confirm that the Company 
has complied with the provisions of the Code throughout 
the year.
Our Board
The Board currently consists of eight members – the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice 
President, Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer 
and four independent non-executive directors. A list  
of directors and their biographies is set out on page 76.
The Chairman, Sir John Peace, has led the Board  
as Chairman since 2002. The Chairman is responsible  
for leading and managing the business of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. He sets the agenda for Board 
discussions and ensures that the Board receives accurate, 
timely and clear information, particularly in relation to the 
Company’s performance. He promotes a culture of 
openness and trust which allows for debate and 
constructive challenge of the executive directors.
The Chairman works collaboratively with the Chief Executive 
Officer, Angela Ahrendts, in setting the Board agenda  
and ensuring any actions agreed by the Board are 
effectively implemented.

Corporate
Governance report
Corporate Governance During the year, the Chairman maintained regular contact 
and met with the Senior Independent Director and other 
non-executive directors outside of formal board meetings. 
The Chairman also met with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors being present.
The Chairman is also responsible for the Company’s 
performance to shareholders and has regular discussions 
with the Company’s main institutional shareholders.
The major commitments of the Chairman are detailed  
in his biography on page 76 and have not changed  
during the year.
The Senior Independent Director, Philip Bowman, 
supports the Chairman in his role and leads the  
non-executive directors in the oversight of the Chairman.  
The Senior Independent Director is also available  
as an additional point of contact for shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors provide strong experience 
and independent support to the Board. They assist in the 
development of strategy and provide constructive challenge 
and support to management.
The Chief Executive Officer, Angela Ahrendts,  
is responsible for the management of the business, 
developing the Group’s strategic direction for consideration 
and approval by the Board and implementing the agreed 
strategy. The Chief Executive Officer is assisted  
by members of her senior management team who meet 
regularly. Members of the senior management team  
are identified on page 164.
The Company Secretary, Catherine Sukmonowski,  
is responsible for supporting the Chairman in the delivery  
of the corporate governance agenda. 
Role of the Board
 “Burberry continues to experience considerable growth and change. 
 With this success comes a responsibility for the Board to ensure we 
 grow in a controlled and sustainable way for our shareholders and 
 wider stakeholders, and that we understand the associated risks.”
The Board is ultimately responsible for promoting the long-
term success of the Group. The Board leads and provides 
direction for management by setting strategy and overseeing 
its implementation by management. The Board is also 
responsible for oversight of the Group’s systems of 
governance, internal control and risk management.
Specific key decisions and matters have been reserved  
for approval by the Board. These include decisions  
on the Group’s strategy, the annual budget and operating 
plans, major capital expenditure and transactions, financial 
results, the dividend, the approval of risk appetite and other 
governance issues. The matters reserved for the Board’s 
decision are set out in writing and available on the 
Company’s website at burberryplc.com.
Role of the Board Committees
The Board is supported in its activities by a number  
of committees including the following principal committees: 
Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 
Committee. All the non-executive directors are members  
of each of the principal committees of the Board. The Board 
believes this to be appropriate as the Board remains 
relatively small and ensures the linkage between the work 
of the Committees and the Board.
The terms of reference of each of the principal committees 
can be viewed on the Company’s website at burberryplc.com.
The Committees, if they consider it necessary, can engage 
third-party consultants and independent professional 
advisors and can call upon other resources of the Group  
to assist them in discharging their respective responsibilities. 
In addition to the relevant committee members and the 
Company Secretary, external advisors and, on occasion, 
other directors and members of the senior management 
team attend committee meetings but only at the invitation 
of the Chairmen of the Committees.
Set out on pages 89 to 92 are reports from the Audit  
and Nomination Committees. The report of the 
Remuneration Committee is set out on pages 93 to 104.

Corporate Governance Board effectiveness
 “As a Board we strive to provide effective leadership that constructively challenges management but also supports Burberry in achieving  
its strategic aims.”
Highlights of Board activities during 2012/13
During the year the Board held six scheduled meetings, including an in-depth two-day session on strategy. Each Board 
member attended all scheduled meetings. In addition, in April 2012 the Board spent five days visiting the Group’s 
businesses in Asia, including in Shanghai, Tokyo, Taipei and Hong Kong. Between meetings directors spend a significant 
amount of time on Board and Committee related matters. The Board considers that it met sufficiently often to enable the 
directors to discharge their duties effectively.
The Board agendas were shaped to ensure that discussion was focused on the Group’s strategic priorities, key monitoring 
activities, as well as reviews of significant issues. In addition, to allow for opportunities for the Board to engage with senior 
management to discuss key elements of the business. The table below gives the highlights of how the Board spent its time 
during 2012/2013 (but is not an exhaustive list of topics covered). Further information on the Group’s strategic focus during 
the year is set out in the Strategic Themes section starting on page 32.

Evaluating our performance in 2012/13
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each financial year, with an external 
evaluation once every three-years. The Board will undertake its next externally facilitated review during 2013/14.
One of the recommendations from last year’s review was that the Board should continue to consider its approach  
to assessing its effectiveness to ensure that it remained meaningful and reflected the collaborative nature of the Board. 
Consequently this year the Board and Committees followed a more discursive approach to the review which encouraged  
the directors to express their views on any area of Board and Committee effectiveness. Feedback from the evaluation  
was provided in the form of a written report to the Board followed by a discussion of the outcomes, led by the Chairman.
The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, also considered the performance of the Chairman 
without the Chairman present. The Chairman was commended for his leadership and overall contribution to the Board.

2. John Smith stepped down as a member of the Committees on 3 March 2013. He also recused himself from meetings where his proposed appointment  
as Chief Operating Officer was considered.
Any other absences were due to illness.
Time allocation
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment which sets out the terms and conditions of his or her 
directorship. The Chairman and the non-executive directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper 
performance of their duties. This is expected to be approximately 20 days each year for basic duties.
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are expected to spend additional time over and above this to discharge their 
added responsibilities.
External directorships
The Board’s executive directors are permitted to hold only one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company.  
Details of the directors’ other directorships can be found in their biographies on page 76.
Board and Committee composition
The non-executive directors are drawn from a wide range of industries and backgrounds, including retail, financial services, 
hotels and hospitality, marketing and media. They have extensive experience of complex organisations with global reach 
including experience of the Group’s key markets of Europe, the Americas and Asia. Their varied yet relevant experience 
brings a wealth of insight to Board discussions and important support to the management team. All the directors,  
with the exception of Stacey Cartwright, will stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2013.
85
Corporate Governance During the year, John Smith was appointed Chief Operating 
Officer effective 4 March 2013. In this newly created position, 
John will focus on the operational execution of the Group’s 
brand strategies in the fast moving digital and mobile 
environment. John has a unique skill set for this role, with 
his extensive experience in global brand management and 
new media, combined with a strong financial and operational 
background. As John has served as a non-executive 
director on the Board since December 2009, his insights 
will be invaluable to his new role. John was not present at 
any Board or Committee meetings at which his proposed 
appointment was considered. 
Separately, Stacey Cartwright, Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer, has decided to resign after over nine 
successful years with the Group in order to pursue new 
interests. Stacey will step down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Group’s Annual General Meeting on  
12 July 2013 and will finish her employment with the Group 
at the end of July. Carol Fairweather will join the Board  
as an executive director on 11 July 2013, and assumes  
the role of Chief Financial Officer on Stacey’s departure.
At the close of the Group’s 2012 Annual General Meeting, 
David Tyler stepped down as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Sir John Peace stepped down as a member 
of the Committee. Ian Carter was appointed as the new 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, while David 
Tyler continues to serve as a member of the Committee.
Board succession
During the year the Nomination Committee has been 
focusing on how to evolve the Board’s relevant skills  
and competencies for the future. Following a review  
by the Nomination Committee, the Board has established  
a succession plan which sets out a phased strategic 
approach to refreshing the Board aimed at balancing 
evolution with stability. The plan aims for the Board  
to appoint up to four new non-executive directors by the  
end of 2014, with the expectation that a number of existing 
non-executive directors will step down from the Board.
All new Board appointments will be based on merit.  
The Board composition principles are to maintain current 
core competencies, to add new competencies which reflect 
the evolution of the Group’s business, to ensure 
compatibility with Burberry’s culture and values and  
to promote diversity including in terms of gender.
Diversity and inclusion
Board succession planning is focused on ensuring the right 
mix of skills and experience for the Board. The Board 
believes in the importance of diverse Board membership.
Of the eight directors currently on the Board, three are 
women including two of the executive directors (comprising 
37% of total membership). This means that our Board 
already reflects the goal as set out in Lord Davies’ report  
on diversity in Britain’s boardrooms, of a minimum of 25% 
female representation on FTSE 100 boards by 2015.  
The Board will monitor diversity and take such steps as  
it considers appropriate to maintain Burberry’s position  
as a meritocratic and diverse business. 
The Board believes that it is critical that women are able  
to succeed at all levels of the organisation. Currently 
approximately 70% of the total workforce is female and 
approximately 37% of management are female.
More broadly, diversity is at the heart of Group culture 
which is characterised by a meritocratic and collaborative 
ethos. At our Group headquarters in London, 54 different 
nationalities are represented.
The Company continues to focus on evolving its strategies 
for recruiting and developing key talent within the business 
in a way which promotes the Group’s cultural values and 
diverse and meritocratic environment. See the Our People 
section on page 71.
Board tenure
0 – 5 years
5 – 10 years
10 years or above
The balance of tenure of service of the directors is set  
out in the diagram above. At the time of the 2013 Annual 
General Meeting, Sir John Peace, Philip Bowman and  
David Tyler will have served on the Board for 11 years. 
The Board is satisfied that all of our non-executive directors 
are independent. The performance of Philip Bowman, David 
Tyler and Stephanie George has been subject to a rigorous 
review including with regard to their independence.  
The Board has concluded that they contribute valuable 
insight and experience to Board deliberations and continue 
to provide independent and constructive challenge to  
the executive directors. On that basis and keeping in  
mind the need to ensure a smooth succession as part  
of the Board succession plan, the Board concluded that 
these directors remain effective non-executive directors. 
Information flow and professional development
The Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary  
in the planning of the agendas and schedule of Board and 
Committee meetings and in ensuring that information is 
made available to Board members on a timely basis and  
is of a quality appropriate to enable the Board to effectively 
discharge its duties. 
86
Corporate Governance As set out in the table ‘Highlights of Board activities during 
2012/13’ on page 84, the Board is kept up to date on legal, 
regulatory, compliance and governance matters through 
advice and regular papers from the Company Secretary, 
the General Counsel and other advisors. 
The Company Secretary assists the Chairman in designing 
and facilitating a tailored induction programme for new 
directors and their ongoing training. The Chairman considers 
the training needs of directors on an ongoing basis.
The Board have direct access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary and the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved  
for the Board as a whole. Directors may also obtain,  
in the furtherance of their duties, independent professional 
advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense.
Re-election of directors
At the Annual General Meeting in 2012, all directors offered 
themselves for re-election. Each director was re-elected 
and no director received less than 94% in favour of the votes 
cast. At the Annual General Meeting in 2013, all of the 
continuing directors with the exception of Stacey Cartwright, 
will again retire and all will offer themselves for re-election. 
Carol Fairweather will offer herself for election.
The Board believes that each of the directors standing  
for re-election or election are effective and accordingly,  
the Board recommends that shareholders approve  
the resolutions to be proposed at the 2013 Annual  
General Meeting relating to the re-election or election  
of the directors.
Managing conflicts of interest
All directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006  
to avoid a situation in which they have, or could have,  
a direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict  
of interest with the Company and the Group.
Under the Group’s Articles of Association, the Board  
has the authority to approve ‘situational’ conflicts of interest 
and has adopted procedures to manage and, where 
appropriate, to approve such conflicts. Authorisations 
granted by the Board are recorded by the Company 
Secretary in a register and are noted by the Board  
at its next meeting.
A review of situational conflicts which have been authorised 
is undertaken by the Board annually. Following the last 
review, the Board concluded that the conflicts had been 
appropriately authorised and that the process for 
authorisation continued to operate effectively.
Engagement with shareholders
The Board believes that effective leadership also involves 
maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with 
shareholders and other stakeholders, and seeks to achieve 
this in various ways including at the Annual General Meeting.
The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer give presentations to institutional 
shareholders and analysts immediately following the 
release of the half and full year results which are then  
made available on the Group’s website at burberryplc.com.  
The Group’s Investor Relations department acts as the centre 
for ongoing communication with investors and analysts.
The Chairman also maintains a regular dialogue with  
major shareholders to hear their views and discuss issues 
of mutual importance and communicates their views to the 
other members of the Board. During the year a combination 
of our Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive 
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer met with 16 of our 
top 20 investors. The Senior Independent Director and  
all the other non-executive directors are available to meet 
with shareholders. The Group also conducts regular 
independent investor audits of its major investors through 
Makinson Cowell, a capital markets advisory firm, to gauge 
investor perception.
Effective internal controls
The Group has a clear and consistent strategy as reflected 
in its key strategic themes. The strategy has been developed 
to exploit identified opportunities through a diversified 
business model. Where material risks have been identified 
within our business, the Group has implemented  
an appropriate internal control environment to endeavour  
to mitigate such risks.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and risk management, and it discharges 
its duties in this area by:
 · determining the nature and extent of the significant risks 
it is willing to accept in achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives (the Board’s risk appetite); and
 · ensuring that management implement effective systems 
of risk identification, assessment and mitigation.
The Audit Committee has been delegated the 
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The Audit Committee uses information 
drawn from a number of different sources to carry out this 
responsibility including:
 · objective assurance provided by Internal Audit through 
its annual work plan, which is approved by the Audit 
Committee and focuses on the principal risks identified  
in the risk assessment and key internal controls;
 · regular reports to the Audit Committee from executive 
management and key Group support functions detailing 
their risk management and compliance approaches and 
highlighting any significant issues;
 · key outcomes from discussions at the Group  
Risk Committee; and
 · further objective assurance is provided by  
external auditors.
87
Corporate Governance The internal control framework has been in operation for the 
whole of the year under review and continues to operate up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The system of internal controls is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of not achieving business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed  
the assessment of risks and the Group’s internal control 
framework and has considered the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control in operation in the Group for  
the year covered by the Annual Report and Accounts and 
up to the date of its approval by the Board. This covered  
all material controls including financial, operational  
and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
The process followed by the Board in reviewing the system 
of internal controls accords with the guidance on internal 
control issued by the Turnbull Committee. It also accords 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Group approach to managing risks
The Group has an integrated approach to risk management 
and internal controls to ensure that its review of risk is used 
to inform the internal audit process and the design of 
internal controls.
A detailed three-year strategic plan and annual budget 
process provides the principal metrics against which  
the performance of the Group is measured. The strategic 
plan and budget are agreed with the Board together with 
defined performance targets and risks to delivery. The plan 
and the principal risks for delivering the strategy also form 
part of the Board’s annual review of Group strategy. 
Executive management assess risk on a regular basis 
through the Group Risk Committee which meets at least 
three times per year and reports any key findings to the 
Audit Committee. The Group Risk Committee evaluates  
risk through reports made to it by Internal Audit and  
other assurance teams and management committees.  
The Committee benefits from cross-functional membership 
encompassing senior management of key areas such as  
IT, Finance, Legal, Brand Protection, Company Secretariat, 
Corporate Responsibility, Human Resources, Supply Chain 
and a number of assurance functions. These meetings are 
attended by the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial 
Officer and/or the Chief Executive Officer as well as the 
Director of Audit and Risk Assurance.
The executive directors also meet with senior management 
on a regular basis to discuss performance, operational and 
budget issues to identify any emerging risks to achieving 
the budget and strategic plan.
All internal audit activity is conducted by the Internal Audit 
team under the leadership of the Director of Audit and Risk 
Assurance, who reports to the Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer, but also has an independent 
reporting line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
In view of Internal Audit’s recommendations, management 
agrees and implements corrective action plans, which are 
tracked to completion by Internal Audit, with the results 
reported to executive management, the Audit Committee 
and the Board.
As part of the Board’s consideration of the principal risks 
facing the Group, Internal Audit facilitate a risk assessment 
process in each key business area and global support 
function to review the significant risks facing its operations 
and to record the relevant controls and any actions in place 
to mitigate the risks. The materiality of the risk is measured 
based on financial and non-financial criteria, and the 
probability of the risk arising is also mapped. The detailed 
assessments are then consolidated to provide input into  
the Group risk assessment. This process also enables 
Internal Audit to engage with senior management throughout 
the business on risk monitoring and management.
There are areas of the Group’s business where it is necessary 
to accept risks to achieve a satisfactory return for shareholders, 
such risks reflecting the Board’s overall appetite for risk. 
During 2012/13 the Audit Committee, in conjunction with 
the full Board, considered and reviewed the nature and 
extent of these risks. It is the Group’s objective to apply 
expertise to prudently manage rather than eliminate such 
risks including keeping them under frequent review.
For details of the principal risks which may adversely 
impact the performance of the Group and the execution  
of its growth strategies and the steps the Group takes  
to address these risks (where they are matters within Group 
control), see the Principal Risks section on pages 60 to 63.
Financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  
These controls are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
reporting purposes. 
The Group has comprehensive planning, budgeting, 
forecasting and monthly reporting processes in place.  
A summary of the Group’s financial results supported  
by commentary and performance measures is provided  
to the Board each month.
In relation to the preparation of the Group financial 
statements, the controls in place include:
 · a centre of expertise responsible for reviewing new 
developments in reporting requirements and standards 
to ensure that these are reflected in Group accounting 
policies;
 · a dedicated finance governance team who are 
responsible for developing the Group’s financial control 
88
Corporate Governance  · processes and procedures and implementing them 
across the Group; and
 · a global finance structure consisting of employees with 
the appropriate expertise to ensure that Group policies 
and procedures are correctly applied. Effective 
management and control of the finance structure  
is achieved through the finance leadership team, 
consisting of key finance employees from the region  
and corporate headquarters.
The reporting process is supported by transactional and 
consolidation finance systems. Reviews of the applications 
of controls for external reporting purposes are carried out 
by senior finance management. The results of these reviews 
are considered by the Board as part of its monitoring  
of the performance of controls around financial reporting.
The Audit Committee reviews the application of financial 
reporting standards and any significant accounting 
judgements made by management.
Control environment
The Group’s business model is based primarily on a central 
design, supply chain and distribution operation to supply 
products to global markets, via retail and wholesale 
channels. This is reflected in the internal control framework 
which includes central direction, resource allocation, 
oversight and risk management of the key activities  
of marketing, inventory management, brand and technology 
development. This includes central support in relation  
to legal, brand protection, human resources, information 
systems and financial practice.
The Group has established procedures for the delegation  
of authorities to ensure that approval for matters that  
are considered significant is considered and given at  
an appropriate level, either because of their value or their 
materiality to the Group. In addition the Group has policies 
and procedures in place that are designed to support risk 
management across the Group. These authorities, policies 
and procedures are kept under review as the Group 
continues to grow. These include policies relating  
to treasury, the conduct of employees and third parties  
with which the Group conducts business including 
prohibiting bribery and corruption.
Accountability and audit
The Board is required to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects in the Annual Report and in interim and other 
public reports. The Board is satisfied that it has met this 
obligation. A summary of the directors’ responsibilities for 
the financial statements is set out on page 106 and includes a 
statement regarding the Group’s status as a going concern 
as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Report of the Auditors on page 107 includes a statement by 
the auditors concerning their reporting responsibilities. 
Report of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the integrity 
of financial information and to provide assurance  
to the Board that the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems are appropriate and regularly 
reviewed, together with overseeing the work of the external 
auditors, approving their remuneration and recommending 
their appointment.
As the external environment continues to be challenging, 
during the year the Committee continued to focus  
on ensuring that the Group’s systems and controls  
are operating effectively, are responsive to this external 
environment and are evolving in line with the Group’s 
growth (including the integration of the Beauty business).
The Audit Committee met three times during the year.  
In addition to the usual work of the Committee (as set  
out on page 90) the Committee considered the following 
specific matters.
 · The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
 · The accounting treatment and progress of the integration 
of the fragrance and beauty business.
 · Impairment assessment for property, plant and equipment.
 · The recoverability of the cost of inventory and the resulting 
amount of provisioning required.
 · The impairment assessment of trade receivables, having 
taken into account the changes in global economic 
conditions during the year. 
 · The Group’s tax strategy and the assumptions  
and judgements applied in order to estimate the amount 
of corporation tax and deferred tax to be recognised  
at the period end.
 · The calculation of the fair value of the put option  
over the non-controlling interest in the Group’s business  
in China.
Where these matters related to the financial statements  
for the period, the Committee reviewed the approach,  
the estimates and judgements applied, the recommendation 
of management and the findings of the external auditors.
The Committee has a constructive and open relationship 
with management and we thank them for their assistance 
during the year.

External auditors
The Committee oversees the work undertaken  
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. During the year

 · Review of all non-audit services provided by the Group’s auditors during the 
period and the fees relating to the services provided (see below on page 91).
90
Corporate Governance Appointment and fees
The Committee has primary responsibility for making  
a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditors. The Committee assesses 
on an annual basis the qualifications, expertise, resources 
and independence of the external auditors and the 
effectiveness of the previous audit process. Over the 
course of the year, the Committee has reviewed the audit 
process and the quality and experience of the audit 
partners engaged in the audit. The Committee also 
reviewed the proposed audit fee and terms of engagement 
for the 2012/13 financial year. Details of the fees paid to  
the external auditors during the financial year can be found 
in note 5 in the financial statements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have remained in place  
as auditors since prior to the IPO of the Company in 2002. 
They were reappointed with a new lead audit partner 
following a formal tender process undertaken by the  
Group for the 2010/11 financial year. The external auditors 
are required to rotate the audit engagement partner every 
five years. The current audit partner commenced his 
engagement for the 2010/11 financial year and is not 
subject to rotation until after the audit of the Group’s 
financial statements for the 2014/15 financial year  
has been concluded.
During the year, the Committee approved the 
reappointment, remuneration and terms of engagement  
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Group’s external 
auditor. The Committee recommended to the Board that  
it proposes to shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP be reappointed as the Group’s external auditors at  
the Group’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Non-audit services
The Committee recognises that the independence  
of the external auditors is an essential part of the audit 
framework and the assurance that it provides.  
The Committee has adopted a policy which sets out  
a framework for determining whether it is appropriate  
to engage the Group’s auditors for non-audit services.  
Key considerations are whether the services:
 · are naturally tangential to the audit and which the 
auditors are best placed to provide;
 · cannot be regarded as naturally tangential to the audit, 
but where the external auditors are in a position to 
provide the best service to the Group due to their 
previous experience, network within and knowledge of 
the Group, or market leadership in a particular area; and 
 · represent a real threat to the perceived independence of 
the audit team.
Under the policy, the auditors may provide non-audit 
services that do not prejudice their independence, subject 
to prior approval as set out in the policy. Proposed fees 
above a certain level must be approved by the Audit 
Committee. Such fees must be activity based and not 
success related. At the half year and year end, the Audit 
Committee reviews all non-audit services provided by the 
auditors during the period and the fees relating to such 
services. If during the year Group expenditure for non-audit 
services exceeds £1.0m, all further requests for work must 
be referred to the Chairman of the Committee. 
During the year, the Group spent £0.8m on non-audit 
services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  
Further details can be found in note 5.
Report of the Nomination Committee
Dear Shareholder,
The role of the Nomination Committee is to:
 · review the balance and composition of the Board and  
its Committees, ensuring that they remain appropriate;
 · be responsible for overseeing the Board’s succession 
planning requirements including the identification and 
assessment of potential Board candidates and making 
recommendations to the Board for its approval; and
 · keep under review the leadership needs of, and 
succession planning for, the Group in relation to both  
its executive directors and other senior executives.  
This includes the consideration of recommendations 
made by the Chief Executive Officer for changes to  
the executive membership of the Board. 
During 2012/13 the Committee has focused on the  
following matters.
 · Executive succession planning. The outcome of this  
was the appointment on 4 March 2013 of John Smith  
in the new role of Chief Operating Officer. In addition,  
the appointment of Carol Fairweather to succeed  
Stacey Cartwright as Chief Financial Officer when  
Stacey finishes her tenure.
 · Board succession planning with the establishment  
of a Board succession plan to implement a phased 
approach to refreshing the Board over the next two 
years, aimed at balancing evolution with stability  
(see Board succession on page 86).
 · The consideration of Board composition principles 
(including in relation to diversity) as part of the 
succession plan.
Board succession and composition will remain a priority for 
the coming year as the Board executes its succession plan.

Other governance disclosures
Tax policy
The Group is committed to complying with global  
tax regulations in a responsible manner with due regard  
to governments and shareholders, and to engage  
in open and constructive relationships with tax authorities  
in the territories in which it operates. The Group’s tax 
planning is consistent with this responsible approach,  
and it will not enter into arrangements which have tax 
avoidance as their sole objective.
Tax governance framework
The finance leadership team, led by the Executive Vice 
President, Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for the 
Group’s tax policy and for the implementation of its tax 
strategy. This is reviewed on an ongoing basis as part  
of the regular financial planning cycle. In addition, the 
Group’s tax status is reported regularly to the Group  
Risk Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible  
for monitoring all significant tax matters. Audit Committee 
meetings are occasionally attended by a number of  
Group officers and employees including the Executive Vice

Corporate Governance Dear Shareholder,
As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2013 which has been prepared by the Committee and  
approved by the Board.
Firstly, I would like to extend my thanks to David Tyler, who has provided strong leadership as chair of the Committee  
during the last five years. I am delighted to be given the opportunity to lead the Committee as we continue to encourage  
the executive directors to deliver exceptional performance and shareholder value, by ensuring that the Group’s remuneration 
policy is aligned to the business strategy and shareholders’ interests. 
2012/13 has once again presented a challenging external environment for Burberry. While we expect the external global 
environment to remain challenging, the team is intensely focused on optimising the significant opportunities that exist  
for the brand across geographies and product divisions, with particular emphasis on unlocking the potential of our digital 
platform and our newly-integrated fragrance and beauty business.
Against this backdrop, Burberry has continued its strong growth trajectory, with another year of record profits.  
This sustained growth is the result of our strategic investment in the brand. In 2012/13, Burberry grew revenue by 8%  
and adjusted PBT by 14% in a challenging global environment. Management’s consistent execution of key strategies  
and dynamic response to issues and opportunities delivered this solid performance.
The Committee aims to ensure that directors’ and senior executives’ remuneration is globally competitive so as to attract 
and retain high calibre individuals, and is also strongly aligned to performance and delivering a sustainable increase  
in shareholder value. The Group’s remuneration policy is set out on pages 94 and 95 and this will continue to be the policy 
for the coming year.
As part of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, the UK Government released its draft remuneration reporting 
regulations during the year. The Committee has been monitoring these developments and, in the coming year,  
will be reviewing executive remuneration arrangements and reporting in light of these proposed changes. The Committee’s 
review will take into account the strategic plan, the performance and growth of the Group and the global luxury goods 
sector, other regulatory developments, shareholder expectations and global market practice.
Investors will be aware that John Smith has been appointed as Chief Operating Officer and that Stacey Cartwright  
will be departing Burberry at the end of July 2013. Following his appointment as an executive director, John Smith resigned 
his membership of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders on any key changes to executive remuneration arrangements  
and looks forward to gaining your support on this report when it is put to vote at the Annual General Meeting in July 2013.

Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board  
and monitors the level and structure of senior executive pay. The terms of reference of the Committee are available  
on the Group’s website at burberryplc.com.
The Board reviewed the performance of the Committee in the year. This review concluded that the Committee operated 
independently and effectively. The Board believes that the collective experience of its members enables the Committee  
to give a balanced view on remuneration matters.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole. No director is involved  
in any discussions as to their own remuneration. During the year, the Committee met formally on five occasions.  
Details of attendance at those meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 85.
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, the following people attended 
meetings and provided advice to the Committee: Sir John Peace (Chairman), Angela Ahrendts (Chief Executive Officer), 
Stacey Cartwright (Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer), Michael Mahony (Chief Corporate Affairs Officer), 
Anne-Soline Thorndike (Senior Vice President, Reward and Recognition) and Catherine Sukmonowski (Company Secretary).
Towers Watson has been the appointed advisor to the Committee since 2011. Towers Watson provides advice  
on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration. A term  
of the engagement between the Committee and Towers Watson is that any additional consulting services provided  
by Towers Watson to management are reported on a regular basis to the Committee. Where an actual or potential conflict 
may occur, such work is agreed by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement. Since their appointment, 
Towers Watson has provided market benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles  
which fall below the remit of Committee review. Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group,  
which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly sets out the role  
of executive remuneration consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee believes the Group’s remuneration should be strongly linked to performance and internationally competitive, 
taking into account the global markets in which it operates and from which it recruits. The Group’s remuneration policy is 
based on the following principles:
 · Shareholder value: remuneration should be closely aligned with long-term value creation for shareholders through 
thoughtful selection of performance measures (as described on the following pages), emphasis on variable pay and 
delivery of a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance 
with the Group’s shareholding policy.
 · Linked to success of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short- and 
long-term business objectives. Variable pay for executive directors includes (1) an annual cash bonus based on Adjusted 
Profit Before Tax as per the audited income statement (‘Adjusted PBT’), and (2) long-term share based incentives linked 
primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in Adjusted PBT.
 · Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain 
exceptional talent within the global luxury goods sector. Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior 
executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberry’s main global competitors and comparable UK companies.  
The Committee recognises that, for each executive, the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be 
different. Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances.
94
Directors’ Remuneration Report The principle of shareholder alignment is reflected throughout the organisation through our all employee share plans,  
which are (where possible) extended to all eligible Burberry employees globally.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee considered the reward framework for all employees 
worldwide, ensuring that the principles applied are consistent with the executive remuneration policy. Merit increases 
awarded to executives also occur within the broader all-employee structure, and executive share plans are extended 
through the organisation to senior executives and high potential employees where appropriate. Details of the remuneration 
policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out on page 102.
Remuneration structure
Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements 
represent the majority of total potential remuneration.
Key elements of executive directors’ remuneration
Purpose Operation Maximum opportunity and link to performance
Base salary 
To recognise the 
responsibilities, 
experience and ability 
of our talent in a 
competitive global 
environment, keeping 
our people focused 
on and passionate 
about the brand.
Salaries are benchmarked against global companies of 
similar size and/or global reach within the luxury goods 
sector and/or companies with high-profile global brands, 
and to a lesser extent comparable UK companies. 
 
The Committee considers the impact of any base salary 
increase on the total remuneration package.
Increases for the executive directors are set within the 
same framework and same ranges as other employees, 
taking into account individual performance, overall 
contribution to the business during the year, cost to the 
Company, as well as the external economic climate.
Annual bonus 
To reward executive 
directors for achieving 
annual financial 
targets linked to the 
strategic plans agreed 
by the Board.
The Committee reviews the performance condition(s) 
annually to ensure it remains appropriate and aligned  
with Group strategy. 
 
The targets are set before the start of each year by 
reference to budget, strategic plan, long-term financial 
goals, latest projections for the year ahead and broker 
earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors. 
 
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion  
of the Committee.
Maximum awards are:
 · 200% of salary for the CEO
 · 150% of salary for other executive directors
Performance condition:
 · Adjusted PBT over one year
Co-Investment Plan 
(CIP) 
To incentivise 
consistent 
performance and 
further align executive 
directors’ interests 
with those of 
shareholders,  
by encouraging  
share ownership.
Executive directors may voluntarily invest all or part of 
their annual bonus in Burberry shares for three years and 
receive a contingent award of matching shares. 
 
The ratio of matching shares awarded depends on annual 
performance during the relevant bonus year. The number 
of matching shares that actually vest is then also subject 
to a three-year performance condition. 
 
The Committee reviews the performance condition(s) to 
ensure it remains appropriate and aligned with the 
Group’s strategy and long-term goals. The targets are 
reviewed at the same time to ensure they are demanding 
yet realistic, given latest Group strategy, prior 
performance and external expectations. 
 
A cash payment equivalent to the value of dividends 
which would have been received during the deferral 
period is paid on matching shares that vest.
Maximum awards (subject to executives investing  
their bonus):
The ratio for matching share awards depends on 
Adjusted PBT performance during the year:
 · In a year of maximum performance, the ratio is 2:1
 · In a year of target performance, the ratio is 1:1
 · Below target performance, the match does  
not operate
 · Straight-line award between
As a percentage of salary, the maximum award is 400% 
(that is a 2x match on a 200% of salary bonus) 
 
The performance condition on vesting is:
 · Adjusted PBT growth over three years
 · 25% vesting for 5% per annum
 · 100% vesting for 10% per annum
 · Straight-line vesting between
95
Directors’ Remuneration Report Purpose Operation Maximum opportunity and link to performance
Restricted Share 
Plan (RSP) 
To focus executive 
directors on 
sustainable long-term 
performance.
Each year, the Committee determines whether to make 
awards of nil-cost options under the Restricted Share 
Plan to executive directors. 
 
If an award is made, the number of nil-cost options that 
vest is determined at the end of a three-year performance 
period. Once the level of performance has been 
determined, vesting is phased over three, four  
and five years. 
 
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of 
Burberry’s peers because it felt that this is an objective 
measure of the Group’s success and aligns with 
shareholder interests. Growth in Adjusted PBT was 
chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by 
management and the Committee believes strong growth 
in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder 
returns. Ultimately, the successful implementation of our 
key strategic themes (outlined on pages 32 to 51) are 
reflected in our Adjusted PBT and TSR performance. 
Maximum awards:
 · 200% of salary
Performance conditions for executive directors:
 · 50% on Adjusted PBT growth over three years:
 – 25% vesting for 10% per annum
 – 100% vesting for 15% per annum
 – Straight-line vesting between 
 · 50% on relative TSR vs. sector peers over  
three years:
 – 25% vesting for median
 – 100% vesting for upper quartile
 – Straight-line vesting between 
 · Vesting: 50% after three years and 25% after each  
of four and five years
Pension 
To offer market 
competitive benefits.
Executive directors participate in defined contribution 
arrangements. Participants may elect to receive a portion 
of their entitlement as a cash supplement.
Company contribution: 30% of salary per annum
Other benefits 
To protect the 
well-being of 
employees, allowing 
them to focus on  
the business.
Benefits for executive directors include private medical 
insurance, life assurance, long-term disability insurance, 
car and clothing allowances.
Benefit levels are reviewed on an annual basis
All-employee share 
plans 
To encourage 
employee share 
ownership at  
all levels.
Burberry operates two all-employee share plans:
 · The Sharesave Scheme offers eligible executive 
directors and eligible employees an opportunity to 
enter into a three- or-five year savings contract to save  
a portion of their salary which can be used to purchase 
Burberry shares at up to a 20% discount to the market 
price at the date of invitation.
 · Grants of shares or a cash equivalent (where shares  
are not possible) are made annually to all eligible 
employees under the UK Share Incentive Plan and 
International Freeshare Plans. The executive directors 
elected not to participate in the Freeshare Plans.
Sharesave: maximum savings amount of £3,000 per 
annum, with which Burberry shares can be purchased 
with a 20% discount. 
 
Share Incentive Plan and International Freeshare Plan: 
awards with a value of up to £500 per annum.
A One-Off grant was granted to Angela Ahrendts following consultation with shareholders during 2010 and the details  
of this grant are set out in detail on page 101.

Directors’ Remuneration Report Service agreements
Angela Ahrendts
Angela Ahrendts relocated from the USA to the UK and commenced her employment with Burberry as an executive director 
on 9 January 2006 under a service agreement dated 10 October 2005. She was appointed Chief Executive Officer on 1 July 
2006 for an indefinite period.
The terms of her service agreement were negotiated when she was appointed. If Burberry terminates Angela Ahrendts’ 
service agreement in circumstances other than for poor performance she would be entitled to 12 months’ salary and 75%  
of her annual maximum bonus opportunity. She would also receive her pension contribution for 12 months together with 
overseas allowances and, if applicable, relocation expenses. Any unvested awards under the Restricted Share Plan and 
unvested Matching Share awards under the Co-Investment Plan will vest but only on a time apportioned basis and subject 
to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Committee determines that  
Angela Ahrendts’ performance or that of the Group does not meet the financial expectations of the Board or shareholders,  
her entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months’ salary and 37.5%  
of her maximum bonus opportunity. Angela Ahrendts may terminate the service agreement on six months’ notice.
The Committee considered that these termination provisions were required to secure the appointment of a Chief Executive 
Officer of the calibre of Angela Ahrendts from the small pool of sufficiently specialised candidates from around the world.

For the year to 31 March 2013, the Company did not achieve the maximum Adjusted PBT target and so the annual bonus did 
not pay out at the maximum level. The 2012/13 Adjusted PBT achieved was ahead of the target level set by the Committee, 
which resulted in bonuses for both Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright of 75% of maximum, as set out in the table 
below. Angela Ahrendts has elected to invest 100% of this bonus into shares under the CIP, as detailed later in this report. 
John Smith did not receive a bonus for the period 4 March 2013 to 31 March 2013.

Directors’ Remuneration Report The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan
In June 2012, Stacey Cartwright was granted an award of shares under the Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’), totalling  
83,333 shares (with a face value of £1,147,495 at the grant date of 13 June 2012). This award will lapse in full when  
Stacey Cartwright ceases to be an employee of the Group.
The third tranche of RSP awards made in 2007 vested during the year. The performance conditions for these awards  
were tested in 2010 (with 57.5% of each grant lapsing). The first tranche of RSP awards made in 2009 vested in full during 
the year, as both the three-year Adjusted PBT growth and relative TSR performance conditions were met in full in 2012. 
The TSR group for the 2009, 2010 and 2012 awards comprises, Coach, Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, 
Fossil, Fifth & Pacific (formerly Liz Claiborne), Geox, Hermès International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s. Bulgari were 
acquired by LVMH in 2011 and so is no longer included in the group.
The vesting outcome based on three-year PBT growth is calculated using Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the Annual 
Accounts. The vesting outcome based on relative TSR is calculated by Towers Watson.
The Burberry Co-Investment Plan
No Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) matching awards vested during the year, as no awards were made under the plan in 2009  
(as there were no 2008/09 annual bonuses).
Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to reinvest the full amount of their 2011/12 bonus into shares and were 
subsequently granted matching awards under the CIP during 2012/13 based on a 2:1 match. Angela Ahrendts received  
an award of 326,736 shares (with a face value of £3,960,040 at grant) and Stacey Cartwright received an award of 148,516 
shares (face value of £1,800,014 at grant). Angela Ahrendts’ award may vest subject to the following performance condition: 
25% of the award may vest if growth in Adjusted PBT is 5% per annum over three years, 100% may vest if Adjusted PBT 
growth is equal to or exceeds 10% per annum over three years. Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis between these 
points. None of the award will vest if Adjusted PBT growth is below 5% per annum.
Stacey Cartwright’s 2012/13 CIP matching award will lapse in full when she ceases to be an employee of the Group.
For the year ended 31 March 2013, Angela Ahrendts intends to invest 100% of her bonus after the deduction of tax into 
Burberry shares under the CIP. Full details of the associated matching award will appear in the 2013/14 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The vesting outcome based on three-year PBT growth is calculated using Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the Annual Accounts.
100
Directors’ Remuneration Report One-Off Grant to Angela Ahrendts
Following consultation with the Company’s largest shareholders in 2010, the Chief Executive Officer was awarded  
a nil-cost option over 500,000 shares which will vest on 1 April 2015 subject to strategic and financial objectives linked  
to the long-term growth of the Company being achieved. These objectives include:
 · the development of the business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board;
 · Burberry’s Adjusted PBT performance;
 · the personal contribution made by the Chief Executive Officer;
 · shareholder value delivered in the context of the luxury goods market; and
 · any other performance factors which are considered appropriate in assessing the fairness of vesting the award  
to the Chief Executive Officer and the shareholders.
The Committee assesses progress towards achieving these objectives each year. At the end of 2012/13 the Committee 
again considered the One-Off grant to the Chief Executive Officer, in the context of:
 · continued progress along the five strategic themes including:
 - Burberry continues to climb in Interbrand’s Top 100 Global Brands;
 - successful integration of Beauty;
 - strong growth in accessories revenue;
 - progress in building the brand’s global retail presence;
 - the performance and growth in under-penetrated markets; and
 - increases in gross margin
 · double-digit growth in adjusted PBT in the 2012/13 year; and
 · the outstanding leadership demonstrated by the Chief Executive Officer.
The Committee resolved that the objectives had been achieved in full during 2012/13.
The Sharesave Scheme
In order to encourage employee share ownership at all levels, the Group offers a Sharesave Scheme. The Sharesave Scheme 
offers eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a three-year savings contract (and five-year savings contract in the UK) 
to save a portion of their salary which can be used to purchase Burberry shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price 
at the date of invitation.
Gains made by directors on share options and awards
The table below shows notional gains made by individual directors from the exercise of share options and awards during  
the year to 31 March 2013. The gains have arisen in respect of RSP awards granted in 2007 and 2009 and a Sharesave 
award granted in 2009 and are calculated by reference to the market value of Burberry’s shares on the date of exercise.

a half times base salary.

Directors’ Remuneration Report FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (the EU), and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
 select suitable applicable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial statements respectively; and 
 prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 76 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
 the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
 the Directors’ Report contained on page 78 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

of Changes in Equity, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, Analysis of Net Cash and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 106, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 81, in relation to going concern;  
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 
31 March 2013 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Group Statement of Cash Flows  
1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. The Group 
also licences third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trade marks. All of the companies which 
comprise the Group are controlled by Burberry Group plc (the Company) directly or indirectly. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
There have been no new standards, amendments or interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period 
commencing on 1 April 2012 that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
As at 31 March 2013, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant 
to the Group’s results, were issued but not yet effective:  
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and introduces new 
requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2015 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer 
to the date of adoption. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 
This standard establishes the principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements and replaces similar principles 
set out in IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 
and has been endorsed by the EU. The adoption of this new standard is not considered likely to have a material impact on the financial position 
or financial performance of the Group.  
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 
IFRS 11 updates the approach currently set out in IAS 28 Investments in associates by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement 
rather than its legal form. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and has been endorsed by the EU. 
The adoption of this new standard is not considered likely to have a material impact on the financial position or financial performance of the Group. 
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 
This standard requires disclosure of information about the nature of, and risks associated with, the Group’s interests in other entities, as well 
as the impact of these interests on the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The standard is applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and has been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will be limited to 
disclosure, and it is not considered likely to have a material impact. 
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 
This standard aims to provide a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to be used 
across all IFRSs. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and has been endorsed by the EU. Any potential 
impact of this new standard will be limited to disclosure, and it is not considered likely to have a material impact. 
Amendment to IAS 1 Financial statement presentation 
The amendment requires entities to group items presented in Other Comprehensive Income on the basis of whether they will be recycled through 
profit or loss at a later date, when specific conditions are met. The amendment is effective from 1 July 2012. The amendments do not address which 
items are presented in Other Comprehensive Income, and as such the impact on the Group will be limited to presentation.  
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries, presented 
as a single economic entity. The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using 
consistent accounting policies across the Group.  
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial  
and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether 
the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group 
and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a loss of control 
of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during which 
the Group had control. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits on transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests 
as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between 
any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded 
in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
1. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure 
of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement 
at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be 
updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates 
and assumptions applied have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
are discussed below: 
Valuation of the fragrance and beauty intangible 
The Group made a payment to Interparfums SA of €181.2m on 21 December 2012 to terminate the existing fragrance and 
beauty licence relationship (£142.2m at the spot rate at the time of exercise). This has resulted in the recognition of an 
intangible asset of £70.9m and an expense of £71.3m in the current period. In order to identify the carrying value of the 
intangible asset acquired, management was required to estimate the incremental income that will be earned by the Group from 
1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017, which represents the remaining period of the original licence, prior to its termination. A 
value-in-use calculation has been performed, based on the key forecast assumptions including: sales of products until 2017, 
by product category; operating margins achieved on this activity; tax charged on the incremental profits; the working capital 
required to support this activity; and anticipated tax relief on the payment made to acquire the intangible asset. Such forecast 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the actual cash flows between 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2017 may differ 
materially from these assumptions. Refer to notes 6 and 11 for further details of the accounting for this transaction. 
Put option liability over non-controlling interest 
The calculation of the fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest in the Group’s business in China is based on 
the contractual agreement and requires the application of key assumptions around both the future performance of the Group’s 
business in China and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise 
and the risk free rate in China. Refer to notes 19 and 25 for further details of the put option liability. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash 
generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and 
estimates. Refer to note 12 for further details of property, plant and equipment. 
Inventory provisioning 
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends. 
As a result it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required. 
When calculating the inventory provision, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as applying 
assumptions around anticipated saleability of finished goods and future usage of raw materials. Refer to note 16 for further 
details of the carrying value of inventory. 
Income and deferred taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the provision for income 
taxes in each territory. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which 
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates 
of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which 
such determination is made. Refer to notes 8 and 14 for further details of income and deferred tax balances.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
1. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Key sources of estimation and judgement (continued) 
Impairment of trade receivables 
The Group is required to make an estimate of the recoverable value of trade receivables. When assessing impairment of trade 
receivables, management considers factors including the ageing profile of debtors as well as any specific known problems 
or risks. Given global economic conditions and the range of countries the Group trades in, unanticipated future events may 
occur that could impact the appropriateness of the assessment made as to the recoverability of the Group’s trade receivables. 
Refer to notes 15 and 25 for further details on the net carrying value and credit quality of trade receivables. 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test at least annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash 
generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation 
of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Refer to note 11 for further details of goodwill balances. 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 
a) Revenue 
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied  
(less returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable. 
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, 
with provisions made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates 
of transactions with customers. Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return 
levels. Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, 
which is typically on the basis of production volumes.  
In arrangements where the Group acts as a purchasing agent to facilitate the procurement of Burberry branded products 
on behalf of its licensees, the purchases and sales from the supplier to the licensee are not recorded as transactions by the 
Group. Any costs incurred by the Group are recorded as operating expenses and any agency fees receivable are recorded 
as operating income. 
b) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been 
identified as the Board of Directors.  
c) Business combinations 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange. Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement. All transaction 
costs are expensed to the Income Statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity, and are 
initially measured either at fair value or at a value equal to the non-controlling interests’ share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired. The choice of the basis of measurement is an accounting policy choice for each individual business combination. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest over the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.

d) Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation schemes, under which services are received from 
employees (including executive directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. The cost of the share based 
incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. Appropriate 
option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value of the awards made. 
The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance 
conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market 
conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number 
of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated 
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held 
in an ESOP trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. The proceeds received from the exercises, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium accounts.  
e) Leases 
The Group is both a lessor and lessee of property, plant and equipment. Determining whether an arrangement is or contains 
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement. Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of an asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Gross rental expenditure/income in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
leases. Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and are accrued 
for on that basis. 
Amounts paid to/received from the landlord to acquire or transfer the rights to a lease are treated as prepayments/accrued 
income on the lease contract. Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are held on the Balance 
Sheet in accruals and deferred income and recognised over the term of the lease.  
Finance leases where the Group is a lessee are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of the 
leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Interest is charged to the Income Statement and credited 
to the lease liability using the effective interest rate method. Lease liabilities are held in other payables on the Balance Sheet. 
The capitalised leased assets are held in property, plant and equipment on the Balance Sheet, and are depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the leased asset.  
f) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend 
becomes a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
g) Pension costs 
Defined contribution schemes 
Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held 
in an independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the 
Income Statement as they fall due and comprises the amount of contributions to the schemes. 
Defined benefit schemes 
Eligible employees of the Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.  
The liability recognised on the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents the Group’s share of the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments 
for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the Projected Unit Credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly 
in Other Comprehensive Income. 
h) Intangible fixed assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest, over the fair value 
of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible fixed asset. Fair values are attributed 
to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition 
at that date. Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.  
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses recognised on 
goodwill are not reversed in future periods. 
Trade marks, licences and other intangible assets 
The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and licences, and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets such as key 
money is capitalised at purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are 
expected to accrue, typically ten years for trade marks, or the term of the lease or licence. The useful economic life of trade 
marks and other intangible assets is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying 
agreement and the nature of the asset. 
Computer software 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and separately identifiable external development costs) 
is capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for 
its intended use. Software costs are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, 
which are up to five years. 
117
Notes to the Financial Statements  
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
i) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets in the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, 
based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Assets 
in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and transferred to completed assets when 
substantially all of the activities necessary for the asset to be ready for use have occurred. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the 
assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 
Type of asset Category of property, plant and equipment Useful life 
Land Freehold land and buildings Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Freehold land and buildings Up to 50 years 
Leaseholds  Leasehold improvements Over the unexpired term of the lease 
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 – 8 years 
Retail fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment 2 – 5 years 
Office equipment Fixtures, fittings and equipment 5 years 
Computer equipment Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 5 years 
Assets in the course of construction Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated 
Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net 
book value at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional. 
j) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs 
to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment 
has been previously recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. 
k) Investment properties 
Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties 
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Cost includes the original 
purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Investment properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years.  
l) Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified 
as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next twelve months is considered to be highly probable. 
Assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and they are stated as the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less cost to sell. 
m) Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost (including an appropriate proportion 
of production overhead) and net realisable value. Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net 
realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability. 
118
Notes to the Financial Statements  
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
n) Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax charge. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items which are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary 
difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entities or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances 
on a net basis. 
o) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the 
obligation can be reliably estimated. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated 
based on the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The present value is calculated 
using forward market interest rates as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks 
reflected in future cash flow estimates. 
Property obligations 
A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return 
the leased property to its original condition at the end of an operating lease. Where a leased property is no longer expected 
to be fully occupied or where the costs exceed the future expected benefits, an onerous lease provision will be recognised 
for that portion of the lease excess to the Group’s requirements and not fully recovered through sub-leasing, or through 
value-in-use.  
Restructuring costs 
Provisions for costs associated with restructuring programmes are recognised when a detailed formal restructuring plan has 
been approved and communicated. Examples of restructuring related costs include employee termination payments, contract 
termination penalties and onerous contract payments. 
p) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to owners of the Company. 
119
Notes to the Financial Statements  
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or 
substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified 
in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.  
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except 
for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where they qualify for hedge accounting, and are held at fair 
value. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals and borrowings. 
The Group classifies its instruments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans 
and receivables. Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Derivatives are 
classified as held for trading, unless in a hedging relationship, and are held at fair value.  
Financial instrument category Note Classification Measurement 
Cash and cash equivalents 18 Loans and receivables Amortised cost 
Trade and other receivables 15 Loans and receivables Amortised cost 
Trade and other payables 19 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost 
Borrowings 21 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost 
Put option over non-controlling interest 19 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 
Forward foreign exchange contracts
(1)
 17 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 
Equity swap contracts 17 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 
Onerous lease 20 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost 
(1) Hedge accounting is applied to cash flow hedges to the extent it is achievable. 
The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below:  
Cash and cash equivalents 
On the Balance Sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with a maturity date of three months 
or less, held with banks and liquidity funds. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank 
overdrafts, which are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance 
sheet date. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
The amount of the movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.  
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance 
sheet date. Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified 
as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months  
after the balance sheet date. 
Put option liabilities over non-controlling interest 
Put options over shares in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through equity when 
granted. They are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the 
Income Statement as other finance expenses and income.  
120
Notes to the Financial Statements  
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivative instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain 
trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 
probable cash flows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases. To manage interest rate risk the Group 
manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap 
derivatives. It designates foreign currency borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
When hedge accounting is applied, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments 
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, 
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value 
of recognised assets and liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) classified as held for trading. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income 
Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred 
in Other Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately 
in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in Other Comprehensive Income are recycled in the Income Statement in the 
periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity 
and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income 
Statement within ‘other gains/(losses) — net’. If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change 
to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses or interest depending upon the nature of 
the instrument. 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses 
on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and will be reclassified to the Income 
Statement when the foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of.

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
r) Foreign currency translation  
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, 
which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except 
where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such 
differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.  
Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of Sterling each month at the 
weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The weighted average 
exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions. The assets 
and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates. Differences arising on the retranslation of the 
opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign 
currency translation reserve.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities  
of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. 
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: 
 Average rate Closing rate

Hong Kong Dollar 12.25 12.38 11.79 12.41 
Korean Won 1,758 1,775 1,691 1,811 
The average exchange rate achieved by the Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward foreign 
exchange contracts on a monthly basis approximately twelve months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 126.9: £1 in the 
year to 31 March 2013 (2012: Yen 133.1: £1). 
s) Adjusted profit before taxation and exceptional items 
Exceptional items include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature. The Group presents these items in 
note 6 to the accounts in profit before taxation. Fair value movements on options held over equity interests, which are held 
for the purpose of future business developments, rather than speculative purposes, are also considered to be exceptional 
items and are separately presented in the Income Statement. These items are added back/deducted from profit/loss before 
taxation to arrive at adjusted profit/loss before taxation. These items and their related tax impacts are added back/deducted 
from profit attributable to owners of the Company to arrive at adjusted earnings per share. These measures are disclosed in 
order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
3. Segmental analysis 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based 
on the reports used by the Board. 
The Board considers the Group’s business through its two channels to market, being retail/wholesale and licensing. Retail/ 
wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and 
digital commerce as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts.  
The flow of global product between retail and wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a 
corporate level and implemented via the Group’s inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the USA. Licensing revenues 
are generated through the receipt of royalties from the Group’s partners in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, eyewear, 
timepieces and European childrenswear. 
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit. This measurement basis excludes 
the effects of exceptional items. The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board includes 
an allocation of corporate and central costs. Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each operating 
segment that is reviewed by the Board.

Auditor remuneration 
Fees incurred during the year in relation to audit and non-audit services are analysed below. All work performed by the external 
auditors is controlled by an authorisation policy agreed by the Audit Committee. The overriding principle precludes the auditors 
from engaging in non-audit services that would compromise their independence. Non-audit services are provided by the auditors 
where they are best placed to provide the service due to their previous experience or market leadership in a particular area.

6. Exceptional items 
Termination of licence relationship 
During the year ended 31 March 2013, a total of £82.9m has been recognised as an exceptional item relating to the termination 
of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship with Interparfums SA. A tax credit of £19.1m has been recognised on this 
exceptional charge in the current period. 
On 16 July 2012, the Group exercised its right to terminate its fragrance and beauty licence relationship with Interparfums SA 
in exchange for a payment of €181.2m (£142.2m at the spot rate of €1.27: £1 on the date of exercise). The payment was made 
on 21 December 2012 (£144.1m at the spot rate prevailing on the date of payment) and the termination was effective from 
1 April 2013. The terms of the termination were set out in the licence agreement, as modified by a subsequent transition 
agreement signed on 10 October 2012. If the licence relationship had not been terminated it would have expired on 
31 December 2017. 
£70.9m of this payment has been capitalised as an intangible asset within the category ‘trade marks, licences and other 
intangible assets’ (refer note 11). 
The remaining £71.3m, which does not qualify to be capitalised as an intangible asset, has been recognised as an expense 
in the current period. The £71.3m expense has been recognised as an exceptional item, due to the size and nature of the 
transaction. Other costs, which were incurred by the Group in the year as a result of the transaction, have been included 
within the total reported exceptional item of £82.9m relating to the termination of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship. 
These other costs are separately presented in order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the 
Group’s ongoing business in the year. 
The analysis of the exceptional item relating to the termination of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship and details 
of the other costs are as follows:

Total exceptional item relating to termination of licence relationship 82.9 
Professional fees 
Professional fees of £0.5m were incurred as a result of the transaction, mainly relating to legal services, tax advice and 
valuation services. 
Net foreign exchange loss 
The payment to Interparfums SA was hedged through taking out forward contracts, which matured on 21 December 2012. 
These contracts had a combined effective average rate of €1.26: £1, compared to the €1.27: £1 used to initially record the 
transaction. This has resulted in a difference of £2.2m between the Sterling equivalent of the amount to settle the creditor 
with Interparfums SA and the amount to settle the forward contract.  
Set up costs 
Set up costs of £8.9m were incurred during the year. These set up costs will not recur in future years, and solely represent 
expenses incurred as a result of transitioning the fragrance and beauty business from a licensed operation to a directly operated 
business. The direct operation is effective from 1 April 2013 and hence these set up costs did not relate to the Group’s ongoing 
business in the year. Further costs incurred in relation to the fragrance and beauty business from 1 April 2013 will not be treated 
as exceptional, other than amortisation of the intangible asset relating to the termination of the licence relationship. 
The set up costs include marketing costs which would have been borne by Interparfums SA if the licence relationship had not 
been terminated; the cost of employees hired in the current year to support the direct operation from 1 April 2013; rental costs 
for a new distribution centre for the Beauty business; system development expenses; consultancy fees, registration fees and 
contractual obligations in relation to equipment and inventory purchases arising from the transition agreement.

6. Exceptional items (continued) 
Restructuring costs 
During the year ended 31 March 2013, an exceptional credit was recognised for the release of £0.6m of the restructuring 
provision held in respect of the cost efficiency programme announced in the year to 31 March 2009. A tax charge of £0.1m 
has been recognised in relation to this exceptional credit in the current period.  
Put option liability finance income/charges 
The exceptional financing credit of £5.2m for the year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: charge of £10.2m) relates to fair value 
movements and the unwinding of the discount on the put option liability over the non-controlling interest in Burberry (Shanghai) 
Trading Co., Ltd. Refer to note 19 for further details of the carrying value of the put option liability. No tax has been recognised 
on this item, as it is not considered to be deductible for tax purposes.

Fragrance and beauty intangible asset 
On 16 July 2012, the Group exercised its right to terminate its fragrance and beauty licence relationship with Interparfums SA  
in exchange for a payment of €181.2m (£142.2m at the spot rate at the time of exercise). The payment was made on 
21 December 2012 and the termination was effective from 1 April 2013. The terms of the termination were set out in the licence 
agreement, as modified by a subsequent transition agreement signed on 10 October 2012. If the licence relationship had not 
been terminated it would have expired on 31 December 2017. The payment of €181.2m has given rise to an intangible asset 
of £70.9m and an expense of £71.3m at the spot rate of €1.27: £1 on 16 July 2012. 
The intangible asset relates to the present value of the anticipated incremental income which will be earned by the Group, 
as a result of selling fragrance and beauty products through retail and wholesale channels rather than under licence, from 
1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017, being the remaining period of the original licence, prior to its termination. In order to identify 
the carrying value of the intangible asset acquired, a value-in-use calculation has been performed, based on key forecast 
assumptions including: sales of products until 2017, by product category; operating margins achieved on this activity; tax 
charged on the incremental profits; the working capital required to support this activity; and anticipated tax relief on the 
payment made to acquire the intangible asset. Such forecast assumptions are inherently uncertain and the actual cash flows 
between 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2017 may differ materially from these assumptions.  
The asset is presented within the intangible asset category ‘trade marks, licences and other intangible assets’. It will be 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017. 
The remaining £71.3m, which does not qualify to be capitalised as an intangible asset, has been recognised as an expense 
in the current period (refer to note 6).

Total 86.3 81.2 
(1) The goodwill reported for China does not include any goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.  
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. Value-in-use calculations 
for each cash generating unit are based on projected three year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted 
terminal value. The cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted for country specific tax rates and risks. Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was 
recognised as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date, 
the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed up, to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest, 
for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit. The key assumptions contained 
in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business and the 
discount rates applied. 
The value-in-use calculations have been prepared using management’s approved financial plans for the three years ending 
31 March 2016. These plans contain management’s best view of the expected performance for the year ending 31 March 2014 
and the expected growth rates for the two years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016. The plans are based on the 
performance achieved in the current year and management’s knowledge of the market environment and future business 
plans. A terminal value has been included in the value-in-use calculation based on the cash flows for the year ending 
31 March 2016 incorporating the assumption that there is no growth beyond 31 March 2016. 
For the material goodwill balances of China and Korea, a sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use 
calculations by assuming no growth beyond the year ending 31 March 2014. This sensitivity analysis indicated significant 
headroom between the recoverable amount under this scenario and the carrying value of goodwill and therefore management 
considered no further detailed sensitivity analysis was required. 
The discount rates for China and Korea were 15.6% and 13.1% respectively (2012: 14.4%; 12.5%). 
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance in the year as, for each cash 
generating unit, the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.

(2) During the year ended 31 March 2012, £18.6m of assets were reclassified from fixtures and fittings to leasehold improvements as this was more representative of the 
nature of these assets.  
During the year to 31 March 2013, a net impairment charge of £11.3m (2012: £3.8m) was identified as part of the annual 
impairment review of the retail store assets. 
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the assets to the carrying 
values at 31 March 2013. The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans of expected revenues and costs of 
each retail cash generating unit, as approved by management, and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the lease exit dates 
using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each store’s location. The pre-tax discount rates used in these calculations 
were between 11.8% and 18.2% (2012: between 10.8% and 16.7%), based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks.

The Group leases out a freehold property in France to a third party on commercial terms. Rental income net of operating 
expenses directly attributable to the property of £0.7m is included in the profit for the year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: £0.7m). 
Based on a valuation report prepared by Cushman & Wakefield, the market valuation of the investment property is £11.3m, 
using closing exchange rates at 31 March 2013 (2012: £11.2m). The valuation was prepared in accordance with the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the International Valuation Standards Council, and is supported by market evidence. 
14. Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, and to the same fiscal authority. The offset amounts are shown

Deferred tax balances within the Other category in the analysis above include temporary differences arising on provisions, 
deferred income and unrealised exchange differences deferred in equity. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through 
the future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £22.3m (2012: £20.3m) in respect of 
losses and temporary timing differences amounting to £68.7m (2012: £57.8m) that can be set off against future taxable income. 
There is a time limit for the recovery of £14.1m of these potential assets (2012: £13.0m) which ranges from six to ten years 
(2012: seven to ten years). 
Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of £0.6m (2012: £0.6m) relating to unremitted 
overseas earnings. No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
where the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the 
foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance. The unrecognised deferred tax liability on unremitted 
earnings is £4.8m (2012: £2.0m).

17. Derivative financial instruments 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign 
exchange contracts. These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. The Group’s foreign currency denominated 
transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases. The Group manages these exposures through 
the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
19. Trade and other payables (continued) 
Following the acquisition of the Burberry retail and distribution business in China, Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group 
company, retains a 15% economic interest in the Group’s business in China. Put and call options exist over this interest stake 
which are exercisable after 1 September 2015 in the case of the call option, and after 1 September 2020 in the case of the put 
option. The net present value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability under IAS 39. 
The fair value of the put option has been derived using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable 
inputs (Level 3). The key inputs applied in arriving at the value of the put option are the future performance of the Group and that 
of the Group’s business in China; the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise; and the risk adjusted 
discount rate for China, taking into account the risk free rate in China. 
The maturity of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities excluding derivatives, retirement benefit obligations and onerous 
lease provisions, is as follows:

The non-current provisions relate to provisions for onerous leases and property reinstatement costs which are expected 
to be utilised within 23 years. Of the total £1.9m restructuring provision (2012: £3.5m), £1.7m represents a current liability 
(2012: £3.3m). The majority of this relates to the closure of the Spanish operations. The £0.2m non-current portion relates 
to onerous leases (2012: £0.2m).

Included within bank overdrafts is £125.6m (2012: £204.7m) representing balances on cash pooling arrangements in the Group. 
The Group has a number of committed and uncommitted overdraft and borrowing facilities agreed with third party banks.  
At 31 March 2013, the Group held bank overdrafts of £4.2m (2012: £2.6m) excluding balances on cash pooling arrangements. 
On 28 March 2011, a £300m multi-currency revolving credit facility was agreed with a syndicate of third party banks.  
At 31 March 2013, there were no outstanding drawings (2012: £nil). Interest is charged on this facility at LIBOR plus 0.90% 
on drawings less than £100m; at LIBOR plus 1.05% on drawings between £100m and £200m; and at LIBOR plus 1.20% 
on drawings over £200m. The facility matures on 30 June 2016.  
On 1 October 2010, a Yen 145m bilateral facility was agreed with a third party bank. The facility matured and was repaid in full 
on 1 October 2012.  
At 31 March 2012 other borrowings related to a loan provided by a minority interest partner totalling £0.5m. The loan matured 
and was repaid in full on 29 March 2013. Interest was charged on this loan at the Japanese short-term prime rate plus 0.5%.  
The fair value of borrowings and overdrafts approximates the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

At 31 March 2013, 30,027 of the 0.05p ordinary shares in issue are held as treasury shares (2012: 30,027). 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum 
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2013, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company 
under this authority (2012: nil).  
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against retained earnings, as the amounts paid reduce the profits 
available for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2013 the amounts offset against this reserve are £88.1m (2012: 
£41.9m). As at 31 March 2013, the ESOP trusts held 6.9m shares (2012: 3.3m) in the Company, with a market value of £91.7m 
(2012: £49.0m). In the year to 31 March 2013 the Burberry Group plc ESOP trust has waived its entitlement to dividends 
of £1.0m (2012: £0.2m). 
During the year profits of £3.1m (2012: £5.0m) have been transferred to capital reserves due to statutory requirements 
of subsidiaries. The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising 
on the purchase of own shares.

23. Financial commitments 
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, warehouses and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease 
arrangements. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group has commitments relating 
to future minimum lease payments under these non-cancellable operating leases as follows:

The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue (‘revenue leases’) have been 
based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease. Under certain revenue leases, there 
are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above. As a result, the amounts charged 
to the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.  
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases 
on land and buildings is as follows:

25. Financial risk management 
Other than derivatives, the Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings, 
trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations. 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk, share price risk 
and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available 
to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably. This is done in close co-operation with the 
Group’s operating units. Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying 
business requirements. The policies of the Group treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Market risk 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. 
The Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign 
exchange contracts (see note 17). The Group’s accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2. 
The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify 
as ‘highly probable’ forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes within the current or previous year. 
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for 
reporting purposes. It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose within the current or previous year. 
At 31 March 2013, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies strengthening/ 
weakening by 20% (2012: 20%) against Sterling with all other variables held constant. The effect on translating foreign currency 
denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have been 
to decrease/increase post-tax profit for the year by £5.2m (2012: increase/decrease £3.0m). The effect on translating forward 
foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries 
would have been to increase/decrease equity by £6.4m (2012: £12.1m). 
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other 
than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to 
manage currency exposure. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or 
paid in cash. Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement.

Share price risk 
The Group is exposed to employer’s national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share based 
incentive schemes. 
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability due to movements in the Group’s share price, 
the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards. The Group does not 
seek hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps. The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national 
insurance liability on an ongoing basis. An increase/decrease in the share price of 50.0p would have resulted in an 
increase/decrease in profit after tax of £1.2m (2012: £0.8m).  
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and 
external borrowings. 
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2013 are £129.8m (2012: £208.6m). This includes cash pool overdraft balances 
of £125.6m (2012: £204.7m) which are offset by cash balances for the purpose of interest calculations. At 31 March 2013, 
if interest rates on the remaining borrowings of £4.2m (2012: £3.9m) had been 100 basis points higher/lower (2012: 100 basis 
points) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £nil (2012: £nil) lower/higher, as a 
result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings. 
The fixed rate financial liabilities consist of amounts owed under a finance lease of £3.2m (2012: £1.8m). 
The floating rate financial assets, being short-term deposits, are £191.7m as at 31 March 2013 (2012: £284.3m). At 31 March 2013, 
if interest rates on short-term deposits had been 100 basis points higher/lower (2012: 100 basis points), with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £2.0m (2012: £2.8m) higher/lower, as a result of higher/lower interest income 
on short-term deposits. 
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not materially exposed 
to movements in foreign currency interest rates. 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number 
of different customers with no single debtor representing more than 7% of the total balance due. The Group has policies 
in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail customers 
are made in cash or via major credit cards. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the 
result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low. An ageing 
of overdue receivables is included in note 15.  
During the year the Group entered into a retail leasing arrangement in the Republic of Korea. As part of this arrangement, 
a KRW 27bn (£16.0m) 15 year interest free loan was provided to the landlord. The Group holds a registered mortgage over 
the leased property for the equivalent value of the loan which acts as collateral. At 31 March 2013 the discounted fair value 
of the loan is £8.7m. Other than this arrangement, the Group does not hold any other collateral as security. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date with respect to trade and other receivables is approximated by the carrying 
amount on the Balance Sheet. 
143
Notes to the Financial Statements  
25. Financial risk management (continued) 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain 
derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure 
equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial 
institution and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of “A”. 
The Group has deposited €0.1m (2012: €0.2m), CHF 0.3m (2012: CHF 0.3m), BRL nil (2012: BRL 0.6m), INR 0.2m  
(2012: INR 0.2m) and AED 0.3m (2012: AED nil) which is held as collateral at a number of European banks. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs 
and close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain 
flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. For further details of this, see note 21.  
All short-term trade payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less. The carrying value 
of all financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows. 
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities is as follows: 
 
 As at 
 31 March 2013 
As at
 31 March 2012 
In more than one year, but not more than two years  7.3 3.8 
In more than two years, but not more than three years  3.3 2.7 
In more than three years, but not more than four years  1.8 4.2 
In more than four years, but not more than five years  1.2 1.2 
In more than five years  148.0 184.0 
Total financial liabilities  161.6 195.9 
Non-current financial liabilities relate to lease liabilities, property-related accruals, derivatives, retirement benefit obligations, 
onerous lease provisions and the put option liability over non-controlling interests. The put option liability is subject to a 
contractual cap of £200m. 
Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital (defined as net cash plus equity excluding non-controlling interest) to ensure that entities in the 
Group are able to operate as going concerns and optimise returns to shareholders. At 31 March 2013, the Group had net cash 
of £296.6m (2012: £338.3m) and total equity excluding non-controlling interest of £1,017.0m (2012: £867.3m). The Group has 
access to a facility of £300m which was undrawn at 31 March 2013. For further details refer to note 21. 
Cash is used to fund the continued investment in the Group and growth of the global brand. It is also used to make routine 
outflows of capital expenditure, tax and dividends. The Group's dividend policy sets its payout target as 40% of adjusted 
diluted EPS. The Board reviews the Group’s dividend policy and funding requirements annually. 
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been 
in compliance throughout the financial year.

Share options granted to directors and employees 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation schemes for its directors and employees. Details 
of each of these schemes are set out in this note. The share option and award schemes have been valued using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan, which has market-based performance conditions 
attached, has been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this value, based on 
information obtained by running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.  
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employer’s national insurance liability (or overseas 
equivalent) that may arise in respect of these schemes (refer to note 25). 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme  
In the financial year ended 31 March 2007, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave) offering Burberry Group plc 
ordinary shares was introduced for employees. 
On 22 June 2012, further options were granted under this scheme with a three-year and five-year vesting period offered 
to employees. 
The savings contract commencement date for this grant was 1 September 2012. These options are exercisable for a period 
of up to six months from 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2017 for the three-year and five-year schemes respectively, 
with vesting dependent on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period. The exercise price 
for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date. 
Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London 
Stock Exchange.

The Burberry Co-Investment Plan  
Executive directors and certain senior management are able to defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest 
it in ordinary shares in the Company with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group performance during the year. 
The matching share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves within that period. The exercise 
price of these share awards is £nil. On 18 July 2012, 1,734,471 ordinary shares were awarded (2012: 1,816,507). The awards 
are also subject to secondary performance conditions. 
Awards granted in June 2010 vest in full only if the Group achieves at least 7% per annum adjusted PBT growth over the three 
year vesting period. A proportion of the award (25%) vests if growth in adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum. Vesting occurs 
on a straight-line basis between the threshold and the maximum. None of the award vests if adjusted PBT growth is below 5% 
per annum. 
Awards granted in June 2011 and 2012 vest in full only if the Group achieves at least 10% per annum adjusted PBT growth 
over the three year vesting period. A proportion of the award (25%) vests if growth in adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum. 
Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis between the threshold and the maximum. None of the award vests if adjusted PBT 
growth is below 5% per annum. 
The fair value of the awards granted on 18 July 2012 was determined as £12.12. The key factors used in determining the fair 
value were as follows: 
  18 July 2012 
Share price at grant date  £12.12 
Exercise price  £nil 
Life of award  Equivalent to 
  vesting period 
Expected volatility  35.9% 
Risk free interest rate  0.23% 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded 
rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the award.

December 2010 One-Off Grant 
On 8 December 2010, options in respect of 850,000 ordinary shares were granted as a one-off award. 
The options are due to vest on 1 April 2015. Strategic and financial objectives linked to the long-term growth of the Group must 
be met in order for 500,000 of the options to vest. The vesting of all of the options is dependent on continued employment for 
the vesting period. The exercise price of these share options is £nil.

27. Assets classified as held for sale 
In September 2010, £17.0m of assets were reclassified to assets held for sale, representing the carrying value of the freehold 
properties in Spain. The property was subsequently written down to its fair value less costs to sell. 
During the year ended 31 March 2013, an asset classified as held for sale with a carrying value of £0.1m was sold, for a price 
of £0.1m. The current conditions in the Spanish property market indicate that it may be difficult to realise the sale of the 
remaining property within twelve months. As a result, £8.3m has been transferred back into property, plant and equipment, 
representing the carrying value at 31 March 2013 of this property, which was previously classified as held for sale. 
Management remains committed to selling the property and continues to actively market it as such. 
28. Related party transactions 
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated 
on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. Total compensation in respect of key management, who are defined 
as the Board of Directors and certain members of senior management, is considered to be a related party transaction.

(1) Held directly by Burberry Group plc. 
In accordance with Section 410(2)(a) of the Companies Act 2006, the above information is provided solely in relation 
to principal subsidiaries. 
As at 31 March 2013, all principal subsidiary undertakings are wholly owned, except where indicated differently above, 
and operate in the country in which they are incorporated with the exception of Burberry Italy Retail Limited, which operates 
principally in Italy. All shares held in subsidiary undertakings are ordinary shares, with the exception of Burberry Limited. 
The Group holds 100% of Burberry Limited’s ordinary and preference shares. All the subsidiary undertakings have been 
consolidated as at 31 March 2013. The Group has a 59% share in profits of Burberry Middle East LLC and has the power  
to appoint the majority of directors. Non-operating intermediate holding and financing companies are excluded from the list 
above. Sparkle Roll Holding Limited, a non-Group company, holds a 15% economic interest in Burberry (Shanghai) Trading 
Co., Ltd. 
On 30 April 2013, the Group increased its equity holding in Burberry International K.K. to 71%, as a result of the exercise 
of an option over the 20% equity stake previously held by a minority interest partner, Mitsui and Co Limited (refer note 30). 
Details of all Burberry subsidiaries will be annexed to the next Annual Return of Burberry Group plc to be filed at 
Companies House.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
30. Non-controlling interest in Burberry International K.K. 
On 29
 
March 2013, Burberry International Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Burberry Group plc, signed 
an amendment to the shareholder agreement for Burberry International Kabushiki Kaisha, a company in which Burberry 
International Holdings Limited held a controlling 51% interest at 31 March 2013. The amendment entitles Burberry International 
Holdings Limited to the option to acquire the remaining equity in Burberry International K. K. from the minority interest partners, 
Mitsui and Co., Ltd and Sanyo Shokai Limited, at a nominal fixed price on or after 1 April 2013 and 1 April 2014 respectively. 
The amendment also required the outstanding borrowings from Mitsui and Co., Ltd in Burberry International K.K. to be repaid, 
as described in note 21. 
As a result of acquiring these call options, it is deemed that the risks and rewards of ownership of the non-controlling interest 
in Burberry International K. K. has transferred to Burberry International Holdings Limited. Consequently, the non-controlling 
interest has been derecognised, resulting in a transfer of £4.2m in the year, from non-controlling interest to equity attributable 
to owners of the Company. 
31. Contingent Liabilities 
The Group is subject to claims against it and tax audits covering, amongst others, valued added taxes, sales taxes, customs 
duties, corporate taxes and payroll taxes. These arise in the normal course of business and in a number of jurisdictions. These 
matters are inherently difficult to quantify. Where appropriate, the estimated cost of known obligations have been provided in 
these accounts in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. While changes to the amounts that may be payable could 
be material to the results or cash flows of the Group in the period in which they are recognised the Group does not expect the 
outcome of these contingent liabilities to have a material effect on the Group’s financial condition.

Five Year Summary We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 106, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and  
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent Company financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:  
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013.

Company Balance Sheet A. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc (the Company) is the parent Company of the Burberry Group. Burberry Group plc is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and its principal business is investment. The Company is the sponsoring entity of The Burberry Group plc 
ESOP Trust and The Burberry Group plc SIP Trust (collectively known as the ESOP trusts). These financial statements have 
been prepared by consolidating the ESOP Trusts into the financial statements of the Company. The purpose of the ESOP 
trusts is to purchase shares of the Company in order to satisfy Group share based payment arrangements.  
Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. The Group 
also licences third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trade marks. All of the companies which 
comprise the Group are controlled by the Company directly or indirectly. 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, with the 
exception of those financial instruments which are included in the financial statements at fair value, and in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.  
B. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  
Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation schemes, under which services are received from 
employees (including executive directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. The cost of the share based 
incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. Appropriate 
option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value of the awards made. 
The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance 
conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market 
conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number 
of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated 
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group 
is treated as a capital contribution. In the Company’s accounts, the cost of the share based incentives is recognised over the 
vesting period of the awards as an increase in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held 
in an ESOP trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. The proceeds received from the exercises, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.  
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend 
becomes a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid. 
Investments in Group companies 
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 
Impairment of assets 
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (income-generating units).  
158
Notes to the Company Financial Statements  
B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments are reported and measured in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26 respectively. The Company used 
the exemption not to present FRS 29 disclosures in the notes to the entity financial statements as full equivalent disclosures 
are presented within the consolidated financial statements.  
Equity swap contracts are marked to market with gains and losses arising on these contracts recognised in the profit and 
loss account. 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated 
into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised 
in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.  
Related party transactions 
FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions and balances between the 
reporting entity and related parties. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under the terms of FRS 8 not to 
disclose details of transactions with entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries.

Profit for the year on ordinary activities, but before dividends payable, was £323.5m (2012: £37.9m). As permitted by 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum 
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2013, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company 
under this authority.  
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce 
the profits available for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2013 the amounts offset against this reserve are £88.1m 
(2012: £41.9m). As at 31 March 2013, the ESOP trusts held 6.9m shares (2012: 3.3m) in the Company, with a market value 
of £91.7m (2012: £49.0m). In the year to 31 March 2013 the ESOP trusts have waived their entitlement to dividends of £1.0m 
(2012: £0.2m). 
The capital reserve consists of the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.

Dividends
An interim dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 
of 8.0p per ordinary share was paid on 25 January 2013.  
A final dividend of 21.0p per share has been proposed and, 
subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 
2013, will be paid according to the following timetable:
Final dividend record date: 5 July 2013 
Deadline for return of DRIP mandate forms: 11 July 2013 
Final dividend payment date: 1 August 2013
The ADR local payment date will be approximately five 
business days after the proposed dividend payment date 
for ordinary shareholders.
Dividends can be paid by BACS directly into a UK bank 
account, with the tax voucher being sent to the 
shareholder’s address. This is the easiest way for 
shareholders to receive dividend payments and avoids  
the risk of lost or out of date cheques. A dividend mandate 
form is available from Equiniti or at shareview.co.uk.
Dividends payable in foreign currencies
Equiniti are able to pay dividends to shareholder bank

be deducted from each dividend payment. Further details 
can be obtained from Equiniti or online at shareview.co.uk.

shareholders to use their dividends to buy further Burberry 
shares. Full details of the DRIP can be obtained from Equiniti. 
If shareholders would like their final 2013 and future 
dividends to qualify for the DRIP, completed application 
forms must be returned to Equiniti by 11 July 2013.
Duplicate accounts
Shareholders who have more than one account due  
to inconsistency in account details may avoid duplicate 
mailings by contacting Equiniti and requesting  
the amalgamation of their share accounts.
Electronic communication
Shareholders may at any time choose to receive all 
shareholder documentation in electronic form via the 
internet, rather than in paper format. Shareholders who 
decide to register for this option will receive an email each 
time a shareholder document is published on the internet. 
Shareholders who wish to receive documentation in 
electronic form should register online at shareview.co.uk.

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. These are typically from overseas-based 
‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in 
USA or UK investments. These operations are commonly 
known as boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, get the 
correct name of the person and organisation and check 
that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk/register/
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme if things go wrong. 
If you think you have been approached by an unauthorised 
firm you should contact the FCA consumer helpline on  
0800 111 6768.

website at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself/

Introduction  In 2012/13, the Burberry team navigated a challenging environment making 
excellent strategic progress and achieving another record financial result.
Sir John Peace
Chairman 
Strategically, activity was focused by Burberry’s core 
themes. In product, the team continued to refine the  
offering across categories. Innovative digital marketing 
activity brought a more engaging message to targeted sets 
of consumers. Flagship store openings extended Burberry’s 
presence in key gateway cities. Supported by these 
initiatives, the brand experience continued to be enriched 
and elevated. Burberry’s distinctive culture was further 
nurtured and reinforced, and continued to project externally 
through the work of the Burberry Foundation. These, along 
with the full set of the Group’s strategic initiatives, are 
discussed throughout this report.
This progress was also recognised externally. Interbrand, 
the global brand consultancy, once again named Burberry  
in its list of the world’s 100 most valuable brands. In the 
digital arena, Burberry led media think tank L2’s Fashion 
‘Digital IQ Index’ for the second year. On land, Fast 
Company magazine listed Burberry second in its ranking of 
the world’s most innovative retailers. And, in an indicator of 
cultural strength, professional platform LinkedIn identified 
Burberry as the 29th most in-demand employer globally.
Financial performance was also strong. Total revenue grew 
8% to £2bn, with adjusted operating profit increasing 14% 
to £428m. While overall results are strong, a look at the core 
retail/wholesale business, which excludes the impact of the 
legacy Japan licensed business, is more indicative of the 
modern brand’s progress. Here, retail/wholesale adjusted 
operating profit increased 17% on an 8% revenue gain. 
Adjusted after-tax return on capital was 35%. The Group 
ended the year with a £297m net cash balance, and the 
board has recommended a 16% increase in the full year  
dividend to 29.0p.
In addition to the team’s efforts, these results were also  
a function of investments over the past several years.  
The Group has invested heavily in stores, emerging growth 
markets, technology and new capabilities. While in line with 
Burberry’s growth objectives, it’s worth highlighting that 
some of these are particularly important in a more difficult 
external environment. For example, previous investments  
in information systems and business intelligence expertise 
brought greater visibility and enabled quicker and more 
precise action during the year. Looking forward, although 
the near-term environment presents many uncertainties, 
Burberry plans to continue to invest based upon a 
successful strategy, its distinctive culture and generally 
favourable luxury sector fundamentals. Consistent with  
this, in 2012/13 Burberry committed to one of its largest 
single investments to date with its decision to integrate the 
fragrance and make-up business. Operating as of 1 April 
2013, Beauty offers an exciting growth platform  
for the future.
The year also brought important management changes. 
Stacey Cartwright, Executive Vice President, Chief  
Financial Officer and a director, will stand down in July 2013 
to pursue new interests. Stacey has been an outstanding 
contributor to Burberry during the past nine years, and we 
thank and wish her well in future endeavours. We welcome 
Carol Fairweather as Chief Financial Officer and a director. 
As Carol has been with the Group for six years, most 
recently leading the finance function, this is a natural 
transition. Finally, John Smith, former Chief Executive of 
BBC Worldwide and a non-executive director, joined 
Burberry’s executive team as Chief Operating Officer in 
March. John’s deep experience in digital media is an 
important addition to the Group. In keeping with this 
dynamic, growing business, we expect to continue  
to evolve board composition going forward.
On behalf of the Board, I thank the global team for their 
efforts during a challenging year and congratulate them  
on their achievements. By executing a consistent strategy  
in pursuit of clear objectives – clarity of the luxury brand 
message, sustainable growth and great company –  
the Burberry team has generated substantial value for 
shareholders in this and years past. Similarly, on behalf  
of the Board and team, I thank shareholders for their 
continued support.

Introduction  From outstanding performance in 2011/12, Burberry began the year cautiously 
optimistic, our long-range objectives – ensuring clarity of the luxury brand message, 
enabling sustainable growth and being a great company – firmly in sight. 
Angela Ahrendts
Chief Executive Officer
This combination of optimism and determination, fuelled  
by the brand’s wealth of opportunity, suggested continued 
pursuit of the investment-oriented strategic agenda in the 
year ahead. At the same time, this pre-disposition was 
tempered by uncertainties in the macro environment and the 
goal to deliver near-term financial performance. In the final 
analysis, the result was a balance of dynamic management, 
core execution and strategic investment.
Challenging context 
Following standout growth in 2011 relative to the range  
of consumer sectors, luxury slowed dramatically in 2012. 
The ongoing economic crisis in the Eurozone and a 
continued sluggish US weighed on all areas of consumer 
spending. Although most of Asia remained relatively  
healthy, the Chinese consumer – which accounts for  
a majority of luxury consumption growth – was subdued  
by a secularly decelerating economy complicated by 
government transition. Industry experts estimate that luxury 
sector growth declined from 13% in 2011 to 5% in 2012. 
Within that, ready-to-wear brands and businesses were 
disproportionately affected. For Burberry, this climate 
manifested itself in a decline in store traffic and greater 
weekly sales volatility.
Dynamic management
Internally, we talk about managing the business dynamically 
and focusing on the things we can control. 2012/13’s 
external environment tested the team on these dimensions. 
Supported by investments in information systems and 
business intelligence expertise during the past few years – 
which enable monitoring, analysis and implementation –  
we set out to do exactly that. 
Heightened conversion
The traffic decline placed greater emphasis on converting 
consumers entering the stores to customers. This effort 
included service initiatives that maximised time on the selling 
floor of our most skilled associates, increased inventory 
availability and improved selling skills and product knowledge. 
In terms of product, we expedited fashion assortments 
targeted at core luxury customers and refined monthly 
floorset execution to enhance the flow of fresh merchandise.

Introduction  Targeted marketing
Aided by deeper consumer insight, we retargeted marketing 
activities in keeping with changing consumer spending 
patterns. The team increased the brand’s presence in  
high-profile outdoor and travel-oriented locations and 
experimented with new digital venues – some of which  
were contracted on a real-time basis. For festive periods,  
a cross-functional group refined programmes across 
product, visual and advertising to better highlight specific 
gift-giving opportunities.
Tactical efficiency
The Group also acted to enhance near-term efficiency. 
Discretionary expenses were tightly controlled and  
inventory was closely managed at all stages of the  
process in keeping with softer sales.
Core execution
Articulated by the five strategic themes, Burberry’s core 
strategy has been consistently executed over the past  
seven years, and actions to navigate immediate conditions 
did not sway us from this course. 
Blurring the physical and digital
Given a world of increasingly ubiquitous mobile internet 
access, we expect dissolution of the boundaries separating 
physical and digital channels. Consumers will see a single, 
continuous space in which to interact with a brand. Through 
a range of activities, we are working to integrate the benefits 
of the physical and digital spheres. Ultimately, the vision  
is to serve completely any consumer on any platform in  
any geography.
 · In this regard, the opening of the London flagship at  
121 Regent Street in September is our most ambitious 
effort to date. Housed in a period building restored in 
partnership with traditional British craftsmen, the store 
expresses burberry.com in tangible space – complete 
product assortment, RFID technology to trigger targeted  
multimedia content, omnipresent digital screens 
continuously projecting brand imagery. Burberry World 
Live, a store of the future, blending heritage and innovation, 
online with offline.
 · Additional integration initiatives included the expanded 
use of iPads to enhance inventory availability, continued 
upgrading of Retail Theatre throughout the store base  
to ensure synchronised delivery of brand content to 
consumers, and experimentation with new payment 
systems to streamline the purchase experience. 
 
 
Enhancing the product proposition
At the heart of the Burberry brand, product was a key  
area of strategic activity.
 · Elevation of the product offering is an ongoing process.  
In the year, we exited selected opening price points  
in heritage rainwear and leather goods categories.  
Exacting a cost in terms of sales, this is consistent with 
the brand’s positioning within the current luxury context. 
Similarly responding to consumer demand, we continued 
to invest in the upper tiers of our product pyramid, the 
Prorsum and London labels. These labels increased their 
share of retail sales during the year.
 · Although founded as a mens brand, Burberry is 
underpenetrated in mens. During the year, outerwear 
benefited from greater emphasis on innovation and 
design. Tailoring developed with broader assortments 
and expanded distribution. Closer attention to in-store 
timing of seasonal merchandise enhanced relevance of 
the offering. And the first fully dedicated Burberry mens 
store was opened in London in October 2012. Achieving  
a 13% revenue increase, mens was the fastest growing 
product division in the year. With mens integration only 
two years old, Burberry is in the early stages of 
capitalising on this heritage.
 · October saw the launch of The Britain watch for women 
and men. The Britain, featuring an advanced Swiss-made 
mechanical movement and more sophisticated design,  
is an important step in realigning Burberry’s watch 
business with the brand’s luxury positioning.
Engaging the Chinese consumer globally
Given their importance, efforts to better understand  
and serve Chinese consumers are an ongoing priority. 
During the year, Burberry conducted proprietary research, 
leveraging the results across functions: to extend product 
sizing and fit, to train sales associates in high-travel markets, 
to formulate occasion-specific marketing campaigns –  
citing a few examples. In the year, Greater China represented 
Burberry’s fastest growing major market and this consumer 
was prominent throughout the retail network.

Introduction  Developing growth markets
Outside Asia, the Group continued to develop other  
growth markets. In the directly operated markets of India, 
Latin America and the Middle East, the Group opened  
net six mainline stores during the year. While some offer 
below average profitability today, we believe these markets 
represent important components of future growth.  
In regions operated through franchise partners, including 
Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe, eight stores were 
opened with expansion to five new markets, including 
Georgia and Jordan. New franchise agreements were 
signed for Colombia and Chile.
Expanding the retail presence
In addition to London, the year included flagship store 
openings in Chicago, Hong Kong and Milan. While 
contributing to sales, these brand statements in gateway 
cities present the complete Burberry to diverse groups  
of relevant consumers, many of them new to the brand.  
In total, the Group opened net 14 mainline stores,  
six concessions and five outlets during the year, and 
completed seven major renovations. Average selling  
space increased 13%.
Refining the wholesale presence
Efforts to align the quality of the brand’s wholesale presence 
with that of retail are ongoing. In both the Americas and 
Europe, we continued to concentrate on luxury-oriented 
department and specialty stores – with emphasis on 
dedicated real estate – while exiting legacy doors 
inconsistent with the brand’s positioning. This activity, in 
combination with the channel’s exposure to soft geographies, 
resulted in 1% underlying wholesale revenue growth for  
the year. 
As part of the brand proposition, Burberry looks to be  
a leader in consumers’ digital interaction with brands,  
in both innovation and capability. In marketing, the S/S13 
campaign generated record awareness through social 
media. Total Burberry YouTube video views reached over 
ten million during the year. RFID-enabled personalised 
content was introduced with the A/W13 runway show. 
Experimenting with emerging digital platforms, Burberry 
streamed live images of London weather to prominent 
outdoor sites in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and 
New York during the Olympic period. In commerce, 
burberry.com added Spanish and Korean languages  
and tested new fulfilment options.
Strategic investment
While executing currently, the team invested in strategic 
initiatives with longer-term horizons.
Integrating Beauty
Among the most exciting strategic investments in recent 
years, the transition of Burberry’s fragrance and make-up 
business from a licensed to a directly operated business 
began in the year.
 · Offering luxury’s opening price point and broadest 
distribution, fragrance is the most widely encountered 
expression of the Burberry brand. The category also 
accounts for a large percentage of global brand media 
spend. As a result, direct operation will assist in 
optimising brand presence in every market, further enable 
Burberry to capitalise on the synergistic relationship with 
fashion, and better align the product offering with brand 
architecture. Integration elevates  
this business to true core activity, allowing Burberry  
to capture the full opportunity.
 · In terms of opportunity, despite Burberry’s position 
among the largest luxury apparel and accessories brands 
globally, it is undersized in fragrance. Growth has been 
slow, with fragrance significantly underperforming the rest 
of the Group over the past five years. In make-up, the 
brand has only just started.
 · From the decision to integrate in October, the team 
moved quickly across functions, leveraging existing skills 
and resources while adding external category-specific 
talent and capability. As of 1 April, Beauty had been 
successfully integrated and commenced operating. 
Burberry’s fifth product division, Beauty is a growth 
platform of the future.
Evolving customer dialogue
In a landscape of Big Data and continuous communication, 
we believe information-intensive, deep customer relationships 
which allow an individualised customer dialogue will be 
critical to future success in luxury. As part of this, the Group 
began developing new tools to provide an integrated  
view of a customer’s interaction with the brand across  
all Burberry platforms, with initial piloting of a clienteling 
application commencing at year end. Development work  
to enhance consumers’ ability to engage the brand through 
mobile devices also progressed in the year.

Introduction  Transitioning the Japan legacy
In Japan, transition from the legacy licensed business  
to global integration continued. As part of this, Burberry’s 
early stage retail operation achieved strong growth at 
existing stores and concessions, opened a concession, 
added a third store and planned additional openings in 
2013/14; while the effect of licence terminations continued 
to reduce legacy royalty income.
Reinforcing the supply chain
To accommodate future growth objectives, the Group 
reinforced the supply chain. In logistics, Burberry added 
distribution capacity, upgraded existing facilities and 
increased network efficiency. In sourcing, additional 
resources were committed to further develop in-house 
outerwear manufacturing capability and improve raw 
material management.
Strong financial results
This balance of activity delivered record financial results  
in 2012/13 while positioning Burberry well for years ahead. 
Total revenue increased 8% underlying to £2bn. Retail 
revenue grew 12% driven by new space and a 5% 
comparable store gain. Soft European markets particularly 
weighed on wholesale, resulting in a 1% underlying revenue 
increase. The 1% underlying decline in licensing revenue 
was a product of double-digit growth among global licences 
more than offset by declining legacy Japan royalties. 
Adjusted operating profit increased 14% to £428m, with the 
core retail/wholesale segment increasing 17% on 8% 
revenue growth – retail/wholesale operating margin also 
reached a record 17.8%. Capital expenditure totalled £176m 
and the Group ended the year with £297m in net cash. 
Powerful culture
Burberry’s culture is a key ingredient to this success. 
Rooted in the brand’s core values and fuelled by a  
creative-thinking, entrepreneurial spirit, our connected, 
united culture creates an energy that enables innovation, 
coordination and agility. These characteristics are evident  
in the year’s accomplishments. This distinctive culture  
is also expressed externally through ethical trade and 
sustainability efforts, employee engagement with local 
communities and the Burberry Foundation, which contributes 
both human and capital resources to encourage youth  
to realise their dreams through the power of creativity.  
We continued to invest in this powerful culture throughout 
the organisation – communication initiatives, operating 
structures, reward programmes and celebrations.  
The bigger the business becomes, the more connected  
we will need to be. 
A great community
Through the efforts of this great team we largely realised  
our objectives. So I thank them, as well as Burberry’s 
extended community of franchise and licensing partners, 
customers and suppliers, for their passion, commitment  
and hard work during the year. Looking forward, this team 
provides confidence for markets favourable or not.

Strategic  
Themes Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Brand momentum
Ensuring the strength, purity and positioning of the  
Burberry brand remained a priority.
Burberry World Live
 · Burberry Regent Street opened in London in September 
2012 as the brand’s most comprehensive expression  
to date. Introducing the concept of ‘Burberry World Live’, 
Regent Street blurred the physical and the digital to bring 
all aspects of burberry.com (‘Burberry World’) to life  
in a meticulously-restored heritage space.
 · Offering the full collection in a digitally-enriched environment, 
Regent Street engaged customers with brand content 
continuously projected on over 100 screens throughout  
the store, including product-specific content triggered by 
RFID-enabled merchandise on mirrors that turn instantly 
to screens. In-store audiences could watch key brand 
moments live from other locations, including the 
womenswear S/S13 and A/W13 runway shows.
 · Regent Street also gave physical expression to the 
brand’s most innovative digital launches. This included 
live music events featuring Burberry Acoustic artists  
and the first in-store Burberry Bespoke experience. 
Beauty
 · In October 2012, Burberry announced the transition  
of its fragrance and make-up business from a licensed  
to a directly operated structure. 
 · As consumers’ most widely encountered expression  
of the Burberry brand, Beauty provides outstanding 
growth opportunities for the Group. Business integration 
was completed during the year with operations 
commencing on 1 April 2013.
Digital
 · Investments in burberry.com continued with expanded 
delivery to over 100 countries, while the introduction  
of Spanish and Korean brought the number of languages 
online to eight.
 · Retail theatre was rolled out to a further 84 stores, 
extending the global streaming of brand content in all 
flagship markets.
Brand recognition
 · Listed in Interbrand’s ‘Top 100 Global Brands’ for the 
fourth consecutive year, Burberry was named the luxury 
fashion brand with the greatest increase in brand value. 
Burberry was cited by Altagamma as the luxury brand 
with the highest digital customer awareness and led 
media think tank L2’s ‘Fashion Digital IQ Index’ for the 
second year, as well as being named by L2 as the fashion 
brand with the highest ‘digital IQ’ in China. LinkedIn ranked 
Burberry the 29th most in-demand employer globally.
Marketing innovation
Continued extension of its reach through marketing 
innovation, leveraging brand content to engage  
and connect global audiences.
Digital engagement
 · Brand excitement was driven globally across a range  
of platforms. The S/S13 main campaign generated  
record awareness through social and traditional media, 
with the launch video generating over 1.7 million views  
on YouTube and Burberry trending globally on Twitter.  
The womenswear A/W13 show was streamed live  
on Twitter for the first time, allowing followers to embed 
the show stream in personal newsfeeds. 
 · Burberry finished the year as the most followed luxury 
brand on Facebook, with nearly 15 million fans. Total 
lifetime YouTube video views reached nearly 24 million 
and the brand’s combined Twitter following was over  
two million. Burberry was also the leading luxury  
lifestyle brand on Instagram.
Outdoor investment
 · Investment was increased in out-of-home marketing  
in key markets. To emphasise the brand’s association 
with weather, Burberry streamed live images of London 
scenes simultaneously throughout the Olympic period  
to prominent outdoor sites in London, Paris, Hong Kong, 
Los Angeles and New York. 
 · The Art Of The Trench social media platform was taken  
to outdoor spaces in London and Chicago in conjunction 
with flagship store launches. 
 · More broadly, the brand secured key airport and iconic 
urban locations on a long-term basis.

Themes Product excellence
Burberry creates great product through intensive focus  
on design innovation, quality and core heritage icons.
Outerwear
 · Outerwear is the core of the apparel business, 
underpinned by monthly fashion groups and a robust 
replenishment programme. Leveraging the brand’s  
unique heritage together with design innovation and 
excellence, outerwear accounted for about 50% of 
mainline apparel sales. The iconic trench coat continued 
to be a central feature of the brand’s marketing activities. 
Mens
 · Investments in infrastructure saw increased product  
and marketing excellence in men’s outerwear, London 
and Brit. As the fastest growing product division,  
mens represented 24% of retail/wholesale revenue.
 · Retail sales of men’s tailoring, available in over 70 mainline 
stores, grew by nearly 70% year-on-year and the first 
dedicated standalone mens store opened in 
Knightsbridge, London.
Product hierarchy
 · Burberry Prorsum and London continued to outperform, 
reflecting customer preferences and representing about 
half of womens and mens mainline retail sales.
 · An ongoing focus on innovative product, marketing  
and merchandising and a shift in the product pyramid  
mix drove growth in mainline average unit retail prices.
 · Runway Made to Order launched, continuing to put  
the Burberry customer at the centre of increasingly 
personalised luxury experiences. Engraved nameplates 
could be added to custom-made outerwear and bags from 
the womenswear A/W13 collection. Smart personalisation 
technology was introduced to unlock bespoke digital 
content relating to each item on touchscreen devices.

Themes Accessories remained Burberry’s largest product division, 
contributing 39% of total retail/wholesale revenue and 
recording underlying growth of 8%. 
Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Men’s accessories
 · Continued investments in product design, development 
and marketing drove an increase in sales of over 30%,  
to account for nearly 20% of total mainline accessories 
revenue. Growth in this category was particularly strong 
in Asia Pacific and on burberry.com.
Soft accessories
 · Continued diversification and innovation in fabrications 
and prints, supported by enhanced visual merchandising, 
enabled outperformance in this key category.
 · Scarves, one of the largest trans-seasonal businesses, 
performed strongly, driven by a balanced offer across 
cashmere and lighter-weight blends.
Large leather goods
 · Accounting for around half of all mainline accessories 
revenue, large leather goods remained the backbone  
of this category. Growth was driven by focused  
marketing of key fashion shapes and continued innovation 
in the core leather programme, including the launch of  
the Heritage Grain collection.
 · Following a successful launch in the womenswear A/W12 
collection, the Orchard bag was subsequently introduced 
as a replenishment style and became the brand’s  
second-best selling shape within a year. 
Festive
 · The seamless execution of giftable product was  
a focus throughout the year, with a particular emphasis  
on accessories. New experiences were created on 
burberry.com and brand marketing campaigns were 
synchronised across all platforms to drive awareness  
and sales growth around key global holiday periods.
Watches
 · With the introduction of The Britain, Burberry took  
a major step in realigning its watches with the brand’s 
global luxury positioning.
 · Inspired by the iconic trench coat, the mechanical watch 
collection for men and women celebrated the brand’s 
values of functional design and craftsmanship.
 · The launch included a bespoke mobile experience, 
featuring a to-scale interactive 3D model of the  
watch displaying the user’s time, location and local 
weather conditions.
Eyewear
 · A continued focus on product development  
and distribution drove robust sales growth.
 · Product activity included the addition of two high-profile 
collections in the year. The Aviator sunglasses collection 
was launched with a digitally-led music campaign,  
which included live performances by Burberry Acoustic 
bands in Milan, New York, Paris and Sydney. Splash 
sunglasses were introduced at the womenswear and 
menswear S/S13 runway shows and featured in the main 
advertising campaign.

at home and abroad.

particular focus on technology, planning and supply chain.
Key highlights from 2012/13 include:
Technology investments
Process innovation
 · Back office finance and HR functions continued to evolve 
with enhanced governance, risk and compliance systems. 
Automated and standardised processes were introduced 
to enable scalable growth and to support the incorporation 
of the Beauty division.
 · Technology was leveraged to enable the rapid delivery  
of consolidated data such as product details, customer 
and transaction information to front-end applications, 
including the development of an iPad-enabled digital 
catalogue for showrooms.
Social entity
 · Continued development and deployment of Burberry’s 
internal communications portal connected and engaged 
employees worldwide with chat forums, video content 
and tailored working groups. 
 · In November 2012, this was rolled out to select external 
partners, reinforcing and enhancing the connections 
between the business and its global constituencies  
and facilitating greater transparency, efficiency  
and responsiveness.
Planning
 · Assortment planning and inventory management 
continued to improve, balanced by product division,  
label, category and price point.
 · The global brand buy, a common product assortment 
across Burberry stores, provided increased supply chain 
efficiency, while maintaining regional flexibility.
Supply chain
Optimising logistics
 · Logistical enhancements were implemented to provide 
capacity for long-term growth. The regional distribution 
hub in Piacenza, Italy was expanded to optimise 
European logistics activities, while in Asia Pacific a new 
distribution centre in Kwai Chung, Hong Kong was 
opened to service China. 
 · Digital commerce operations in Europe moved  
in-house, with all online customer orders fulfilled by  
the recently-enhanced UK distribution centre in Blyth. 
Investment in UK manufacturing
 · Additional capital investments in Castleford, the brand’s 
heritage rainwear manufacturing facility, enabled seamless 
end-to-end product development and production, 
increasing accuracy and efficiency. 
 · The Woodrow facility, where the brand’s iconic gabardine 
fabric is woven, was renamed Burberry Mill to align the 
site more closely with the brand. Burberry Mill benefited 
from the integration of finance, HR and site management 
resources with Castleford during the year.

Burberry Impact
The Burberry Impact programme, covering ethical trade  
and environmental sustainability, was introduced as  
a five-year commitment to make meaningful and lasting 
improvements to workers’ employment and workplace 
conditions, as well as to significantly reduce the company’s 
environmental impact. These commitments, informed  
by baseline assessments, were developed in partnership 
with Forum for the Future and with support from the Ethical 
Trading Initiative. The programme is supported by  
an advisory committee of external expert stakeholders  
and the Burberry Strategic Responsibility Council. 
Burberry Impact has four areas of focus: people, product, 
process and property.
People
Burberry expects all its suppliers to comply with local  
labour and environmental laws and the Burberry Ethical 
Trading Code of Conduct, providing their workers with  
safe working conditions and fair pay, and allowing them  
to exercise their right to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining. 
Further integration of ethical trade principles into 
commercial decision making continued to be a focus  
across the business, with opportunities identified  
to improve labour standards through strong supplier 
relationships. Engagement activities included announced 
and unannounced audits; monitoring; continuous 
improvement programmes supported by third parties; and 
the provision of training and confidential worker hotlines. 
Burberry continued to provide suppliers with the necessary 
tools and support to ensure compliance with the Burberry 
Ethical Trading Policy, including the Burberry Ethical  
Trading Code of Conduct. The Code is underpinned by  
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the fundamental conventions of the International Labour 
Organisation and the Ethical Trading Initiative base code.

Burberry initiated an environmental baseline assessment  
of both direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) 
impacts from raw materials, energy, water, chemical inputs 
and waste. This detailed analysis enabled the identification 
of risks and priority areas for the business to focus reduction

Together, cotton and leather represent 57% of CO 2e

 from 
Burberry raw materials. Building collaborative partnerships 
with the suppliers of these materials is therefore critical  
to achieving Burberry’s product commitments. Working 
closely with other luxury brands and the Leather Working 
Group, Burberry committed to monitoring and improving  
the environmental management and traceability in its  
leather supply chain, working with tanneries supplying  
more than 65%
^
 of accessories leather.
Process
Burberry is committed to driving more sustainable 
outcomes throughout its worldwide operations. 
Reflecting its commitment to reducing energy consumption 
across the supply chain, Burberry conducted energy 
efficiency assessments at key vendor sites and distribution 
centres, which account for almost one-third of CO 2e
^
 
identified in the environmental baseline assessment.
Property
Leveraging the sustainability expertise of the Burberry 
construction team is crucial to the continued pursuit  
of more sustainable construction practices and energy 
efficiency in both existing and new buildings. 
Pilot energy saving schemes were introduced after store 
audits identified up to 65% kilowatt hours
^
 of potential 
energy savings in selected stores. The new Chicago  
flagship store achieved LEED Silver certification, using 
innovative technologies to increase efficiency.
Recognising that associate education and engagement  
is critical to achieving Burberry’s energy efficiency targets,  
a training programme was established and supported by  
a global challenge encouraging the submission of creative 
ideas for sustainable action.

Burberry Engage 
Leveraging core business competences and individual 
talents in the communities where associates live and work 
remains a key objective. Burberry continued to encourage 
its associates to connect with the Burberry Beyond 
framework, extending its positive impact in new and  
existing locations. Eight taskforces were established to 
dynamically embed the framework into ways of working 
across the global organisation. 
Associates were encouraged to dedicate their skills and 
passions during working hours to volunteering programmes, 
harnessing their talents to give back to local communities.

Great Company Reward
Burberry continued to strengthen the link between reward 
and performance across the organisation, with all 
associates in a bonus or incentive scheme and able to  
share in the success of the business through the All 
Employee Free Share Plan. Accessibility was improved  
for the global SAYE programme, complementing existing 
online applications with the UK launch of text and  
telephone requests, which contributed to a 20% increase  
in global take-up. 
The Icon Awards programme, which recognises exceptional 
performance at all levels of the company, reached its sixth 
anniversary. A record 10,000 nominations were received 
globally and 97 awards were presented across four regions, 
in categories inspired by the Burberry brand, heritage and 
core values. 
The Long Service Awards scheme celebrated the loyalty 
and commitment of around 700 associates who reached 
milestone service anniversaries with Burberry, including  
15 associates with 30 years' service or more. 
Reinvent
A new, fully cross-functional and global team was 
established to integrate Beauty into the wider organisation. 
This was achieved through strategic recruitment of Beauty 
expertise and the reallocation of talent within the business. 
Regional accountability for organisational design and 
development was ensured, reflecting the diverse markets  
in which Burberry operates.
The technology function was also evolved to support  
the Beauty integration, with strategic competences  
brought in-house.
Recruit 
Burberry maintained its commitment to diversity  
and equal opportunities in recruitment. Nearly 10,000 
associates from over 100 countries are now employed 
across all continents, with an age span from 16 to 77  
and a global management team that is 37% female.  
The diversity within the Burberry community underpins  
its energy, vibrancy and connectedness. 
Following the establishment of a new Resourcing  
Centre of Expertise in 2011/12, applications increased  
by 70% year-on-year and 82% of all recruitment globally 
was conducted directly.
Increased use of social media directly impacted these 
results. On LinkedIn, Burberry’s followers increased  
by 250%, leading to applications from the site accounting 
for 6% of global direct recruitment. In addition to being 
ranked LinkedIn’s 29th most in-demand employer globally, 
Burberry was the ‘most-watched’ midsize company  
by UK students.
Retain
Burberry continued to enhance its retail teams and secure  
a talent pipeline for the future. A pilot Retail Management 
Programme was launched to prepare retail associates  
for a career in store management, through a series  
of assignments, masterclasses and mentoring support.
An extended and improved new associate on-boarding 
programme was rolled out in London, New York and Hong 
Kong, including regular and consistent pre-communication, 
defined training modules and in-depth insight into the 
Burberry culture and values over a three-month period.
The Burberry Leadership Council supported the 
development of 75 high potential associates towards 
becoming next-generation leaders through international 
networking opportunities, global strategy off-sites, mentoring 
from senior executives and leadership training workshops.
Burberry recognises that its people are its greatest asset and constantly strives 
to attract the best talent worldwide, to provide meaningful development 
opportunities at all levels and to reward and recognise high performance.

Retail
71% of revenue (2012: 68%); generated from 206 mainline 
stores, 214 concessions within department stores, digital 
commerce and 49 outlets. 
 · Retail sales increased by 12% on an underlying  
and reported FX basis.
 · Comparable store sales increased by 5%  
(H1: 3%; H2: 7%).
 · New space contributed the balance of growth (7%). 
 · Average retail selling space increased by 13%  
(2012: 14% excluding China acquisition).
During FY 2013, retail trading was uneven, with comparable 
store sales growth of 6%, 1%, 6% and 8% by quarter, achieved 
against double-digit growth throughout the previous year.
Product, marketing and customer service initiatives drove 
strong performance in the second half festive periods 
including Christmas and Chinese New Year. Digital was 
further optimised, with innovative marketing and monthly 
global messages leveraged and synchronised online and 
offline, responding to rapidly changing consumer behaviour.
Overall, store traffic was soft, offset by increased 
conversion rates and higher average transaction values. 
Online traffic and conversion were up significantly.
With continued focus on the execution of proven retail 
strategies, the drivers of growth were consistent with 
previous years.
 · Outerwear and large leather goods remained at about  
half of mainline revenue.
 · Replenishment remained at about half of mainline revenue.
 · Burberry Prorsum and London penetration increased  
by four percentage points to reach 49% of mainline 
apparel revenue.
 · Mens and men’s accessories accounted for over half  
the growth in mainline revenue.
There was positive comparable store sales growth  
in all four regions during the year.
Asia Pacific
Nearly 90% of Asia Pacific revenue came from retail. China 
and Hong Kong both delivered double-digit comparable  
store sales growth in the year, while Korea remained weak. 
A net seven stores were opened in the region, focused on 
upgrading the store portfolio in China and in flagship markets 
including Hong Kong, with new stores in Pacific Place and 
Russell Street. 
Europe
Retail accounted for nearly 70% of Europe revenue. Following 
a strong first quarter, comparable store sales growth was 
broadly unchanged for the remainder of the period. France 
and Germany were robust and Italy remained weak. The 
United Kingdom, Burberry’s home market, accounted for 
over 40% of Europe retail revenue and delivered good 
overall growth, driven by the investment in London stores 
(Regent Street and Knightsbridge mens).
New store openings were largely in flagship markets, 
including London, Milan and Rome, which typically benefit 
more from travelling luxury customers.
Americas
About two-thirds of Americas revenue came from retail.  
Low single-digit comparable store sales growth in the  
year was weighted towards the second half. Approaching 
10% of Americas retail revenue came from outside the 
United States, with five stores in Canada, seven in Brazil 
and two in Mexico at the year end. 
Store openings included the rebuilt Chicago flagship,  
a further store in San Francisco and four openings in Brazil.
Rest of World
Retail accounted for nearly 60% of revenue for Rest of World, 
with 30 stores at the year end (23 in the Middle East  
and seven in India). Although uneven, high single-digit 
comparable store sales growth was achieved in the year,  
led by India.

24% of revenue (2012: 26%); generated from sales  
to department stores, multi-brand specialty accounts,  
65 franchise stores and Travel Retail. 
 · Wholesale revenue increased by 1% underlying  
(down 1% at reported FX).
 · H1: up 5% underlying; H2: down 3% underlying  
as guided.
 · Growth in North America, Asia Travel Retail  
and emerging markets offset by continued planned  
account and product rationalisation.
 · Outerwear and mens outperformed other products.
Asia Pacific
Good growth was achieved during the year in Travel Retail, 
despite weakness in Korea. 
Europe
Europe remains the Group’s largest wholesale region at 
nearly 40% of wholesale revenue. Revenue was impacted 
by weak demand from domestic customers, especially in 
Italy, coupled with continuing planned rationalisation of 
small specialty accounts for brand and credit reasons.
Americas
The Americas is about one-third of Group wholesale 
revenue. Sales to North American department store 
customers again performed strongly, despite the greater 
impact of withdrawing entry price point products in core 
accessories and outerwear than in other regions.  
There was a further expansion of dedicated shop-in-shops  
during the year, reflecting brand segmentation initiatives 
with key customers. 
Rest of World
Wholesale revenue in Rest of World, which is mainly  
to franchise partners, saw good growth. 
At the year end, Burberry had 65 franchise stores,  
a net increase of eight during the year, including  
in Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia. 
Licensing 
5% of revenue (2012: 6%); of which just over 60% is from 
Japan (split roughly 85% apparel and 15% from three 
remaining short-term accessories licences), with the 
balance from global product licences (fragrance, eyewear 
and watches) and European wholesale childrens. 
 · Licensing revenue down 1% on an underlying basis  
(up 1% at reported FX).
 · Consistent with full year guidance.
 · Fragrance and beauty taken in-house from 1 April 2013.
At constant exchange rates, royalty income from Japan  
was down compared to last year. Income from the apparel 
licence, which expires in June 2015, increased slightly, 
reflecting higher minimum payments, offset by the planned 
termination and downsizing of the remaining short-term 
accessories licences in Japan.
Global product licences delivered double-digit percentage 
growth. Product launches included Body Tender fragrance, 
the Aviator and Splash sunglasses collections and  
The Britain watch, starting the realignment of Burberry 
watches with the brand’s luxury positioning. 
Burberry began directly operating fragrance and beauty 
from 1 April 2013. The royalty revenue (£27m in FY 2013) 
from this product category will no longer be received.

Review On 8% revenue growth, retail/wholesale adjusted operating 
profit increased 17% to £335.6m, resulting in a 140 basis 
point improvement in operating margin to 17.8%. This 
included a £12m benefit from a lower performance-related 
pay charge, due in part to the external environment being 
more challenging than budgeted. Without this benefit, 
adjusted operating margin would have been 17.1% compared 
to 16.4% in FY 2012. 
Gross margin increased by 250 basis points, driven by 
modest price increases, FX benefits on sourcing, improved 
inventory management and the mix shift to retail. 
The operating expenses to revenue ratio increased by 110 
basis points, driven in part by the shift to retail. Of the £94m 
increase, over half related to net new space. Spending by 
the largest corporate functions (marketing, IT, product  
and design) was tightly controlled, falling marginally as  
a percentage of sales, funding further investment in areas 
including digital.

Termination of licence relationship (82.9) –
Restructuring credit 0.6 –
China put option liability  
finance credit/(charge) 5.2 (10.2)
(77.1) (10.2)
During the year, £82.9m has been recognised as an 
exceptional item relating to the termination of the  
fragrance and beauty licence relationship. 
 · Of the Euro 181m termination payment, £70.9m has been 
capitalised as an intangible asset and will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to  
31 December 2017. This intangible asset relates to the 
present value of the anticipated incremental income from 
fragrance and beauty which will be earned by the Group 
up to 31 December 2017. The annual amortisation charge 
is expected to be £15m.
 · The remaining £71.3m has been recognised as  
an expense, together with related costs of £2.7m.  
It is anticipated that this value will be recovered through 
increased income from fragrance and beauty beyond  
31 December 2017.
 · Set up costs of £8.9m were incurred during the second 
half of the year as Burberry prepared for the transition  
to direct control. These included marketing, product 
registration and headcount costs.
The restructuring credit of £0.6m relates to the release  
of a provision held in respect of the cost efficiency 
programme announced in January 2009.
The China put option liability finance credit/(charge) relates 
to fair value movements on the put option liability over the 
non-controlling interest in the acquired Chinese business. 
The credit in the full year was £5.2m (2012: £10.2m charge).
Taxation 
In FY 2013, Burberry had a tax charge of £91.5m  
(2012: £100.6m), giving a tax rate on adjusted profit  
of 25.8% (2012: 26.7%). Tax on exceptional items has  
been recognised as appropriate. The resulting effective  
tax rate on reported profit is 26.1% (2012: 27.5%).
The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2014 is currently 
expected to be about 25%.
Net cashflow 
Cash inflow from operations was £523m, an increase of 
£40m over last year. This funded significant investment 
during the year, with capital expenditure of £176m  
(2012: £153m) and £144m to terminate the fragrance  
and beauty licence relationship. Other major outflows  
were dividends (£114m) and tax (£99m). Net cash at  
31 March 2013 was £297m (2012: £338m).
Inventory at 31 March 2013 was £351m. Excluding Beauty 
(£9m), this was a 7% increase year-on-year at constant 
exchange rates, compared to 12% retail sales growth.

Review Outlook 
Retail
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry plans to open  
about 25 mainline stores and close about 15, while opening 
about ten concessions and closing about the same number. 
Openings are biased towards the evolution of the portfolio  
in China and further expansion in Latin America. Following 
two years of above average space growth, net new openings 
are planned to contribute low to mid single-digit percentage 
growth to retail revenue in FY 2014.
Wholesale
Excluding Beauty, Burberry expects underlying wholesale 
revenue to decrease by about 10% in the six months to  
30 September 2013 (2012: £253m). Wholesale customers 
globally planned more conservatively for Autumn/Winter 
2013 and there is a continuing impact from Burberry’s 
strategic rationalisation of wholesale accounts (particularly 
in Europe) and entry price products (particularly in  
North America). 
In addition, and as previously guided, with Burberry directly 
operating Beauty from 1 April 2013, wholesale revenue of 
about £140m and incremental retail/wholesale operating 
profit of around £25m is still expected in FY 2014. This will 
be weighted towards the second half, reflecting the impact 
in the first half of the move from licence to direct operation.
Licensing
In the year to 31 March 2013, licensing revenue, excluding 
£27m royalty income from fragrance and beauty, was £82m.  
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry expects growth from 
this level to be slightly positive at constant exchange rates  
and broadly unchanged at reported exchange rates, with  
the difference in growth rates largely reflecting the impact  
of the Japanese Yen hedge rate. 
In FY 2014, royalty income from Japan is expected  
to be broadly unchanged at constant exchange rates  
year-on-year, with higher minimum payments from the 
apparel licence offset by ongoing rationalisation of the  
three remaining accessories licences. The two global 
product licences (watches and eyewear) are expected  
to deliver double-digit percentage growth.
Retail/wholesale profit
For FY 2014, the aim is to modestly increase on the 
operating margin achieved in FY 2013, which was 17.1% 
without the £12m benefit of a lower performance-related  
pay charge. Reflecting the evolution and phasing of the 
business, adjusted PBT for the six months to 30 September 
2013 is currently expected to be below the level of the prior 
year (£173m):
 · Revenue continues to be weighted to the second half.

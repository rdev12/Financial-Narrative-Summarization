Eland at a Glance
Eland is focused on building and developing a portfolio 
of producing upstream oil and gas assets in West Africa.
In September 2012, the Company 
completed the acquisition of a 45% equity 
stake in OML 40 and listed the Company on 
AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
Since its foundation the Company has 
assembled an experienced Board and 
management team with extensive  
in-country experience and successful track 
records in acquiring and developing oil and 
gas interests. The Eland team has a 
particular focus on development within 
Nigeria and other locations in West Africa.
Eland’s core assets are the OML 40 licence 
and the Ubima field, both onshore Nigeria. 
The Group acquired a 40% participating 
interest in Ubima in August 2014.

(1997) and four wells have been drilled in 
the field between the 1960s and 1981.
 + Hydrocarbons were encountered in all 
four wells in multiple stacked reservoirs. 
OML 40
The OML 40 licence is situated within the
Niger Delta, approximately 75km northwest
of Warri and covers an area of 498km
2
. 
The environment in OML 40 consists of 
shoreline and coastal mangrove swamps. 
The region is lightly populated with 
indigenous groups living in dispersed 
riverine communities mainly from the Ijaw 
and Itsekiri ethnic groups.
Oil production was re-started in February 
2014 from two existing wells in the Opuama
field. Oil is exported via the Shell-operated
Trans Escravos Pipeline network running
from the Opuama field south along the
coastline to the Forcados Oil Terminal.
The OML 40 licence area, of 498km
2
, holds 
gross 1P reserves of 38.7 mmbbls, gross 2P 
reserves of 81.4 mmbbls, gross 2C 
contingent resources of 41.2 mmbbls  
and a best estimate of 254.5 mmbbls of 
gross unrisked prospective resources.*

A Year of Progress
Significant progress has 
been made on our path 
to development in OML 
40 and in exploration 
activity.
2014 saw a sustained chain of achievements 
for Eland. In 2014 Eland established its 
position as an oil producing company with 
revenues of $11.7 million as a direct result of 
the successful development strategies 
executed on the assets. 
The responsible management of our 
finances has allowed us to leverage our 
resources to move from the traditional equity 
funding into a more diversified source of 
investment through debt.
This year has seen the growth of our 
portfolio of assets with the acquisition of 
Ubima which expands our 2C contingent 
resources by 33.9 mmbbls gross (13.6 
mmbbl net).
Elcrest received consent from the Ministry  
of Petroleum Resources for Elcrest’s 
appointment as operator of OML 40. The 
Company now has the opportunity to 
control its operations more efficiently.
First Oil and Operational Consistency
Oil Sales, Revenue and Pioneer Status
Oil production from the Opuama field initially 
re-started in February 2014 through the 
successful recommissioning of existing 
infrastructure and sustained production 
commenced in the autumn of 2014. Average 
production for producing days in 2014 was 
3,338 bopd gross.
 + Rehabilitation work on the flowstation.
 + Repair of the 8” and 10” sections of the 
export pipeline which make up the first 
12km of the export pipeline as well as the 
24km-long final 12” section leading to the 
custody transfer point at Otumara.
 + Re-opening of existing wells Opuama 1 
and Opuama 3 (dual completion).
 + Replacement of the three flowlines of the 
start-up wells. These flowlines were 
trenched and overlaid with protective 
concrete mats at major water crossings.
 + During 2014, Elcrest sold a total of 
115,722 bbls of crude oil for an average 
price of $101 per barrel. 
 + Group revenue was $11.7 million for 2014 
(2013: nil).
 + Elcrest received approval in May 2014 of 
Pioneer Tax status on the OML 40 licence 
under which Elcrest will be exempt from 
paying Petroleum Profits Tax for an initial 
three year term which can be extended 
by a further two years on successful 
application. The incentive results in a 
material rise in the value of the reserves, 
increasing the NPV per net 2P barrel by 
over 75%.
 + In the four months to 30 April 2015, 
Elcrest completed the loading and sale of 
95,290 bbls. Strategic Report

 + During 2014 the Company completed 
the conditions precedent to access 
the $22 million Bridge loan. As of 31 
December 2014, a Reserve Based 
Lending facility of up to $75 million 
was executed with Standard 
Chartered Bank to fund development, 
with $35 million committed initially. 
Post-year end, $10 million has been 
drawn to fund the early stages of this 
year’s work programme.
 + The marketing and syndication of the 
remaining $40 million has begun and 
commitments are expected by the end 
of Q2 2015.
 + Access to the RBL facility will provide 
greater flexibility and optionality with 
regard to the work programme 
allowing the full funding of our current 
plans.
 + 2C resource estimate of 33.9 mmbbl 
gross of oil.*
 + Significant upside 3C resource 
estimate of 66.9 mmbbl gross of oil 
and 97.0 gross Bcf of non-associated 
gas.**
 + As Ubima’s technical and financial 
partner we will be able to lead the 
development of our assets.
 + The proposed export pipeline will be 
tied into an existing pipeline network.
Financing
Ubima Purchase
During 2014, Eland entered the debt stage 
of financing which was a turning point for the 
Company. Against a background of lower 
crude prices where financing is more 
difficult, being able to achieve an RBL 
commitment re-asserts the value of our 
assets.
In August 2014, Eland purchased a 40% 
interest in Ubima. The licence area is 65km
2
, 
located onshore in the northern part of 
Rivers State and has been carved out of 
OML 17, which is operated by Shell 
Petroleum Development Company.
Other Key Events
 + In February and March 2014 Eland 
exercised the full balance of options 
under the Solstice Option Agreement and 
Helios Option Agreement at 100 pence 
per share, resulting in cash proceeds 
during 2014 of $33.3 million.
 + The results of the new CPR as of 30 June 
2014 demonstrate a material increase in 
the value to Eland of the reserves and 
resources of OML 40 as compared with 
the previous report. The new report takes 
into account the Pioneer Tax incentive 
granted in May 2014.
 + During the year we increased our 
technical staff compliment with a view to 
accelerating the development of our 
assets.

Investing in Eland
We are now generating 
cash from OML 40 
which together with the 
Pioneer tax incentive 
granted in 2014 and the 
current and anticipated 
debt facility means we 
expect to be fully 
funded for our current 
plans.
Attractive tax status on OML 40 -  
no Petroleum Profits Tax for an initial 
three year term which can be 
extended by a further two years on 
successful application:
 + Significantly increasing free cash flow 
from OML 40 through development 
drilling.
 + Incentivises further investment and 
accelerated development of OML 40.
 + Creates potential for dividend in short to 
medium term.
 + In combination with a lower cost 
environment means our expected 
average netback per barrel remains 
positive even in the current economic 
outlook of low oil prices.
Increased production phase:
 + Total liftings in 2014 amounted to 115,722 
bbls of crude oil and total liftings for the 
four months to 30 April 2015 amounted 
to 95,290 bbls.
 + During this same period successful 
re-commissioning of existing 
infrastructure lead to 100% uptime of 
facilities and pipeline. However, due to a 
planned maintenance shutdown in 
January of the Trans Escravos Pipeline by 
SPDC, overall average production uptime 
was over 90%.
Ubima acquisition:
 + Net contingent resources increased by 
13.6 mmbbl in 2014.
 + Excellent resource base with significant 
upside potential of 66.9 mmbbl gross 3C 
resources.*
OML 40 – greenfield core asset:
 + Significant, only partly developed, reserve 
base with outstanding upside of 41.2 
mmbbl gross 2C resources and 254.5 
mmbbl gross best estimate prospective 
resources.
Development plan funded through 
own cash flow supported by current 
and anticipated debt facilities with 
no requirement for further 
equity funding:
 + Cash generative asset producing over 
3,000 bopd (net 1,350 bopd).
 + The Group executed an RBL facility of up 
to $75 million in December 2014 with 
Standard Chartered Bank to fund 
development.
 + $35 million has been committed initially 
and the remaining $40 million is expected 
to be syndicated by the end of Q2 2015.
 + Leverage opportunity to develop other 
assets, increase production rates and 
significantly enhance cash flow.

Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present 
Eland’s annual report for 
2014 after what has 
been a volatile year for 
the sector but one in 
which we have made 
significant headway.
Following a near halving of the oil price our 
industry is facing major challenges, but I 
remain confident that we have the assets and 
a management team that can deliver value to 
our shareholders. We have continued to 
make good progress on OML 40 and we look 
forward to development drilling later this year.
The focus over the last year has been to 
stabilise production and this has been 
successfully achieved. In December 2014 
production ‘uptime’ was over 90% which 
compares to 6.2% for the first six months of 
production. In 2015 to the end of April, we 
have recorded 100% ‘uptime’ apart from 
short periods when our off-taker Shell 
carried out maintenance work on their 
connected facilities which has taken the 
average to 91%. This accomplishment has 
been achieved by working more effectively 
with the indigenous operator (NPDC) and the 
local communities. We have also secured 
Pioneer Tax Status for OML 40 giving us a 
100% Petroleum Profits tax concession for 
an initial three years with a further two years 
on successful application. This concession 
gives Eland a great incentive to accelerate 
the production revenue from OML 40 which 
is expected to be achieved through drilling 
later this year. We have commenced a 
workover of the shut-in well Opuama 5 
which we expect to add between 400-600 
bopd (gross) to the field’s production. During 
the year we also farmed in to the Ubima field 
(OML 17) which adds a minimum of 13.6 
mmbbls of net 2C resources to our assets 
which we expect to increase as we add 
finance to the operations. We are presently 
undertaking the technical work on the field 
with the intention of drilling in 2016.
At the end of 2014 Eland completed a  
‘Reserve Based Lending’ (RBL) facility of up 
to $75 million – a significant achievement 
given the oil price environment and a vote of 
confidence from Standard Chartered Bank 
in the Company and its assets. $35 million of 
the facility was committed immediately and 
the balance is expected to be syndicated in 
the coming months. The financial 
performance for 2014 (a loss of $16.3 million) 
reflects operating costs associated with the 
start-up of production but also includes oil 
sales of 115,722 bbls which generated $11.7 
million of revenue. With production 
stabilised, and hopefully growing as new 
wells are drilled, we can expect increased 
sales revenues and lower unit operating 
costs for 2015. At the end of 2014 our cash 
and cash equivalents were $15.0 million with 
undrawn bank facilities comprising a $22 
million Bridge loan facility, which was 
subsequently replaced by the RBL.

Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report

During 2014 the management team was 
strengthened by the appointment of George 
Maxwell as Chief Executive Officer and 
Louis Castro as Chief Financial Officer. I 
agreed to assume the role of Executive 
Chairman for a temporary period while the 
new team settled in. We have also added to 
the technical team with the appointment of 
John Downey as Chief Technical Officer and 
the recruitment of new technical staff all 
based in Aberdeen. I would like to thank our 
former CEO Les Blair for his contribution to 
the development of Eland over the last four 
years. He remains an adviser to the Group in 
a role where his knowledge of Nigeria and 
energy can add most value. I would also like 
to thank all of our stakeholders for their 
support, particularly the management and 
staff for their hard work over the last year.
Nigeria has the largest oil reserves of all 
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa but is 
significantly under-represented by junior oil 
companies like Eland as the entry hurdles 
are perceived to be too large. We have seen 
an increasing number of indigenous 
companies participating in recent years and 
I believe this trend will continue. Nigeria has 
also just elected a new President and we 
expect this to be positive for the upstream 
sector. Eland is well placed to grow in this 
environment with its experienced 
management and a relatively strong financial 
position. Very recently we have had 
confirmation from the Department of 
Petroleum Resources that Elcrest has met 
all of the obligations required in order to be 
appointed as operator of OML 40. We see 
this as a significant step forward which will 
enable us to accelerate the unlocking of 
value in OML 40. Our plan is to drill at least 
two new wells this year and complete two 
workovers all of which should push 2015 
year-end production up to 12,000 bopd 
(gross). We look forward to being able to 
deliver further positive news on the 
development of OML 40 that shareholders 
are awaiting.

Chief Executive Officer’s Report
George Maxwell
Chief Executive Officer
Eland has had a strong 2014, from first oil in 
February, the award of Pioneer Tax status on 
OML 40 in May, acquiring a second Nigerian 
asset, the Ubima field, in August and ending 
the year with over 90% production uptime in 
December. This level of production 
consistency has continued into 2015 with 
near-continuous production from December 
through the end of April, with only planned 
maintenance of seven days on the Shell Trans 
Escravos Pipeline (TEP) resulting in any 
downtime. 
Management Change
During this year we also saw a change in 
management as I moved into the Chief 
Executive role and Les Blair moved aside to 
focus on in-country strategy and key 
interfaces. This was a natural progression as 
the Company moved from an acquisition 
and building phase towards asset 
development. The changing landscape in 
the Nigerian oil & gas sector has seen a rise 
in the number of independents, and more 
recently further divestments by Shell and 
Chevron and we anticipate this process of 
divestitures by the IOC’s to continue in 2015 
and beyond.
Eland remains well placed to take advantage 
of opportunities as they arise and during this 
time we will continue to expand our 
production in country.
Eland, from its formation 
in 2010, has been focused 
on building a portfolio of 
upstream oil and gas 
assets in West Africa, 
particularly in Nigeria. In 
September 2012, we 
completed the acquisition 
of the initial part of that 
portfolio when the Group 
acquired a 45% equity 
interest in OML 40, 
through a special purpose 
vehicle, and listed the 
Company on AIM.
Completion of Rehabilitation Work 
and Commencement of First Oil
In February 2014 we commenced 
production from the Opuama field following 
the completion of flowstation and pipeline 
repairs. Initial production rates of 3,500 
bopd were achieved from two wells 
(Opuama 1 and 3), with crude oil delivered to 
the Forcados terminal and sold through an 
off-take agreement with Shell Western 
Supply and Trading Limited.
We encountered a number of challenges 
relating to the flow station and pipeline 
integrity. These issues caused numerous 
production interruptions from February 
through August and in addition there was  
a significant delay due to the shut down of 
the Forcados terminal in March and April of 
last year.
During 2014 we significantly improved the 
integrity of the pipeline. This contributed to 
the improved level of uptime we have 
experienced over the past 5 months. Strategic Report

Pioneer Tax Status
In May 2014 our local company Elcrest 
Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd 
(“Elcrest”) was awarded Pioneer Tax status 
for OML 40. This will run for an initial three 
year term until May 2017 with an opportunity 
to extend for an additional two years on 
successful application. This provides an 
excellent incentive for investment in our 
asset. OML 40 is an underdeveloped asset 
of 498km
2
, with the Opuama field in 
production and the Gbetiokun field awaiting 
development. In addition from our most 
recent analysis we determine over 75 drilling 
targets within the licence, which we plan to 
exploit over the coming five years. The tax 
incentive allows the re-investment into OML 
40 to accelerate the growth.
Ubima
In August 2014 we acquired a 40% interest 
in the Ubima field, located onshore in the 
Niger Delta, just north of Port Harcourt. The 
agreement allows Eland the opportunity to 
operate the field as technical and finance 
partner to All Grace Energy Ltd (“All Grace”) 
which holds and retains a 60% equity 
interest. The addition of this asset to our 
portfolio was a key development and 
highlighted the benefit of having a strong 
presence in-country. The field currently has 
an estimated 33.9 mmbbls gross contingent 
resources and we have already commenced 
detailed sub-surface work, an environmental 
impact assessment on the development 
plan and land surveys. Further work is 
planned in Q4 of 2015.
Funding our Operations
During 2014 we met all of the conditions 
precedent required to access our $22 million 
bridge loan facility with Standard Chartered 
Bank. The debt remained undrawn until 
expiry in February 2015, and at the end of 
2014 we completed and signed a four and a 
half year Reserve Based Lending facility of 
up to $75 million, again with Standard 
Chartered Bank. $35 million of the facility 
has initially been committed by Standard 
Chartered and a further $40 million is 
expected to be syndicated by the end  
of Q2 2015. 
Work Programme and Budget
The Work Programme and Budget for 2014 
had originally focused on re-commencing 
production followed by an initial drilling 
campaign in Opuama. The inconsistency of 
production delayed access to our debt 
facility, resulting in a delay to the programme. 
During this time we re-evaluated workover 
opportunities. In Q4 of 2014 we reviewed 
three potential workover possibilities, 
Opuama 4, 5 and 7. The conclusion of this 
evaluation resulted in a change to our 2015 
work programme, where we included both 
Opuama 5 and 7 into the programme. These 
two workovers are in addition to the planned 
two new wells (Opuama 8 and 9) due to 
commence in Q3 2015. We are currently 
working on Opuama 5 and expect to have 
the well in production during Q2 of 2015.
The experience gained repairing the 
infrastructure during 2014 has provided 
sufficient detail on the pipeline condition 
enabling us to delay the line replacement. 
This was originally planned for 2015, 
however, given the current infrastructure 
performance we plan only sectional 
replacements of the line, if required. This has 
allowed the Company to direct the majority 
of its capex programme towards revenue-
generating capex, being the two workover 
wells and two new producing wells.
We are currently completing an evaluation of 
available drilling rigs with a view to completing 
this selection in Q2 2015 with a contract award 
for drilling to commence in Q3 2015.
The re-entry of Ubima 1 well is planned for 
late Q4 2015/early Q1 2016, subject to 
securing the rig contract and completion of 
the subsurface studies.
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Social Responsibility
We, in conjunction with our partners, NPDC 
and All Grace, work closely with our host 
communities and consult with them on all 
major aspects of work we undertake. This 
includes carrying out full risk assessments 
and environmental impact surveys and also 
providing the host communities employment 
opportunities through local contracting. 
This has been successful in Opuama, where 
a number of community contracts have 
been awarded which have contributed to the 
successful production from this field in 2014. 
We have a number of community programmes 
planned in 2015 and 2016, including two water 
wells, a civic centre and hospital all within OML 
40. We currently support some communities 
with power through the use of diesel 
generators. In 2016 we plan to convert these 
to gas-fired generators utilising the gas 
produced at Opuama and further reducing the 
volume of gas flared. These key areas of 
medical care, drinking water and power for 
communities remain our key focus areas in 
addition to creating employment opportunities.
Outlook
In recent times the oil and gas industry has 
faced some significant challenges. In Eland 
we are not immune to these. We have 
focused on our cost base, targeting over 
$8 million of opex and G&A savings within 
2015 alone. We have prepared our work 
programme and budget on the basis of a 
$50/bbl Brent oil price, with a sensitivity at 
$40/bbl. We can maintain our full capex 
work programme at the $50/bbl price deck, 
and to date the majority of our crude oil 
sales in 2015 have been well above this 
price. Our industry is well experienced in 
dealing with oil price fluctuations and this 
experience is key to maintaining a plan to 
ensure a positive contribution from every 
barrel produced. We have excellent assets in 
OML 40 and Ubima which provide an 
incredible growth opportunity, even at 
current oil price levels.
Following the recent approval of transfer of 
operatorship to Elcrest by the DPR, we are in 
discussions with our partner NPDC to assume 
the operatorship of OML 40. This process is 
well underway and we fully expect to 
announce the formal transfer of operatorship, 
through the execution of a new operating 
agreement on OML 40, in the near future.
Eland has come a long way since its 
inception in 2010. I am very excited at the 
opportunity to continue this development 
progress in the coming years.

Strategy in Action
OML 40 is a world-class asset with production,  
booked oil reserves, an export pipeline and plentiful 
contingent and prospective resources.
A Portfolio in a Licence
The OML 40 licence currently produces light 
oil with low GOR and has a very strong 
aquifer drive which contribute to high 
ultimate recoveries.
Partnerships
The OML 40 partnership successfully 
re-commenced initial oil production from the 
Opuama field in February 2014 through 
the re-commissioning of the existing 
infrastructure and the re-opening of two 
existing wells and sustained production 
commenced in the autumn of 2014.
Reserves
OML 40’s booked reserves are found in 
Opuama in the western, and Gbetiokun in 
the eastern, part of the licence. Our primary 
contingent resources lie in the Polobo and 
Abiala fields and in addition there are 
numerous prospects and leads across the 
whole of the OML 40 licence.

Gbetiokun
Overview
Gbetiokun is located 63km north-west  
of Warri on the boundary of OML 40 and 
OML 49, which is operated by Chevron. The 
field is known as Gbetiokun in OML 40 
whilst a small extension of the field in OML 
49 is called Bime.
The field was discovered by well Gbetiokun 
1 in 1987 and presently four wells have been 
drilled on the structure.
A total of 20 hydrocarbon reservoirs have 
been identified in the Gbetiokun field. The 
crude is generally characterised as being 
low viscosity, under-saturated, with API 
gravities of about 40°.
PVT samples were taken in the discovery 
well and the results of the PVT analysis have 
indicated the presence of good quality oil. 
The reservoirs are similar to those found in 
Opuama and it is considered very likely that 
they will have moderate to strong
aquifer drive.
Highlights
 + Detailed geological studies, 
supplemented with development studies, 
are being used to prepare a Field 
Development Plan (FDP). The field is 
planned to be produced through an early 
production facility which contains 
equipment needed for oil treatment, 
pumping and gas compression. A 30km 
wet crude export pipeline is planned to 
join the Opuama - Otumara export 
pipeline system.
 + The latest appraisal well, Gbetiokun 2,  
was drilled in August 1991 on the  
western flank of the field where it found  
significant extensions of reservoirs 
discovered by well Gbetiokun 1.
Overview
The Opuama field was discovered in 1972 
and a total of 12 hydrocarbon reservoirs 
have been identified. The reservoirs contain 
light sweet crudes with API gravities ranging 
from 47.5˚ in the shallow reservoirs to 37.8˚ in 
the deep and saturated reservoirs. There 
has been very little pressure depletion over 
the 30+ years of production, which indicates 
a strong aquifer support leading to very high 
ultimate oil recoveries.
The oil production from the Opuama wells is 
received at the Opuama flowstation where it 
is, after initial treatment, pumped via the 
Otumara manifold into the Shell-operated 
Trans Escravos Pipeline network to the 
Forcados Oil Terminal.
Highlights
 + Opuama 1, more than 30 years after first 
production, is still producing over 1,700 
bopd without showing any significant 
production decline.
 + New wells on Opuama are expected to 
deliver high flow rates and high oil 
recoveries through accurate well placing 
as a result of modern 3D seismic imaging 
and modern drilling techniques.
 + Wells 
1
 and 
3
 initial gross production 
totalling over 3,500 bopd gross.
 + Re-entry potential on wells 
5
 & 
7
.
 + Each new well is expected to produce 
4,500 to 5,500 bopd gross.
 + Seven wells are planned, including five 
deviated well with dual completion and 
two horizontal wells with single 
completion.
 + Oil recovery factors of well beyond 50% 
are expected as the highly permeable 
Opuama reservoirs contain very light oil 
sustained by a strong water-drive.
 + Average recovery factor of 40% as 
presently assumed in the NSAI CPR 
creates potentially, in the medium and 
long term, a material upward reserves 
revision opportunity.

Polobo Overview
Abiala Overview
 + The Polobo discovery was made in 1972 
based on 2D seismic.
 + The Polobo discovery well was drilled to 
a depth of 9,712ft. Oil was found over a 
96ft thick interval. RFT tests confirmed 
the presence of under-saturated oil with 
an API gravity of 47°.
 + Following the acquisition of 3D seismic, 
Polobo has been upgraded to an exciting 
contingent resource.
 + Polobo is just 11km north-west of the 
Opuama flowstation and could be quickly 
tied into existing facilities.
 + An appraisal well is planned in the near 
future and, if successful, provides the 
opportunity for an accelerated 
development with production through  
the Opuama flowstation.
 + The Abiala discovery was made in 1989 
and is located in the north-east of OML 40 
near the northern boundary of the licence.
 + Using 3D reprocessed seismic data in 
2009 it became clear that the Abiala 
discovery well had crossed a fault 
between the Abiala North and Abiala 
South blocks, effectively proving up 
further potential in both fault blocks.
 + Total hydrocarbon intervals identified in 
the well are five in Abiala North and 10 in 
Abiala South.
 + Abiala has significant near-field potential 
which will need to be appraised. Future 
development wells will be designed to 
capture all the reservoirs within a 
particular fault block, whilst pilot holes 
will be drilled and plugged back as a 
cheap and efficient way of exploring the 
near-field prospective upside.

There are five more discovered fields in OML 40 apart from Opuama and Gbetiokun, 
the largest being Polobo and Abiala. As these fields and near field upside is further 
appraised and developed they are expected to result in a significant increase in total 
reserves.

Strategy in Action –  
OML 40 Prospective Resources
The new Competent Person’s Report (CPR) as of 
June 2014 provided by Netherland, Sewell & 
Associates Inc. (NSAI) demonstrates a significant 
increase in OML 40’s prospective resources.
Since acquisition the Company has purchased additional off-block well data as well as 
reprocessing 3D seismic on the western flank of the licence block.
The latest CPR takes into account this analysis and as a result the total best estimate gross 
prospective resources show an increase of 113.7% compared to the previous report. 
In the western area of OML 40 the prospects are Amobe, Polobo South and Opuama North. 
In addition, a number of deep turbidite plays have been identified, namely Adagbassa Deep, 
Polobo Deep, Abiala Deep, and Gbetiokun Deep, but these studies are too immature to carry 
prospective resources and require further detailed studies.
Amobe
 + Amobe is one of the largest prospects 
with a gross best estimate of 78.4 
mmbbl and a gross high estimate of 
340.1 mmbbl prospective resources.
 + In the eastern areas of OML 40 there 
are a large number of prospects 
covered by 3D seismic surveys.

Financial Review
Louis Castro
Chief Financial Officer
“At the turn of the year 
the Company executed 
a Reserve Based 
Lending facility of up 
to $75m with Standard 
Chartered Bank in 
spite of difficult market 
conditions and a falling 
oil price.”
Key Strengths
 + Cash generative asset producing over 
3,000 bopd gross (1,350 bopd net) and 
selling at a premium to Brent.
 + Strong banking and off-take relationships.
 + Extensive reserves and resources 
which will produce further capacity to 
fund the future development of the 
Group’s assets.
 + Supportive shareholder base.
Key Financial Highlights
The consolidated loss for the year was $16.3 
million compared with $26.1 million for 2013, 
with consolidated revenue of $11.7 million 
(2013: nil) from the sale of 115,722 barrels of 
crude oil.
The signing of a Reserve Based Lending 
(‘RBL ’) facility with Standard Chartered Bank 
(‘SCB’) with $35 million committed initially, to 
be syndicated to $75 million.
The exercise of options by Eland during the 
year which raised $33.3 million in total from 
two of its major shareholders, Helios Natural 
Resources Limited (‘Helios’) and Solstice 
International Investments Inc. (‘Solstice’).
The granting of pioneer tax status to Elcrest 
in respect of OML 40 on 1 May 2014 under 
which Elcrest will be exempt from paying 
Petroleum Profits Tax for an initial three year 
term which can then be extended by a 
further two years on successful application.
Review of 2014
The consolidated loss for the year was $16.3 
million, with consolidated revenue of $11.7 
million, consolidated operating expenses of 
$18.2 million and consolidated administrative 
expenses of $8.8 million. First oil was 
achieved in early February 2014 through the 
re-opening of two existing wells at Opuama, 
which stabilised at an initial production rate 
of some 3,500 bopd gross (1,575 bopd net) 
and has since declined to 3,000 bopd gross 
(1,350 bopd net), a lower than anticipated 
decline rate. Continued prolonged 
interruptions to production were 
experienced right through until September 
2014 which had the effect of reducing 
potential revenue and increasing operating 
expenses per barrel.
Since September 2014, downtime has 
reduced considerably with a subsequent 
enhancement in performance. In total, the 
Group sold 115,722 barrels of crude oil 
during 2014, and of these, 98,942 barrels 
were produced between September and 
December 2014. Uptime has continued to 
improve post year-end, and in the first four 
months of 2015, the Group has produced 
114,084 barrels in spite of the natural decline 
in bopd noted above.
Operating expenses of $18.2 million were 
recorded after a net adjustment amounting 
to $6.0 million representing the revision by 
management of estimated amounts due to a 
service provider for logistical and general 
support services for which no invoices have 
been received by the Group since 2011 (see 
note 5). Strategic Report
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014
25
During 2014, based on consolidated 
operating expenses of $24.2 million (before 
the net adjustment noted above) and 
production of 113,502 barrels, the 
consolidated opex per barrel amounted to 
$213. However, this was heavily influenced 
by the long interruptions to production, such 
that by the final month of 2014 as 
production uptime improved, consolidated 
opex per barrel was running at $63. 
During 2015, as we deliver on our planned 
well programme and increase production, 
consolidated opex per barrel costs are 
expected to fall sharply to $21 by the final 
quarter and $16 during the final month in 
2015, with further subsequent reductions 
forecast during 2016.
Administrative expenses of $8.8 million 
during 2014 were broadly in line with the 
$8.4 million incurred in 2013. We have 
targeted over $8 million of opex and G&A 
savings within 2015 alone. 
Finance costs amounted to $1.5 million 
during 2014 and related principally to the 
costs of the Bridge loan which was 
extended to the Company by SCB until 
replacement by the RBL.
The Group’s consolidated balance sheet, 
with an overall increase in net assets of 
$18.5 million as at 31 December 2014, 
reflects the commencement of initial 
production and both the investment in the 
forthcoming development of OML 40 and 
the acquisition of a 40% share in Ubima.
Consolidated current assets rose to $19.8 
million from $8.0 million, principally as a 
result of higher cash and cash equivalents 
of $15 million at the year end.
Consolidated current liabilities increased by 
$18.1 million, which comprise principally the 
amounts due on capital and other 
expenditure on OML 40, including 
expenditure on the rehabilitation of the 
Opuama flow station, the costs of dredging 
required ahead of the forthcoming drilling 
programme and fabrication costs of a 
metering system for Opuama crude export.
At the turn of the year the Company 
executed an RBL facility of up to $75 million 
with SCB in spite of difficult market 
conditions and a falling oil price. The RBL 
has a maturity of four and a half years, is 
repayable semi-annually from September 
2016 and has a margin of 7.75% over US$ 
Libor. SCB has committed $35 million of the 
facility and will act as lead arranger for the 
syndication of the remaining $40 million.
Also during 2014, the Company exercised 
the full balance of options with Helios and 
Solstice which yielded $33.3 million. The 
combination of the cash from these options, 
the cash being generated by the Group’s 
existing producing wells and the availability 
of the RBL facility is expected to enable the 
Group to execute the planned work 
programme on its assets.
The Group began the year with consolidated 
cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 million 
and finished the year with $15.0 million 
having raised $33.3 million from the exercise 
of the options mentioned above. The cash 
was invested as to a net $6.0 million in 
operations and $15.9 million on enhancing 
the Group’s assets, including $7.0 million on 
the acquisition of a 40% interest in Ubima, a 
participating interest in a marginal field 
acquired in August 2014, and, $3.9 million for 
the award of pioneer tax status on OML 40 in 
May 2014.
2015 Financial Outlook
The Company has recently drawn down  
its first $10 million from the RBL and will be 
applying it to the commencement of its 
planned work programme for 2015. The 
immediate focus on the finance side will  
be to extend the facility to the full $75 million 
syndicated amount which will, along with 
cash flows from operations, be applied to 
accelerate development of the Opuama  
field and grow the Company’s net 
production to our desired 2015 exit rate  
and beyond.

Key Performance Indicators
The Group has outlined 
below the Key 
Performance Indicators 
which are used to provide 
an understanding of the 
development and 
performance of the 
business.
The Group established an initial with NSAI 
reserves and resources base for OML 40 in 
2013. This position was re-evaluated 
through detailed study and seismic re-
processing during 2014. The results are 
shown in the graphs alongside for both 
reserves and resources and are compared 
to the 2014 position.
These indicators highlight the increase in the 
net reserves and resources base in the
business.
Included within the production section is a
cost control metric over produced volume.
This is measured as operating expenses per
barrel of oil produced. The key target is to
improve the efficiency of production with
lower operating costs per unit.
The key financial metrics for the business
include comparison for Revenue, EBITDA*
and Cash Flow (before Capex).
The tables alongside show the comparison  
between 2013 and 2014 Actual 
performance.

Principal Risk Detail Mitigation
Exploration & 
Appraisal Risk
The Group’s strategy is driven by the acquisition, exploration 
and development of oil and gas assets in Nigeria. There are 
risks inherent in exploration and development of oil & gas 
reserves and resources. Appraisal results of discoveries are 
also uncertain. Exploration, appraisal and development 
activities, involving the drilling of wells within a field, may be 
unpredictable and may not result in the outcome planned, 
targeted or predicted. Only by extensive testing can the 
properties of the entire field be understood.
The Group has a very experienced management team with 
considerable technical experience in Nigeria.
The technical programmes and budgets are the responsibility 
of the Technical & Reserves Committee of the Board and a 
rigorous review process is undertaken by the committee when 
reviewing and approving the work programmes.
Corporate 
Governance &  
Ethical Conduct
The Group operates in West Africa and in Nigeria in particular. 
Nigeria is one of the highest ranking countries in the OECD 
table for risk of bribery and corruption.
The Group has introduced a Code of Conduct manual which 
provides for full compliance and transparency throughout the 
Group’s operations and has obtained membership of the QCA.
Plans are in place to introduce a full programme of compliance 
and training for the UK Bribery Act and the US FCPA.
Environmental Risks Pollution arising from drilling and/or production operations, 
which could result in loss of reputation, financial loss and the 
risk of loss of life due to process or equipment failure.
The Group operates on an industry best practice basis for all 
drilling and production operations. The Group performed a full 
EIA on OML 40 prior to the acquisition and prior to any 
remedial work being undertaken on existing facilities in OML 
40. The Group has developed a system and process to plan 
drilling operations with all contractors and suppliers prior to 
arrival at each well location. 
Health & Safety A significant event could impact the reputation of the 
Group and/or the safety of the Group’s employees and 
contractors. The Group operates in Nigeria which has 
experienced incidents of robbery and kidnap in recent 
years.
The Group performs a full security review and risk assessment 
for each permanent and temporary location in which it 
operates. The Group also fully engages with the host 
communities in which it operates to minimise the risk to 
employees and equipment in these areas. The Group has a 
detailed security plan in place for each site and these plans are 
continually reviewed as the risk levels change. A risk 
management plan is prepared for each project prior to any 
active operations.
Loss of Key 
Employees
Loss of key individuals could cause a delay or have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s plans and operations.
The Group has a competitive compensation package that is 
reflective of market conditions for these key roles and is 
constantly under review as conditions change. The Group 
operates a long-term incentive plan for key employees. The 
Group has also undertaken a succession planning review of 
these key roles.
Oil Price A significant fluctuation in the oil price could have an impact 
on the Group’s plans and expected returns.
The Group is focused on effective working capital 
management to ensure that programmes and plans are 
achieved. These plans are under constant review and will be 
delivered to the extent that sufficient liquidity is maintained 
within the Group.
The Directors are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management activities and internal control processes. As a participant 
in the upstream oil and gas industry, the Group is exposed to a wide range of risks in the conduct of its operations. 
A summary of the Group’s key risks as identified by the management are outlined within this report together with the mitigation plans 
currently employed by the Group. The responsibility for risk review and management remains a function of the full Board.
The process of risk management is continually reviewed by the Board and management and complies with the practice as set out in the 
Quoted Companies Alliance (‘QCA’) guidelines.
This section on Principal Risks and Uncertainties should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting judgments and 
estimates which are set out in note 3 to the Financial Statements.

Principal Risk Detail Mitigation
Community 
Relations
Host communities could cause disruption to operations and 
adversely impact production.
The Group works closely with all host communities to ensure 
that engagement is achieved at all levels. Agreements with 
host communities are in place or under negotiation to ensure 
harmonious working relationships. The Group is also 
committed to a number of community related projects to 
enhance the wellbeing of these host communities.
Production 
Operations
Production operations involve risks common to the industry, 
including oil spills, pipeline disruption, explosions, fires, 
equipment damage or failure and natural disasters. In the 
event that any of these occur, environmental damage, injury 
to persons and loss of life or failure to produce oil could result.
The Group employs an experienced management team with 
a proven track record in managing oil and gas production 
and drilling operations throughout West Africa and in 
particular in Nigeria. Contingency plans are in place to allow 
oil production to continue should there be a prolonged 
disruption to the producers, facilities, pipeline or other 
disruptions impacting oil evacuation.
Failure to obtain 
financing in the 
future could 
materially adversely 
impact the 
performance of the 
Group
The Group’s business necessarily involves significant capital 
expenditure. If the Group is required to invest further capital in 
pursuit of additional opportunities, it may need to seek further 
external debt or future equity financing. There is no guarantee 
that such additional financing, if required, will be available on 
acceptable terms at the relevant time. Furthermore any 
additional debt financing may involve restrictive covenants, 
which may limit or affect the Group’s operating flexibility.
The Group currently has access to sufficient cash resources 
and debt to commence the development of OML 40. Full 
syndication of the existing debt facility is required to fully 
exploit the 2P resources within the planned time frame. 
However, should such debt sources be unavailable to the 
Group, the 2P resources can still be fully developed albeit in a 
much extended time frame. The Group remains focused on 
new opportunities and will review and evaluate these 
opportunities in line with the funding available to pursue these 
ventures at the appropriate time.
Licensing and other 
regulatory 
requirements
The Group’s direct and/or indirect intended future 
operations may be subject to petroleum leases, licences, 
production sharing contracts, regulations and approvals of 
governmental authorities for exploration, development, 
construction, operation, production, marketing, pricing, 
transportation and storage of oil, taxation, and 
environmental and health and safety matters. The Group 
cannot guarantee that such documents applied for will be 
granted or, if granted, will not be subject to potentially 
onerous conditions. Any changes to licences, regulations 
and approvals, or their availability to the Group or its 
associated companies may adversely affect the Group’s 
assets, plans, targets or projections. In particular, in relation 
to the Group’s OML 40 licence, the licence has a current 
expiry date of 2019, which is extendable upon successful 
application.
The Group’s activities and operations are subject to various 
rules, regulations, laws and custom in all countries in which we 
are present. The Group always will remain compliant with 
these rules, laws and regulations when undertaking its 
activities and works to respect local customs in these areas. 
The Group has employed a highly skilled team to manage the 
activities and mitigate any negative impact such changes in 
rules, laws, regulations or customs may have on existing or 
future operations. In particular, in relation to OML 40, in line 
with the licence agreement, the Group has an option to 
request an extension of up to 20 years on the OML 40 licence 
at the current licence expiry date of June 2019, at additional 
cost, provided the terms of OML 40 have been complied with. 
There is precedent for extension of licences in Nigeria and 
management believe it is more likely than not that an extension 
of the licence to 2026 can be obtained.
Increase in drilling 
costs and the 
availability of drilling 
equipment
The oil and gas industry historically has experienced periods 
of rapid cost increases. Increases in the cost of exploration 
and development may affect the Group’s ability to invest and 
to purchase or hire equipment, supplies and services. In 
addition, the availability of drilling rigs and other equipment 
and services is affected by the level and location of drilling 
activity around the world. An increase in drilling operations 
outside the Group’s intended area of operations may reduce 
the availability of equipment and services to the Group and to 
the companies with which it operates. The reduced availability 
of equipment and services may delay the Group’s ability, 
directly or indirectly, to exploit reserves and adversely affect 
the Group’s operations and profitability.
The Group’s management is constantly monitoring the market 
situation with regard to drilling equipment and services. The 
opportunities to exploit existing assets rely upon securing the 
necessary rigs, equipment and services in a timely manner. 
The Group has also initiated a number of remedial action plans 
to provide additional opportunities to secure equipment and 
services if these are not available in the market within a 
reasonable time frame.
Fiscal changes Changes in fiscal terms could adversely impact the Group’s 
operations and profitability.
The Group’s management reviews all proposed changes to 
fiscal terms in the areas in which it operates and actively 
participates in industry forums to promote transparency and 
inward investment in the area of operations.

Corporate Governance Report
The UK Corporate Governance Code
Companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange are required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Eland Oil & Gas PLC’s shares are traded on AIM and as such, the Company is not subject to the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on corporate governance, nor is it required to disclose its specific policies in relation to corporate governance. However, 
as a publicly quoted company, the Company will maintain appropriate standards of corporate governance.
The UK Corporate Governance Code represents the ‘gold standard’. However, the UK Corporate Governance Code was not designed with 
smaller companies in mind. Adherence to the full UK Corporate Governance Code is often impractical for smaller companies. In the past, in 
the absence of an alternative code, many AIM companies have adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code “to the extent applicable”.
In July 2005, the QCA introduced a simple set of guidelines for corporate governance for AIM companies, which were updated in July 2007 
and again in September 2010. According to the QCA, the guidelines have been devised in consultation with a number of significant 
institutional smaller company investors.
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and the Company holds membership of the QCA and complies with 
the QCA guidelines and the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, insofar as is practicable to do so for a company of 
Eland’s current size and stage of development, save in relation to the presentation of an Audit Committee report, performance evaluation 
procedures for the Directors and the Board and in relation to certain of the Directors, who will not be independent because of the grant or 
proposed grant of options to them by the Company.
The Board of Directors operates within the framework described below.
Table of Committees
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, budgets and corporate actions. Board meetings 
are held at least quarterly and at such other times as the Directors deem necessary.
The Directors recognise the value of the UK Corporate Governance Code and take appropriate measures to ensure that the Company 
complies, when practicable and so far as possible given the Company’s size and nature of business, with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code.
The roles of the Chief Executive and Chairman have been segregated and the Company has adopted a senior independent director in 
Robert Lambert. The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee, a Technical and Reserves Committee and a 
Nomination Committee. All committees have formally delegated duties and responsibilities as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Henry Turcan as Chairman, Harry Wilson and Robert Lambert.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Company is 
properly monitored and reported on and for meeting with the auditors and reviewing findings of the audit with the external auditor.
It is authorised to seek any information it properly requires from any employee and may ask questions of any employee. It meets with the 
auditors once a year without any members of management being present and is also responsible for considering and making 
recommendations regarding the identity and remuneration of such auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Russell Harvey as Chairman, Richard Norris and Henry Turcan.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once each year and considers and recommends to the Board the framework for the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors of the Company and senior management.
It further considers and recommends to the Board the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director including bonuses, 
incentive payments and share options or other share awards. In addition, subject to existing contractual obligations, it reviews the structure 
of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and, for each such plan, recommends whether awards are made and, if so, the overall 
amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and the performance targets to be used. No Director is involved in 
decisions concerning his own remuneration. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014
36
Technical and Reserves Committee
The Technical and Reserves Committee consists of Robert Lambert as Chairman, Russell Harvey and Richard Norris.
The Technical and Reserves Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for reviewing the technical performance and plans of 
the Company and to review and approve the annual reserves audit to be performed by a competent technical auditor. The committee is 
responsible for the selection and appointment of the technical auditor for recommendation provided by the Company or independently 
sourced by the committee.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of Harry Wilson as Chairman, Robert Lambert and Russell Harvey.
The Nomination Committee meets at least once each year and considers the selection and re-appointment of Directors. It identifies and 
nominates candidates to all Board vacancies and regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board (including the skills, 
knowledge and experience) and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes.
The Company has adopted a share dealing code (based on the AIM Rules) and the Company takes all proper and reasonable steps to 
ensure compliance by the Directors and relevant employees.
The Board is also responsible for ensuring the Company’s compliance with all applicable anti-corruption legislation, including, but not limited to, the 
UK Bribery Act 2010 and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 . The Company complies and always has complied with all applicable 
anti-corruption laws. In view of the requirement in the UK Bribery Act 2010 for relevant companies to have adequate anti-bribery procedures, the 
Company has devised and implemented a suite of anti-corruption policies and procedures designed to prevent corruption by anyone working on 
its behalf. The Company has adopted a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to corruption and is committed to ethical business practices.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
 + properly select and apply accounting policies;
 + present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 + provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 + make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 + the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 + the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
For the year ended 31 December 2014
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is comprised of Russell Harvey (Chairman), Richard Norris and Henry Turcan. The 
Committee is responsible for determining and making recommendations to the Board on the structure and overall remuneration package for 
Executive Directors and reviews the remuneration for the Company’s senior employees. It is responsible for determining individual 
remuneration packages including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the basis of a proposal prepared by the Committee. No Director 
may participate in any meeting at which discussion or any decision regarding his own remuneration takes place. The Committee also 
administers the Company’s share option and share award schemes. The Committee keeps itself fully informed of all relevant developments 
and best market practice in the field of remuneration.
The Committee is permitted to appoint independent advisers to assist in the determination of the remuneration and does so periodically.
In April 2014 Russell Harvey took over from Harry Wilson as Chairman of the Committee. Louis Castro stood down from the Committee on  
8 September 2014 in light of his appointment to the executive position of Chief Financial Officer. Andrew Bartlett stood down from the 
Committee on 15 September 2015, and Richard Norris was appointed to the Committee on the same date. Harry Wilson stood down from 
the Committee on 1 April 2015 in light of his appointment to the role of Executive Chairman, and Henry Turcan was appointed to the 
Committee on the same date. 
Remuneration Policy
The Committee, in forming its policy on remuneration, has given due consideration to the needs of the Company, the shareholders and the 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The ongoing policy of the Committee is that the overall remuneration 
package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees capable of achieving the Group’s objectives 
and to incentivise them effectively, so as to deliver long-term shareholder value.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward key employees on a basis which is linked, to a significant extent, to the performance of the individual 
and of the Company. Also, the remuneration is subject to the broader principle that their remuneration should be competitive with that 
received by professionals of comparable companies, and to this end a benchmarking exercise was carried out during the course of 2014.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package:
 + Base salary
 + Employee benefits
 + Performance-related cash bonus
 + Performance-related share award
 + Long-term share options
The Group bonus performance measurement for Executive Directors and staff is based upon personal performance, linked to personal 
development plans and Group performance in achieving the key operational targets. The key operational targets relate to production, 
reserves and budget performance. The Group continues to monitor key metrics on share performance versus its peer group companies and 
key indices such as the FTSE AIM Oil & Gas, and FTSE AIM All-Share.
The share option plans also have key performance measurements in place which include achievement of a significant increase in share price 
in addition to a vesting period of between two and three years in order for the options to be exercised.
Base Salary
The policy is to pay a fair and reasonable base salary, taking into account comparable salaries for similar roles in similar companies. The 
base salary is reviewed annually by the Committee having regard to the performance of the Company, individual performance, market data, 
levels of increases applicable to other employees of the Company and economic conditions. A salary and bonus review for staff and 
Executive Directors was undertaken in Q1 2015.
Employee Benefits
Of the Executive Directors, George Maxwell, Louis Castro and Gilles Krijger received car allowances in the period. In 2014, pension 
contributions totalling £67,612 (2013: £24,200) were made in respect of the current year. In 2013 an additional contribution of £49,000 was 
made in relation to 2012 and prior years. Pension plan arrangements for all employees including Executive Directors are set at 11% Company 
contribution of gross base salary. Further details of Directors’ remuneration paid in the year are set out on page 40 and in note 31 of the 
Financial Statements.
The Company provides the Company’s Directors and Officers with third party indemnity insurance. Governance

Employee Share Plan
On 26 June 2012 the Board modified and approved the long-term employee share plan (the ‘Share Plan’), designed to provide incentives to 
employees to act in the long-term best interests of the Group and its shareholders. Performance-related share awards may be granted 
under the Share Plan to the Company’s employees and Executive Directors by the Board, upon recommendation by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Long-Term Share Option Scheme
On 26 June 2012, the Board approved the implementation of share option plans (the ‘Plans’). On the same day, 412,500 options were 
granted under the Plans to the employees and Directors over Ordinary Shares of the Company. On 31 August 2012, the Board approved the 
award of 10,467,263 options under the Plans to the employees and Directors over Ordinary Shares of the Company. Details of the terms of 
the options awarded to Directors and employees under the Plan are set out in Note 29 to the Financial Statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Eland Oil & Gas PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Eland Oil & Gas PLC for the year ended 31 December 2014 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets,  
the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements  
and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. General information
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year.
Eland Oil & Gas PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office 
is given on the back cover. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Company and the Group’s financial statements cover the year to 31 December 2014.
2. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the assets at the date of transaction. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As permitted by section 408 of the Act, the Company has elected not to present its income statement for the year. Eland Oil & Gas PLC 
reported a loss for the year ended 31 December 2014 of $7.2 million (2013: profit of $0.8 million).
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which impact these activities, such as the risk of interruptions to production are 
included within the Chief Executive’s Report and the risk factors described on page 28. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on page 24. Having regard to the matters above, and after 
making reasonable enquiries and taking account of uncertainties and reasonably possible changes in operating performance, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. 
For that reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the accounts.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up 
to 31 December each year. Control exists when an investor has power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of returns. Elcrest Exploration and 
Production Nigeria Limited has been consolidated because it is controlled by the Company. The Company has power to affect the amount 
of returns for the following reasons:
• the Company is entitled to appoint a number of Directors to the Board such that it can control decision making.
• in the event of disagreement amongst the Board of Directors, decisions are reached by shareholder vote and the Company has the 
ability, through the combined effect of a Shareholders Agreement, Loan Agreement and Share Charge, to direct the votes of the 55% 
shareholding that it does not own.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
New IFRS standards and interpretations
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted. Their application has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported or the disclosures in these financial statements, except for extra disclosures in respect of IFRS 12. 
IAS 36 (amendments)   Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
IFRS 10 (amendments)   Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 10 and 12    Consolidated Financial Statements and Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 11 and amendments   Joint Arrangements
IAS 27 (amendments)   Investment Entities
IAS 28 (as revised in 2011), amendments Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS 32     Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
IAS 39 (amendments)   Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union):
IFRS 15      Revenue from contracts with customers 
IFRS 9     Financial Instruments
IFRIC Interpretation 21   Levies

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed. The Group is still assessing the impact of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, but initial indications are 
a disclosure impact only, with no changes expected to the Group’s recognition of revenue.
No new Standards or Interpretations were early adopted by the Group or Company during the year.
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which two or more parties have joint control. The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration, 
development and production through unincorporated joint ventures which it accounts for as joint operations whereby the Group accounts 
for its share of the results, assets and liabilities of these joint operations. The Group accounts for its interests in jointly controlled entities 
using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the venture since the acquisition date.
Revenues
Sales revenue represents the sales value of the Group’s oil liftings in the year. Oil revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have transferred substantially to the buyer and it can be reliably measured, and generally occurs when title has passed  
on bill of lading. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for oil 
and gas products in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Overlift/underlift
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in the Group’s jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not 
receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period. The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and 
cumulative production is underlift or overlift. Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within receivables and payables 
respectively. Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is recognised on an 
entitlement basis. 
Oil and gas assets – exploration and evaluation assets
During the geological and geophysical exploration phase, expenditures are charged against income as incurred. Once the legal right to 
explore has been acquired, expenditures directly associated with exploration and evaluation are capitalised as intangible assets and are 
reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication of impairment and that drilling is still underway or is planned. If no future 
exploration or development activity is planned in the licence area, the exploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are 
written off. Pre-licencing expenditures on oil and gas assets are recognised as an expense within the income statement when incurred.
Oil and gas assets – development and production assets
Once a project is commercially feasible and technically viable, which in practice is when the asset has been approved for development by 
the appropriate regulatory authorities, the carrying values of the associated exploration licence and property acquisition costs and the 
related cost of exploration wells are transferred to development oil and gas properties after an impairment test. Development and production 
assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and 
bringing them into production. The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such 
assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and 
decommissioning.
Other property, plant and equipment
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Fixtures and equipment 10% – 30% per annum 
Motor vehicles  30% per annum
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by reference to the 
ratio of production in the year and the related proved and probable commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development 
expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production. Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are 
dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other 
reserves. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the 
carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the 
future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test 
purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash 
inflows of each field are interdependent.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas 
and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be 
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially viable. There should be at least a 50% statistical 
probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be equal to or more than the amount estimated as proved and probable 
reserves.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to impairment 
subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that 
would have been charged since the impairment.
Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
constitute a business. There have been no such acquisitions to date.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a business, are treated 
as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field interests directly or the transfer of an 
incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the consideration is allocated to the assets and 
liabilities purchased based on relative fair values.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets disposed of 
and any surplus or deficit is recorded as a gain or loss on disposal in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, and where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and is determined on a 
first-in, first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required 
to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount and timing of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount and timing of the receivable can be 
measured reliably.
Decommissioning
A provision for decommissioning the Group’s oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed or acquired.  
The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the 
discount rate to be applied. A corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also 
recognised. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the asset and included in depletion expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are accounted for prospectively by 
recording an adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment. The unwinding of discount on 
the decommissioning provision is classified in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as finance costs. Financial Statements
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014
53
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
To the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash flow hedge of interest 
rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and released to profit or loss when the qualifying 
asset impacts profit or loss. To the extent that fixed rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective fair 
value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reflect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in US 
Dollars, which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The Group’s income, and the majority of its costs, are denominated in US Dollars. The remainder of the costs are denominated in other 
currencies, predominantly Sterling and Nigerian Naira. The Group also has foreign currency denominated liabilities. Exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations therefore arise. The Directors currently believe that foreign currency risk is at an acceptable level.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Taxation
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company or Group has become a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables
Accounts payable are measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
Capital risk management
Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis 
on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 30 to the financial statements. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014

Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recorded on 
an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value includes the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity settled share-based 
transactions are set out in note 29.
The fair value determined at the date of grant of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of the equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects 
the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Pension costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. The Group had no defined benefit 
schemes in place during the years presented.
3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In the application of the Company and the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make 
critical accounting judgments and assumptions. The assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant.
The following are the critical judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Company and the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Exploration and evaluation assets (Note 11)
The accounting for exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, including 
whether exploratory wells have discovered economically recoverable quantities of reserves. Designations are sometimes revised as new 
information becomes available. If an exploratory well encounters hydrocarbons, but further appraisal activity is required in order to conclude 
whether the hydrocarbons are economically recoverable, the well costs remain capitalised as long as sufficient progress is being made in 
assessing the economic and operating viability of the well. Criteria used in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir 
characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected additional development activities, commercial evaluation and regulatory matters. The 
concept of ‘sufficient progress’ is an area of judgement, and it is possible to have exploratory costs remain capitalised for several years while 
additional drilling is performed or the Group seeks government, regulatory or partner approval of development plans.
Impairment indicators (Notes 11, 12)
The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to E&E assets and property, plant and equipment. For E&E assets 
the following are examples of the types of indicators used: 
• The entity’s right to explore in an area has expired or will expire in the near future without renewal;
• No further exploration or evaluation is planned or budgeted;
• The decision to discontinue exploration and evaluation in an area because of the absence of commercial reserves; or
• Sufficient data exists to indicate that the book value will not be fully recovered from future development and production.
For development and producing oil and gas properties, the following are examples of the indicators used:
• A significant and unexpected decline in the asset’s market value or likely future revenue;
• A significant change in the asset’s reserves assessment;
• Significant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environments for the asset; or
• Evidence is available to indicate obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, or that it is underperforming expectations. Financial Statements
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014
55
The assessment of impairment indicators requires the exercise of judgement. If an impairment indicator exists, then the recoverable amounts 
of the cash-generating units and/or individual assets are determined based on the higher of value-in-use and fair values less costs of 
disposal calculations. These require the use of estimates and assumptions, such as future oil and natural gas prices, life of field, discount 
rates, operating costs, future capital requirements, decommissioning costs, exploration potential, reserves and operating performance. 
These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will 
impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets and/or Cash Generating Units (CGUs).
OML 40 licence extension (Note 12)
In line with the licence agreement, the Group has an option to request an extension of up to 20 years on the OML 40 licence at the current 
licence expiry date of June 2019, at additional cost, provided the terms of OML 40 have been complied with. There is a precedent for 
extension of licences in Nigeria and management believe that it is more likely than not that an extension of the licence to 2026 can be 
obtained. Any failure to secure the renewal of the OML 40 licence would have a material adverse impact on the Group’s estimated reserves 
and resources outlined earlier in this report and hence the Group’s ability to generate revenue beyond June 2019. An assumption that the 
licence is not renewed beyond its current expiry date of June 2019 does not however have a material impact on the reported financial results 
for 2014, including the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge and the decommissioning liability recognised in the current year or 
the carrying value of the Group’s interest in OML 40 as at 31 December 2014. 
Ubima acquisition (Note 11)
Management has considered the criteria in IFRS 3 (2008) ‘Business Combinations’ in their assessment of whether the acquisition of its 
interest in the Ubima licence during the year was a business combination or an asset acquisition. The Ubima asset is still in the exploration 
and evaluation stage, with no operations or infrastructure and no proved or probable reserves as at the date of acquisition. On this basis, in 
management’s judgement, the Ubima acquisition constituted an asset acquisition and not a business combination, and accordingly 
management has recognised the consideration paid of $7 million as an addition to the Group’s E&E assets during the year.
Ubima carry arrangement (Note 11)
Under the terms of the Ubima sale and purchase agreement, the Group has agreed to fund capital and operating expenditure in respect of 
both its 40% interest in the Ubima asset and the remaining 60% owned by All Grace Energy Limited. The Group is exposed to substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the Ubima asset until the commencement of production, at which point, the amounts paid on behalf of All Grace 
Energy Limited would start to be recovered from future oil and gas revenue. On this basis, and in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy, the Group has recognised all of its own costs and the costs borne on behalf of All Grace Energy Limited incurred since acquisition of 
the Ubima asset ($1.0 million) as additions to the Group’s E&E assets.
Amounts payable to partners in oil and gas arrangements (Note 16)
In line with the Joint Operating Agreement (‘JOA’), the Group is responsible for its share of expenditures incurred on OML 40 in respect of its 
participating interest, on the basis that the operator’s estimated expenditures are reasonably incurred based on the approved programme 
and budget. Where management disputes such expenditures on the basis that they do not meet these criteria, management accrues at the 
period end for its best estimate of the amounts payable to the operator. The amounts recognised as accruals as at 31 December 2014, 
therefore, reflects management’s best estimate of amounts that have been incurred in accordance with the JOA and that will ultimately be 
paid to settle its obligations in this regard. To the extent additional amounts have been claimed by the operator, such amounts are disclosed 
unless the probability of payment is considered remote.
Contingent liability (Note 32)
The Group’s subsidiary, Wester Ord Oil & Gas (Nigeria) Limited may become, subject to certain conditions (see below), ultimately liable to 
pay a production bonus of $3 million to All Grace Energy Limited in respect of the transfer of a 40% interest in the Ubima Field. The payment 
is contingent on both receiving Nigerian Ministerial Consent to the transfer and attaining production volume of 2,000 barrels gross of crude 
oil per day on average over a thirty day period. Management consider that the asset is still in the exploration and evaluation stage, the Group 
is required to obtain DPR approval for a field development plan (“FDP”) and subsequently, be successful in developing and reaching 
production for the above obligation to arise. These events are not within the control of the Group and further, it is not uncommon in the oil 
and gas industry for these contingent events/milestones not to be achieved on any given E&E project. On this basis management has 
disclosed this amount as a contingent liability. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014

3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have a 
significant risk of carrying a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed 
below.
Carrying value of oil and gas assets (Note 12)
The carrying value of oil and gas assets is subject to judgement over their recoverable value. The calculation of recoverable value requires 
estimates of future cash flows within complex value-in-use models. Key assumptions and estimates in the cash flow models relate to 
commodity prices, discount rates that are adjusted to reflect risk specific to individual assets, commercial reserves and the related cost and 
production profiles.
Management assesses the Group’s oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment at least annually with reference to indicators as defined in 
IAS 36. Note 12 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets. Due to the prevailing low oil prices, management have performed 
a full impairment review of the carrying value of the Group’s interest in OML 40 as at 31 December 2014 assuming a life of field to 2026, an 
oil price profile benchmarked to ICE commodity forward prices at 31 December 2014, management’s best estimates of proved and probable 
reserves and a 10% post-tax discount rate. On this basis, there was no indication of impairment of the carrying value of the Group’s oil and 
gas assets as at 31 December 2014.
Decommissioning provision (Note 19)
The Group has significant obligations to decommission and remove oil and gas facilities from its OML 40 licence at the end of the production 
period currently estimated to be 2026 – see the note on OML 40 licence extension above. Legal and constructive obligations associated with 
the retirement of non-current assets are recognised at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a 
liability, that cost is capitalised as part of the related non-current asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. 
Management apply judgement in deciding on an appropriate inflation rate to estimate costs in the future and also apply judgement in 
selecting a discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability, and in estimating the likelihood that the 
licence will be extended after its initial period, as further described in note 19.
The costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually. A review of all decommissioning cost estimates was undertaken by an independent 
specialist in 2013. This has been reassessed by the same independent specialist in early 2015, at the request of the Directors, and updated for the 
purposes of the 2014 financial statements. Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs is based on current legal and constructive 
requirements, technology and price levels.
It is difficult to estimate the costs of these decommissioning and removal activities, which are based on current regulations and technology, 
considering relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities will be undertaken many years into the future and the removal 
technology and costs are constantly changing. As a result, the initial recognition of the liability and the capitalised cost associated with 
decommissioning and removal obligations, and the subsequent adjustment of these balance sheet items, involve the application of 
significant accounting judgement, further details of which are provided in note 19. 
Commercial reserves
Proved and probable reserves are estimates of the amount of oil and gas that can be economically extracted from the Group’s oil and gas 
assets. The Group estimates its reserves using standard recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed annually.
Proved and probable reserves are determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors and future commodity prices, the 
latter having an impact on the total amount of recoverable reserves. Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of 
development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers. 
Reserves estimates are inherently uncertain, especially in the early stages of a field’s life, and are routinely revised over the producing lives of 
oil and gas fields as new information becomes available and as economic conditions evolve. Such revisions may impact the Group’s future 
financial position and results, in particular, in relation to D,D&A and impairment testing of oil and gas property, plant and equipment. Financial Statements

*  Includes costs of $1,050,000 (2013: $839,000) relating to Non-Executive Directors’ fees and other temporary employment costs not included in note 7 below.
**  Reversal of accruals relates to the revision of estimated accrued amounts under an agreement with a service provider for logistical and general support services for which no 
invoices have been received by the Group since 2011. Furthermore, under the agreement any invoices which might be received would need to be approved by the Group at its 
sole discretion before payment. Having reviewed the services provided to date, management believe that the value of the services provided is much less than the figure 
previously accrued and that a provision of $2.25 million from inception of the agreement in 2011 to 31 December 2014, would be sufficient to cover the cost of services provided. 
Accordingly, the accrual of $8.25 million recognised in trade and other payables at 31 December 2013 has been reversed and a provision of $2.25 million (see note 17) has been 
made as at 31 December 2014.

Pioneer tax relief
When granted, Pioneer tax relief provides relief from Petroleum Profits tax for an initial period of three years and can be extended on an 
annual basis, at the agreement of the tax authorities, for an additional two years. Net aggregate tax losses arising in the pioneer relief period 
are available for carry forward to offset taxable profits arising in future periods, whilst losses generated prior to commencement of 
production and Pioneer tax status must be utilised to offset taxable profits generated prior to claiming the benefit of Pioneer tax relief. 
Management has made a judgement in relation to the Pioneer tax relief period in that they are confident the Group will be successful in 
obtaining the two annual extensions to the Pioneer tax relief period when the initial 3 year period expires in May 2017. However, this does not 
impact the 2014 results including in particular management’s decision to not recognise deferred tax on losses as at 31 December 2014 as 
forecasts supporting future profitability indicate that the asset will be utilised within three years i.e. by 31 December 2017. On expiry of 
Pioneer tax status, Elcrest is expected to be paying tax at 65.75% for five years and at 85% thereafter.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of $784,000 as at 31 December 2014 in relation to the temporary difference that arises 
between the net book value and the tax written down value of the oil and gas assets. Capital allowances can be deferred during the Pioneer 
tax relief period and will be available following the tax relief period, whilst the book value of the asset is depreciated following 
commencement of production.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group has taxable losses of $130 million (2013: $77 million) for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits against which the asset will be offset. In particular, Elcrest Exploration 
and Production Nigeria Limited, which accounts for the majority of these tax losses ($119 million), was granted Pioneer tax status on OML 40 
during 2014. The company benefits from a three year tax relief period, with two further one year extension periods available on successful 
application. During the Pioneer tax relief period accumulated tax losses are required to be offset against taxable profits prior to applying the 
benefit of the tax relief period. The Group expects that the available tax losses will be fully utilised during the relief period and therefore no 
deferred tax asset has been recognised on the taxable losses.

The Group’s oil and gas exploration and evaluation assets at 31 December 2014 relate to the Group’s interest in the Ubima marginal field 
in Nigeria.
In August 2014, the Group’s subsidiary Wester Ord Oil & Gas (Nigeria) Limited (‘Wester Ord’) acquired a 40% participating interest in the 
Ubima field from All Grace Energy Limited (“All Grace”). Wester Ord paid a signature bonus of $7 million at completion and, contingent on 
both gross production of 2,000 bopd over thirty days and receipt of Nigerian Ministerial Consent to the transfer, a production bonus of $3 
million will become payable. This amount has not been provided in the financial statements as at 31 December 2014. It has been disclosed 
as a contingent liability (note 32). 
The Group has considered the definitions set out in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, and has concluded that a business has not been 
acquired and has accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition as set out in the significant accounting policies on page 52.
Wester Ord has agreed to fund 100% of the initial work programme and will be entitled to 88% of production cash flow until the partner costs 
have been recovered. This carried interest arrangement represents, in substance, a disposal of exploration risks and rewards by All Grace.
The additions of $7.95 million recognised by the Group during the period from acquisition to 31 December 2014, therefore includes both the 
carried interest, amounting to $0.6 million, and the Group’s own costs.
The other intangible asset relates to the approval fee paid on grant of Pioneer tax status during 2014 (note 9). The cost is being amortised on 
a straight line basis over the maximum expected tax relief period of three years with two further annual periods of extension (note 3), and the 
charge for the year has been included within operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: nil).  Financial Statements

The Group’s oil and gas development and production assets at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 relate to the Group’s interest in 
OML 40 in Nigeria. An amount of $6.3 million (2013: $174.7 million) was classified as under development in relation to this asset as at the year 
end.
Production substantially commenced from the Group’s interest in OML 40 in July 2014 and accordingly the Group has recognised a depletion,

The RBL facility of up to $75 million with Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), which Westport (the Group’s finance vehicle) entered into on 31 
December 2014 is available to the Group to fund, amongst other things, capital expenditure obligations in respect of Elcrest’s participating 
interest in OML 40 and for the Group’s working capital purposes up to $5 million. The facility has a maturity of four and a half years from 31 
December 2014 and is repayable semi-annually from September 2016. 
 
The Facility, to which SCB has committed an initial $35 million, is a secured revolving loan facility and SCB has been mandated to syndicate 
a further $40 million to take the total of the facility to $75 million in 2015. Interest is payable on amounts outstanding on a quarterly basis at a 
rate equivalent to USD Libor plus a margin of 7.75%.
The facility is secured over the Company’s shares in Elcrest, and by way of a debenture which creates a charge over certain assets of the 
Group, including its bank accounts.
The size of the facility is subject to a cap determined by the borrowing base of OML 40 and the cap, which is currently $75 million, is 
re-determined every six months.
The facility has a maturity of four and a half years from 31 December 2014 repayable semi-annually from September 2016.

At 31 December 12,306 11,978
The provision for decommissioning is in respect of the Group’s interest in OML 40. The provision represents the present value of amounts 
that are expected to be incurred in 2026, discounted to the present value using a 2.75% discount rate (2013: 2.75%).
A corresponding amount equivalent to the initial provision is recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment. The 
amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in 
accordance with local conditions and requirements, reflecting management’s best estimates.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included in the Income Statement as a finance cost.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment 
to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
During 2013, an independent specialist evaluated the decommissioning costs for the licence and the study led to the adjustment of the 
amounts previously provided for. The effect of this change along with revisions to the assumed inflation and discount rates, is reflected in the 
2013 comparative in the above table. The same independent specialist carried out a further validation in early 2015 of the assumptions and 
data contained within the 2013 report and confirmed there was no material change to the position. Management believes the estimates 
continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning.
Prior to 2013, it was assumed that costs would be incurred at the expiry of the licence in 2019. In line with the licence agreement, the Group 
has an option to request an extension of up to 20 years on the OML 40 licence at the current licence expiry date of June 2019, at additional 
cost, provided the terms of OML 40 have been complied with. There is precedent for extension of licences in Nigeria and management 
believe it is more likely than not that an extension can be obtained. The date the costs are expected to be incurred has therefore been 
retained as 2026. Financial Statements

Prior to 1 January 2013 exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Company from its functional currency 
(British pounds sterling) to the Group’s presentation currency, US Dollars, were recognised directly in the translation reserve. From 
1 January 2013 the Company’s functional currency changed to US Dollars. As a result there is no movement on the reserve in the current 
year or the prior year.

The Directors believe that the Group has only one reportable operating and geographic segment, which is the exploration and production of 
oil and gas reserves in Nigeria. All operations are classified as continuing. The Board monitors the operating results of its operating segment 
for the purpose of making decisions and performance assessment. Segmental performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss 
and is reviewed consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.  Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report

29. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates an employee share option plan. Initially, share options were granted on 3 December 2012 to all Directors and key 
personnel of the Group comprising of 2,669,763 Founder options exercisable at £1.00 each, 8,210,000 share options exercisable at £1.00 
each and 368,500 share options exercisable at £1.13 each. During 2014, 65,000 share options at £1.25 each and 1,250,000 share options at 
£1.16 each were granted to employees. The options will be exercisable in full if the average closing price per share over any continuous thirty 
(30) day period, ignoring any days which are non-dealing days for AIM, occurring wholly during the period of 10 years from the date of grant, 
is equal to or greater than one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the Placing Price. Management has determined a 70% probability of this 
condition being satisfied. All of the share options have a vesting period of three years from the date of grant except for Founder Options 
which have a vesting period of two years. The £1.00 Founder options are exercisable for a period of eight years (less one day) from the 
second anniversary of the date of grant. The other options are exercisable for a period of seven years (less one day) from the third 
anniversary of the date of grant. If the options remain unexercised after the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant the 
options expire. Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

Outstanding at the end of the year 12,563,263 1.02 11,248,263 1.00
Exercisable at the end of the year – – – –
The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 have a weighted average exercise price of £1.02, and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of seven years and eight months. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted in 2014 was £245,000. 
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model in respect of the options granted during 2014 were as follows:
Year-end closing share price 71p
Weighted-average exercise price 115.5p
Expected volatility 25%
Expected life 3 years
Risk-free rate 2.5%
Dividend yield nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price from the date of admission to AIM to 
the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $1,508,000 (2013: $1,456,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2014. Financial Statements

30. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to 
shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2013.
The capital structure of the Group does not include any debt as at 31 December 2014. Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 
comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 20 to 24.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables
• Trade and other payables
• Cash and bank balances
• Bank loans
Categories of financial instruments
At 31 December 2014, the Group and Company held the following financial assets:

15,463 60,221 5,837 45,647
Of the cash balances of $15.0 million (2013: $3.8 million), $11.3 million (2013: $1.1 million) was denominated in US Dollars and $3.7 million 
(2013: $2.7 million) was denominated in Sterling. Naira denominated balances were immaterial.
Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks. Cash balances are held with banks with an ‘A’ rating or better 
where possible. There is believed to be insignificant credit risk associated with trade, other debtors and prepayments.
At 31 December 2014, the Group and Company held the following financial liabilities at amortised cost:

Market risk
The Group’s and Company’s activities expose them primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There has 
been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the manner in which these risks are measured and managed.
Foreign currency risk management
With effect from 1 January 2013, the functional currency of the Company changed from Sterling to US Dollars. The functional currency of the 
Group is now US Dollars. The change was triggered by the increasing influence of the US Dollar on its operations as its borrowing facilities 
and income are borrowings denominated in US Dollars.
The Group’s income, borrowings, and the majority of its costs, are denominated in US Dollars. The remainder of the costs are denominated 
in other currencies, predominantly Sterling and Nigerian Naira. The Group also has foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. 
Exposures to exchange rate fluctuations therefore arise. The Directors currently believe that foreign currency risk is at an acceptable level. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2014

30. Financial instruments continued
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Although the Group reports in US Dollars, elements of its business are conducted in Sterling and Nigerian Naira. The current exposure to 
foreign currency risk is manageable due to the predictability of transactions in these currencies.
If the US Dollar had strengthened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, the post tax loss for the year would have 
been $0.7 million lower mainly as a result of differences of translation of Sterling denominated expenditure at lower rates of exchange.
If the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, the post tax loss for the year would have been 
$0.8 million higher mainly as a result of translating Sterling denominated expenditure at higher rates of exchange.
If the US Dollar had strengthened by 10% against Naira, with all other variables held constant, the post tax loss for the year would have been 
$0.4 million lower mainly as a result of translating Naira denominated expenditure at higher rates of exchange.
If the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Naira, with all other variables held constant, the post tax loss for the year would have been 
$0.3 million higher as a result of translating Naira denominated expenditure at lower rates of exchange.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. In order to mitigate this risk, management regularly reviews 
liabilities to ensure these can be met as and when they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and reserve borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash flows. Details of undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduced liquidity risk are set out in note 18.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values, unless otherwise 
stated.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
All of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities and financial assets as at 31 December 2014 are either payable or receivable within one 
year. On this basis no maturity analysis has been disclosed.
Financial facilities
Loan Facility
The Group has loan facilities with Standard Chartered Bank. Details are given in note 18.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group utilises the RBL facility it will become exposed to potential adverse movements in the US Dollar Libor component of the rate.

32. Contingent liability – Ubima production bonus
The Group’s subsidiary, Wester Ord Oil & Gas (Nigeria) Limited may become liable to pay a production bonus of $3,000,000 to All Grace 
Energy Limited in respect of the transfer of a 40% interest in the Ubima Field. The payment is contingent on both receiving Ministerial 
Consent to the transfer and attaining production volume of 2,000 barrels gross of crude oil per day on average over a thirty day period. No 
provision has been made in these financial statements as management do not consider that the payment is probable at this stage. See note 
11 for further details of the Ubima acquisition.
 
33. Post-balance sheet events 
Availability and utilisation of $35m reserve based lending (RBL) facility
In April 2015, all of the conditions precedent to the RBL facility were deemed satisfied and accordingly, the initial $35m facility became 
immediately available to the Group. Westport Oil Ltd has subsequently drawn down $10m from the facility, on the terms outlined in note 18.
Operatorship of OML 40
The Group announced on 11 May 2015 that Elcrest had received confirmation from the Department of Petroleum Resources (“DPR”) that 
Elcrest had fulfilled its obligations, including the payment of the requisite premium and fees of $2.3 million to the DPR, in relation to Elcrest’s 
appointment as operator of OML 40 for a minimum 10 year period. The Joint Operating Agreement is under review by all parties with signing 
expected in the near future.

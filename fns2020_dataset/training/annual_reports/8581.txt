Strategic Report 
The Strategic Report explains in detail how we have performed this year and sets out a fair review of the business, a balanced and comprehensive analysis of our performance, the 
use of key performance indicators to explain the progress we have made, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company, and an indication of potential 
future developments.  
The Strategic Report is prepared in line with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the Company has had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in its Exposure Draft: Guidance on the Strategic Report. It is intended to provide shareholders with a better understanding of the Company, of its position in the markets 
within which it operates, and of its prospects.  
In setting out the Company’s main risks and uncertainties, an indication of potential future developments, and in other content, this report and accounts contains statements that 
are based on knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of the Strategic Report, and what are believed to be reasonable judgements, and therefore cannot be

the largest commercial family of channels in the UK. In 
addition to traditional broadcasting on our channels, 
we deliver our content on demand through numerous 
platforms, both directly and via ITV Player. Through ITV 
Studios we produce content for both our own channels 
and third parties in the UK and increasingly overseas. 
Our distribution business sells finished programmes and 
formats worldwide.

Broadcast & Online
ITV broadcasts a wide variety of content on its family of 
free to air (FTA) channels consisting of ITV, the largest 
commercial television channel in the UK, and the digital 
channels, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. In 2014 we will launch 
ITVBe, our new FTA lifestyle and reality channel. The 
family of channels attracted a total share of viewing of 
23. 1% in 2013, the largest audience of any UK commercial 
broadcaster. Programming is primarily funded by 
television advertising revenues. ITV has the largest share 
of our estimate of the UK television advertising market at 
45.4% in 2013. 
In addition to linear broadcast, ITV delivers its content 
across multiple platforms. This is either through ITV 
Player , available on ITV’s website, itv.com, and platforms 
such as Virgin and Sky, or through direct content deals 
with services such as Lovefilm and Netflix. ITV’s content  
is now available on 19 platforms and in 2014 we will 
launch our new pay channel, ITV Encore, on Sky. 
ITV Studios
ITV Studios is the Group’s international content 
business. It is the largest production company in the 
UK and produces programming for ITV’s own channels 
and for other broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4 
and Sky. ITV Studios also operates in five international 
locations, the US, Australia, Germany, France and the 
Nordics, producing content for local broadcasters in 
these regions. This content is either locally created IP 
or created elsewhere by ITV, mainly the UK. We have 
made a number of acquisitions in the UK, US and the 
Nordics as we look to build our international business. 
Global Entertainment, ITV’s distribution business, 
licenses ITV’s finished programmes and formats and 
third party content internationally.

Business Model
How ITV generates value
As an integrated producer broadcaster , we have a unique opportunity to deliver value from our investment in quality 
content. Our investment in our programme budget for our broadcast channels delivers unrivalled audiences that drive 
our advertising revenues. Our channels also provide a shop window for our own content to make it famous before 
selling it internationally.  
By creating and owning content we can grow new revenue streams by exploiting that content across multiple 
platforms, both free and pay. Investment in our creative pipeline and in selective acquisitions is building our 
international content business as we sell our programmes and formats internationally as the demand for proven 
content continues to grow.

The media environment in which ITV operates, both as 
broadcaster and producer , continues to be dynamic. We 
must ensure that we adapt as the market changes as 
it presents great opportunities for ITV as an integrated 
producer broadcaster. 
Broadcast & Online
Over recent years the number of ways to watch TV has 
greatly increased. Viewers are now able to choose between 
a variety of traditional platforms, both free and pay. On 
demand viewing allows people to watch content away from 
traditional television with programmes delivered over the 
top to devices including mobiles, tablets and connected 
TVs. Linear viewing via the TV set is still dominant with on 
demand a relatively small part of overall viewing, but it is 
growing fast: we cannot be complacent and must ensure 
that our online offering is strong to compete in this market.
Traditional television viewing
ITV competes for viewers with the BBC and other commercial 
broadcasters, including the Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky 
families of channels. The process of digital switchover in the UK 
completed in 2012, increasing the number of channels available 
to all viewers from the traditional five terrestrial channels to a 
choice of hundreds. The erosion of audience share experienced 
by the terrestrial broadcasters during this transition has now 
levelled. Relatively little has changed in terms of viewing 
behaviour . In the last five years the public service broadcaster 
(PSB) families have only lost 1.2 share points. BBC One and ITV 
continue to be the only channels consistently able to deliver 
peak audiences of more than five million, and the PSB families 
receive around 72% share of viewing (SOV). ITV Family SOV in 
2013 was 23. 1%, second only to the BBC’s family of channels at 
32.2%. SOV for the Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky families was 
significantly smaller at 11.0%, 6.0% and 8.0% respectively .
Total television viewing has been largely stable over the 
past decade with average viewing of 232 minutes in 2013 
compared to 224 minutes in 2003. Total viewing saw a 
decline of 4% in 2013 due to the lack of a large one-off 
sporting event and the good weather over the summer . 
Viewing of commercial channels was only down 1% to 153 
minutes per day.
Platforms
The platforms on which viewers watch television is 
important to ITV as for linear viewing our SOV is higher in 
free to air homes. The current platform mix is around 48% 
free to air (Freeview and Freesat) and 52% Pay (including Sky, 
Virgin and BT). We continue to support free platforms with 
developments such as YouView, which is estimated to have 
distributed over 900,000 boxes by the end of 2013.

Video on demand and catch up
Video on demand (VOD) viewing of lawful long form content 
is growing rapidly but remained around 3% of all viewing in 
2013. Growth is being driven by viewing on mobiles, tablets 
and the television set, while PC viewing is declining (Source: 
Internal estimates, 3Reasons). 
The number of homes with Personal Video Recorders (PVRs) 
has increased to around 63%, with PVR catch up viewing of 
around 12% (2012: 10%). The line between catch up and VOD 
is becoming more blurred with the growth of connected 
devices as viewers no longer need to record programmes. 
ITV continues to improve the quality and distribution of ITV 
Player to take advantage of this growing demand. 
Advertising revenues
ITV generates revenues from advertising through traditional 
broadcast and also increasingly online. ITV competes with 
the commercial broadcasters and other advertising mediums, 
such as the internet and print, for its advertising revenues. 
Over the last five years TV has broadly maintained its share 
of total advertising spend at around 28% whilst the internet, 
which is growing rapidly , continues to take share from press. 
ITV’s share of the television advertising net revenues (SOB) 
was 45.4% in 2013, slightly behind 2012 (45.8%). However , it 
is getting increasingly difficult to measure the market as all 
broadcasters have differing definitions and therefore include 
sources of revenue other than pure spot advertising.

Subscription and Pay revenue
ITV also earns revenues from pay TV, both directly from 
the viewer and through licensing its channels and content. 
The total UK pay TV market has been growing moderately 
and was estimated to be £6.1 billion in 2012 (Source: 
Screen Digest). Much of this goes to platform owners such 
as Sky and Virgin as subscriptions from the viewer , with 
the remainder being paid by platform owners to content 
owners, such as ITV, and rights holders.
A big growth area in pay TV is now subscription VOD, where 
viewers have unlimited access to content for a period of 
time. 2012 was the first year that VOD subscription took off 
in the UK, and the two main services, Netflix and Lovefilm 
which offer ITV content, are growing fast. 
ITV Studios and the Global content market
Over the last few years the proliferation of entertainment 
platforms and the increasingly competitive nature of the 
broadcasting industry has created strong demand for quality 
proven content and formats that travel internationally. 
This is because broadcasters and platform owners want 
to increase the certainty of their audiences, either mass or 
targeted, around which to sell their advertising. This provides 
great opportunities for ITV as a leading content creator and 
producer. 
ITV Studios production regions
ITV Studios is the largest commercial production company 
in the UK, and the third largest European producer after 
Fremantle and Endemol, producing over 3,500 hours of 
content per year for ITV and other broadcasters in the 
UK. ITV Studios also produces programming for local 
broadcasters in five international locations: the US (the 
largest international base), Australia, Germany, France 
and the Nordics. Global Entertainment, ITV’s distribution 
business, sells finished programmes and formats around the 
world and is one of the top three European distributors of 
television content.
The global content market
The global content market is estimated to be worth around 
$50 billion. Approximately 29% of this ($15 billion) is 
accounted for by the US, 8% by the UK ($4 billion), and the 
remaining 63% by the rest of the world.
Entertainment and factual entertainment formats such as 
Come Dine With Me, Hell’s Kitchen and I’m A Celebrity Get 
Me Out Of Here! are a significant part of global content sales. 
We are also seeing a resurgence of drama and comedy, and 
a rise in reality programming, for example Duck Dynasty and 
Real Housewives.
The UK and US drive global creativity in TV formats and 
finished tape sales. The UK is the world leader for the 
volume of exported formats, ahead of other top exporters 
the US, Holland and the Nordics, and second only to the US in 
catalogue sales.
In the UK and internationally ITV competes with a large 
number of independent producers, including ‘super-indies’ 
such as Fremantle and Endemol. The independent producers 
are largely privately owned, and do not have the advantage 
of being an integrated producer broadcaster. 
The US is the largest creative market in the world and while 
dominated by vertically integrated conglomerates, there is 
a thriving independent market valued at about $3.5 billion 
in which ITV competes. ITV Studios is now one of the five 
largest independent producers in the US.

Chairman’s Statement
Archie Norman
Dear Shareholder
ITV today is a much stronger business in almost every 
respect than when the restructured Board and leadership 
team were formed four years ago. When we set out our 
transformation programme in 2010 the core objective was 
to rebalance the business, to open up new growth paths, and 
to ensure it is more resilient in a changing media landscape. 
Whilst there is much further to go, this programme is well 
under way with strong growth in all sources of non-net 
advertising revenue. 
After years of underperformance, our content business is 
now delivering consistent growth under strong creative 
leadership. Selected international acquisitions have 
accelerated progress, particularly in the USA, to form the 
basis for a global content network. Meanwhile, online, pay 
and sponsorships have all shown strong and profitable 
growth. This has been achieved against the backdrop of 
difficult economic conditions and subdued consumer 
markets.
As a result ITV today is in unrecognisably better health, with 
strong leadership and a good talent base at all levels. This 
does not of course mean we can afford to let the pace of 
change diminish. While the traditional broadcast television 
model remains robust, the market for ‘television-like’ 
content is changing faster than ever with new forms
of viewing emerging, more catch up, more consumption on 
connected and mobile devices and indeed new entrants 
competing for share of the viewers’ time. Therefore we 
must continue to adapt ITV to take advantage of these 
opportunities.
We see great opportunities ahead as we build on the 
creative capability of ITV internationally. However, these 
will also pose challenges to the way we work internally and 
externally. And as we extend our reach it remains vital to 
sustain the health of our growing channel family in the UK 
and especially of our flagship channel ITV.
Our ability to tackle these challenges with confidence is 
reinforced by the transformation of our financial position 
which has been the result of tight cash management, 
debt restructuring and cost control: we now have a robust 
balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. The Board 
is very mindful of the need to balance the investment 
requirements of the business to deliver future growth with 
increasing shareholder returns. The Board has proposed a 
35% increase in the ordinary dividend to 3.5p and a 4.0p 
special dividend in line with last year.
ITV remains a regulated business and as the media 
landscape changes we continue to see the need for the 
relaxation of regulatory constraints as non-regulated 
forms of competition grow. However , we are pleased that 
our public service licences have now finally been renewed 
providing a stable platform for another ten years.
“We are a talent driven, people 
intensive business. Our 
progress has been driven by 
the leadership, creativity and 
motivation of our people”

Our philosophy of management has been to combine very 
strong commercial and management leadership with great 
creative talent. This approach is also reflected at Board 
level where we seek to retain a mix of deep commercial 
and creative understanding around the Board table. I am 
delighted therefore that Sir Peter Bazalgette has joined our 
Board this year . Mike Clasper , who made a huge contribution 
to the Board in good times and bad over the last eight years 
has stood down with our thanks.
Finally, we are a talent driven, people intensive business. 
Our progress has been driven by the leadership, creativity 
and motivation of our people. And I want to thank all our 
colleagues at ITV for their hard work, and our shareholders 
for their continuing support.

2013 was another strong year for ITV, both operationally 
and financially, as we continue to make progress with our 
strategy of growing and rebalancing the business. External 
revenues were up 9%, with non-NAR revenues up £175 
million (17%), and for the fourth year in a row we delivered 
double digit profit growth. 
2013’s performance builds on the consistently strong 
results we have delivered since we announced our strategy. 
Since 2009 we have increased Group external revenues 
by 27%, EBITA before exceptional items (EBITA) by 207%, 
adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 522% and improved 
our cash position by over £750 million, even after returns to 
shareholders and investment in the business. 
Our Broadcast business remains in good shape. In 2013 we 
had the best year-on-year viewing performance for ten years 
with ITV Family SOV up 4%, and the television advertising 
market returned to growth. Online, Pay & Interactive 
revenues continue to grow strongly and are now a material 
part of the business. ITV Studios, which again delivered 
significant revenue growth, is becoming an increasingly 
international business as it grows both organically and 
through selective acquisitions.
Our vision remains to create world-class content, which 
we can make famous on our channels, before exploiting its 
value across multiple platforms, both free and pay, in the UK 
and internationally. While there is still much to do and good 
potential for growth, the progress we are making is clearly 
evident in our results.

2013 operating and financial performance
ITV’s financial results reflect a good performance across the 
business. ITV NAR grew 2% and, in line with our strategy, non-
NAR revenues grew £175 million or 17% to £1,211 million. 
Good revenue growth, together with our tight cost control, 
has led to 21% growth in EBITA before exceptional items 
(EBITA) to £620 million, 27% growth in adjusted profit before 
tax (PBT) to £581 million and 23% growth in adjusted EPS 
to 11.2p. Group margins have improved by three percentage 
points to 26% and we delivered £28 million of cost savings, 
£8 million ahead of our original target.
Broadcast & Online revenues grew by 3% to £1,896 million 
(2012: £1,834 million) and EBITA increased by 20% to £487 
million (2012: £406 million). This was driven by 2% growth in 
ITV Family NAR and 16% growth in Online, Pay & Interactive 
as we have increased the quality and distribution of ITV 
Player and further developed our pay opportunities. 
On-screen we have had a very strong year with ITV share 
of viewing (SOV) up 3% and ITV Family SOV up 4% as we 
have continued to increase the quality and variety of the 
schedule. 
ITV Studios delivered 20% growth in total revenue to £857 
million (2012: £712 million) and 24% growth in EBITA to 
£133 million (2012: £107 million). This was driven by the 
international studios business, with growth coming both 
organically and from the acquisitions we have made in the 
UK and internationally. 
Our continued focus on cash and costs and our strong profit 
to cash conversion, saw us grow our free cash flow by over 
£100 million. We generated £433 million of free cash before 
investment and shareholder returns to end the year with net 
cash of £164 million. We have taken further steps to improve 
the efficiency of the balance sheet with additional debt 
buybacks and the redemption of the convertible bond. 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.4p (2012: 1.8p) 
giving a full year dividend of 3.5p (2012: 2.6p) – an increase 
of 35%. The Board is committed to a progressive dividend, 
taking into account the outlook for the business, while 
balancing the need to invest for growth and to maintain a 
robust financial position.
In addition to the final dividend, the Board is proposing a 
special dividend of 4.0p per share (£161 million). The cash 
distribution reflects the Board’s confidence in the ongoing 
growth and cash generation of the business. Going forward 
we will continue to show capital discipline and balance the 
need to invest for future growth with increasing returns to 
shareholders.

Our strategy and the changing  
media environment
We are now four years into our five year Transformation 
Plan which is based on our four key priorities. We remain 
committed to this strategy as the progress we have made 
over the last four years shows it is the right strategy for ITV.
The demand from viewers for quality content is strong not 
just in the UK but globally. Linear viewing remains healthy 
and we must ensure that our Broadcast business continues 
to be strong, generating significant profits and cash. 
However, we must not be complacent and we must adapt 
to the challenges and opportunities of the dynamic media 
environment in which we operate. 
While on demand is still a relatively small part of total 
viewing, we must make sure that our digital offerings are 
high quality, competitive and widely available so we can keep 
up with changing consumer behaviour and demands. We 
continue to experiment with new free and pay offerings to 
explore how viewers want to consume our content.
In such a rapidly evolving market, creating and owning high 
quality content is more important than ever , so we will 
continue to invest in a quality creative pipeline and exploit 
our advantage as an integrated producer broadcaster .
2014 and beyond
The television advertising market continues to show signs 
of improvement with ITV Family NAR expected to be up 5% 
to 6% in the four months to the end of April. We expect 
to outperform our estimate of the television advertising 
market over the full year . Our good on-screen performance 
in 2013,  the strong 2014 schedule including the FIFA World 
Cup in June and the advertising deals we have done to date, 
puts us in a good position to achieve this. 
Online, Pay & Interactive should deliver another year of good 
revenue growth as we continue to exploit opportunities in 
digital media and drive new revenue streams. Our new pay 
channel, ITV Encore, which will launch on Sky in 2014, will 
contribute towards this. 
We anticipate good revenue growth in ITV Studios, primarily 
driven by the recent acquisitions we have made in the UK 
and internationally. Key to our success is creative content 
and therefore we will continue to invest in the pipeline of 
ideas and look at potential acquisitions and partnerships. 
We remain committed to our strategy of rebalancing ITV 
and expect all parts of the business to see further growth 
in 2014. While a healthy broadcast business remains at the 
core of ITV, going forward we expect growth to increasingly 
come from Online, Pay & Interactive and from ITV Studios 
internationally.

Create a lean, creatively dynamic and fit-for-purpose 
organisation
In 2013 we have again made significant progress in making 
ITV lean, creatively dynamic and fit-for-purpose.
We continue to make ITV a better business both creatively 
and commercially, through driving out complexity, 
developing our people, driving cultural change throughout 
the organisation, investing in our core systems and 
technologies, and in our brand.
As well as operating efficiently it is vital that we also operate 
responsibly. Our behaviour impacts our employees, our 
shareholders, our viewers, the wider community and the 
environment. Our Corporate Responsibility strategy, which 
is aligned to our four key priorities, aims to help grow our 
business by strengthening stakeholder pride and loyalty in 
ITV, as well as mitigating the risks to the business. Ensuring 
the welfare and human rights of our employees is a key 
consideration in our day-to-day activity, both in the UK and 
internationally, and we use United Nations human rights 
frameworks as guiding principles. 
This report highlights issues which are material to our 
business strategy. However , our commitment goes beyond 
the business plan and regulatory requirements. As a 
responsible industry leader we undertake a number of 
initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to behaving 
responsibly and to a sustainable future for our industry, 
which can be found on our website. 
www.itvplc.com/responsibility
Our people
Our people are key to the success of ITV. It is essential 
that we develop and support them so that we can attract 
and retain the best talent. We measure our employee 
engagement annually and we are pleased to see it has 
again improved to 91% (2012: 88%), which compares to 
a benchmark for comparable company surveys of 77%.  
Employee participation has also increased to 88% (2012: 
80%), which compares to a benchmark of 69%.
We have continued to simplify the way we operate and to 
increasingly work as One ITV. This makes it easier for people 
to do their jobs and to help deliver value from our integrated 
producer broadcaster model and to drive future growth. 
However , there is still more we can do.

ITV at the heart of popular culture
At the start of 2013 we successfully rolled out the ITV 
rebrand with the emphasis on putting ITV at the heart of 
popular culture. This was one of the most extensive media 
rebrands ever undertaken and was developed in-house 
by ITV Creative. We rolled out a new identity for our five 
channels, our entire online estate, and our production and 
distribution businesses in the UK and internationally, all on 
the same day. The rebrand has significantly improved ITV’s 
brand health as measured by YouGov and has helped make 
ITV the ‘most loved’ commercial network in 2013. 
Relentless focus on cash and costs
In 2013 we delivered £28 million of cost savings, £8 million 
ahead of the original target. These savings are largely not 
employee related. Since 2009 we have taken £118 million 
of costs out of the business. These savings have funded 
our investment in our creative and commercial capabilities, 
specifically in our creative pipeline, in technology and online.

efficiently it is vital that we 
also operate responsibly”

Our focus on costs and cash has enabled us to significantly 
strengthen and improve the efficiency of our balance 
sheet. Our cash generation remains strong with free cash 
flow up over £100 million year-on-year.  Profit to cash 
conversion was 97% and we have ended the year with net 
cash of £164 million even after significant investment in 
acquisitions, property and returns to shareholders. We have 
also continued to improve the efficiency of the balance 
sheet with £211 million of debt buybacks (nominal) and the 
redemption of the convertible bond, both of which deliver 
significant interest cost savings for 2014 and beyond.
The steps we have taken on the balance sheet along with 
another period of double digit profit growth has led the 
Board to propose a final dividend of 2.4p (2012: 1.8p) giving 
a full year dividend of 3.5p (2012: 2.6p) – an increase of 35%. 
The Board is committed to a progressive dividend, taking 
into account the outlook for the business, while balancing 
the need to invest for growth and to maintain a robust 
financial position.
In addition to the final dividend, the Board is proposing a 
special dividend of 4.0p per share (£161 million). The cash 
distribution reflects the Board’s confidence in the ongoing 
growth and cash generation of the business. Going forward 
we will continue to show capital discipline and balance the 
need to invest for future growth with increasing returns to 
shareholders.

We have made great strides in creating a better business and

We will maintain our focus on costs but, given the savings 
we have made to date, further significant savings are getting 
harder to achieve. For 2014 we have identified a further £10 
million of non-network programme budget cost savings.
It is essential that while we remain operationally and financially 
fit-for-purpose, we must balance cost and cash discipline with 
the need to invest in the business. The balance sheet we now 
have gives us the flexibility to invest where appropriate to 
drive future growth and improve shareholder returns.

Maximise audience and revenue share from our existing  
free-to-air broadcast business 
A strong broadcast business is central to our strategy. As 
a business it generates significant profits and cash and its 
content can be repackaged to drive new revenues. As an 
integrated producer broadcaster , our family of broadcast 
channels provides a platform on which to make ITV Studios 
content famous before exploiting it internationally.
ITV Family NAR grown by 2%
In 2013, ITV Family NAR grew by 2% based on pure spot 
advertising. This is slightly behind our estimate of the 
television advertising market, up 3%. However, it is 
getting increasingly difficult to measure the market as all 
broadcasters have differing definitions and therefore include 
sources of revenue other than pure spot advertising.
Since 2009 we have grown our Share of Broadcast (SOB) 
from 44.7% to 45.4% in 2013. We have achieved this through 
the quality of our schedule and the unrivalled reach that 
ITV offers. ITV is the UK’s strongest marketing platform, 
delivering the mass audiences which are so much in 
demand from advertisers. In 2013 ITV delivered 99.9% of all 
commercial audiences over five million viewers and 100% of 
audiences over six million.
Our digital channels, ITV2, 3 and 4, provide more targeted 
demographics, which together with ITV main channel, 
ensures that we deliver both mass and targeted reach. 
Our broadcast performance has helped to drive 3% growth 
in Broadcast & Online revenues to £1,896 million.
Strong on-screen performance
The improved quality and variety of the schedule has driven a 
consistently strong on-screen performance throughout 2013. 
ITV Family SOV was up 4% over the full year – the best year-
on-year performance for over ten years. ITV main channel 
SOV was up 3%, ITV main channel SOCI was up 1% and ITV 
Family SOCI was flat. ITV digital channels performed broadly 
in line with last year .
ITV had many on-screen successes in the year with both new 
and returning programmes. Based on the series average, ITV 
broadcast the highest rating drama with Downton Abbey , 
the highest rating new drama launch with Broadchurch and 
highest rating entertainment programme with I’m A Celebrity 
Get Me Out of Here! Other notable successes include Lewis, 
Poirot, Mr Selfridge, Doc Martin, Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night 
Takeaway , The Chase, Tipping Point, Paul O’Grady: For the 
Love of Dogs, and Her Majesty’s Prison: Aylesbury . Our sports 
programming again delivered good audiences, in particular 
the Champions’ League and England international friendlies.
The strong on-screen performance is not just due to the 
success of these new and returning series. Much of our

Birds of a Feather returned 
in 2014 and became the 
most watched comedy on 
ITV since records began 
with 9.5 million viewers.
regional news programmes have grown their audience share 
as we remain committed to providing high quality, impartial 
news. 
The improved quality of ITV channels has again been 
recognised publicly in 2013 with ITV winning Channel of the 
Year at the Edinburgh Television Festival and ITV2 winning 
digital channel of the year at the Broadcast Digital Awards. 
ITV also won six National Television Awards including most 
popular serial drama for Coronation Street and most popular 
entertainment programme for I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of 
Here!
ITV2 and ITV3 remain the two largest digital channels in the 
UK and our digital channels again aired successful new and 
returning programmes, including Tricked, The Big Reunion, 
Duck Dynasty, Plebs, Celebrity Juice, The Only Way is Essex, 
The Tour de France and The French Open.
Our viewing performance is clearly healthy but there remain 
areas we would like to improve. While overall the digital 
channels performed well, ITV4’s performance was slightly 
disappointing and the early daytime schedule on ITV has 
not performed as well as we had hoped. We will continue 
to rejuvenate some of our programmes and trial new ideas 
across our channels. We aim to increase our success rate in 
launching new programmes through research, viewer panels 
and pilots.
Our advertising is sold based upon the on-screen 
performance in the previous year and therefore our strong 
viewing performance in 2013 puts us in good stead for 2014.

During 2013 we experienced a number of transmission 
outages on our channels. High quality transmission is an 
absolute priority for ITV and we have a number of projects 
ongoing to ensure our transmission and distribution 
technologies are fit-for-purpose. 
Maximising the value of our airtime
We compete with broadcasters and other media for our 
share of television advertising and advertising revenues in 
general. We aim to maximise the value of our 30 second 
spot and drive related revenue streams through sponsorship, 
interactivity and brand extensions. For example, the 
successful sponsorship campaigns and off-air endorsements 
including Morrisons with Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night 
Takeaway, Tesco Finest with Downton Abbey, and Boots and 
This Morning. Following the successful broadcast of The 
Big Reunion on ITV2 in 2013 we also launched the live Big 
Reunion Tour and recommissioned the programme.
Traditional broadcast model remains robust
While the media environment is developing rapidly, the 
traditional television broadcast model remains structurally 
robust. On demand viewing is growing fast, but it remains 
around 3% of total viewing and people continue to watch 
around four hours of television a day. 
We must ensure that even though our Broadcast business 
is strong we continue to make our digital offerings more 
widely available and competitive. 
Renewal of licence
In February 2014, ITV’s Public Service Broadcasting licences 
were renewed for a full ten years which gives us the certainty 
we require to continue to invest for the long term in our 
broadcast business and high quality content.
2014 and ahead
As we look into 2014 and beyond we must continue to 
focus on delivering a strong on-screen performance by 
offering a rich and varied schedule, including our new free 
to air lifestyle and reality channel ITVBe. There will be both 
challenges and opportunities. From the second half of 2015 
we will no longer hold the live rights for the Champions’ 
League but this will potentially open up parts of the schedule 
which will give us an opportunity to invest more in ITV 
Studios content.
The television advertising market continues to show signs 
of improvement with ITV Family NAR expected to be up 5% 
to 6% in the four months to the end of April. Over the full 
year we expect to outperform our estimate of the television 
advertising market. Our on-screen performance in 2013 and 
our strong schedule for 2014, including the FIFA World Cup 
and the advertising deals we have done, puts us in a good 
position to achieve this.

Corporate Responsibility
Using the power of our reach to inspire,  
engage and empower people to make a  
positive difference in our society.
ITV together with its much loved channels,  
popular programmes, celebrities and viewers  
have helped raise millions for charitable causes  
in 2013.
Social action has also been at the heart of many of 
our Corporate Responsibility campaigns in the form 
of volunteering and community action – often in 
collaboration with charities and other UK-wide social 
action organisations. 
Responsible programming and complying with 
Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code is absolutely key for ITV.

Drive new revenue streams by exploiting our content across 
multiple platforms, free and pay
Online, Pay & Interactive are fast growing new revenue 
streams which we are driving from distributing our content 
across a range of platforms, both free and pay. This is 
either by selling advertising around our content online or 
pay revenues through licensing our content to third party 
platform owners or , to a lesser extent, through transactions 
directly with the consumer through ITV Player .  
In 2013 we have continued to increase the quality and 
the availability of ITV Player and further developed our 
pay services. This, combined with the continued growing 
demand for watching our content via non-traditional 
channels as well as linear channels, has seen us again deliver 
strong growth, with revenues up 16% to £118 million. 
Online advertising
Over the last few years we have invested to improve 
the quality of our online offering and ITV Player is now 
fit to compete with the best in the digital market. In 
2013 we continued to enhance our online offering with 
improvements to the ITV Sports and ITV News sites.
We have also been working to increase the distribution of 
ITV content digitally so that it is available when and how 
people want to watch it. Our content is now available on 19 
platforms. 
The rapid increase in video on demand (VOD) is adding to 
a huge demand for quality content, both free and pay, and 
as an integrated producer broadcaster we are in a unique 
position to create value from this. Mobile and tablet viewing 
is driving VOD and there have now been over 11.7 million 
downloads of the ITV Player app since it was launched.
The increased quality and distribution of the ITV Player has 
led to continued good growth in long form video requests, 
which were up 16% in 2013. Advertiser demand continues to 
be strong for ITV’s VOD and we must manage our advertising 
load to meet that demand while maintaining a good user 
experience.

As consumer viewing behaviour evolves, we continue to

direct-to-consumer and to broadcasters and platform 
owners. We have trialled pay opportunities on the ITV Player 
with episode premieres of programmes such as Scott & 
Bailey for ITV and Plebs for ITV2, and have offered box sets 
to download to rent. We have also launched an ad free 
subscription model on iOS – the first broadcaster to do so.
During the year we renegotiated a number of our current 
deals with platform owners and also agreed a number of 
new deals to make our content available on more platforms.

Build a strong international content business
A strong international content business lies at the heart of 
our strategy to create and own more of our own content, 
make it famous in the UK on our channels and distribute it 
across multiple platforms in the UK and internationally. As an 
integrated producer broadcaster we are in a unique position 
to do this.
The high demand globally for quality content from 
broadcasters and platform owners provides a significant 
opportunity for us. We are building real momentum as we 
continue to invest in a strong and healthy creative pipeline 
in the key creative markets and specifically in genres that 
return and travel – drama, entertainment and factual 
entertainment, good examples of which are Mr Selfridge, 
Come Dine With Me and The Chase. 
In 2013 we delivered a 20% increase in total ITV Studios 
revenue with good performances across the business – 
particularly driven by international production – and 24% 
growth in EBITA. We delivered good organic growth and are 
building on this with the acquisitions we have made both 
in the UK and internationally. Our portfolio of acquisitions 
are performing in line with our expectations and we will 
continue to look at further acquisitions which fit with our 
strict strategic and financial criteria.
The strong performance in 2013 builds upon the significant 
progress we have made over the last few years. While there 
is still a great deal to do, ITV is now an international studios 
business – we are the number one commercial producer in 
the UK, a top five independent producer in the US and the 
third largest European distributor of television content.
UK Production
In the UK we have increased our production revenues by 12%. 
Growth has come in particular from drama, entertainment 
and factual, with original hours commissioned in these 
genres up 55%, 16% and 49% respectively, including the 
benefit of our acquisitions. Growth also came both on and 
off ITV. We have again increased ITV Studios’ share of ITV 
output, which increased to 59%, up from 50% in 2009.

programmes that return, including Mr Selfridge, Ant & Dec’s 
Saturday Night Takeaway and Surprise Surprise, which all 
have international appeal.
Off ITV our new commissions include Pressure Pad for the 
BBC and Kingfishers for Discovery while our recommissions

International Production
Our international production business continues to grow 
very strongly, with revenues up 56%, driven by the US. 
Our US businesses have secured a number of new 
commissions such as The Chase, which was originally 
commissioned in the UK, and many recommissions of 
programmes which demonstrate their longevity and their 
international appeal. These included Hell’s Kitchen which 
broadcast its 11th series in 2013, Kitchen Nightmares which 
broadcast its 5th series, Cake Boss which broadcast its 6th 
series and is developing spin-off shows, and Duck Dynasty 
which has broken cable viewing records in the US and is 
now also on ITV4. A number of these shows have already 
been recommissioned which will be reflected in the 2014/5 
results.
Our other international production bases in Australia, 
Germany, France and the Nordics also produce their own 
original formats and versions of UK formats. Their original 
formats include Der Letzte Bulle in Germany, Mad As Hell in 
Australia and Night Patrol in Norway. UK formats produced 
locally include I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! and The 
Audience in Germany, Four Weddings in France and Hell’s 
Kitchen in the Nordics. They have also secured a number of 
new commissions for 2014 including UK formats, such as 
Hell’s Kitchen in Germany.
Global Entertainment
The growth in the UK and international production 
businesses is starting to feed our international distribution 
arm, whose revenues were up 2% to £135 million.  
Global Entertainment’s successes in the year include Mr 
Selfridge, Poirot, Marple, Lewis and Hell’s Kitchen US, which 
have all now been sold to over 150 countries. We also 
continue to sell formats successfully, for example Come 
Dine with Me, Four Weddings and The Chase, and we now 
have eight programmes sold in three or more countries. As 
well as distributing ITV’s own content we are adding to our 
catalogue through the distribution of third party content, 
such as Rectify for AMC and River Monsters for Icon Films. 
We are seeing strong growth in sales to digital platforms 
which is more than offsetting the decline in DVD sales. 
We have delivered revenue growth in the period, but it 
takes time for the creative pipeline to flow through and the 
market for third party rights remains very competitive.

Acquisitions
Our acquisitions focus to date is on the two key markets 
which have a track record for creating and owning 
intellectual property, namely the UK and US. We are looking 
for companies that have a good creative pipeline and 
produce in genres that have the potential to travel.
In the UK we are seeking to enhance our skills in key genres. 
In 2013 we acquired UK producers The Garden and Big Talk to 
increase our capability in creating factual entertainment and 
comedy formats that travel and in delivering commissions 
for other broadcasters.
In the US we continued to build strength and scale with the 
most recent acquisitions of High Noon and Thinkfactory who 
produce reality, entertainment and drama programmes, 
such as Cake Boss and R&B Divas. These complement our 
existing business, including Gurney Productions which we 
acquired at the end of 2012.
2014 and beyond
In 2014 we again anticipate good growth, primarily driven by 
the acquisitions we have made in the UK and internationally. 
As ever ITV’s revenue growth will not be a straight line 
because of the phasing of the delivery schedule required by 
our network and cable customers. A challenge for the UK 
business is that ITV main channel will be spending less on 
original commissions given the World Cup cost in the first 
half of 2014. 
We will continue to invest in our creative pipeline to develop 
programmes that return and travel and we will also look 
at potential acquisitions in the key creative markets. Our 
international production business will remain a key focus 
as the demand for quality content globally continues to 
grow and will increasingly be the main driver for ITV Studios 
growth.
On 19 February 2014 we acquired a 51% controlling interest 
in DiGa Vision, a US independent producer of reality and 
scripted programming. There is a put and call option to buy 
the remainder of the company over three to six years.

Strategic priority 2 aims to 
maximise audience share from 
our existing free-to-air broadcast 
business, and ITV Family Share 
of Viewing (SOV) is the clearest 
indicator of this. ITV Family SOV 
is ITV’s share of the total viewing 
audience over the year achieved 
by ITV’s family of channels as a 
proportion of total television 
viewing, including the BBC family. 
ITV aims to at least maintain the

Strategic priority 2 aims to

our existing free-to-air broadcast

of Commercial Impacts (SOCI) 
is another key indicator of this. 
SOCI is the trading currency 
in the television advertising 
market, and since it only covers 
commercial television it does not 
include the BBC. This is the share 
of total UK television commercial 
impacts which is delivered by 
ITV’s family of channels. An 
impact is one viewer watching 
one 30 second commercial. We 
aim to maximise our SOCI.

ITV’s share of UK television 
advertising revenues is known 
as its Share of Broadcast (SOB). 
To maximise revenues from our 
free-to-air business, which is a key 
component of strategic priority 2, 
we aim to continue to maximise 
our SOB and to outperform the 
UK television advertising market.
 
It is getting increasingly difficult 
to measure the total television 
advertising market as all 
broadcasters have differing 
definitions and therefore include 
sources of revenue other than 
pure spot advertising.
Related Priority 2
Performance
ITV SOB was slightly down year 
on year . In 2014 we expect to 
outperform our estimate of the 
television advertising market 
over the full year . Our on-screen 
performance in 2013, the strong 
schedule for 2014 including 
the FIFA World Cup, and the 
advertising deals we have done, 
puts us in a good position to 
achieve this.

Our strategy looks to drive new 
revenue streams by exploiting 
our content across multiple 
platforms. 
Long form video requests is a 
measure of the total number 
of our videos viewed across all 
platforms (such as itv.com, Virgin, 
Sky and mobile devices) and 
therefore provides a key measure 
of how much of our content is 
being viewed online. 
A long form video is a programme 
that has been broadcast on 
television and is available to 
watch online and on demand in its 
entirety.

Growth in long form video 
requests has been driven by

Growing non-NAR revenues is 
key to the strategy as we aim 
to rebalance the business away 
from our reliance on television 
advertising revenues. Non-NAR 
revenues include all ITV revenues, 
both internal and external, 
except net advertising revenues 
(NAR). 
Key drivers of non-NAR revenue 
are the growth in Online, Pay

particularly international.

Financial and Performance Review
Ian Griffiths
We have again delivered a strong set of results with good 
revenue growth and double digit profit growth. There was 
growth from all parts of the business, our acquisitions are 
making a material contribution and the relentless focus on 
costs and cash is evident in our healthy financial position.  
We ended the year with £164 million of net cash even after 
significant investment across the business and increased 
returns to shareholders.

We again maintained our focus on cash and costs. We 
delivered £28 million of cost savings, £8 million ahead of our 
original target and our tight working capital management 
has delivered a strong profit to cash ratio at 97%, again 
above our 90% rolling three year target. We have continued 
to take steps to improve the efficiency of the balance sheet 
having bought back £211 million of gross debt and exercised 
our right to redeem the convertible bond. Together , these 
actions have reduced our level of total debt to £354 million 
and further reduced our financing costs. 
The Financial and Performance Review focuses on the 
adjusted results, which in management’s view shows our 
business performance in a more meaningful and consistent 
manner and reflects how the business is managed and 
measured on a daily basis.  A reconciliation to the reported 
results is set out in the earnings per share section that 
follows. 
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted EPS remove the 
effect of exceptional items which include acquisition 
related costs (professional fees, primarily due diligence, 
and performance based employment linked contingent 
payments), impairment of intangible assets, amortisation of 
intangible assets acquired through business combinations, 
net financing cost adjustments and other tax adjustments.

Broadcast & Online delivered a strong performance.  
Revenues were up £62 million (3%) and with tight control 
of costs and growth in new higher margin revenues, we 
delivered an £81 million (20%) increase in EBITA.  
Revenue growth was driven by a 16% increase in Online, Pay 
& Interactive revenues and 2% growth in ITV Family NAR 
as the television advertising market returned to growth. 
The television advertising market again showed significant 
fluctuations across the year , often driven by the timing of 
sporting events or programmes delivering large audiences. 
ITV Family NAR was down 3% in the first half of the year as 
there were tough comparatives in Q2 caused by the absence 
of a big sporting event but this recovered over the second 
half which was up 8%. In 2014 with the FIFA World Cup in Q2 
we expect again to see significant variations by quarter . 
There also continues to be volatility by sector. In 2013 we 
continued to see strong demand from advertising sectors 
driven by technology and highly competitive industries. 
Good growth was seen in entertainment & leisure, 
telecommunications, cars, publishing & broadcasting, 
airlines & holidays and household stores.  While retail as a 
whole did not show significant growth as the high street 
subsector remained weak, supermarkets did spend more. 
Finance declined year-on-year driven by banks and building 
societies. Food was weak due to the margin pressure being 
experienced within the sector .

Over the full year , ITV NAR based on pure spot advertising 
was up 2% which is slightly behind our estimate of 
the television advertising market up 3%. However, it is 
getting increasingly difficult to measure the market as all 
broadcasters have differing definitions and therefore include 
sources of revenue other than pure spot advertising.
In 2014 we expect to outperform the television advertising 
market. Our on-screen performance in 2013, the strong 
schedule for 2014 including the FIFA World Cup, and the 
advertising deals we have done, puts us in a good position to 
achieve this. 
SDN revenues increased 15% benefiting from the launch of 
the 12th and 13th video streams in the year . No similar one-
off benefit is expected in 2014.
Online, Pay & Interactive revenues grew strongly, up 16% 
to £118 million. Within this, online advertising revenues 
increased as long form video requests grew 16%, which has 
been helped by our continued improvement in the quality 
and distribution and the enhanced offerings of itv.com and 
ITV Player. Our pay revenues have also grown as we have 
renegotiated deals with Virgin, BT and Lovefilm. These pay 
revenues are mainly from platform owners paying us for our 
channels. Our content is now available on 19 platforms. Our 
interactive revenues, which include competitions and voting, 
have been broadly flat year-on-year but we continue to drive 
engagement and interaction with our content.

Other commercial income includes sponsorship, minority 
revenues, media sales and other income. In total these 
are up 3%, with growth coming from sponsorship and 
brand extensions as we have broadened our commercial

sponsoring Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway which 
included a full brand endorsement of Morrisons and Ant &

Schedule costs were down as a result of the savings we 
have secured on our FA Cup and Champions League rights 
and lower overall sports costs as there has been no large 
one-off sporting event. This has enabled us to invest in more 
hours of drama and entertainment, including programmes 
from ITV Studios. Other costs were flat as we manage our 
overheads tightly which has mitigated inflationary pressures 
and funded our investment in the business.

In 2013 we again delivered strong revenue growth, up 20%. 
All parts of the business performed well, with significant 
growth coming from International Productions both 
organically and through the acquisitions we have made.
Through this strong revenue growth, our continued focus 
on costs and changes in our revenue mix, we delivered 24% 
growth in EBITA. 
Organic revenue growth was 7% and acquisitions delivered 
just under £100 million of revenue growth and £15 million of 
EBITA in line with our expectations. 
UK Productions grew on and off ITV, with total revenue up 
12%. This has been driven by drama, entertainment and 
factual with programmes such as Mr Selfridge, Lewis, Vera, 
Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway and The Chase for ITV 
as the demand for high quality content has grown. Off ITV 
we have produced Graham Norton and Shetland for the BBC, 
24 Hours in A&E for Channel 4 and Four Weddings for Sky 
Living. 
International Productions grew very strongly, up 56%. This 
was driven particularly by America for a number of reasons. 
Firstly they delivered good organic growth with additional 
volumes of programmes such as Hell’s Kitchen. Secondly 
2013 was the first full year of owning Gurney Productions, 
who produce the hugely popular show Duck Dynasty. Finally 
our other acquisitions also performed well with programmes 
such as Cake Boss produced by High Noon. We also had a 
good year in Germany and France with I’m A Celebrity Get 
Me Out Of Here! and Come Dine With Me in Germany and 
Four Weddings in France.

The strong growth in our UK and international production 
businesses is starting to feed our global distribution 
business, with programmes such as Mr Selfridge, Poirot, 
Marple, Lewis and Hell’s Kitchen US selling to over 150 
countries. In addition, eight of our formats have been sold 
in three or more countries this year , including I’m a Celebrity 
Get Me Out Of Here!, Dancing on Ice, Coach Trip and The 
Audience. However , this is a process that does take time. We 
are seeing strong growth in sales to digital platforms which 
is more than offsetting the decline in DVD sales. 
The majority of costs incurred in ITV Studios vary directly 
with levels of activity. However , we continue to maintain our 
focus on costs and to drive efficiencies in the production 
process.  
Acquisitions
In 2012 and 2013 we acquired a number of content 
businesses in the UK, the US and the Nordics. These have 
been made against strict strategic and financial criteria. 
Financially we look at ownership of intellectual property, 
return on capital employed and discounted cash flow. 
Strategically we look at the talent, creative pipeline and type 
of content to ensure it has the potential to return and travel. 
We have structured the deals, with earnouts or put and 
call options, to base a significant part of the consideration, 
which is capped, on future performance and therefore align 
incentives and lock in creative talent. To date our portfolio of 
acquisitions is performing in line with our expectations. 
In 2012 we acquired Gurney Productions in the US, So TV in 
the UK, Mediacircus in Norway and Tarinatalo in Finland.
In April 2013 we acquired 100% of the UK independent 
producer The Garden to enhance our capability in creating 
factual entertainment formats that travel and to increase 
our strength in delivering commissions off ITV. We made an 
upfront payment of £18 million with a further capped cash 
payment contingent on The Garden’s future performance.  
In July 2013 we acquired 100% of Big Talk Productions and 
associated companies (Big Talk) to strengthen our comedy 
and light entertainment capability. We paid an initial cash 
consideration of £13 million and there are further capped 
cash payments contingent on Big Talk’s future performance. 
In May 2013 in the US we acquired 60% of High Noon 
Entertainment for an upfront cash consideration of $26 
million (£16 million) and in June we acquired 65% of 
Thinkfactory Media for an upfront cash consideration of $30 
million (£19 million), to further build our strength and scale. 
There are put and call arrangements in place to buy the 
remaining minority stakes.
The total initial payment for 2012 and 2013 acquisitions 
is £108 million with a further expected £97 million 
(undiscounted) payable which is based upon our current 
view of their performance over the payment period. The 
total maximum consideration of £293 million (undiscounted 
contingent consideration of £185 million and initial 
consideration of £108 million) for all these acquisitions is 
payable only if the businesses deliver 20–30% compound 
average annual growth rate in earnings.  
On 19 February 2014 we acquired a 51% controlling interest 
in DiGa Vision, the US independent producer of reality and 
scripted programming. There is a put and call option to buy 
the remainder of the company over three to six years.

Net financing costs
Net adjusted financing costs of £25 million were £19 million 
lower than last year as a result of the full year benefit of the 
debt bought back in 2012 and part year benefit of the debt 
buyback and the redemption of the convertible bond in 
2013. 
The £61 million of losses on buybacks relate to the 
exceptional loss on the £211 million (nominal) of debt we 
bought back in the year. The partial repayment of the 2019 
bilateral loan in March of £138 million (nominal) resulted in 
an exceptional loss of £38 million and will save £48 million of 
future interest costs. 
The £73 million convertible bond buyback, together 
with the early redemption of the remaining balance 
for equity, resulted in an exceptional loss of £23 
million and will save £16 million of future interest 
costs as well avoiding the dilution of our shareholders. 
In 2012 losses were incurred on the buyback of certain 
bonds. 
In January 2014 we bought back the remaining tranche of 
the 2019 bilateral loan for £95 million.

Tax
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax of £581 
million is 23% which is comparable to the standard tax rate 
of 23.25% (2012: the effective tax rate on adjusted profits 
of 23% was lower than the standard rate of 24.5% due to 
the adjustments made for prior periods and the recognition 
of overseas deferred tax credits). The total tax charge is 
£105 million (2012: £77 million). 
Cash tax paid of £67 million (2012: £62 million) arises as a 
result of making payments for taxable profits partially offset 
by the use of losses and the tax treatment of allowable 
pension contributions. The majority of cash tax is paid in  
the UK.

Dividend
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.4p (2012: 1.8p) 
giving a full year dividend of 3.5p (2012: 2.6p) – an increase 
of 35% on 2012. The Board is committed to a progressive 
dividend, taking into account the outlook for the business, 
while balancing the need to invest for growth and to 
maintain a robust financial position.
In addition to the final dividend, the Board is proposing a 
special dividend of 4.0p per share or £161 million (2012: 4p 
per share special dividend). The cash distribution reflects 
the Board’s confidence in the ongoing growth and cash 
generation of the business. Going forward we will continue 
to show capital discipline and balance the need to invest for 
future growth with increasing returns to shareholders.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired 
through business combinations is not included within 
adjusted earnings. Amortisation of software licences and 
development is included as management considers these 
assets to be core to supporting the day-to-day operation of 
the business.
Operating exceptional items are mainly acquisition related 
expenses, including professional fees, primarily due diligence, 
and performance based employment linked contingent 
payments. There are no restructuring costs in 2013.
Non-operating exceptional items largely relate to the profit 
on disposal of STV shares in the year resulting in a gain of  
£6 million.

‘Profit to cash’ ratio 97% 97%*
* Previously reported profit to cash ratio for 2012 was 95%. This has increased to 97% 
because of the restatement of EBITA.
Our focus on cash remains a priority and we generated 
£604 million of cash from £620 million of EBITA before 
exceptional items. This performance is largely due to the 
continued management of working capital balances. Our 
profit to cash ratio of 97% has been maintained at a strong 
level and continues to be ahead of our KPI target of 90% on 
a three year rolling basis. 
This calculation includes £45 million of capital expenditure, 
which largely relates to the new state-of-the-art Coronation 
Street set. However , it excludes the acquisition of the 
Company’s London headquarters for £58 million as 
management considers it to be a material one-off capital 
expenditure and not a day-to-day operational investment.

Except where disclosed, management views the acquisition of operating property, plant

Free cash flow reflects our underlying cash generation and 
our strong free cash flow generation gives us flexibility to 
invest in the business and reward our shareholders. This is a 
key strength of ITV today. 
Free cash flow before dividends, acquisitions and debt 
repayments remains very strong and is up over £100 million 
(32%) year-on-year, in line with the growth in profits. 
Net cash, liquidity risk and funding
Net cash at the year end was £164 million, compared to net 
debt of £52 million at 30 June 2013 and £206 million net 
cash at the end of 2012.

One of the key strengths of our business is our strong cash 
generation but it is weighted to the second half of the year 
as we make a number of significant payments both regular 
and one-off in the first half of 2013, including acquisitions, 
dividends, the pension deficit funding contribution, debt 
buybacks and the purchase of our London headquarters.  In 
spite of this investment and shareholder returns we ended 
the year with similar cash position to 2012.

Debt structure and liquidity
We continued to strengthen our balance sheet and 
maintain access to liquidity with our strong underlying cash 
generation, the £125 million invoice discounting facility 
and our £250 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). In June 
2013 we extended the maturity of the RCF by a further year 
to July 2016. The facility remains undrawn and, subject to 
agreement by the banks, is extendable by a further year. 
The facility contains leverage and interest cover financial 
covenants as is normal for a facility of this nature.
We have bought back over £1.1 billion of debt (including the 
£73 million of convertible we bought back) since October 
2009 and we now have a much more efficient balance sheet. 
After the year end we bought back the remaining £62 million 
(nominal) of the March 2019 bank loan (see post balance 
sheet events). Given what we have bought back over the last 
few years we do not expect to be able to make any further 
material changes in the efficiency of our balance sheet. 
The debt buybacks in the year were as follows:
● ●
In March 2013 we repaid £138 million (nominal) of the 
£200 million covenant free bilateral loan with a maturity 
of March 2019. This was satisfied by £30 million of cash 
and by gilts secured against the loan and resulted in an 
exceptional charge of £38 million. This repayment will 
save £48 million in future interest costs.
● ●
During the year we repurchased £73 million (nominal) 
of the £135 million convertible bond with a maturity 
date of November 2016 for a cash cost of £169 million.   
In September we exercised our right to redeem the 
outstanding principal amount of the convertible bond. 
This redemption and conversion process was completed 
on 21 October and resulted in 95 million new shares 
being issued. Settling the convertible has resulted in £16 
million of interest cost savings over the remaining period 
of the bond. Partly buying back the debt has avoided 
the full dilution which would have occurred if the entire 
convertible had been redeemed. Settling the convertible 
has also resulted in an exceptional charge of £23 million 
shown in financing costs and in a net £74 million loss 
attributable to equity, which has been reflected directly in 
retained earnings. 
The actions we have taken will improve our adjusted 
financing costs going forward. In 2014 we expect adjusted 
financing costs to be about £10–£12 million, a saving of 
around £15 million after the repurchase of the remaining 
2019 loan.

Adjusted net debt to EBITDA 1.2 1.7
Net debt/net cash is one measure of the strength of our 
financial position. However , we believe it is appropriate to 
look at all our financial commitments and have developed 
an adjusted net debt measure, similar to how credit rating 
agencies could look at our balance sheet. The ratio of adjusted 
net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items is 1.2. This level 
of indebtedness is slightly lower than previous years and 
reflects the improved profitability and strong cash generation 
of the business as well as reduced lease commitments and a 
lower pension deficit as measured by IAS 19.
As can be seen from the table, adjusted net debt includes 
the undiscounted estimate of the contingent payments 
in relation to all the acquisitions we have made in 2012 
and 2013, the pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis, and our 
operating lease commitments (undiscounted) which are 
mainly for broadcast transmission contracts and property. 
Lease commitments have reduced year on year as a result of 
the acquisition of our London headquarters.

Financing
We are financed using debt instruments with a range of 
maturities. Following the buyback of the 2019 loan in 
January 2014, the remaining debt, other than the finance 
leases, is publicly traded Eurobond debt. Borrowings at

There are no financial covenants on any of our debt 
instruments, other than the RCF which remains undrawn.
The recent debt buyback of the 2019 loan removes the last 
of the high coupon debt taken out in 2008/9. 
Ratings
Our credit ratings have improved during 2013 with all three 
ratings agencies upgrading their long-term credit ratings. 
In March and April respectively, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch 
upgraded our long-term credit rating to investment grade 
BBB- (Stable outlook). In August Moody’s Investors Service 
also upgraded their long-term credit rating to investment 
grade Baa3 (Stable outlook).
The factors that are taken into account in assessing our 
credit rating include our degree of operational gearing, 
exposure to the economic cycle, and business and 
geographical diversity. Continuing to execute our strategy 
will strengthen our position against all these metrics.
Pensions 
IAS 19 
The aggregate IAS 19 deficit of the defined benefit schemes 
at 31 December 2013 was £445 million (31 December 2012: 
£551 million). This was partly as a result of the £80 million 
annual deficit funding contribution. Total liabilities have also 
reduced as a result of an increase in the implied discount 
rate used to value liabilities. This was largely offset by an 
increase in the rate of market-implied inflation. A review of 
the mortality assumption produced a further increase in the 
liabilities, reflecting an increased allowance for longer life 
expectancy. 
In 2011 the Group entered into a longevity swap to protect 
against further increases in life expectancy. Changes in 
accounting standards mean that the assumptions used to 
value this swap are now based on market fair values, rather 
than best estimates. These changes have resulted in a 
significant actuarial gain in 2013 with the book value of the 
swap decreasing from a £118 million liability in 2012 to a £23 
million liability in 2013.
Pensions continue to be paid from the Scheme based on 
actual requirements.

Actuarial valuations 
Full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years 
with the latest completed actuarial valuations of all three 
sections of the main defined benefit scheme carried out as 
at 1 January 2011 and, on the bases adopted by the Trustee, 
the combined funding deficits amounted to £587 million.
The Trustee of the Scheme will undertake actuarial 
valuations as at 1 January 2014 with the outcome expected 
by 2015.
Deficit funding contributions
Following completion of actuarial valuations as at 1 January 
2011 the Group has agreed with the Trustee that the level of 
contributions to the main section of the ITV Pension Scheme 
will be a combination of fixed and performance related 
payments. 
The fixed payments will be as follows:
2013 – 2014
£35 million per annum plus an additional £5 million if there 
are no initiatives in the previous year which materially reduce 
the deficit. This has not changed from the previous funding 
plan.
2015 – 2019 
£48 million per annum in 2015 increasing by £0.5 million  
per annum to £50 million per annum in 2019.
2020 – 2025 
£50 million per annum, but may be reduced by the impact of 
additional profit-related contributions set out below.
The performance related contributions will be calculated as 
follows:
2012 – 2020
If the Group’s reported EBITA pre exceptional items exceeds 
£300 million, the Group will increase the fixed contributions 
by an amount representing 10% of EBITA pre exceptional 
items over the threshold level, subject to an annual cap 
which averages to £70 million per annum over the period 
2015 – 2020. If the additional profit-related contributions 
are paid at the expected rate then the £50 million  
per annum fixed contributions scheduled to be paid 
between 2021 and 2025 (inclusive) should not be required.
In addition to the agreed deficit funding contributions, the 
SDN partnership established in 2010 provides an annual 
distribution of £11 million to this section of the Scheme for 
12 years from 2011.
For Sections B and C of the Scheme the Group has 
agreed with the Trustee that it will make deficit funding 
contributions of £5.5 million per annum in order to eliminate 
the deficits in these sections by 31 March 2021. 
In 2014 we expect to make a total deficit funding 
contribution of £89 million, which is £9 million higher than 
2013 reflecting the increase in EBITA year-on-year. 
Post balance sheet events
On 16 January 2014 we agreed to repay the remaining £62 
million of the 2019 bilateral loan. This repayment will save 
around £44 million in adjusted financing costs over the 
remainder of the loan – around £8 million on an annualised 
basis, and will lead to an exceptional loss of £30 million 
for 2014. The repayment was satisfied by a one-off cash 
payment of £95 million.

ITV has a formal risk management process which is 
embedded within the business to support the identification 
and effective management of risks across the business. It 
is regularly reviewed and adapted as the Company, industry 
and macro environment evolves.
Our approach, which is consistent with previous years, covers 
risks at all levels of the organisation and considers risks in 
three core groups:
● ●
High Impact, Low Likelihood (HILL) risks – of low inherent 
likelihood but where there would be major consequences 
were the risk to materialise;
● ●
Strategic risks – would impact the successful execution of 
the strategy; and
● ●
Process level risks – embedded into everyday activity 
within the organisation.
HILL

Process level risks
Risk management framework and risk appetite
The Board is responsible for establishing a robust and 
appropriate risk management framework and risk 
management process for ITV. The Board, supported by the 
Audit Committee, regularly reviews the risk management 
framework, its content and its operations. This includes 
reviewing the risks themselves and the mitigating actions. 
The Board also reviews risk appetite to ensure ITV is carrying 
an acceptable level of risk. During the year it conducted an 
exercise to assess the current risk appetite of the business 
and the actual risk the business takes with respect to 
the following categories: financial, market, operational, 
compliance and regulation, creative investment and 
organisational. This is considered to be the first step towards 
using risk appetite as a decision making tool and further 
work will be undertaken in 2014 to enhance this process.  
The Board also continues to monitor closely ITV’s specific 
financial risks, including foreign exchange, borrowing levels, 
interest rates and pension risks. 
The Audit Committee keeps the overall effectiveness of 
the risk management framework and the risk management 
process under review.
Risk management process
The Management Board has responsibility for the content 
and operation of the risk management framework and 
performs regular reviews of all risks. In 2013 all the HILL 
and Strategic risks were reassessed and further refined to 
improve our risk management. As well as management 
review, process level risks are also subject to an ongoing 
review by internal audit.
Mitigating actions have been identified for all the HILL and 
Strategic risks. Each strategic risk has been mapped to at 
least one of the four key strategic priorities and, where 
possible, assigned key risk indicators. Where appropriate, 
the key risk indicators are aligned to our key performance 
indicators (KPIs) on page 36 or a subset of these KPIs. All HILL 
and strategic risks are owned by at least one member of the 
Management Board.
Risk monitoring process
ITV’s risk monitoring process is embedded in the running 
and review of the business. Risks are primarily controlled 
through the risk management process. In addition to the risk 
specific mitigating actions outlined below, risks are regularly 
discussed and considered through day-to-day operations 
and through a number of divisional Board and review 
processes. 
Internal Audit Plan
The internal audit plan is driven from ITV’s risk management 
framework. As outlined above management has completed 
a number of activities with respect to HILL risks, Strategic 
risks and Process level risks. Internal audit reviews the 
auditable elements of these risks and this informs the areas 
and topics that internal audit focuses on.

Strategic Risks
The key strategic risks are those that impact the successful execution of the strategy. They require regular monitoring by the 
Management Board and are frequently discussed at management and divisional boards.
All of the strategic risks identified have been mapped to the four strategic priorities of the Strategy and have been grouped 
by key risk themes. 
Strategic Risks Mitigating Factors Strategic Priorities
The Market 
There is a major decline in 
advertising revenues and ITV 
does not build sufficient non-
NAR revenue streams to offset 
the financial impact of this 
decline.
● ●
Growing non-advertising revenues, in areas such as ITV 
Studios and Online, Pay & Interactive, remains a key part of 
the strategy.
● ●
ITV continues to focus on cash and costs, ensuring the 
Company has an adequate financial liquidity and balance 
sheet flexibility.
2 3 4
The Market 
The television market moves 
significantly towards pay 
television as a preferred 
model, negatively impacting 
ITV’s free-to-air revenues.
● ●
ITV continues to support free platforms, including 
YouView, to keep free-to-air strong.
● ●
ITV looks at and evaluates the opportunities for expanding 
its existing pay services and other pay offerings.
● ●
ITV explores other platforms to understand viewing habits 
and what people are prepared to pay for.
2 3
The Market 
A faster than expected shift 
to Video on Demand (VOD) or 
other new technologies causes 
a sustained loss of advertising 
revenue.
● ●
The business continues to develop ITV Player VOD 
services, maximise the distribution of ITV Player and grow 
its VOD advertising business.
● ●
ITV monitors the market for new technology and where 
appropriate explores how ITV can participate.
2 3 4
People 
ITV fails to attract, develop and 
retain key creative, commercial 
and management talent with 
the skills required for the 
changing business.
● ●
ITV invests in training and development for all key 
colleagues in the business.
● ●
Strategic focus on working across the business to embed 
and strengthen the culture of ‘One ITV’ way of working.
● ●
Succession plans are in place for all key positions within 
the Company.
1 2 3 4
Organisation, Structure and 
Processes 
ITV fails to evolve its 
organisational structure 
and culture to ensure that 
it is capable of delivering 
continued growth from the 
new businesses or revenue 
streams.
● ●
ITV constantly reassesses the business to create a fit-for-
purpose organisation.
● ●
ITV continues to embed and strengthen the culture of 
‘One ITV’ way of working.
1 2 3 4
Organisation, Structure and 
Processes 
A significant high profile 
incident or series of events 
such as transmission incidents 
or a major regulatory breach 
causes significant reputational 
damage.
● ●
ITV has ongoing projects to ensure transmission and 
distribution technologies are fit-for-purpose.
● ●
There are disaster recovery and incident management 
plans in place in high risk areas of the business to help 
deliver a rapid and flexible response.

Strategic Risks Mitigating Factors Strategic Priorities
Organisation, Structure and 
Processes 
There is significant loss of 
programme or sports rights or 
ITV fails to identify and obtain 
the optimal rights packages.
● ●
ITV is focused on both protecting and exploiting existing 
rights and ensuring that future rights generated accrue  
to ITV.
● ●
ITV has a detailed model to evaluate the value of third 
party rights to ensure it only buys rights that make 
economic sense.
2 3 4
Organisation, Structure and 
Processes 
ITV fails to create and own 
a sufficient number of hit 
programmes/formats.
● ●
ITV maximises opportunities for ITV Studios to create 
successful shows by investing in the creative pipeline 
and focusing on programmes and genres that can return 
and travel internationally, i.e. drama, entertainment and 
factual entertainment.
● ●
ITV is focused on hiring and retaining the right key creative 
talent.
2 3 4
Organisation, Structure and  
Processes 
ITV fails to properly resource, 
creatively and operationally, 
the growth businesses, 
in particular online and 
international content.
● ●
Talent management plans have been developed and 
reviewed to ensure adequate succession planning  
across ITV. 
● ●
ITV continues to embed and strengthen the culture of 
‘One ITV’ way of working.
● ●
Lessons from recent investments are captured through 
post acquisition reviews.
3 4
Organisation, Structure & 
Processes 
ITV loses a significant volume 
of personal or sensitive data.
● ●
A management board sponsored Information Security 
Steering Group is in place to ensure the appropriate 
management of information security.
● ●
Mandatory online training modules, awareness campaigns 
and simplified information security policies for employees. 
● ●
Monitoring of information sharing outside of ITV.
1 2 3 4
Technology 
ITV remains heavily reliant 
on legacy systems, which 
could potentially restrict the 
ability to grow the business. 
These systems and processes 
may not be appropriate for 
non-advertising revenues or 
international growth.
● ●
System requirements are kept under review with business 
growth and system modernisation projects implemented 
as appropriate.
● ●
A replacement plan is in place for the legacy systems 
which remains under constant review and development 
to ensure technology systems meet the needs of the 
business.
1 2 3 4
Technology 
ITV fails to ensure appropriate 
business continuity planning 
and resilience within its core 
systems, processes, platforms 
and technology infrastructure.
● ●
Disaster recovery plans are in place with tests conducted 
annually on business critical systems. 
● ●
Internal Audit review the disaster recovery plans and the 
test results as appropriate.
1 2 3
Technology  
There is a sustained cyber/
viral attack causing prolonged 
system denial or major 
reputational damage, for 
example the ability to 
broadcast our channels or the 
availability of ITV Player.
● ●
We continue to improve our ability to monitor , detect 
and respond to cyber threats internally and through 
partnerships with specialist security organisations.
● ●
Mandatory online training modules, awareness campaigns 
and simplified information security policies for employees.
● ●
There are disaster recovery and incident management 
plans in place for high risk areas of the business to help 
deliver a rapid and flexible response.
● ●
A management board sponsored Information Security 
Steering Group is in place to ensure the appropriate 
management of information security.

Change of control
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special 
rights with regard to control of the Company.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and 
options would normally vest and become exercisable on 
a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions. Certain of the Group’s bonds/
borrowing facilities have change of control clauses whereby 
the issuer can require ITV to repay/redeem bonds in the 
event of a change of control. The Company is not aware of 
any other significant agreements to which it is party that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company.
Financial instruments
Note 4.5 to the accounts gives details of the Group’s financial 
risk management policies and related exposures. 
Political donations
It is the Company’s policy not to make cash contributions to 
any political party. However, within the normal activities of 
the Group’s national and regional news-gathering operations 
there may be occasions when an activity might fall within 
the broader definition of ‘political expenditure’ contained 
within the Companies Act 2006. Shareholder authority 
for such expenditure was given at the 2013 AGM. However , 
during 2013 the Group made no payments falling within this 
definition (2012: nil).
Employees
Employment of disabled persons
The Company continues to meet its legal obligations as 
outlined in the Equality Act 2010 by actively encouraging 
applicants with disabilities whilst ensuring we retain the best 
talent within our workforce.
This is reflected in an award of the annual Department for 
Work and Pensions Two Ticks Disability Symbol status.
Our policies and procedures fully support our disabled 
colleagues. With a robust reasonable adjustment policy, an 
HR Disability manager , disability specific online resources 
and on-site diversity experts, we have taken active measures 
to ensure employees are fully supported.
The Company is committed to the development and growth 
of all its employees. Our learning and development portfolio 
is inclusive and accessible to employees. Alternative formats 
are available to all employees, which include large print, use 
of British sign language interpreters and Braille. 
The Company’s commitment around the disability agenda 
extends beyond our legal obligations. For a comprehensive 
outline of our activity visit our Corporate Responsibility 
website.

Employee involvement
Attracting and retaining talent is critical to ITV’s success. 
It is therefore in our interest to ensure that we provide the 
appropriate rewards and opportunities for development so 
that people feel engaged with the Company.
In 2013 ITV carried out an engagement campaign consisting 
of a series of roadshows during which the Management 
Board visited ITV locations. This gave employees an 
opportunity to feed back their thoughts and concerns 
about the business. Engagement was reinforced through 
forums such as the intranet, regular hard copy newsletters 
and briefings between management and its teams. These 
channels enabled employees to understand the financial 
and economic factors affecting the Company’s performance, 
how their role contributed towards the execution of the 
strategy and how they could benefit from company success 
through involvement in employee share schemes and 
information on their rights and benefits.  
We have continued to measure and listen to employees 
through employee surveys and employee engagement has 
increased again in 2013 to 91% (2012: 88%) with 93% of 
respondents proud to work for ITV.

Pensions
The Group operates a pension scheme which provides 
retirement and death benefits for employees of ITV. The ITV 
Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) comprises three sections: 
A, B and C. Section A includes the defined contribution 
(DC) section of the Scheme. The DC section is open to new 
members. The defined benefit (DB) sections are closed to 
new members but are still open to future accrual.
ITV Pension Scheme Limited is a corporate trustee and 
manages the DB and DC assets of the Scheme, which 
are held under trust separately from those of the Group. 
Members of the trustee board are formally appointed as 
directors of ITV Pension Scheme Limited. There are nine 
directors including the chairman – five appointed by the 
Company and four nominated by the members.
A member nomination selection process took place during 
June 2013 and on 1 July 2013, one trustee was reappointed 
and two new trustees were appointed. There is currently a 
vacancy for a company appointed director .
The trustee has four committees: Investment, Audit and 
Operations, DC and Corporate Affairs. The Corporate Affairs 
Committee is convened as and when appropriate for 
dealing with any corporate activities that may arise. It is the 
responsibility of the trustee to have in place appropriate 
training for its directors and effective committee structures. 
The trustee board and each committee have a business plan 
which is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, together 
with the associated budget. The trustee board also has a 
risk register , a conflicts of interest policy and a register of 
interests policy, all of which are reviewed at least annually.
The trustee directors receive regular training throughout the 
year and also have the support of the various professional 
advisers. The chairman and the pensions executive identify 
training opportunities. Training is delivered both by 
attendance at external courses and with targeted training 
to support specific agenda items at the start of each trustee 
board meeting. Where appropriate, longer training sessions 
are organised. Comprehensive records are kept of all training 
completed by each trustee director and training is discussed 
as part of the trustee evaluations conducted on an annual 
basis. 
The trustee board completes regular assessments of its 
advisers and has prepared a Service Charter that outlines 
the terms of the appointment and clarity on the services 
provided. The aim of the document is to support the ongoing 
monitoring of the adviser or services provider and will be 
introduced as they are reviewed and appointed. During 
2013 The Scheme Actuary and Investment Consultant were 
reappointed and the DC Investment Platform provider was 
replaced.
To encourage greater pension savings, the Government has 
introduced auto-enrolment. This requires employers to enrol 
eligible employees into a pension scheme automatically. The 
requirement to comply with the auto-enrolment regulations 
is being phased in with larger employers required to 
comply first and with medium-sized and smaller employers 
following at a later period. The size of an employer’s largest 
PAYE scheme determines the point at which the new duties 
affect their organisation (the ‘staging date’). ITV had a 
staging date of 1 March 2013 however, in line with permitted 
legislation ITV postponed auto-enrolment until 29 May 2013 
when eligible employees were enrolled into the ITV Auto-
enrolment Pension Plan.
Pension Scheme indemnities: Qualifying pension scheme 
indemnity provisions, as defined in section 235 of the 
Companies Act 2006, were in force for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2013 and remain in force for the benefit 
of each of the directors of ITV Pension Scheme Limited, a 
subsidiary of ITV plc. These indemnity provisions cover, to the 
extent permitted by law, certain losses or liabilities incurred 
as a director or officer of ITV Pension Scheme Limited.

Health and safety
The Health and Safety (H&S) of our employees, contractors

team continue to use a management system that meets 
the specific risk profile of the business which is supported by 
a comprehensive training programme and communicated 
across the business.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year . Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
● ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
● ● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
● ● for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
● ● for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the parent company financial statements; and
● ● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that 
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Report continued
Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s and the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 58 and 59, confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
● ● the Group accounts, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group; and
● ● the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 
2006, the Directors confirm that, so far as they are each 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken 
all steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of internal controls for the year ended 
31 December 2013. In the opinion of the Board, the Company 
has complied with the internal control requirements of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code throughout the year , 
maintaining an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, 
and minimising risk. Further information is set out in the 
Audit Committee Report on page 79.

“The Board believes that 
Corporate Governance is 
important in ensuring its 
effectiveness”
Dear Shareholder,
The Board believes that a high standard of corporate 
governance is a key contributor to the long-term success of 
the Company.  
The Board remains committed to ensuring that a 
combination of good leadership and the highest standards 
of corporate governance is maintained through a 
combination of a robust internal framework of systems and 
controls underpinned by the right values and culture. This 
framework of policies and processes is regularly reviewed 
against developments in the legislative, regulatory and 
governance landscape.
This governance report comprises the following sections:
● ● How the Board works
● ● Effectiveness
● ● Relations with shareholders
● ● Audit Committee Report
● ● Remuneration Report
The role of the Board
The Board’s main role is to work with the executive team, 
providing support and advice to complement and enhance 
the work undertaken. The Board consistently challenges 
processes, plans and actions and exercises a degree of 
rigorous enquiry and intellectual debate. This serves to 
promote continuous and sustained improvement across the 
business.
The Board consisted of a majority of independent Non-
executive Directors throughout the year . Further details of 
our Board composition and appointments are set out in the 
Governance Report.
In addition to scheduled formal Board and Committee 
meetings, there are meetings for cross interaction among 
the members of the Board, Management Board, Senior 
Independent Director, Non-executive Directors and myself. 
These meetings provide a sense of value added from the 
engagement of the Board members in all their interaction 
with the Company, formal or otherwise. In 2013, the Board 
continued its programme of visiting different areas of 
the business. This year the Board members took a trip to 
Stockholm where they met with colleagues to discuss 
our continuing growth in the Nordic region. The Company 
has a policy and programme for induction and continuing 
professional development for Directors. On appointment 
each Director takes part in a comprehensive induction 
programme. To enhance performance and effectiveness, the 
Board has established a process for the annual development 
of the Board, its committees and individual Directors. 
We remain committed to sharing our business vision with 
our shareholders by maintaining regular open dialogue 
and effective communication. We believe that continued 
engagement with our shareholders is highly beneficial to 
all parties as it helps to build a greater understanding of our 
investors’ views, opinions and concerns. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code
As a listed company, ITV is required to report on how it has 
complied with the principles of governance set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
I am pleased to report that ITV has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year ended

Who is on our Board and how we work as a team
Composition and appointments
In June 2013 the Board appointed Sir Peter Bazalgette as a 
Non-executive Director . Peter was selected from a number 
of potential candidates. The Board felt that Peter’s wealth 
of experience in media consultancy, digital media and as 
a former television producer would be an asset to the 
Board assisting with the execution of the business strategy.  
Executive search firm, JCA Group, were engaged to assist 
with the rigorous selection process. JCA Group have no other 
connection with ITV.
Mike Clasper completed seven years as a Non-executive 
Director in January 2013 and was asked by the Board to 
continue in this position for a further twelve month period. 
He stepped down from the Board on 31 December 2013. 
Andy Haste was appointed as Senior Independent Director in 
his place.
As recommended by the Code, there will be resolutions to 
elect or re-elect each of the Directors at the AGM in  
May 2014.
Non-executive Directors are expected to commit at least 
18 to 20 days per annum to the Company and the Board is 
satisfied that each of the Non-executive Directors commits 
sufficient time to the business of the Company. An outline of 
the terms of engagement for the Non-executive Directors 
can be found on our website.

Skills and experience
There are job descriptions in place for each of the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive, and the Senior Independent Director 
which have been agreed by the Board.

The Board is still of the view that the Non-executive Directors are independent in both character and judgement. They 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy, scrutinise the performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.
The Board works well together bringing strong, independent, balanced judgement, knowledge, and experience to the 
Board’s deliberations. Each non-executive Director has appropriate skills and experience that their views carry significant 
weight in the Board’s decision making.

Effectiveness
Evaluation
The Board has established an ongoing evaluation and 
development process. The process focuses on roles and 
responsibilities, culture, balance of skills and experience, 
diversity and how the Board works together. In particular, it 
focuses on how effective the Directors are in assisting the 
executive team in achievement of the strategy.
At the end of 2012 the Board embarked on a comprehensive 
Board Development Programme facilitated by Gurnek 
Bain of YSC, a global firm of business psychologists. This 
included a rigorous assessment of performance, agreement 
on the Board’s aspirations for itself and identification of 
steps required to achieve its objectives. Over the past 12 
months each board member  has had access to feedback 
and advice from YSC to help develop their own performance 
and the Board has held a number of collective discussions 
to review and agree on progress. At the end of the process 
further feedback was given and a programme for future 
development was agreed. It is ITV policy to ensure that 
all board members have continued access to coaching, 
feedback and support, and a further healthcheck review will 
be undertaken on the anniversary of the completion of the 
programme in 2014. 
YSC have also been involved in supporting the review of 
the board make up and composition. They have no other 
connection with the Company.

Succession planning
The Board has agreed a succession planning framework to 
ensure that:
● ● board tenure is appropriate and encourages fresh thinking 
and new ideas;
● ● the Board is sufficiently diverse but most importantly has 
the appropriate mix of generalist and specialist skills; and
● ● Non-executive Directors have the appropriate level of 
independence, from the executive and each other .
When planning succession within the Company 
consideration is given to emergency cover together with 
medium and long-term succession. There is particular 
emphasis on growing the internal leadership pipeline 
through the launch of the following key programmes:
● ● Executive Development Programme for next generation 
potential board successors giving them an opportunity to 
develop their management potential and gain a greater 
understanding of the business.
● ● Developing Future Leaders Programme for delegates 
selected from across the business identified as a result 
of the performance review process. Content includes 
understanding what it means to be a leader at ITV, how 
to manage performance effectively, coaching skills and 
change management.
● ● Graduate Programme.
● ● Apprentice Programme.
A comprehensive portfolio of development courses and 
workshops for all colleagues which address common 
development needs is in place.

Diversity
It is the Board’s policy to retain a strong but relatively 
small board bringing a balance of in depth commercial 
and creative experience. Although given the size of the 
Board specific formulaic targets are not appropriate it is 
our intention to increase the gender and ethnic diversity of 
board membership as opportunities arise. 
Diversity within the organisation is integral to achieving 
our business aims. Reflecting the demographics of our 
customers and understanding their needs ensures that our 
brand, services and products are accessible, inclusive and 
have wide appeal. 
The Company’s aim is to represent our society both within 
the organisation and on-screen. Year-on-year progress has 
been achieved in working towards this target. Key activity in 
2013 included:
● ● Diversity awareness training for line managers, 
supervisors and programme makers.
● ● Sustaining programme portrayal monitoring across 75% 
of our programmes.
● ● Workshops across the country to support future 
generations of diverse talent from Black, Asian, Minority 
Ethnics and individuals with disabilities.
● ● Developing and maintaining partnerships with external 
organisations to support and recognise diverse talent. For 
example, partnering with the inaugural Asia Media Awards 
and working with government to deliver the first ever 
Disability Confident conference to FTSE 100 companies.
Induction 
The Company has a policy and programme for induction 
and continuing professional development of Directors. On 
appointment, each Director takes part in a comprehensive 
induction programme where they:
● ● receive information about the Group in the form of 
presentations by executives from all parts of the business 
and on the regulatory environment;
● ● meet representatives of the Company’s key advisers;
● ● receive information about the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference 
and membership of Board committees and the powers 
delegated to those committees;
● ● receive information about the Company’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures and the latest 
financial information about the Group; and
● ● are advised of their legal and other duties and obligations 
as a director of a listed company.
This is supplemented by visits to key locations, including 
studios and regional sites, and meetings with key senior 
executives and with major shareholders where appropriate.
The key stages of the induction programme are:
Stage one Matters covered
Provision of documents Duties of a Director , board 
procedures, board and 
strategy papers and corporate 
governance
Stage two Matters covered

Continuing professional development
During their period in office, the Directors are continually 
updated on the Group’s businesses and the competitive and 
regulatory environments in which they operate. This is done 
through:
● ● updates and papers which cover changes affecting the 
Group and the market in which it operates; 
● ● meetings with senior executives across the Group and key 
advisers;
● ● regular updates on changes to the legal and governance 
requirements of the Group and in relation to their own 
position as Directors; and
● ● presentations given at board and committee meetings 
on business matters and technical update sessions from 
external advisers where appropriate.
As part of their professional development Executive 
Directors may accept external appointments as non-
executive directors of other companies and retain any 
related fees paid to them.  For further information on board 
development see the Evaluation section on page 71.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has delegated the authorisation of conflicts to 
the Nomination Committee and has adopted a Conflicts of 
Interest Policy.
The Board has considered in detail the current external 
appointments of the Directors which may give rise to a 
situational conflict and has authorised potential conflicts 
where appropriate.
This authorisation can be reviewed at any time but will 
always be subject to annual review. The Board is confident 
that these procedures operate effectively.
Insurance and indemnities
The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors 
and officers which is renewed on an annual basis. The 
Company has also entered into deeds of indemnity with 
its Directors. A copy of the indemnity can be found on our 
website.
www.itvplc.com/about/governance
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches a high priority to effective 
communication with shareholders and has regular and 
open dialogue with our institutional investors. The Board 
believes that continued engagement with our shareholders 
is beneficial to both ITV and its stakeholders as it helps 
to build a greater understanding of investors’ views, 
opinions and concerns. Adam Crozier , Ian Griffiths and 
our investor relations team meet with many institutional 
investors throughout the year to keep them updated on 
the Company’s performance and the Transformation 
Plan. These range from one-to-one meetings to group 
presentations including the Full year and Interim results and 
the AGM. Specifically, following the Full year and Interim 
results one-to-one meetings are held with our largest 
institutional investors.
The Chairman responds to shareholder queries and holds 
meetings where appropriate.
The Company maintains a programme of engagement 
with the investment community, including the results 
presentations, briefings to brokers and other sales forces 
and attendance at a number of investor conferences. 
Presentations given to the investment community are 
available to download from our website.
www.itvplc.com/investors
We regularly seek feedback on the perception of the 
Company amongst shareholders and the investor 
community more broadly via our corporate brokers. Investor 
comments are fed back to the Board and its committees 
regularly.
The Company considers annually whether it is appropriate to 
commission an investor audit. No audit was undertaken 
in 2013.
Private shareholders represent more than 95% of our 
shareholders holding 3.36% of our shares. We encourage 
shareholders to register their email addresses to receive 
information from us in a timely manner .

Audit Committee Report
“We seek not just to respond 
to changes but to support 
and challenge management 
to develop controls as 
they anticipate future 
opportunities and risk.”
Dear Shareholder,
On the following pages we set out the Audit Committee’s 
Report for 2013. The report comprises four sections:
● ● How the Committee works
● ● What we focused on in 2013
● ● Internal controls
● ● Our auditors
Strong and effective risk management and control 
procedures underpin our ability to execute and implement 
our strategy. The principal aims of the Committee are to 
support the maintenance and continuing development 
of a strong control environment across ITV and to ensure 
the integrity of the financial information provided to our 
shareholders. We do this in the context of a business with 
ambitious plans and a growing international footprint. 
We seek not just to respond to changes but to support 
and challenge management to develop controls as they 
anticipate future opportunities and risks. 
As requested by the Board, the Committee has considered 
the processes and controls in place to help ensure that the 
annual report presents a fair , balanced and understandable 
view of the business. As a result of this work the Committee 
concluded that the processes and controls were appropriate 
and was able to provide positive assurance to the Board.
In reporting to you, we have sought to respond to 
shareholders’ changing requirements and expectations 
of audit committees. This is no doubt the start of 
improved communication between audit committees and 
shareholders and we welcome feedback.

The purpose of this report is to highlight areas that the Committee has reviewed during the year, reporting back to 
shareholders the significant financial reporting issues and judgements made in connection with the preparation of the 
Company’s financial statements. The report also notes any areas or specific topics, such as risk, that the Committee 
has reviewed. Also highlighted is how the Committee has assisted the Board in reviewing the Company’s internal 
control environment, and what the Committee has done to review the effectiveness of both internal and external 
auditors. This year the report addresses the changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code by describing in more 
detail what the Committee does, and what processes and controls are in place to help ensure that the annual report 
presents a fair , balanced and understandable view of the business.

Audit Committee Report continued
How the Committee works
The Committee members have between them a wide range 
of business and financial experience which enables the 
Committee to fulfil its terms of reference in a robust and 
independent manner . The Committee considers that John 
Ormerod has recent and relevant financial experience for 
the purposes of the Code. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee, including 
qualification and experience, are set out on pages 58 and 59
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and internal and 
external auditors attended meetings during the course of 
the year at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee. 
Members of the Management Board and other senior 
management have attended certain meetings by invitation. 
The Committee as a whole has regular private sessions 
with both internal and external auditors and also, when 
appropriate, with the Group Finance Director .
In addition, throughout the year the Chairman of the 
Committee has individual sessions with other Committee 
members and meets informally, and has open lines of 
communication, with the Group Finance Director, Head of 
internal audit and the senior engagement team from the 
external auditors. This group generally meets ahead of each 
full Committee meeting to prepare and identify key areas 
for consideration by the Committee. 
The Committee works to a structured programme of 
activities with agenda items focused to coincide with key 
events of the annual financial reporting cycle, themes or 
areas of risk that the Committee has identified, together 
with standing items that the Committee is required to 
consider regularly under its terms of reference. Reports 
are provided by management, internal audit, and external 
audit, addressing the key risks and reporting matters faced 
by the Group. Following each meeting the Committee 
communicates its main discussion points and findings to the 
Board. 
In addition to formal meetings, from time to time, 
Committee members have informal briefings on topics 
relevant to the Committee’s work from members of the 
operational and financial management teams and external 
auditor.   
In reviewing the various topics on its agenda the Committee 
members receive input from management, internal 
audit and external audit as appropriate. Committee 
members draw upon this and their own experience to 
provide a constructive challenge to the judgements made 
by management and consider alternative scenarios or 
accounting treatments in reaching their conclusions. 
What is our role?
The role of the Committee includes to:
● ● monitor the integrity of the published financial 
information of the Company;
● ● review and report to the Board on the significant 
financial reporting issues and judgements made in 
connection with the preparation of the published 
financial information of the Company (having 
regard to matters communicated by the auditor);
● ● review the consistency of, ongoing appropriateness 
of, and changes to, accounting policies, consider the 
methods used to account for significant or unusual 
transactions;
● ● review the effectiveness of the internal control and 
risk management processes;
● ● review the Group’s whistleblowing process for 
employees;
● ● review and approve the internal audit plan;
● ● monitor and review the effectiveness and 
independence of the internal audit function;
● ● monitor and review the effectiveness of 
management in addressing internal and external 
audit actions;
● ● review the quality and effectiveness of the external 
audit and the procedures and controls designed to 
ensure auditor independence; 
● ● consider and make recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment, reappointment, 
replacement, and remuneration of the Company’s 
external auditor; and
● ● where requested by the Board, provide advice on 
whether the annual report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

What we focused on in 2013
In planning its own agenda, and reviewing the audit plan 
of the internal and external auditor , the Committee takes 
account of significant issues and risks, both operational 
and financial, likely to impact on the Company’s financial 
statements. The Committee also addresses specific queries 
referred to it by the Board or Remuneration Committee. In 
2013, the Remuneration Committee asked the Committee 
to report by exception on significant unusual or non-
recurring transactions which came to its attention and the 
effect of which the Remuneration Committee may wish to 
consider in connection with its assessment of remuneration. 
An annual review of the performance of the Committee 
was conducted for the year . In addition to feedback from 
members of the Committee, input was sought from the 
Group Finance Director, KPMG, internal audit and the 
Chairman of the Board. Overall, the review concluded that 
the Committee is responding appropriately to its terms of 
reference and will continue to develop its role. 
Below is a summary of some of the more significant risks 
and issues discussed in the year by the Committee. 
During 2013 there were no topics where there was 
significant disagreement between management, our 
external auditor and the Committee or unresolved issues 
which needed to be referred to the Board.
Technology Risk 
As the Group has progressed through the strategy, the 
technology infrastructure supporting the business has 
evolved to support the rebalancing of the business 
opportunities from new revenue streams and the production 
business. Legacy systems supporting the existing business 
remain in place, while emerging technology has been 
adopted to support new opportunities. It is therefore 
important to have in place an effective technology 
governance framework that seeks to address the risks posed 
by the Group’s technology environment. The governance 
framework, which is reviewed by the Committee, seeks 
to identify and manage key risks and provide oversight 
and methodologies around governing change and major 
projects. 
In 2012 reviews by internal and external audit highlighted 
a number of opportunities to improve the governance of 
our core systems. The Committee and management agreed 
a set of actions and a workplan to address these, most 
of which were completed by the end of 2013.  Work will 
continue to finalise remaining actions which will be kept 
under review by the Committee and internal and external 
audit.
The Group has a technology governance and assurance team 
who ensure a coordinated approach is in place to mitigate 
the risks faced in technology. In 2013 two key high risk areas 
were reviewed by the Committee:
● ● As part of a wider end-to-end review of the broadcast 
transmission infrastructure (including interaction 
with third party outsource providers), the incident 
management and governance processes were 
revisited, and a number of changes were agreed for 
implementation. 
● ● There has been significant media coverage of the recent 
increase in attacks on corporate infrastructure. Examples 
of such issues include the loss of customer data due to 
hacking and the disruption of corporate social media 
feeds. In response to these cyber security threats, 
the Committee discussed management’s assurance 
plans around information security and technology 
infrastructure.
Financial Reporting
As part of the Committee’s review of the interim and year-
end financial statements, the following were discussed:
Complex discrete transactions in the year
The Group completed certain transactions during the period 
which were outside the normal course of business. The 
Committee carefully reviewed these one-off transactions 
to ensure that the judgements applied by management 
were reasonable and any complex accounting guidance 
followed correctly. The topics discussed in the year 
covered acquisitions, debt settlements and large property 
acquisitions. 
Acquisition accounting (see note 3.4 for details of 
acquisitions): following the acquisition of four businesses 
during the year , the Committee debated the accounting 
for the key areas of judgement: the determination of 
whether ITV has control of the entity and should therefore 
consolidate its accounts in the Group’s accounts, the 
presentation of performance-related contingent payments 
or earn-out costs in the income statement, and determining 
the fair values of the net assets acquired:
● ● Control: this was particularly relevant for acquisitions that 
were structured so that the Group acquired a majority 
equity interest in a company, but less than 100%. The 
Committee debated ITV’s majority representation, 
control of budgets and decision-making power on the 
new boards and concluded that the Group does control 
each of the businesses acquired.  
● ● Performance-related consideration and earnouts: the 
Group’s acquisitions include an amount which is payable

Audit Committee Report continued
based on future performance of the business. Structuring 
the acquisition this way helps manage risks in terms 
of initial capital outlay and creates a joint incentive 
between ITV and the previous owners to grow the 
business. This is a feature that is common for acquisitions 
in the creative industry. Where the payment is also 
linked to employment, IFRS requires it to be accrued 
as a remuneration operating cost over the period to 
payment. The Committee debated the presentation of 
the transaction and concluded that these costs are linked 
to a capital transaction and their size and nature warrants 
them being excluded from underlying earnings (adjusted 
profit). Once acquired and the earnout period has been 
completed, operational salary and bonuses payable to the 
sellers are treated as part of operating costs.
● ● Intangibles: the Committee reviewed the results of 
the exercise to allocate the purchase price between 
intangible assets and goodwill and agreed with 
management’s allocation.
Debt settlements: as part of management’s continued 
efforts to improve the balance sheet and remove remaining 
expensive debt, the Group repurchased significant debt 
in the year . Accounting for these repurchases, though 
complex, required little judgement. However, due to the 
significant loss of £61 million the Committee sought 
to ensure the accounting standards had been applied 
correctly. The Committee considered the source of the 
inputs management used in calculating the amount of loss 
to be recognised and concluded that the accounting was 
appropriate. 
Acquisition of the London Television Centre: the Group 
acquired its headquarters in January. The Committee 
discussed the analysis undertaken by management to 
allocate the purchase price between the value of the land 
and building, which is required by the new accounting 
standard on fair value measurements. Real estate 
consultants were engaged to provide an estimate of the 
land value. The Committee considered the results of the 
exercise and agreed with management’s allocation  
(see note 3.2). 
Recurring transactions in the year
There are a number of areas where the Group transacts 
as part of its business as usual. However, these areas may 
require the application of judgement by management or 
have underlying complexity that should be considered on an 
ongoing basis by the Committee. Consequently, the topics 
noted below are regularly reviewed by the Committee:
Revenue: every year the Committee considers 
management’s assessment of the Group’s internal controls 
framework, which includes control over revenue. The Group’s 
processes and controls around existing revenue streams, 
such as NAR and Studios revenues, have remained consistent 
and effective during the year .
As new revenue streams emerge – which has been seen in 
areas such as the Online, Pay & Interactive business – the 
Committee reviews policies adopted by management 
to recognise revenue and considers the related controls. 
The policies and controls adopted in 2013 are consistent 
with prior years and are considered appropriate by the 
Committee. No changes have occurred during the year .
Deal debt: deal debt is where management provides for 
over/under delivery of advertising value to agencies. The 
Committee reviews management’s approach and method of 
determining the provision required and ensures consistency 
is applied in estimating inputs. The Committee is satisfied 
that the provision has been calculated on a consistent basis 
with prior years.
Royalty accruals: the Group is required to make royalty 
payments for content broadcast and distributed. Such 
payments are in accordance with individual contracts, 
and the large variety of terms results in a complex and 
manual process. As part of the agreed 2013 plan, internal 
audit reviewed the controls around the royalty accrual 
process without significant finding. As with previous years, 
the Committee considered the estimated accrual to be 
reasonable. 
Pension accounting: the Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme is a significant liability on the Group’s balance sheet 
(see note 3.7) and the value of the scheme will fluctuate 
due to changes in underlying assumptions. The main 
assumptions which drive these fluctuations include the 
forecast bond yield rates and the forecast inflation rate. A 
particular feature affecting 2013 has been the valuation of 
a longevity swap. A recent change to IFRS has required the 
swap to be recorded at fair value on a different basis from 
the best estimate of value on which the swap was previously 
recorded. The Committee considered both the process 
management undertook to finalise the assumptions, and 
how these assumptions benchmark against the market. In 
particular , because of the size of the valuation adjustment to 
the longevity swap of £95 million, the Committee confirmed 
the changes in IFRS had been appropriately applied with 
our auditors and the sources of information on which the 
recorded valuation was based. The Committee concluded 
that that the process was robust and the resulting 
calculation appropriately balanced.

Tax: the Group recognises certain provisions and accruals 
in respect of tax. The Committee debates the nature and 
key risks which give rise to corporate tax, payroll and VAT 
issues, and discusses the activities management undertake 
to resolve the matters that give rise to such provisions. 
Where support from our tax advisers is received, the results 
and views of their work are also reviewed. The Committee 
concluded that the provisions at the year-end were 
appropriate (see note 2.3).
Risk Management
The Committee continued to consider the process for 
managing risk within the business. 
Every year the Board and senior management review and 
challenge the Group’s High Impact Low Likelihood (HILL) 
risks, and the strategic risks. Each risk is assigned an owner 
and has a series of mitigating actions identified. An updated 
list of risks is included within the Strategic Report on pages 
53 to 55.
For each HILL risk the Committee reviewed the Group’s 
current level of exposure and considered the appropriateness 
of the mitigating actions being taken by management. 
The Committee also considered management’s response to 
each strategic risk, including the level of assurance provided 
around the risk and how the risk is tracked using key risk 
indicators. With regard to process risks the Committee 
reviewed how effective management was in addressing the 
findings of internal and external audit, as well as the method 
by which management accepted process risks. 
The Committee was comfortable with the processes in place 
for risk management, that the internal audit plan for 2014 
was aligned to the highlighted risks and with those process 
risks that have been accepted.

section on page 52
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
systems of internal control and for regularly reviewing the 
effectiveness of those systems. The Committee assists the 
Board in reviewing the Group’s systems of internal control.  
The primary responsibility for the operation of these 
systems is delegated to management. Such systems can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. Key control procedures are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and can be 
summarised as follows:
● ● Strategy and financial reporting: the strategy is 
reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group performs 
a comprehensive annual strategy review and five year 
financial planning exercise. The five-year plan feeds into 
the annual budget cycle. The Executive Directors review 
formal forecasts, detailed budgets, strategies and action 
plans and the Board approves the overall Group budget as 
part of its normal responsibilities. The results of operating 
units are reported monthly , along with an update of the 
Group’s performance against strategic KPIs and cash. 
Actual results are compared to budget and forecasts, and 
key trends and variances are explained and analysed.
● ● Organisational structure and authorisation procedures: 
the Group has an established organisational structure 
with clearly stated lines of responsibility, approval levels 
and delegated authorities.
● ● Risk assessment and management: management is 
responsible for identifying the risks facing the business 
and for establishing controls and procedures to monitor 
and mitigate those risks.
The Board is responsible for establishing a robust risk 
management process and for regularly reviewing the 
identified risks. The Committee keeps the effectiveness 
of the process under regular review. 
● ● Control environment: financial controls, policies, and 
procedures are considered as part of the Group’s ongoing 
risk assessment process. These controls are reviewed 
to ensure risks are identified and the processes and 
procedures are in accordance with and aligned to the 
strategy. The internal audit team provides objective 
assurance as to the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal control and risk management, reporting to 
both the Management Board and the Committee.
● ● Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of 
internal controls: controls are monitored by senior 
management, internal audit and the Committee.  
Remedial plans are put in place where controls are weak 
or there are opportunities for improvement. Serious 
control weaknesses (if any) are reported to the Board and 
actions taken as appropriate.
● ● Data analytics: during the year the Group implemented a 
suite of automated analytics tests that enables the Group 
to continuously highlight exceptions from the norm 
over its transactional financial data. Going forward, this 
will make the control environment stronger and more

Audit Committee Report continued
Our auditors 
Internal auditor
The Group’s internal audit activity is outsourced to Deloitte 
who report directly to the Committee. The Committee keeps 
under review the internal audit relationship with Deloitte 
and the procedures to ensure appropriate independence of 
the internal audit function is maintained. In particular, the 
Committee has approved guidelines in relation to other 
advisory and consultancy work that Deloitte may undertake 
for the Company, which adheres to the underlying principle 
that they cannot implement controls that they audit. 
During the year Deloitte provided the Group with advice 
on remuneration policy and the external remuneration 
environment. Other services included tax and corporate 
finance advice. 
The effectiveness of internal audit is assessed over the year 
using a number of measures which include (but are not 
limited to):
● ● an evaluation of each audit assignment completed using 
feedback from the part of the business that has been 
audited; and
● ● a high level annual review that is completed by obtaining 
feedback from senior management in each division.
At the start of the year the Committee considered and 
approved the internal audit plan, which included audits 
across the Group as well as assurance over live projects. 
During the year the Committee reviewed findings from 
these internal audit reports, the actions taken to implement 
the recommendations made in the reports and the status of 
progress against previously agreed actions. All internal audit 
reports are available to the Committee as required. 
External auditor
Auditor engagement
Throughout the year the Committee receives reports from 
the auditors on their plans and the progress and results of 
their work.
The Committee considers carefully the scope of planned 
work and the assessment of risk and materiality on which it 
is based. In particular the Committee reviews the audit fee 
arrangements to ensure that there is an appropriate balance 
between the scope of work and the cost of assurance. The 
Committee’s aim is to support a robust and effective audit 
and strong reporting lines to the Committee. 
In 2012 the Committee conducted a tender process for 
external audit services, the main outcome of which was the 
reappointment of KPMG, and a plan for the development of 
the external audit approach over a two to three year period.
The principal planned changes agreed were that:
● ● the scope of the external audit will consider 
developments in certain areas of the business earlier than 
otherwise might have been considered necessary on a 
traditional assessment of financial materiality, such as 
certain online revenues and controls over and at smaller 
overseas acquisitions ; and
● ● the data analytics implemented by management as part 
of the internal control initiatives will allow for all year 
round routine audit tests through exception reporting, 
making the control environment both stronger and more 
efficient. Further , the embedded technology will support 
internal and external audit’s systems evaluation and 
testing.
The Committee continues to monitor the implementation of 
these changes. 
Auditor effectiveness
Audit quality is reviewed throughout the year with the focus 
on: strong audit governance; the firm’s methodology and 
its effective application to ITV; robustness of challenges and 
findings on areas which require management judgement; 
and the quality of the senior members of the audit team. 
In particular , the effectiveness of the audit is assessed over 
the year using a number of measures including (but not 
limited to):
● ● reviewing the quality and scope of planning of the audit 
and its responsiveness to changes in our business;
● ● implementation of planned improvements identified in 
the audit tender process;
● ● monitoring the independence and transparency of the 
audit;
● ● reviewing the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review (AQR) reports for KPMG and other audit firms; and
● ● seeking feedback from KPMG on any external or internal 
quality review of our audit.
At the conclusion of each year’s audit the Committee 
performs a specific evaluation of the performance of 
the external auditor . This is supported by the results of 
questionnaires completed by the Executive Directors and 
relevant senior management, both finance and non-finance, 
covering areas such as quality of audit team, business 
understanding, audit approach and management. Where 
appropriate, actions are agreed against the points raised 
and subsequently monitored for progress. There were no 
significant findings from the evaluation this year and the 
Committee considers the external audit to have been robust 
and effective.

Independence, objectivity and fees
The Committee seeks to ensure the objectivity and 
independence of our auditors through:
● ● focus on the assignment and rotation of key personnel; 
● ● the adequacy of audit resource; and 
● ● policies in relation to non-audit work.
The senior audit partner serves no more than five years 
continuously and the independent review partner serves 
no more than seven years continuously. Other key partners 
serve for no longer than seven consecutive years. The 
Committee monitors the tenure of partners and senior staff 
as well as former employees working for the Company. The 
appointment by the Company of former senior employees 
of the external auditor would require approval of the 
Committee.
The Committee regularly monitors the other services 
being provided to the Group by its external auditor, and has 
developed a formal policy to ensure this does not impair 
their independence or objectivity. The policy is based on 
the five key principles which underpin the provision of other 
services by the external auditor . These are that the auditor 
may not provide a service which:
● ● places them in a position to audit their own work;
● ● creates a mutuality of interest;
● ● results in the auditor developing close personal 
relationships with ITV employees;
● ● results in the auditor functioning as a manager or 
employee of ITV; or
● ● puts the auditor in the role of advocate for ITV.
The policy is reviewed annually and is available in full on our 
website. 
www.itvplc.com/about/governance
Other than in exceptional circumstances management and 
the Committee do not expect non-audit fees to be in excess 
of fees for audit and audit related services. The non-audit 
fees for 2013 were half that of the audit fees. A report on the 
level of non-audit work provided by the auditor is given to 
the Committee half yearly. No changes have been made to 
the policy during the year .
Details of the related audit and other services are set out in note 
2.1 on page 123
The significant non-audit engagements related to VAT and 
corporate tax services, including tax advice. Significant 
engagements require the prior approval of the Chairman of 
the Committee.
Reappointment
During the year the Committee considered the performance 
and audit fees of the external auditor , and the level of non-
audit work undertaken, and recommended to the Board 
that a resolution for the reappointment of KPMG Audit Plc 
for a further year as the Company’s auditor be proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM in May 2013. The resolution was 
passed and KPMG Audit Plc was reappointed for a further 
year.
KPMG has instigated an orderly wind-down of KPMG Audit 
Plc as a result of an internal reorganisation and requested 
that going forward the audit is instead undertaken by KPMG 
LLP (an intermediate parent of KPMG Audit Plc). KPMG Audit 
Plc will not therefore be seeking re-appointment as auditor 
of the Company and in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006, a resolution proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP 
as our auditor will be put to the 2014 AGM.

“Rewarding the Executive 
Directors for continuing 
to deliver strong business 
performance and shareholder 
value is key to ITV’s continued 
success.” 
Dear Shareholder,
On the following pages we set out the Remuneration Report 
for 2013. Our report looks quite different this year as we are 
required for the first time to comply with new UK regulations 
on the disclosure of directors’ remuneration.
Remuneration review
During 2013 we undertook an extensive review of our 
approach to remunerating Executive Directors. As a result 
of this review we will be asking our shareholders to support 
three resolutions on executive remuneration matters at our 
AGM in May 2014:
● ● We will be seeking shareholder approval for a new Long 
Term Incentive Plan (new L TIP).
● ● We will be asking our shareholders to formally approve 
our remuneration policy for the first time.
● ● We will be holding an advisory vote on our Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
We have consulted extensively with our major shareholders 
on these proposals and where appropriate their comments 
have been reflected.
Objectives for the remuneration review
The principal objective of the review was to ensure that the 
remuneration framework remains aligned with the strategy 
of the business as ITV moves into the next phase. 
The current remuneration arrangements were put in place 
for 2011 when the Board set out to build a top calibre, highly 
motivated team to lead the renewal of ITV and have strongly 
supported the strategy over this time. Performance has 
been outstanding and delivered real value to shareholders 
over the period to 31 December 2013, including:
Remuneration Report
In this report . . . 
The purpose of this report is to set out for shareholders the principles and policy we apply to remuneration for our 
Executive Directors and to update you on how we have applied these for the financial year ended 31 December 2013.  
The report also aims to demonstrate how our remuneration policy is aligned to our strategy, supports the retention of 
the Executive Directors and rewards them for outperformance.
This report is subject for the first time to amended legislation on remuneration and we will be asking our shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM to approve our:
● ● Remuneration policy as set out on pages 85 to 92. This will be a binding vote.
● ● Annual Report on Remuneration as set out on pages 93 to 101. This will be an advisory vote.
We would encourage our shareholders to provide us with feedback if they feel we could provide more clarity in our 
reporting.

● ● Share price growth of 177% (around 40% per annum).
● ● £5. 1 billion of additional value to shareholders.
● ● Significant outperformance of the FTSE 250 and  
FTSE 100.
The Committee wants to ensure that the remuneration 
framework continues to incentivise and reward strong 
business performance and shareholder value during the next 
phase of the strategy, and acts as a retention tool to retain 
the key management team that has delivered outstanding 
performance to date.
Summary of the key changes 
The adjustments to remuneration strategy include the 
following elements:
● ● Simple to understand – We heard that going forward 
shareholders wanted us to adopt a simpler approach 
to remuneration. We have therefore removed the link 
between the voluntary deferral of annual bonuses and 
long-term incentive award levels. 
● ● Performance measures aligned to the next phase of 
our business strategy – Our new L TIP will ensure that 
the continued delivery of our strategy is rewarded. 
We have amended the performance tests to reflect 
strategic challenges and align them more closely with the 
continuing evolution into a more balanced business. 
● ● Increased shareholding guidelines – We have increased 
the minimum shareholding requirements for our 
Executive Directors. The combination of executive 
shareholding requirements, deferred annual bonuses 
and share-based long-term incentives will strongly align 
executive incentives with shareholder value. 
● ● Longer holding periods – Reflecting the preference of the 
Committee and our shareholders, we are also introducing 
an additional two year holding period for awards under 
the new L TIP . This will be phased in over the next two 
award cycles. 
● ● Adjusted salaries to reflect the size and complexity of 
the Executive Director roles – Our remuneration policy 
for Executive Directors has been, and will continue to 
be, that salary increases will generally follow those 
of the wider employee population. This approach has 
been adopted since their appointment. During that 
time the shape and size of the business has changed 
significantly and performance has been strong. We have 
therefore increased base salaries to reflect increased 
responsibilities, performance, marketability and the 
challenges ahead. Following these increases it is our 
intention to return to normal policy in 2015.  We have 
also increased pension allowances in the year to reflect 
the levels of pension provision provided to Executive 
Directors in comparable organisations.
● ● Provide market competitive levels of remuneration 
comparative to performance – We are proposing to 
increase long-term incentive opportunities to levels that 
reflect the current size and challenge of the Executive 
Director roles, the level of performance delivered and the 
current size of the Company. 
● ● Performance targets set at stretching levels to reflect 
business outlook – Performance target ranges will 
continue to be set at levels that reward strong business 
performance. The level of vesting for threshold 
performance has been reduced, reflecting the increased 
award levels.  When considering performance outcomes 
the Committee will look beyond formulaic results to 
ensure the outcomes align with the overall business 
performance.
The Committee has been thoughtful about the combined 
value of all of the proposed changes, as well as the individual 
elements. In summary, the overall remuneration packages 
are intended to support the retention of the Executive 
Directors in the business and to reward them for continuing 
to deliver strong business performance and shareholder 
value.
The increase in total remuneration for the Chief Executive 
from 2012 to 2013 results from the vesting of his joining 
award in 2013, together with the first vesting under a PSP 
award since he joined ITV. The level of vesting of both 
awards reflects the outstanding performance to date and a 
significant increase in share price. 
Further details are provided in our remuneration policy.
The Committee initiates dialogue with major shareholders 
where developments or changes are proposed and 
welcomes feedback at other times.
We look forward to receiving your support for all three 
resolutions at our forthcoming AGM.

Directors. The current members are:
● ● Andy Haste (Chairman) 
● ● Archie Norman 
● ● John Ormerod
Mike Clasper stepped down from the Board and as member of the Committee on 
31 December 2013.

How the Committee works
What is our role?
The role of the Committee is primarily to:
● ● review the ongoing appropriateness, relevance and 
effectiveness of the Group remuneration policy including 
in relation to retention and development;
● ● approve the remuneration policy and strategy for the 
Executive Directors, Management Board and other senior 
executives (together the Senior Executive Group);
● ● approve the design of the Company’s annual bonus 
arrangements and long-term incentive plans, including 
the performance targets that apply for the Senior 
Executive Group; and
● ● determine the award levels for the Senior Executive 
Group based on performance against annual bonus 
targets and long-term incentive conditions.
Principles considered when setting remuneration
The Company operates in the particularly competitive media 
market. We aim to balance the need to attract and retain 
high quality talent essential to the Company’s success with 
the need to be cost-effective and to reward exceptional 
performance. The Committee has developed a remuneration 
policy for the Company which balances these factors, while 
taking into account the prevailing best practice and a fair 
outcome for investors.
A significant proportion of the remuneration package is tied 
to the achievement of stretching performance conditions 
which align remuneration with our strategy to deliver 
strong business performance and create shareholder value. 
Individuals should be rewarded for success and performance 
measured over clear timescales. The remuneration package 
is focused on rewarding sustained long-term performance 
and aligning executives with the shareholder experience.
What we did in 2013?
In addition to the remuneration review described in the 
Chairman’s letter, during 2013 our work was broadly in four 
areas:
Setting targets
● ● setting the business and personal performance targets 
for 2013 annual bonuses aligned with the business plan 
for the year;
● ● setting the performance targets that would apply to the 
ITV Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards made in 2013; 
and
● ● carrying out a preliminary review of annual bonus targets 
for 2014.
Reviewing outcomes
● ● reviewing the annual bonus outcomes and award levels 
for 2012 and indicative 2013 outcomes ahead of final 
approval in 2014; and
● ● approving the performance outcomes of the 2010 awards 
under the PSP , including the awards made on recruitment 
to Adam Crozier .
Reward framework
● ● agreeing the base salaries for the Senior Executive Group 
with effect from 1 January 2013 using the same process 
as applied to the wider employee population;
● ● reviewing the pension allowances provided to Executive 
Directors;
● ● agreeing the remuneration packages for new 
appointments to the Senior Executive Group and the 
arrangements for any leavers from this group; and
● ● agreeing a new remuneration framework and new L TIP as 
set out in the Chairman’s letter.
Governance
● ● considering the final BIS regulations on executive pay and 
how these will be integrated into the future remuneration 
strategy; and
● ● agreeing the Remuneration Report for 2012, prior to its 
approval by the Board, and approval by shareholders at 
the AGM in May 2013.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its work.
An annual review of the performance of the Committee 
was conducted. Feedback was also sought from the Chief 
Executive, Group HR Director and Deloitte. Overall the review 
concluded that the Committee is responding appropriately 
to its terms of reference and will continue to develop its role.

strategy.
The element compulsorily 
deferred into shares 
rewards delivery of 
sustained long-term 
performance, provides 
alignment with the 
shareholder experience 
and supports the 
retention of executives.
Measures and targets 
are set annually based 
on business plans at the 
start of the financial 
year and pay-out levels 
are determined by the 
Committee following 
the year end based on 
performance against 
objectives.

been audited. Annual bonus 
calculations that are based 
on the financial results for 
the year are audited by 
Internal Audit and reviewed 
by the Audit Committee 
before consideration by the 
Committee.
The Committee has the 
discretion to amend the 
bonus pay-out should any 
formulaic assessment of 
performance not reflect 
a balanced view of overall 
business performance for 
the year .
Two-thirds of the bonus is 
delivered in cash and one-
third is deferred into shares 
under the DSA for a period 
of three years. 
During the deferral period 
share awards may be 
reduced or cancelled in 
certain circumstances. 
Further detail is provided 
on page 88.
Dividends are paid to 
participants on the 
deferred shares during the 
deferral period.
The maximum bonus opportunity 
for any Executive Director will not 
exceed 200% of salary.
The current bonus opportunities 
are 180% of salary for Adam

Increases above the current 
opportunities, up to the 
maximum limit, may be made 
to take account of individual 
circumstances, which may include:
● ● Increase in size or scope of the 
role or responsibility.
● ● Increase to reflect the 
individual’s development and 
performance in their role.
Performance 
measures and 
targets are set by 
the Committee 
each year based on 
corporate objectives 
closely linked to the 
strategic priorities 
and individual 
contributions.
The majority of the 
bonus opportunity 
will be based on 
the corporate and 
financial measures.

bonus will be based 
on performance 
against individual 
objectives.
Up to 20% of 
the maximum 
opportunity will be 
received for threshold 
performance.

Acts as a retention tool 
to retain the executives 
required to deliver the 
business strategy. 
Awards are made under 
the L TIP rules, which 
shareholders have been 
asked to approve at the 
2014 AGM.
Awards are made annually 
with vesting dependent 
on business performance 
during the performance 
period. The performance 
period will be three years, 
other than in exceptional 
circumstances. 
The Committee has 
discretion to amend the 
final vesting level should 
any formulaic assessment 
of performance not reflect 
a balanced view of the 
business performance 
during the performance 
period.
Awards will be required to 
be held for an additional 
period of two years after 
the end of the performance 
period. This is called the 
holding period and will be 
phased in during 2014 and 
2015.
Dividends are earned on 
deferred shares during the 
holding period.
During the holding period 
awards may be reduced 
or cancelled in certain 
circumstances. Further 
detail is provided on page

Our current operational policy is 
to make awards of 225% of salary 
each year . 
Under the new L TIP rules, the 
maximum annual award that may 
be granted in any financial year is 
350% of salary.
The Committee would consult 
with shareholders if it was 
considering increasing awards 
above the current operational 
policy.
Performance is 
measured against 
corporate targets 
closely linked to 
the Company’s 
financial and strategic 
priorities.
Performance metrics 
are:
● ● Adjusted EPS
● ● Non-NAR and its 
components
● ● Viewing 
performance
For details on 2014 
targets see page 99.
L TIP awards will vest 
based on financial 
performance. 
A gateway condition 
must be achieved 
before any portion of 
the award vests. 
Each performance 
metric will operate 
independently.
The performance 
range will be 
determined for 
each metric. The 
proportion of each 
element of the 
award that will 
vest for threshold 
performance against 
a metric will be 20%.
SAYE Provides all employees, 
including Executive 
Directors the opportunity 
to voluntarily invest in 
Company shares. 
Executive Directors are 
entitled to participate in 
the plan on the same basis 
as other employees.
Participation limits are as per the 
rules of the plan and in accordance 
with HMRC limits.
None
Should the Company choose to implement a tax efficient all-employee share participation plan (for example a SIP) the 
Executive Directors would be eligible to participate in accordance with any shareholder approved plan rules and HMRC limits.

Malus is the possible reduction of deferred awards and clawback is the possible recovery of awards that have already 
been made to executives. Deferred awards under the DSA and awards under the new L TIP or PSP , including awards held 
during any additional holding period, may be reduced or cancelled at the Committee’s discretion in such cases as material 
misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud. 
Performance measures and target setting
The annual bonus is assessed against both financial and individual targets determined by the Committee. This enables the 
Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific 
financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each director , which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the 
business.
The Committee sets targets for the long-term incentive plans taking into account external forecasts, internal budgets and 
business priorities. Targets are set to be appropriately stretching in this context with maximum performance being set at a 
level which is considered to be the delivery of exceptional performance.
When considering performance outcomes the Committee will look beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align 
with the overall business performance.

Non-executive Directors
The table below summarises the main elements of remuneration for Non-executive Directors:
Component Approach of the Company
Chairman fees The Committee determines the fees of the Chairman and sets the fees at a level that is considered to be 
appropriate, taking into account the size and complexity of the business and the expected time commitment 
and contribution of the role.
The fee is a fixed annual fee of which 25% (40% for the current Chairman) after statutory deductions, is used 
to acquire shares in the Company. The shares are purchased quarterly and held by a nominee until retirement 
from the Board.
Non-executive fees The Board determines the fees of the Non-executive Directors and sets the fees at a level that is considered 
to be appropriate, taking into account the size and complexity of the business and the expected time 
commitment and contribution of the role.
Fees are structured as a basic fee with additional fees payable for membership and/or chairmanship of a 
committee or other additional responsibilities.
The Non-executive Directors are required to use 25% of their annual fees, after statutory deductions, to 
acquire shares in the Company. The shares are purchased quarterly and held by a nominee on their behalf until 
they retire from the Board. 
Benefits Additional benefits may also be provided in certain circumstances, if required for business purposes.
Application of remuneration policy
The chart below provides an indication of the level of remuneration that would be received by each Executive Director under 
the following three assumed performance scenarios:

Recruitment remuneration
When agreeing the components of a remuneration package for a new Executive Director , the Committee will apply the 
principles detailed below. 
The package will be competitive to attract and retain the best candidate for the job.
Where possible, the Committee will always seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy outlined 
above. However , where appropriate, elements of the package may be outside of this policy to meet the circumstances of the 
individual upon recruitment.  The Committee will ensure that the arrangements are in the best interests of both ITV and its 
shareholders and remain subject to the overall variable pay limits set out below.  
Ongoing remuneration In determining an appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into 
account all relevant factors to ensure they are able to recruit the best candidate for the job and that 
the arrangements are in the best interests of both ITV and its shareholders. The Committee will 
typically seek to align the ongoing remuneration package with the ongoing remuneration policy 
outlined in the table on pages 85 to 87. 
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted to a new director upon 
appointment (excluding any buy-out awards for forfeited remuneration) will not be greater than 
550% of salary (the sum of the maximum bonus and maximum new L TIP opportunities).
Buy-out awards for forfeited 
remuneration
The Committee may make awards to ‘buy out’ a candidate’s remuneration arrangements that are 
forfeited as a result of leaving their previous employer . 
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance 
conditions attaching to forfeited awards, the likelihood of the awards vesting and the form and 
timing of the awards. The Committee will typically seek to make buy-out awards on a comparable 
basis to those that have been forfeited. 
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may grant a buy-out award under a structure not 
included in the policy but that is consistent with the principles set out above. 
The Committee will take all relevant factors into account (including the candidate’s location, the calibre of the individual, 
external influences, internal relativities and the overall business context) when determining the new remuneration package 
and seek to ensure that no more is paid than necessary. 
In the Remuneration Report following the appointment, the Committee will fully explain to shareholders the remuneration 
package for the appointed individual and the rationale for such arrangements and will display such information on the ITV 
plc website and announce via a regulatory information service as soon as practicable following the appointment.
Service contracts and loss of office
Executive Directors
Executive Directors have rolling service contracts that provide for 12 months’ notice on either side. There are no special 
provisions that apply in the event of a change of control.
A payment in lieu of notice, including base salary, contractual benefits and contractual provision for an income in retirement 
may be made if:
● ● the Company terminates the employment of the executive with immediate effect, or without due notice; or
● ● termination is agreed by mutual consent.
The Company may also make a payment in respect of outplacement costs, legal fees and the cost of any settlement 
agreement where appropriate.

With the exception of termination for cause or resignation, Executive Directors will be eligible for a bonus award prorated 
to reflect the proportion of the financial year for which they were employed and subject to performance achieved, provided 
they have a minimum of three months’ service in the bonus year.

Non-executive Directors
Each Non-executive Director, including the Chairman, has a contract of service with the Company. Non-executive Directors 
will serve for an initial term of three years, subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders, unless otherwise 
terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon one month’s written notice (12 month’s for the current 
Chairman).
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
External appointments
With specific approval of the Board, Executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies and retain any related fees paid to them.
Adam Crozier is currently a non-executive director of G4S plc.
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
When setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions of 
employees elsewhere in the Company.
The Company does not consult directly with employees in respect of determining the Directors’ remuneration policy. 
However , the Committee does receive general feedback from employees via the HR function as part of the output from the 
employee engagement survey and receives a report on employment practices elsewhere in the Company.
Shareholder views
The Committee maintains regular and transparent communication with shareholders. We believe that it is important to 
regularly meet with our key shareholders to understand their views on our remuneration arrangements and what they would 
like to see going forward. We welcome feedback from shareholders at any time during the year .
Where we are proposing to make any significant changes to the remuneration framework we seek major shareholders’ views 
and take these into account when determining any changes to the remuneration policy.

The increase in total remuneration for the Chief Executive from 2012 to 2013 results from the vesting of his joining award in 
2013, together with the first vesting under a PSP award since he joined ITV. The level of vesting of both awards reflects the 
outstanding performance to date and a significant increase in share price. 
Further information in relation to each of the elements of remuneration set out in the table above are detailed below.
Salary
Executive Directors’ base salaries were increased by 2.75% with effect from 1 January 2013 in line with the average increase 
given across the Company.
Taxable benefits
The benefits provided to the Executive Directors include the cost of private medical insurance and car related benefits.
Bonus (cash and shares)

Annual incentives are provided to Executive Directors through the bonus with one-third of any award deferred into shares 
under the DSA. The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are closely linked to 
the Company’s corporate, financial and strategic priorities.
The Committee set 2013 performance targets and measures which continue to support both the delivery of the strategy 
and key operational outcomes.
The majority of the bonus (60%) was based upon the achievement of corporate and financial targets. 
The remainder of the bonus (40%) was based upon the contribution the executive makes to the overall strategy through 
the delivery of specific targets. The personal targets include a combination of specific financial metrics and key strategic 
deliverables. 
The Committee ensured that the maximum bonus opportunity could only be achieved for significant outperformance of 
all corporate, financial and individual bonus outcomes, with target performance achieving a 60% payout of the maximum 
bonus opportunity.

The new regulations require us to show awards in the remuneration table above according to the year in which the 
performance period for each performance condition came to an end.
As  a result, where an award has more than one performance condition, it may be split across two years within the

Deloitte LLP have been appointed by the Committee after consultation with the Board as an independent adviser on 
remuneration policy and the external remuneration environment. During the year they provided advice on benchmarking, 
shareholder consultation and new long-term incentive arrangements. Total fees for the advice provided to the Committee 
during the year amounted to £131,000.
Deloitte are a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and are signatories to the Code of Conduct in 
relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK. During the year Deloitte also provided the Group with advice 
on tax, corporate finance and pensions matters, and acted on a consultancy basis to provide internal audit support under 
separate engagement terms.
The Committee has formally reviewed the work undertaken by Deloitte for the Committee and elsewhere in the Company 
and is satisfied that the advice they have received has been objective and independent.

Remuneration policy for 2014
The following provides details of how the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2014.
Salary
Executive Directors base salaries were increased with effect from 1 January 2014 as follows.
1 January 2014 
£000
1 January 2013 
£000 % Change
Adam Crozier 900 841 7.0
Ian Griffiths 550 461 19.3
Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors has been, and will continue to be, that salary increases will generally follow 
those of the wider employee population. This approach has been adopted since their appointment. During that time the 
shape and size of the business has changed significantly and performance has been strong. We have therefore increased 
base salaries to reflect increased responsibilities, performance, marketability and the challenges ahead. Following these 
increases it is our intention to return to normal policy in 2015. 
Taxable benefits, pension and bonus
These will be paid in line with the remuneration policy.
New LTIP awards 
Awards will be made in line with the remuneration policy under the new L TIP . The proposed performance measures and 
targets for awards to be made in 2014 are detailed below.  In order to ensure that Executive Directors are only rewarded if 
value is delivered to shareholders, awards will be subject to an initial cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to 
that required for threshold performance.  If this gateway is achieved, performance will then be assessed by reference to the 
conditions detailed below.
Performance measure Weightings Threshold Maximum
Cumulative adjusted EPS 50% 37.1 p 42.3 p
Family SOV 20% 23.05% 23.51%
Non-NAR 10% 5% growth pa 10% growth pa
   International Production revenue 10% 5% growth pa 15% growth pa
Online, Pay & Interactive revenue 10% 5% growth pa 18% growth pa
Threshold vesting for all targets is 20%. Vesting between threshold and maximum (100%) is on a straight line basis.
When assessing performance against the Family SOV target the Committee will also have regard to the health of the main ITV channel.
The target range for awards to be made in future years will be reviewed and set in the context of the operating environment at that time.
Chairman and Non-executive Director Fees
Non-executive Director fees were increased with effect from 1 January 2014 as set out below.

Directors’ share interests
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Executive Directors being shareholders so as to align their 
interests with other shareholders. Shareholding guidelines are in place, which encourage Executive Directors to build up a 
holding of ITV plc shares based on a percentage of base salary. 50% of the requirement must be obtained within three years 
of appointment and the remainder within five years as follows.
% of salary required under 
shareholding guidelines

Ian Griffiths 200 554
The guidelines were increased in 2014 from 200% of salary for Adam Crozier and 150% of salary for Ian Griffiths.  
Other members of the Management Board are required to hold between 50-100% of their salary in line with their individual 
bonus opportunity.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of ITV Plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 109 to 173. In our opinion:  
● ● the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of the Goup’s profit for the year then ended;  
● ● the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union;  
● ● the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and 
● ● the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows.  
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these significant risks is set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 75. 
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition and contractual arrangements  (see note 2.1)
The Group’s revenue consists primarily of advertising, programme 
production and programme rights.  
Net Advertising Revenue (‘NAR’) (£1,542 million)
The majority of ITV’s advertising revenue (‘NAR’) is subject to regulation 
under Ofcom’s Contract Rights Renewal system (‘CRR’). CRR works by 
ensuring that the annual share of TV advertising that will be placed 
with ITV by each advertising agency can change in relation to the 
viewing figures for commercial television that it delivers. The CRR 
system, the pricing of the annual contractual arrangements with 
advertising agencies and the details of each advertising campaign, 
together with the related processes and controls, are complex and 
involve estimation. 
In particular, the pricing mechanism means it is possible for a difference 
to arise between the price received by ITV for an advertising campaign 
and the value it delivered, mainly as a result of the actual viewing 
figures being different from the agreed level. Where the Group has 
over-delivered viewers this is referred to as a ‘deal credit’, or a ‘deal 
debt’ where delivery has fallen short. Rather than the price paid for that 
campaign being adjusted, these differences are noted for each agency 
and then taken account of when agreeing either future campaigns or 
the annual contract. Only a net deal debt position with an agency is 
recorded in ITV’s accounts, as a liability.  
NAR is therefore considered a significant risk due to:
● ● the quantum and complexity of contractual agreements with 
advertising agencies;
● ● the complexity of the systems and processes of control used to 
record revenue; and
● ● the level of estimation involved in determining the deal debt liability 
at the period end. 
Our audit procedures included: 
● ● testing of controls, assisted by our own IT specialists, 
including those over: input of individual campaigns’ terms 
and pricing, comparison of those terms and pricing data 
against the related overarching contracts with advertising 
agencies; linkage to transmission/viewer data; and 
segregation of duties;  
● ● testing management’s review controls over: contract 
approval; periodic deal reconciliations; and the deal debt 
adjustment;  
● ● analysis of revenue based on our industry knowledge and 
external market data, following up variances; and  
● ● challenging the year end deal debt adjustment based on 
comparison with customers’ correspondence and agreed 
terms of business.

The risk Our response
Other revenue streams (‘Non-NAR revenue’)  
(£847 million of external revenue)
Non-NAR revenue includes revenue from: programme production, the 
sale of programme rights, transmission supply arrangements and the 
Online, Pay & Interactive division within the Broadcast segment.  
Recognition of non-NAR revenue is primarily driven by the related 
contracts. It is considered to be a risk as the contracts can be 
complex and the terms are varied, with the result that accounting 
for the revenue generated in any given period can require individual 
consideration.
Our audit procedures included testing of controls over the 
timing of revenue recognition, and the accounting for new 
contractual arrangements. We considered the revenue policies 
against the relevant accounting standards. For the larger 
contracts entered into during the year , and for a statistical 
sample of all contracts, we tested whether revenue had been 
recognised in accordance with the contractual terms, given the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standard.
Acquisition accounting (see notes 3.3 and 3.4)
During the year , ITV acquired four production companies for an 
aggregate initial consideration of £66 million.  
Accounting for acquisitions requires the Group to determine the fair 
value of the consideration transferred, the non-controlling interests 
(‘NCI’) and the assets acquired as part of the acquisition.  
This requires the Group to make a number of judgements, which focus 
on, but are not limited to: assessment of the earnout arrangements 
entered into with selling shareholders (whether it is acquisition 
consideration or post-acquisition remuneration), assessing options 
granted to the Group over shares of the acquired business (whether the 
Group has a liability for the option price) and determining the fair value 
of the assets acquired.
In summary, acquisition accounting is considered to be a significant risk 
due to the level of judgement required to be applied over numerous 
assumptions in establishing the fair values of consideration transferred 
and acquired assets.
For each significant acquisition:
We critically assessed the treatment of earnout arrangements 
and options against the relevant accounting standards.
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in critically 
assessing the appropriateness of the identified intangibles 
against the criteria of the relevant accounting standards.  
Our audit procedures also included testing the principles and 
integrity of the asset valuation models used, comparison of the 
input assumptions to externally and internally derived data as 
well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as the 
likelihood of shows being recommissioned; and the impact of 
the loss of key talent on the forecasts.  
Defined benefit pension schemes  (£445 million, see note 3.7)
The valuation of the pensions liability requires significant judgement 
and estimation to be applied across numerous assumptions. 
Further, the application of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ in 2013 has 
led to a change in the valuation approach for the longevity swap, with 
the value of the swap increasing by £95 million in 2013.  
The key valuation assumptions are set out in note 3.7 in the ‘keeping 
it simple’ section on page 148. When deciding on these assumptions 
the Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to their 
appropriateness.    
The valuation is considered to be a significant risk as, given the 
quantum of the net deficit, small changes in the assumptions can have 
a material financial impact on the Group.
Our audit procedures included an assessment of the 
competency and objectivity of the actuarial specialists engaged 
by the Group. 
We compared the valuation methodology, in particular for the 
longevity swap, with relevant accounting standards and market 
practices.  
We also challenged the key assumptions supporting the 
retirement benefit obligation and swap valuations, with input 
from our own actuarial specialists. This included a comparison 
of the mortality, discount and inflation rates used against 
externally derived data.  
We obtained third party confirmation of the pension schemes 
assets as at 31 December 2013. 
We considered the appropriateness of the disclosures described 
in note 3.7.

The risk Our response
Royalty accruals (£71 million,  see note 3.1.5)
The Group pays royalties directly to artists/producers for all content 
used. The contractual terms of these agreements are varied and 
complex.
The related IT systems can only address part of the processing, 
necessitating a significant manual element in calculating the year end 
royalty accrual recorded by the Group. Overall the process is complex, 
though core to the Group’s operations. 
The volume and variety of contracts being interpreted and accounted 
for combined with the manual nature of the process increases the risk 
of error . 
Among other procedures, we tested controls over the recording 
of royalty costs and the approval of royalty payments.  
We also re-performed a sample of the year end calculations, 
agreeing key inputs to contracts and the underlying system 
data. 
In addition, we performed analytical procedures comparing 
royalty costs as a percentage of the related income streams 
to budgets and prior periods, taking account of any expected 
changes.   
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Our materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole has been determined 
with reference to:  
For 2013 our materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole was set at:
Consequently, corrected and uncorrected 
audit differences are explained to the Audit 
Committee.
Group profit before tax.
We consider this to be one of the principal 
considerations for members of the company 
in assessing the financial performance of the 
Group.
£21m
This represents 5% of Group profit before 
tax.
We explain audit differences with a 
quantitative impact of over £1 million, in 
addition to other audit misstatements 
below that threshold that we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group’s principal operations are in the United Kingdom and represent 89% of total Group revenue, 95% of Group profit before tax and 
92% of Group total assets. Only the UK operations are scoped in for Group reporting purposes. The Group audit team performed the audit of 
the UK operations as if they were a single aggregated set of financial information using the materiality levels set out above.
Although not in-scope for Group reporting purposes, in agreement with the audit committee and coterminus with the audit of the Group 
and the UK operations, audits were performed in Australia and Germany to local materiality levels and specified audit procedures were also 
performed on four entities in the US. Together these audits and specified audit procedures covered 99% of total Group revenue, 99% of 
Group profit before taxation; and 99% of total Group assets.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:  
● ● the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and  
● ● the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

In this section . . .
 
The financial statements have been presented in a style which attempts to make them less complex and more relevant 
to shareholders. We have grouped the note disclosures into five sections: ‘Basis of Preparation’, ‘Results for the Year’, 
‘Operating Assets and Liabilities’, ‘Capital Structure and Financing Costs’ and ‘Other Notes’. Each section sets out the 
accounting policies applied in producing the relevant notes, along with details of any key judgements and estimates used. 
The purpose of this format is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of what drives financial performance of the 
Group. The aim of the text in boxes is to provide commentary on each section, or note, in plain English.
Keeping it simple . . . 
Notes to the financial statements provide information required by statute, accounting standards or Listing Rules  
to explain a particular feature of the financial statements. The notes which follow will also provide explanations  
and additional disclosure to assist readers’ understanding and interpretation of the annual report and the  
financial statements.

In this section . . . 
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an 
accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This section also shows 
new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and whether they are effective in 2013 
or later years. We explain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the 
Group.
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc (‘the 
Company’) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the 
Group’) and include the Group’s interests in associates and 
jointly controlled entities. The Company is domiciled in the 
United Kingdom.
As required by EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) the 
Group’s accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU (‘IFRS’), and approved by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the 
basis of historical cost. Where other bases are applied these 
are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
The 2012 consolidated income statement and consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income have been restated for 
the retrospective application of IAS 19 Revised (see note 3.7). 
In addition, the consolidated statement of financial position 
has been restated for fair value adjustments to the net 
assets acquired with acquisitions in 2012 (see note 3.4). 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP .
Going concern
As a result of the Group’s continued generation of significant 
free cash flows the Group maintained its positive net cash 
position while paying a special dividend. The Group has also 
sought to gain further efficiencies in the balance sheet by 
repurchasing further debt where it is economically beneficial 
to do so (see section 4 for details on capital structure and 
financing).
The Group continues to review forecasts of the television 
advertising market to determine the impact on ITV’s 
liquidity position. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group will be able to operate 
within the level of its current funding.
The Group also continues to focus on development of the 
non-advertising business, and evaluates the impact of 
further investment in acquisitions against the strategy and 
cash headroom of the business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and  
special purpose entities
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly 
controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an 
interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group 
and one or more other parties undertake an economic 
activity that is subject to joint control. The Group accounts 
for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method. 
Under the equity method the investment in the entity is 
stated as one line item at cost plus the investor’s share of 
retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in  
net assets.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint 
venture, over which the Group has significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in, but 
not control or jointly control, the financial and operating 
decisions of an entity. These investments are also accounted 
for using the equity method.
A special purpose entity (SPE) is a legal entity which 
the Group may establish to fulfil a specific trading 
and investment purpose. Judgement is required when 
determining if an SPE should be consolidated and involves 
the evaluation of the substance of its relationships with 
the Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards. Those SPEs 
controlled by the Group are established under terms that 
impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of 
their management and that result in the Group receiving the 
majority of the benefits related to their operations and net 
assets, being exposed to the majority of risks incidental to

their activities and receiving the majority of the residual or 
ownership risks related to the SPEs or their assets.
SPEs are used in limited circumstances by the Group. The 
only significant SPE is the pension funding partnership that 
was established in 2010 between the Group and the Trustee 
of the ITV Pension Scheme as a way of establishing payment 
streams to the pension scheme. The partnership, which is a 
Scottish Limited Partnership, is controlled and consolidated 
by the Group.
Current/non-current distinction
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading 
purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected 
to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of 
the Group’s operating cycle. All other assets are classified as 
non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading 
purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of 
the Group’s operating cycle and those liabilities due within 
one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are 
classified as non-current liabilities.
Classification of financial instruments
The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified 
into the following financial statement captions in the 
statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 39 
Financial Instruments:
● ● ‘Loans and receivables’ – separately disclosed as cash and 
cash equivalents (excluding gilts over which unfunded 
pension commitments have a charge) and trade and 
other receivables;
● ● ‘Available for sale financial assets’ – measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. Includes gilts over 
which unfunded pension commitments have a charge 
and equity securities that do not meet the definition of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates;
● ● ‘Held to maturity investments’;
● ● ‘Financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss’ – separately disclosed as derivative financial 
instruments in assets/liabilities and included in non-
current other payables (contingent consideration); and
● ● ‘Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost’ – 
separately disclosed as borrowings and trade and other 
payables.
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate 
classification of the Group’s financial instruments. Details 
on the accounting policies for measurement of the above 
instruments are set out in the relevant note.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and 
liabilities
The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it 
becomes a party to the contract. Financial instruments are 
no longer recognised in the statement of financial position 
when the contractual cash flows expire or when the Group 
no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and 
rewards under the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call 
deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to three 
months from the date of acquisition, cash held to meet 
certain finance lease commitments and gilts over which 
unfunded pension commitments have a charge. The 
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to 
approximate fair value.
Foreign currencies
The primary economic environment in which the Group 
operates is the UK. The consolidated financial statements 
are therefore presented in pounds sterling (‘£’).
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign 
currencies, these transactions are translated into pounds 
sterling at the exchange rate on that day. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated into pounds 
sterling at the year end exchange rate. Where there is a 
movement in the exchange rate between the date of the 
transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss 
may arise. Any such differences are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured 
at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of 
the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the year 
end exchange rate. The revenues and expenses of these 
companies are translated into pounds sterling at the 
average monthly exchange rate during the year . Where 
differences arise between these rates, they are recognised 
in the translation reserve within equity and other 
comprehensive income.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the 
Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates are 
recognised in the translation reserve within equity and other 
comprehensive income.
On disposal of an interest in a joint venture or an associate, 
the related translation reserve is released to the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires 
management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in 
which the estimates are revised and in any future periods 
affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity are set out below and in more detail in the 
related notes:
● ● Revenue recognition (note 2.1)
● ● Classification of financial instruments (included in  
this note)
● ● Business combinations (note 3.3 and note 3.4)
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and 
assumptions that are significant to the financial statements

New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards
The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards relevant to the Group’s results that are 
effective in 2013: 
Accounting Standard Requirement Impact on financial statements
IAS 19 Revised – 
Employee Benefits
The IASB issued numerous amendments to IAS 19, 
ranging from the concept of expected return on 
plan assets to simple clarifications and rewording of 
disclosures.
The most significant amendment is the requirement 
to calculate net interest income or expense using the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation, whereas the previous standard required a 
separate expected return on assets to be used.
The amendment also clarifies that administrative 
costs should be recognised within operating costs, 
which differs from previous practice of including it as a 
deduction of assets.  
The revised standard has been implemented in the 
current year by the Group, with retrospective application.
The impact on the income statement has been reflected 
in the current year and has resulted in finance costs 
of £20 million (which is adjusted for in calculating 
adjusted profit), and operating costs of £13 million, 
which is included within EBITA. The 2012 comparative 
performance has been restated to reflect an increase 
in finance costs of £7 million to £16 million, and an 
additional £7 million in operating costs to £15 million. 
The impact on 2012 statutory EPS is a decrease from 
6.9p to 6.6p.
The above amendments have not had any impact on the 
2013 and 2012 net asset position of the Group.
IAS 1 Financial 
Statement 
Presentation
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items 
presented in other comprehensive income. Items that 
could be reclassified to the income statement at a 
future point in time would be presented separately from 
items that will never be reclassified.
The statement of other comprehensive income has 
been amended to reflect the update in presentation but 
there is no impact on the Group’s financial position or 
performance.
IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurements
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under 
IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not 
change when an entity is required to use fair value, but 
rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value 
under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The 
standard is effective for periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013.
Longevity swap
IFRS 13 has resulted in a change in the method of valuing 
a longevity swap (previously accounted for under IAS 
19R). Under the new method the Group will be applying 
market-based assumptions to the measurement process 
(previously the best estimate was taken).
Longevity swap
The value of the longevity swap has increased from 
a negative asset of £118 million in 2012 under the old 
method to a negative asset of £23 million in 2013 under 
the new method. Had the old valuation method applied 
at 31 December 2013, the value of the longevity swap 
would have been negative £140 million. The impact 
of the new valuation method is an increase in the net 
assets position of £117 million, with the remaining £22 
million offsetting movement being changes in market 
conditions over 2013. The movement has been reflected 
within the net remeasurement gain presented in the 
statement of other comprehensive income.  
The change in value of the swap has had no impact 
on the consolidated income statement of the Group. 
Further details are in note 3.7.
There have been no other material impacts noted for 
the Group.

The Directors also considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations 
or amendments on the Group that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. Except where noted below, none are 
considered relevant to the Group’s results and are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
Accounting Standard Requirement Impact on financial statements
IAS 32 Financial 
Instruments
The amendments clarify the offsetting criteria, such as 
when an entity has a legal right to offset and when gross 
settlement is equivalent to net settlement.
Based on the preliminary analyses performed, the 
amendments are not expected to have any impact on 
the Group.
IFRS 10 IFRS 10 replaces a portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements that addresses the 
accounting for consolidated financial statements. It 
also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – 
Special Purpose Entities. 
 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies 
to all entities including special purpose entities. The 
changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require management 
to exercise significant judgement to determine which 
entities are controlled and therefore are required 
to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the 
requirements that were in IAS 27.
Based on the preliminary analyses performed, IFRS 10 
is not expected to have any material impact on the 
currently held investments of the Group.
IFRS 11 IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and 
SIC-13 Jointly controlled entities – Non-monetary 
contributions by Venturers.
 
IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly 
controlled entities (JCEs) using proportionate 
consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of 
a joint venture must be accounted for using the equity 
method.
Based on the preliminary analyses performed, IFRS 11 
is not expected to have any material impact on the 
currently held investments of the Group.
IFRS 12 IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were 
previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial 
statements, as well as all of the disclosures that 
were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These 
disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
Although a number of new disclosures will be required, 
there is no material impact expected on the Group’s 
financial position or performance.

In this section . . . 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. On the following pages you will find disclosures 
explaining the Group’s results for the year , segmental information, exceptional items, taxation and earnings per share.
Keeping it simple . . . 
This section analyses the Group’s profit before tax by reference to the activities performed by the Group and an 
analysis of key operating costs.
Earnings before interest, tax, amortisation (EBITA) and before exceptional items remains the Group’s key profit 
indicator. This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group. 
This section therefore also shows each division’s contribution to total revenue and EBITA.
Following revisions to IAS 19, we have restated our prior period results and the details of those restatements are 
included in note 3.7.
2.1 Profit before tax 
Accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and comprises the sale 
of products and services to third parties. Selecting the 
appropriate timing and amount of revenue recognised 
requires some judgement. Revenue from the sale of 
products is recognised when the Group has transferred 
both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and 
control of the products sold and the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably. Revenue recognition criteria for 
the Group’s key classes of revenue are recognised on the 
following bases:
Applicable 
segment Class of revenue Recognition criteria
Broadcast & 
Online Advertising on transmission or display
Broadcast & 
Online
Sponsorship on transmission of the 
sponsored programme or

Segmental information
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are 
reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Board of Directors, regarded as the 
chief operating decision maker .
The Board of Directors considers the business primarily from 
a product or activity perspective. The reportable segments 
for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 
2012 are therefore ‘Broadcast & Online’ and ‘ITV Studios’, the 
results of which are outlined in the following tables:

Intersegment revenue, which is carried out on arm’s 
length terms, is generated from the supply of ITV Studios 
programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily 
on ITV. This revenue stream is a measure which forms part of 
the Group’s strategic priority of building a strong international 
content business. 
In preparing the segment information, centrally managed 
costs have been allocated between reportable segments on 
a methodology driven principally by revenue and headcount 
of each segment. This is consistent with the basis of 
reporting to the Board of Directors.
Broadcast & Online 
This segment is responsible for commissioning and 
scheduling programmes on the ITV channels, marketing and 
programme publicity and online rights exploitation. Upon 
transmission of these programmes, Broadcast & Online 
generates revenue from the sale of audiences for advertising 
airtime and sponsorship. Other sources of revenue are 
from:  participation revenue, digital revenue (including pay), 
online advertising, digital terrestrial multiplex SDN, brand 
extensions and licensing channels and content to pay 
operators.
ITV Studios 
ITV Studios is an international productions business. It 
comprises ITV Studios UK, international production centres 
in the USA, Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Norway 
and Finland and ITV Studios Global Entertainment, the 
distribution and exploitation business.
A significant portion of ITV Studios’ UK revenue is generated 
when it creates ideas that are then produced and sold as 
programming to the ‘Broadcast & Online’ segment, primarily 
for ITV. This is shown in the intersegment revenue in the 
segmental analysis. 
ITV Studios Global Entertainment sells programming, 
exploits merchandising and licensing worldwide, and is a 
distributor of DVD entertainment primarily in the United 
Kingdom, both for ITV Studios and third parties.
EBITA before exceptional items
The Directors assess the performance of the reportable 
segments based on a measure of EBITA before exceptional 
items. The Directors use this measurement basis as 
it excludes the effect of non-recurring income and 
expenditure. Amortisation, investment income and share 
of profit/(losses) of joint ventures and associates are also 
excluded to reflect more accurately how the business is 
managed and measured on a day-to-day basis. Net financing 
costs are not allocated to segments as this type of activity 
is managed by the central treasury function, which manages 
the cash position and funding of the Group.

Whilst becoming more international, the Group’s principal 
operations are in the United Kingdom. Its revenue from 
external customers in the United Kingdom is £1,982 million 
(2012: £1,895 million), and total revenue from external 
customers in other countries is £407 million (2012: 
£301 million).
There are three media buying agencies (2012: three) acting 
on behalf of a number of customers that represent the 
Group’s major customers. These agencies are the only 
customers which individually represent over 10% of the 
Group’s revenues. Revenues of approximately £527 million 
(2012: £486 million), £235 million (2012: £239 million) 
and £210 million (2012: £233 million) were derived from 
these customers. These revenues are attributable to the 
‘Broadcast & Online’ segment.

The number of full-time equivalent employees (excluding 
short-term contractors and freelancers), calculated on a

2013 2012
Broadcast & Online 2,049 2,102
ITV Studios 2,208 1,957
4,257 4,059
The increase in full-time equivalent employees in ITV Studios 
is primarily driven by the four acquisitions completed in 
2013 as well as an increase in production from the core UK 
business. Broadcast & Online headcount reduction is driven 
by the regional news operations due to changes in Ofcom 
regulations combined with efficiency savings.
Details of Directors’ emoluments, share options, pension 
entitlements and long-term incentive scheme interests are 
set out in the Remuneration Report.
Read more on the Remuneration Report on page 82.
Depreciation
Depreciation in the year was £24 million (2012: £27 million), 
of which £12 million (2012: £15 million) relates to ‘Broadcast 
& Online’ and £12 million (2012: £12 million) to ‘ITV Studios’.
Operating leases
The total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 
under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for payment 
as follows:
2013 Transponders Property Total

The Group’s operating leases relate to transponder 
assets and office and studio properties. The Group holds 
transmission supply agreements that require the use of 
specific transponder assets for a period of up to 11 years with 
payments increasing over time, limited by specific RPI caps. 
These supply agreements are classified as operating leases, 
in accordance with the Group’s policy on leases detailed in 
note 3.2.

Included in 2012 property commitments were future 
minimum lease payments of £82 million contracted on 
the London T elevision Centre, a property which the Group 
acquired in January 2013 (see note 3.2).
Property leases typically run for a period of up to ten years 
and may have an option to renew after that date (options 
to renew are not included in the commitments table). Lease 
payments are generally subject to market review every 
five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the 
uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such 
changes have not been reflected in the table above. None of 
the leases include contingent rentals. 
The total future minimum sublease payments expected to 
be received under non-cancellable subleases at the year end 
are £2 million (2012: £4 million).
The total operating lease expenditure recognised during the 
year was £45 million (2012: £40 million) and total sublease 
payments received were £2 million (2012: £2 million).
Audit fees
The Group engages KPMG Audit Plc (‘KPMG’) on assignments 
additional to their statutory audit duties where their expertise 
and experience with the Group are important.

Fees paid to KPMG for audit and other services to the 
Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as 
the Group accounts are required to disclose such fees on a 
consolidated basis.
2.2 Exceptional Items
Keeping it simple . . . 
Exceptional items are material and non-recurring 
and are excluded from management’s assessment 
of profit because by their nature they could distort 
the Group’s underlying quality of earnings. They are 
typically gains or losses arising from events that are 
not considered part of the core operations of the 
business (e.g. costs relating to capital transactions, 
such as professional fees on acquisitions). These items 
are excluded to reflect performance in a consistent 
manner and are in line with how the business is 
managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Accounting policies
Exceptional items as described above are disclosed on the 
face of the income statement. 
Subsequent revisions of estimates for items initially 
recognised as exceptional provisions are recorded as 
exceptional items in the year that the revision is made. Gains 
or losses on disposal of non-core assets are also considered 
exceptional due to their nature and impact on the Group’s 
underlying quality of earnings.

A – Reorganisation and restructuring costs
In 2012 £5 million of costs were incurred relating to 
restructuring initiatives to drive cost efficiency in line with 
the strategy.
B – Acquisition related expenses
Acquisition related expenses of £8 million include 
professional fees (mainly financial and legal due diligence) 
incurred on the acquisitions completed during the year 
of £5 million (2012: £2 million; see also note 3.4), and 
expenses in the period with respect to performance based, 
employment linked contingent costs accrued to former 
owners of £3 million (2012: nil).
C – Loss on sale and impairment of non-current assets
In 2012 a £6 million loss on sale and impairment of non-
current assets was incurred primarily as a result of an 
impairment on previous premises of £5 million.
D – Gain on sale and impairment of subsidiaries and 
investments
In 2013 the credit principally relates to the gain of £6 million 
recognised on disposal of STV shares. In 2012, the £1 million 
credit related to a £3 million gain on the sale of Screenvision 
US (Technicolor Cinema Advertisers LLC), offset by £2 million 
of impairment charges on investments in Freesat (UK) 
Limited and NoHo Film and Television Limited. 
2.3 Taxation
Keeping it simple . . . 
This section lays out the tax accounting policies, the 
current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year 
(which together make up the total tax charge or credit 
in the income statement), a reconciliation of profit 
before tax to the tax charge and the movements in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Following revisions to IAS 19, we have restated 
our prior period results and the details of those 
restatements are included in note 3.7.
Accounting policies
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income 
statement and the statement of comprehensive income, 
according to the accounting treatment of the related 
transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and 
deferred tax. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until a resolution has been reached by the 
relevant tax authority. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the 
taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in 
respect of previous years. The current tax charge is based on 
tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the 
year end.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues 
based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely 
to become due, which require judgement. Amounts are 
accrued based on management’s interpretation of specific 
tax law and the likelihood of settlement. Where the final 
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact 
the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which such determination is made.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation 
purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for:
● ● the initial recognition of goodwill;
● ● the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination; and
● ● differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to 
the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the 
temporary difference.

Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves 
judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable 
income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net 
to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same 
authority and the Group has the right of set-off.

In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax 
charge of £105 million (2012: £77 million restated) arises 
on a profit before tax of £435 million (2012: £334 million 
restated), the taxation charge that would arise at the 
standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the 
actual tax charge as follows:

Total taxation charge in the income 
statement (105) (77)
Non-deductible expenses are expenses that are not 
expected to be allowable for tax purposes. Similarly non-
taxable income is income that will not be taxed.
A deferred tax asset of £10 million is recognised on overseas 
temporary differences in the USA. The deferred tax asset of 
£9 million in 2012 was on overseas temporary differences in 
the USA and Germany. 
Adjustments for prior periods primarily arise where an 
outcome is obtained on certain tax matters which differs 
from expectations held when the related provision was 
made. Where the outcome is more favourable than the 
provision made, the difference is released, lowering 
the current year tax charge. Where the outcome is less 
favourable than our provision, an additional charge to 
current year tax will occur .
The effective tax rate is the tax charge on the face of 
the income statement expressed as a percentage of the 
profit before tax. In the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
effective tax rate is comparable to the standard rate of 
UK corporation tax. In the year ended 31 December 2012, 
the effective tax rate was lower than the standard rate of 
UK corporation tax primarily due to the reversal of over 
provisions for prior periods and recognition of overseas 
deferred tax assets. As explained in the Financial and 
Performance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to 
show the cash tax impact on its adjusted earnings.
Taxation – Other comprehensive income
Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling 
£13 million (2012: credit of £50 million) has been recognised 
representing deferred tax. An analysis of this is included in 
the deferred tax movement table.

At 31 December 2013, total deferred tax assets are 
£81 million (2012: £133 million) and total deferred tax 
liabilities are £29 million (2012: £40 million).
The deferred tax balance relates to:
● ● property, plant and equipment temporary differences 
arising on assets qualifying for capital allowances;
● ● temporary differences on intangible assets arising on 
business combinations;
● ● programme rights temporary differences on 
intercompany profits on stock;
● ● pension scheme deficit temporary differences on the 
IAS 19 pension deficit, additional contributions resulting 
from funding through the SDN pension partnership 
(not recognised as contributions under IAS 19) and the 
spreading of tax relief on one-off large pension funding 
payments;
● ● UK tax loss temporary differences in receiving the benefit 
of the Group’s tax losses;
● ● interest-bearing loans and borrowings and derivatives  
temporary differences on hedging instruments;
● ● share-based compensation temporary differences on 
share schemes;
● ● overseas temporary differences on intangible assets and 
net operating losses arising in the US and Germany; and
● ● other temporary differences on miscellaneous items.
Due to the change in the statutory tax rate, deferred tax is 
provided at 20% (2012: 23%), which is the rate that has been 
substantively enacted to apply on 2 July 2013. The impact 
of the change in the tax rate is £6 million (2012: £7 million), 
of which £4 million was recognised in the deferred tax 
charge and the remainder recognised in equity to reflect the 
movements in the pension deficit taken to equity.
The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit 
has been adjusted to reflect the current tax benefit obtained 
in the current year following the employer contributions of 
£91 million to the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme.

The adjustment in equity to the deferred tax balance primarily 
relates to the actuarial gains recognised in the period. 
A deferred tax asset of £446 million (2012: £513 million) 
in respect of capital losses of £2,230 million (2012: 
£2,230 million) has not been recognised due to uncertainties 
as to the amount and whether a capital gain will arise in the 
appropriate form and relevant territory against which such 
losses could be utilised. For the same reasons, deferred tax 
assets in respect of overseas losses of £14 million (2012: 
£13 million) that time expire between 2017 and 2026 have 
not been recognised.
2.4 Earnings per share
Keeping it simple . . . 
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is the amount of post-tax 
profit attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is calculated on the Group profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders of £326 million 
(2012: £256 million) divided by 3,929 million (2012: 
3,888 million) being the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year .
Diluted EPS reflects any commitments the Group has 
to issue shares in the future. In 2013, this comprised 
share options and the 2016 convertible bond. To 
calculate the impact it is assumed that all share 
options are exercised and that the 2016 convertible 
bond is converted into shares in its entirety. 
When calculating the impact of the convertible bond, 
only ten months of dilution were suffered since the 
bond was settled in October (see note 4.1 for details).  
Basic EPS is adjusted in order to more accurately show 
the business performance of the Group in a consistent 
manner and reflect how the business is managed 
and measured on a day-to-day basis. Adjusted EPS is 
adjusted for exceptional items which include acquisition 
related costs (professional fees, primarily due 
diligence, and performance based, employment linked 
contingent payments), impairment of intangible assets, 
amortisation of intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations, net financing cost adjustments 
and prior period and other tax adjustments.
Following revisions to IAS 19, we have restated 
our prior period results and the details of those 
restatements are included in note 3.7.
The calculation of basic, diluted and adjusted EPS is set out

Read more on our rationale for determining the adjustments to profit in the 
Financial and Performance Review on page 47.
Details of the adjustments to earnings are as follows:
A. The Group dilutes EPS for the impact of any convertible 
instrument outstanding during the year . As detailed in note 
4.1, in 2013 the Group partially settled the 2016 convertible 
Eurobond for equity. Consequently, diluted profit for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders of ITV plc includes 
an adjustment for interest and accretion recognised in the 
year on the convertible Eurobond which would not have 
been incurred if the bond had been converted to equity at 
the beginning of the period. There will equally be a dilutive 
impact on the weighted average number of shares for the 
period to settlement resulting in an additional 136 million 
shares (2012: 192 million shares for the full year). 
B. Both operating and non-operating exceptional items 
(detailed in note 2.2) are adjusted to reflect profit for 
the year before exceptional items. A net tax credit of £1 
million (2012: £2 million credit) is recognised on the total 
exceptional items charge of £2 million (2012: £12 million 
charge). 
C. Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible 
assets of £42 million (2012: £37 million) is calculated as 
total amortisation and impairment of £66 million (2012: 
£60 million), less amortisation of software licences and 
development of £12 million (2012: £11 million). A related tax 
credit of £12 million (2012: £12 million) is then recognised on 
the net amount.
D. Gross adjustments to net financing costs of £90 million 
(2012: £62 million restated) relate to mark-to-market 
movements on swaps and foreign exchange, losses on 
buybacks and imputed pension interest charges. This is 
reduced by a tax credit of £21 million (2012: £15 million 
restated) to give a net adjustment of £69 million (2012: 
£47 million restated).
E. Other tax adjustments primarily reflect the impact on 
the deferred tax charge resulting from a decrease in the 
statutory tax rate from 23% to 20% and to reflect the 
reversal of credit in respect of losses (2012: the rate at which 
we recognised deferred tax decreased from 25% to 23%).
F. Adjusted profit is defined as profit for the year before 
exceptional items which include acquisition related costs 
(professional fees, primarily due diligence, and performance 
based, employment linked contingent payments), 
impairment of intangible assets, amortisation of intangible 
assets acquired through business combinations, net 
financing costs adjustments and other tax adjustments.

This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result. 
Liabilities relating to the Group’s financing activities are addressed in Section 4. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
shown in note 2.3.
On the following pages there are notes covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and 
disposals, provisions and pensions.
3.1 Working capital
Keeping it simple . . . 
Working capital represents the assets and liabilities  
the Group generates through its trading activity. The 
Group therefore defines working capital as distribution 
rights, programme rights and other inventory, trade 
and other receivables and trade and other payables.
Careful management of working capital ensures  
that the Group can meet its trading and financing 
obligations within its ordinary operating cycle. 
Working capital is a driver of the ‘profit to cash’ 
conversion, a key performance indicator for the Group. 
The Group’s target ‘profit to cash’ ratio on a rolling 
three year basis is at least 90%.
In the following section you will find further 
information regarding working capital management 
and analysis of the elements of working capital.
3.1.1 Distribution rights
Accounting policies
‘Distribution rights’ are programme rights the Group buys 
from producers to derive future revenues principally through 
licensing to broadcasters. These are classified as non-current 
assets as these rights are used to derive long-term economic 
benefit for the Group.
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and 
charged through operating costs in the income statement 
over a maximum five year period that is dependent on 
either cumulative sales and programme genre, or based on 
forecast future sales. Certain film rights are expensed over 
a period of up to ten years reflecting the estimated period 
over which these types of rights can be exploited. These 
estimates are based on historical experience with similar 
rights as well as anticipation of future events. Advances 
paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are disclosed 
as distribution rights as soon as they are contracted. These 
advances are not expensed until the programme is available 
for distribution. Up to that point they are assessed annually 
for impairment through the reassessment of the future sales 
expected to be earned from that title.
Movements in distribution rights during the year are shown 
in the table below:

3.1.2 Programme rights and other inventory 
Accounting policies
Where programming, sports rights and film rights are 
acquired for the primary purpose of broadcasting, these are 
recognised within current assets.
Assets are recognised when the Group controls the 
respective assets and the risks and rewards associated  
with them. 
For acquired programme rights, assets are recognised as 
payments are made and are recognised in full when the 
programme is available for transmission. Programmes 
produced internally , either for the purpose of broadcasting or 
to be sold in the normal course of the Group’s operating cycle, 
are recognised within current assets at production cost.

Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities 
continued
Programme costs and rights, including those acquired under 
sale and leaseback arrangements, are generally expensed 
to operating costs in full on first transmission. Film rights, 
sports rights and certain acquired programmes are expensed 
over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern in 
which the right is consumed.
Programme costs and rights not yet written off are included 
in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. In assessing net realisable value 
for programmes in production, judgement is required when 
considering the contracted sales price and estimated 
costs to complete. For programme stock, sports rights and 
film rights, the net realisable value assessment is based 
on estimated airtime value, with consideration given to 
whether the number of transmissions purchased can be 
efficiently played out over the licence period. 
Historically, ITV has entered into sale and leaseback 
agreements in relation to certain programme titles. Related 
outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise 
the principal and accrued interest, are included within 
borrowings. The finance related element of the agreement is 
charged to the income statement over the term of the lease 
on an effective interest basis. Sale and leaseback obligations 
are secured against an equivalent cash balance held within 
cash and cash equivalents.
The programme rights and other inventory at the year end 
are shown in the table below:

Production inventory comprises the costs incurred by ITV 
Studios in producing a programme, where the programme 
is part way through the production process and not yet 
available for delivery to a broadcaster . Commissions 
primarily comprise programmes purchased based on 
editorial specification, over which the Group has some 
control. 
Programme rights and other inventory written down in the 
year were £1 million (2012: £3 million). 
3.1.3 Programme commitments
These are operating commitments in respect of 
programming entered into in the ordinary course of business 
with programme suppliers, sports organisations and film 
distributors in respect of rights to broadcast on the ITV 
network. Commitments in respect of these purchases, which

3.1.4 Trade and other receivables
Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of 
the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the 
amounts considered recoverable (amortised cost). Where 
payments are not due for more than one year , they are 
shown in the financial statements at their net present value 
to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment. The Group 
provides goods and services to substantially all its customers 
on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables 
that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected. 
These estimates include such factors as historical 
experience, the current state of the UK and overseas 
economies and industry specific factors. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to 
approximate fair value.

3.1.7 Working capital management
Cash and working capital management continues to be a key 
focus. During the year the cash outflow from working capital 
was £15 million (2012: inflow of £1 million) derived as follows:
2013
£m
2012

distribution rights (42) 29
(Increase)/decrease in receivables (15) 17
Increase/(decrease) in payables 42 (45)
Working capital (outflow)/ inflow (15) 1
The working capital outflow for the year excludes the impact 
of balances acquired on the purchase of new subsidiaries 
(see note 3.4).
The increase in programme rights and other inventory is 
largely driven by an increase in commissions and sports 
rights. The broadcast sports rights mainly represent 
payment for the FIFA World Cup and Rugby World Cup.
The increase in receivables has been driven by higher 
revenues, compared to December 2012, resulting in an 
increase in trade receivables.
The increase in payables primarily relates to trade payables, 
and an increase in the Group VAT liability.

Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities 
continued
3.2 Property, plant and equipment
Keeping it simple . . . 
The following section shows the physical assets used  
by the Group to operate the business, generating 
revenues and profits. These assets include office 
buildings and studios, as well as equipment used in 
broadcast transmission, programme production and 
support activities.
The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid 
for them. A depreciation expense is charged to the 
income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and 
the reduced value of the asset over time. Depreciation 
is calculated by estimating the number of years the 
Group expects the asset to be used (useful economic 
life). If there has been a technological change or 
decline in business performance the Directors review 
the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen 
below their depreciated value. If an asset’s value falls 
below its depreciated value an additional one-off 
impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies 
followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in 
arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Certain 
items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued 
to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being 
the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of 
transition.
Leases 
Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Certain service 
contracts involve the use of specific assets (e.g. transmission 
or studio equipment) and therefore contain an embedded 
lease. 
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires 
judgement as to whether substantially all of the risks and 
benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group. 
Estimates used by management in making this assessment 
include the useful economic life of assets, the fair value 
of the asset and the discount rate applied to the total 
payments required under the lease. Assets held under such 
leases are included within property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. 
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise 
the principal plus accrued interest, are included within 
borrowings. The finance element of the agreements is 
charged to the income statement over the term of the lease 
on an effective interest basis. 
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which 
are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, 
plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The 
annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated 
useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at 
the end of its life. The major categories of property, plant 
and equipment are depreciated as follows:
Asset class Depreciation policy
Freehold land not depreciated
Freehold buildings up to 60 years
Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or 
estimated useful life
Vehicles, equipment and fittings

3.3 Intangible assets
Keeping it simple . . . 
The following section shows the non-physical assets 
used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include brands, customer contracts and 
relationships, contractual arrangements, licences, 
software development, film libraries and goodwill. The 
cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has 
paid or , where there has been a business combination, 
the fair value of the specific intangible assets that 
could be sold separately or which arise from legal 
rights. In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount 
the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and 
above the fair value of the individual assets and 
liabilities acquired. The value of goodwill is ‘intangible’ 
value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong 
market position and the outstanding productivity of 
its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of  
goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group 
expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, 
via an annual amortisation charge to the income 
statement. Where there has been a technological 
change or decline in business performance the 
Directors review the value of assets to ensure they 
have not fallen below their amortised value. Should 
an asset’s value fall below its amortised value an 
additional one-off impairment charge is made against 
profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied 
and the specific judgements and estimates made by 
the Directors in arriving at the net book value of these 
assets.
Accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that 
arise from assets that are not capable of being individually 
identified and separately recognised. The goodwill 
recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of business 
combinations.
Due to changes in accounting standards goodwill has been 
calculated using three different methods depending on the 
date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred 
since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the 
acquisition method. Under this method, goodwill is 
measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred 
(including the recognition of any non-controlling interests 
of the business being bought), less the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
all measured at the acquisition date. Any contingent 
consideration to be transferred will be recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date and recognised within Other 
payables. Contingent consideration classified as an asset 
or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in the income 
statement. The determination of fair value is based on 
discounted cash flows. The key assumptions take into 
consideration the probability of meeting each performance 
target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call 
and put options are granted over the remaining interest, 
a non-controlling interest is recognised in equity. A call 
option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, 
carried at fair value. The put option is recognised as a liability 
within Other payables, carried at the present value of the 
put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is 
included in Merger and Other Reserves. Any subsequent 
remeasurement of the call option and the put option liability 
is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets 
acquired can only be made within 12 months of the 
acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined 
provisionally at an earlier reporting date. These adjustments 
are accounted for from the date of acquisition. 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for 
as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result of such transactions. Transaction costs 
incurred in connection with those business combinations, 
such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional 
fees, are expensed as incurred.

Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 
1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 were accounted 
for using the purchase method in accordance with 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations (2004)’. Goodwill on those 
combinations represents the difference between the cost 
of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-
controlling interest. Transaction costs incurred in connection 
with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due 
diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in 
the cost of acquisition.
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 
2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which 
represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that 
time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 December 
2003. The classification and accounting treatment of 
business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as 
permitted under IFRS 1. Goodwill is stated at its recoverable 
amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses 
and is allocated to cash-generating units.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are those which are identifiable and 
can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
Within ITV there are two types of intangible assets: those 
acquired and those that have been internally generated 
(such as software licences and development).
Other intangible assets acquired directly by the Group 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Those 
separately identified intangible assets acquired as part of a 
business combination are shown at fair value at the date of 
acquisition less accumulated amortisation.
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are brands, 
licences, contractual arrangements, and customer contracts 
and relationships.
Each class of intangible asset’s valuation method on initial 
recognition, amortisation method and estimated useful life 
is set out in the table below:

Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities 
continued
Determining the fair value of intangible assets arising 
on acquisition requires judgement. The Directors make 
estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash 
flows derived from exploiting the assets being acquired. 
The Directors then estimate an appropriate discount rate 
to apply to the forecast cash flows. Such estimates are 
based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for 
an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, 
expected changes to selling prices, operating costs and 
the expected useful lives of assets. Judgements are also 
made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be 
renewed; this drives our amortisation policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or 
businesses being acquired.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the 
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives 
are judged to be indefinite. Indefinite life assets, such as 
goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at 
each year end.
Impairment
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested 
annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement 
of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible 
assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement. 
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the 
recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill, the cash-
generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) related 
to the goodwill. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (‘cash-
generating unit’ or ‘CGU’).
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and ‘value in use’. The value in use is based 
on the present value of the future cash flows expected to 
arise from the asset. 
Growth assumptions derived from the strategy are not 
included in the estimated future cash flows used as the 
Group applies cautious assumptions for impairment testing.
Estimates are used in deriving these cash flows and the 
discount rate. Such estimates reflect current market 
assessments of the risks specific to the asset and the time 
value of money. The estimation process is complex due to 
the inherent risks and uncertainties. If different estimates 
of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of 
an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were 
made, these changes could materially alter the projected 
value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence 
materially different amounts would be reported in the 
financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In 
respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.

2012 goodwill additions have been restated to reflect fair 
value adjustments of £6 million recognised upon finalisation 
of the purchase price allocation exercise.
Following an annual review of the amortisation periods 
and residual values of the intangible assets, the Group has 
adjusted its estimated residual value for the film libraries, 
resulting in an increased annual amortisation charge in the 
period.

Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s current five 
year plan. Beyond the five year plan these projections are 
extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate of 
2% (2012: 1%–2.5%). The growth rate used is consistent with 
the long-term average growth rates for the industry and is 
appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect 
the latest market assumptions for the Risk-Free rate, the 
Equity Risk Premium and the net cost of debt. There is 
currently no reasonably possible change in discount rate that 
would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.
Broadcast & Online
The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition 
of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the largest of which 
were the acquisition by Granada of United News and Media’s 
broadcast businesses in 2000 and the merger of Carlton and 
Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc.
No impairment charge arose in the Broadcast & Online CGU 
during the course of 2013 (2012: nil). 
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow 
projections for this CGU are based include: the share of the 
television advertising market; share of commercial impacts; 
programme and other costs; and the pre-tax market 
discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount 
of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of the television 
advertising market. In forming its assumptions about 
the television advertising market, the Group has used a 
combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and 
in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent 
experience. Current industry consensus for the advertising 
market is 3.5% for 2014. The impairment test also assumed 
that ITV renews its broadcasting licences, which occured in 
February 2014. No impairment was identified. Also as part of 
the review, a sensitivity of -5% was applied to 2014 for the 
purposes of the impairment test, again with no impairment 
identified.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.3% (2012: 12.3%) has 
been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible 
change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in 
this CGU to zero.
SDN
Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN (the 
licence operator for DTT Multiplex A) in 2005. It represented 
the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the 
Group, principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as 
a platform, business relationships with the channels which are 
on Multiplex A and additional capacity available from 2010.
No impairment charge arose on the SDN goodwill during the 
course of 2013 (2012: nil).
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows 
are based are income to be earned from medium-term 
contracts, the market price of available multiplex video 
streams in the period up to and beyond digital switchover 
and the pre-tax market discount rate. These assumptions 
have been determined by using a combination of current 
contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house 
estimates of video stream availability and pricing. 
A pre-tax market discount rate of 13.1% (2012: 14.4%) has 
been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible 
change in the income and availability assumptions would 
reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
ITV Studios
The goodwill for ITV Studios arose as a result of the 
acquisition of production businesses since 1999, the largest 
of which were the acquisition by Granada of United News 
and Media’s production businesses in 2000 and the merger 
of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc. ITV Studios 
goodwill also includes all of the goodwill arising from recent 
acquisitions in 2013 and 2012.
No impairment charge arose in the ITV Studios CGU during 
the course of 2013 (2012: nil).
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were 
based include revenue (including international revenue and 
the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions 
and hours produced), margin growth and the pre-tax market 
discount rate. These assumptions have been determined 
by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends 
within the business, industry estimates and in-house 
estimates of growth rates in all markets. 
A pre-tax market discount rate of 12.2% (2012: 12.9%) has 
been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible 
change in the income and availability assumptions would 
reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.

3.4 Acquisitions
Keeping it simple . . . 
The following section outlines what the Group has 
acquired in the year . 
All of the deals are structured so that a large part of 
the payment made to the sellers is determined based 
on future performance (‘consideration’). Accounting 
standards require some of this consideration to be 
included in the purchase price used in determining 
goodwill (‘contingent consideration’), while the rest 
is required to be recognised as a liability or expense 
outside of acquisition accounting (put option 
liabilities and performance based, employment-linked 
contingent payments known as ‘earnout’ payments).
Therefore, for each acquisition below, the distinction 
between the types of consideration has been 
explained in detail.
Read more on how each of these businesses plays an important role in 
helping the Group execute its strategy in the Financial and Performance 
Review on page 45.
Acquisitions
During 2013 the Group completed four acquisitions, all 
of which have been included in the results of the Studios 
operating segment. Each of these businesses fits with the 
Group’s strategy to create world class content for multiple 
platforms, free and pay , both in the UK and internationally . 
The following sections provide a summary of each acquisition.
Acquisitions in the United Kingdom
The Garden Productions
On 22 April 2013, the Group acquired 100% of The Garden 
Productions Limited (‘The Garden’), a company that 
specialises in factual entertainment productions. Initial 
consideration of £18 million was paid in cash. Contingent 
consideration included a performance based payment 
due in 2014 of a maximum of £8 million which is no longer 
expected to be paid.
The Group also agreed to an earnout payment that will be 
based on the business meeting certain performance targets. 
The maximum payment is £28 million (undiscounted) and 
the expected payment is being accrued over the earnout 
period (five years), and will largely be reported within 
exceptional items relating to acquisitions in the income 
statement.
Intangibles, being the value placed on key contractual 
arrangements, of £8 million were identified. Goodwill, which 
represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify 
and grow the content and formats produced by the Group, 
has been provisionally valued at £12 million. The goodwill 
arising on the acquisition is not expected to be deductible 
for tax purposes.
Big Talk Productions
On 26 July 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share 
capital of Big Talk Productions Limited and associated 
companies (‘Big Talk’), a business that specialises in scripted 
programmes. Initial consideration of £13 million was paid 
in cash. Contingent consideration includes a performance 
based payment due in 2015 of £1 million (maximum of £2 
million undiscounted) and in 2018 of £2 million (maximum of 
£4 million undiscounted).
The Group also agreed to an earnout payment that will be 
based on the business meeting certain performance targets. 
The maximum payment is £11 million (undiscounted) and the 
expected payment is being accrued over the earnout period 
(five years), and will largely be reported within exceptional 
items relating to acquisitions in the income statement.
Intangibles, being the value placed on key contractual 
arrangements, of £3 million were identified. Goodwill, which 
represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify 
and grow the content and formats produced by the Group, 
has been provisionally valued at £12 million. The goodwill 
arising on the acquisition is not expected to be deductible 
for tax purposes.
Acquisitions in the United States
On 10 May and 18 June 2013, the Group acquired 60% and 65% 
of the membership interests in High Noon Entertainment (‘High 
Noon’) and Thinkfactory Media (‘Thinkfactory’) respectively . The 
Group consolidates all of the earnings of both businesses and 
the vendors’ remaining interest will be recognised as a non-
controlling interest in equity .
High Noon specialises in reality and entertainment 
programmes, while Thinkfactory has a mixture of reality , 
entertainment and some scripted programming. It is the 
Group’s view that the acquisitions will strengthen and 
complement ITV’s existing position as a producer for major US 
television networks. 
Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to 
expand the Group’s programme offering in the United States 
and exploiting that offering internationally . It also reflects the 
value of the assembled workforce of creative talent who will 
develop that content. It is expected to be deductible for US tax 
purposes.
Further details of each US acquisition is summarised below.

High Noon Entertainment
Initial consideration of £16 million ($26 million) for 60% was 
satisfied in cash and contingent consideration includes a 
performance based payment due in 2015 of £2 million ($3 
million undiscounted, maximum of $10 million). 
A call and put option has been granted over the 40% non-
controlling interest. The call option is exercisable in the first 
half of 2016 and then following the expiry of the vendors’ 
put option, which is exercisable in 2019.
The maximum additional consideration that the Group could 
pay for the remaining 40% equity interest is £45 million 
($74 million; undiscounted). Final payment will be entirely 
dependent on future performance of the business, and 
the maximum payout will only be achieved if the business 
continues to deliver substantial growth over the next five 
years.
Intangibles, being the value placed on brands, customer 
contracts and contractual arrangements, of £7 million were 
identified and goodwill was valued at £16 million. 
Based on the Group’s projections at acquisition, the value 
of the put option was valued at £8 million ($13 million, 
discounted). The total was allocated, for accounting 
purposes, between a put option liability and an earnout 
accrual. Consequently, a put option liability of £6 million

Position. Any changes in the fair value of the put option

exceptional items relating to acquisitions in the income 
statement.
At the year end, the value of the put option was estimated to

Initial consideration of £19 million ($30 million) for 65% was 
satisfied in cash.
A call and put option has been granted over the 35% non-
controlling interest. The call option is exercisable in the first 
half of 2017 and then following the expiry of the vendors’ put 
option, which is exercisable in 2019.
The maximum additional consideration which the Group 
could pay for the remaining 35% equity interest is £42 million 
($70 million; undiscounted). Final payment will be entirely 
dependent on future performance of the business, and 
the maximum payout will only be achieved if the business 
continues to deliver substantial growth over the next five years.
Intangibles, being the value placed on brands, customer 
contracts and contractual arrangements, of £8 million were 
identified and goodwill was valued at £18 million.
At acquisition the put option was valued at £9 million ($13 
million, discounted). The total has been allocated between 
a put option liability and an earnout accrual, resulting in a 
£7 million ($10 million) put option liability included in the 
Statement of Financial Position. Any subsequent changes in the 
fair value of the put option liability arising from a reassessment 
of projections will be reported within financing costs on the 
income statement, and excluded from adjusted profit. The 
remaining £2 million ($3 million) will be accrued over the put 
option vesting period as an earnout payment and will be 
reported within exceptional items relating to acquisitions in the 
income statement.
At the year end, the value of the put option was estimated to 
be £12 million ($20 million; undiscounted).

Fair value of the consideration transferred comprises the 
initial cash paid to the sellers and an estimate for any future 
payments the Group may be liable to pay, based on future 
performance of the business. This latter amount is classified 
as contingent consideration. 
The total expected remuneration payment reflects the present 
value of the future amount the Group estimates it will have to 
pay the sellers based on employment conditions set out in the 
purchase agreement (separate to any employment contract). 
This payment does not form part of the calculation of goodwill.  
Acquisitions in 2012
During 2012 the Group completed four acquisitions which 
have all been included in the ITV Studios operating segment. 
The Group acquired a 61.5% controlling interest in Gurney 
in December 2012. Total payments of £29 million ($46 
million) were made, consisting of initial consideration of 
£25 million ($40 million) and £4 million ($6 million) paid for 
cash acquired. A call and put option was granted over the 
non-controlling interest. The discounted put option liability 
(‘options’) at the acquisition date was £12 million and the 
maximum consideration which the Group could pay for the 
remaining 38.5% equity interest is £42 million ($71 million; 
undiscounted). Final payment will be entirely dependent on 
future performance of the business.
Intangibles, being the value placed on brands, customer 
contracts and contractual arrangements, of £8 million were 
identified and goodwill of £26 million has been recognised. 
The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the 
remaining three businesses for total consideration of £13 
million. The maximum additional amount payable is £11 
million (undiscounted), and is primarily being accounted for 
as an earnout payment. Total goodwill of £6 million was 
recognised on acquisition and represents the value placed 
on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content and 
formats produced by the Group.

Acquisition costs largely comprise legal and financial 
diligence fees. Details of that, along with earnout costs 
expensed in the period, are disclosed in exceptional items 
note 2.2.
3.5 Assets held for sale and disposals
Keeping it simple . . . 
The following section outlines what the Group is either 
holding for sale or has disposed of in the year .
IFRS provides strict criteria that must be met for 
an asset to be classified as held for sale. Where the 
Group no longer considers an asset to meet any of the 
criteria, it is reclassified.
Accounting policies
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held 
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through sale, rather than continuing use; they are available 
for immediate sale; and the sale is highly probable. A disposal 
group consists of assets that are to be disposed of, by sale or 
otherwise, in a single transaction together with the directly 
associated liabilities. The Group includes goodwill acquired 
in a business combination if the disposal group is a cash-
generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets 
or components of a disposal group are remeasured in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter , 
generally the assets or disposal groups are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell. Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to 
goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a  
pro rata basis, except to programming rights and other 
inventory , financial assets and deferred tax assets, which 
continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policies. Impairment on initial classification as held 
for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement 
are recognised in the income statement. Gains are not 
recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current 
assets (including those in disposal groups) classified as 
held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed 
separately on the face of the statement of financial position 
and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal 
groups being separated between assets held for sale and 
liabilities held for sale.
Assets held for sale
The movement in assets held for sale since 1 January 2013 is 
summarised in the table below:

At the beginning of the year the Group was actively marketing 
certain freehold properties in Manchester following the 
Group’s decision to relocate to a new site at MediaCity . The 
sale of one Manchester property was completed in 2013 for 
consideration of £4 million, with an immaterial gain on sale. 
The remaining properties are under a conditional offer , with 
the sale not expected to complete until 2015. As a result, they 
have been reclassified to tangible fixed assets.
3.6 Provisions
Keeping it simple . . . 
A provision is recognised by the Group where an 
obligation exists, relating to events in the past and it is 
probable that cash will be paid to settle it.
A provision is made where the Group is not certain 
how much cash will be required to settle a liability, so 
an estimate is required. The main estimates relate to 
the cost of holding properties that are no longer in 
use by the Group, the likelihood of settling legal claims 
and contracts the Group has entered into that are now 
unprofitable.
Accounting policies
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial 
position when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash 
will be paid to settle it and the amount can be estimated 
reliably. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows by a rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as a financing cost in the income statement. The 
value of the provision is determined based on assumptions 
and estimates in relation to the amount and timing of actual 
cash flows which are dependent on future events.

Provisions of £19 million are classified as current liabilities 
(2012: £25 million). Unwind of the discount is nil in 2013 and 
2012.
Contract provisions comprise onerous sports rights 
commitments that are expected to be utilised over the 
remaining contract period. Other contract provisions relate 
to onerous commitments on transmission infrastructure.
Property provisions principally relate to onerous lease 
contracts due to empty space created by the ongoing 
review and rationalisation of the Group’s property portfolio. 
Utilisation of the provision will be over the anticipated life of 
the leases or earlier if exited.
Other provisions of £15 million primarily relate to potential 
liabilities that may arise as a result of Boxclever having 
been placed into administrative receivership, most of which 
relate to pension arrangements. In 2011 the Determinations 
Panel of The Pensions Regulator determined that Financial 
Support Directions (‘FSDs’) should be issued against certain 
companies within the Group in relation to the Boxclever 
pension scheme. The Group immediately referred this 
decision to the Upper Tribunal (thereby effectively appealing 
it). An FSD would require the Company to put in place 
financial support for the Boxclever scheme; however , it 
cannot be issued during the period of the reference. The 
reference process is ongoing and aside from procedural 
issues there were no substantive case developments in 
the period. The Directors have obtained leading counsel’s 
opinion and extensive legal advice in connection with the 
proceedings and continue to believe that the provision held 
is appropriate. 
3.7 Pensions
Keeping it simple . . . 
Historically , the Group has offered its employees the 
opportunity to participate in a number of defined benefit 
schemes; these are now closed to new members. The ITV 
Pension Scheme (the Scheme) consists of three sections, 
A, B and C. Section A of the Scheme is considerably 
larger than the other sections. The Group is required to 
disclose the net of its defined benefit pension assets 
and liabilities in the statement of financial position. In 
the event of a net liability the Directors are obliged to 
determine how this deficit will be addressed. 
The Group continues to offer employees defined 
contribution pension schemes and, where taken up, 
makes payments into this scheme on their behalf.
In this section we explain the accounting policies 
governing the Group’s pension schemes, followed by 
analysis of the deficit on the defined benefit pension 
scheme and how this has been calculated. In addition, 
we have placed text boxes to explain some of the 
technical terms used in the disclosure.
Accounting policies
Defined contribution schemes
Obligations under the Group’s defined contribution schemes 
are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement 
as incurred.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group’s obligation in respect of defined benefit pension 
schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then 
deducted. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation 
date on high quality corporate bonds, that exactly match the 
timing of the expected benefit payments over future years. 
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries 
relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which 
include life expectancy of members, expected salary and 
pension increases, and inflation. It is important to note 
that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used 
may have a significant effect on the income statement and 
statement of financial position.

The Group’s pension schemes
Keeping it simple . . . 
Under defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee 
and has no further obligations to employees. The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the 
members rather than the Group. It is the member’s responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement 
benefits.
In a defined benefit scheme, members receive cash payments at and in retirement, the value of which is dependent on 
factors such as salary and length of service. The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to 
meet these obligations. In the event of poor returns the Group needs to address this through a combination of increased 
levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the schemes. Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions 
are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be 
put aside to cover future payments.
The Group makes contributions to the ITV Pension Scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not 
consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the statement 
of financial position. It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the schemes and to monitor 
the schemes’ funding position. The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members. The appointment of 
trustees is determined by the scheme’s documentation. 
In the unfunded scheme the Group is responsible for meeting pension obligations as they fall due.
The following section outlines the key elements of the Group’s defined contribution and defined benefit schemes 
during the year and as at 31 December 2013.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured 
by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to 
be paid using the projected unit method. This method is an 
accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowance 
for projected earnings. These calculations are performed by 
a qualified actuary. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period 
in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
An unfunded scheme in relation to previous Directors is 
accounted for under IAS 19. This is securitised by assets held 
outside of the ITV Pension scheme in the form of gilts and 
included within cash and cash equivalents.
Defined contribution schemes
T otal contributions recognised as an expense in relation to 
defined contribution schemes during 2013 were £8 million (2012: 
£9 million). This is the default scheme for all new employees.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group’s main scheme was formed from a merger of 
a number of schemes on 31 January 2006. The level of 
retirement benefit is principally based on pensionable 
salary at retirement. The Group’s main scheme consists of 
three sections, A, B and C. The latest triennial valuations of 
sections A, B and C were undertaken as at 1 January 2011 by 
an independent actuary appointed by the Trustee of the 
ITV Pension Scheme and agreed in 2012. The next triennial 
valuation of sections A, B and C will be as at 1 January 2014, 
and is expected to be agreed in 2015. The Group will monitor 
funding levels annually . 
The defined benefit pension deficit
The defined benefit pension deficit at 31 December 2013 
was £445 million (2012: £551 million).
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of financial position and shown 
within non-current liabilities. The totals recognised in the 
current and previous years are:

Addressing the deficit
The statutory funding objective is that a funded scheme 
has sufficient and appropriate assets to pay its benefits as 
they fall due. This is a long-term target. Future contributions 
will always be set at least at the level required to satisfy the 
statutory funding objective. The general principles adopted by 
the Trustee are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, 
will be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits already in 
payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments 
which will arise from members’ accrued pension rights.
The levels of ongoing contributions to the defined benefit 
schemes are based on the current service costs (as assessed 
by the scheme Trustee) and the expected future cash 
flows of the schemes. Normal employer contributions in 
2014 for current service are expected to be in the region of 
£10 million (2013: £11 million) assuming current contribution 
rates continue as agreed with the Trustee. Based on the 
agreements currently in force, the following deficit funding 
payments are expected for forthcoming years.
In 2014 the Group expects to make deficit funding 
contributions of £89 million (£80 million was paid in 2013) 
comprised as follows:
● ● deficit funding contribution to Section A of £40 million;
● ● total annual deficit funding contributions to Sections B 
and C of £5.5 million;
● ● £32 million, being 10% of the Group’s EBITA before 
exceptional items that exceeds the £300 million threshold; 
● ● £11 million of annual deficit contributions as a result of 
the SDN pension partnership. Under the partnership 
arrangements, the Group has committed to making a 
payment to the main section of the Scheme of up to 
£200 million in 2022, if and to the extent that it remains 
in deficit at that time.
Read more on the Scheme commitments in the Financial and Performance 
review on page 51. 
The remaining sections provide further detail of the value of 
scheme assets and liabilities, how these are accounted for 
and the impact on the income statement.
Total defined benefit scheme obligations
Keeping it simple . . . 
The defined benefit obligation (the pension scheme liabilities) may change due to the following:
● ● Current service cost – the cost to the Group of benefits arising in the future which are attibutable to the members’ 
service in the current period. This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
● ● Past service cost – refers to the cost or credit as a result of changes in the benefits offered to members or a 
reduction in the number of employees covered by the scheme. This is recognised through operating costs in the 
income statement.
● ● Settlement gains/(losses) – these occur when the Group enters into a transaction to eliminate all further legal or 
constructive obligations for some or all of the benefits provided by the schemes. Settlement gains or losses can 
arise from the transfer of member benefits into alternative pension arrangements, fully insuring benefits or on 
business disposals.
● ● Increase due to interest cost – future pension obligations are stated in present value, in that a discount factor is 
used to state the current worth of a future cost. This interest cost is the unwinding of the discount on the present 
value of the obligation. Broadly, it is determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by 
the present value of the obligation during the period. This is recognised through net financing costs in the income 
statement.
● ● Actuarial losses/(gains) – in order to value the Group’s defined benefit obligation at the end of a period, it is 
necessary to apply certain assumptions in relation to demographic and financial trends. Where there is a difference 
between previous estimates and actual experience, or a change to assumptions, this will give rise to actuarial gains 
or losses, which are recognised through other comprehensive income
● ● Benefits paid – any benefits paid out by the schemes will lower the obligations of those schemes.

Keeping it simple . . . 
Assumptions used to calculate the best estimate 
of future cash flows to be paid out by the schemes 
include: future salary levels, future pensionable salary 
levels, the estimate of increases in pension payments, 
the life expectancy of members, the effect of inflation 
on all these factors and ultimately the discount rate 
used to estimate the present day fair value of these 
obligations.
When deciding on these assumptions the Group 
takes independent actuarial advice relating to the 
appropriateness of the assumptions.
The principal assumptions used in the schemes’ valuations at 
the year end were:
2013 2012
Discount rate for:
 Past service liabilities 4.45% 4.2%
 Future service liabilities 4.60% 4.2%
Inflation assumption for:
 Past service liabilities 3.35% 2.9%
 Future service liabilities 3.40% 2.9%
Rate of pensionable salary increases 0.9% 0.9%
Rate of increase in pension payment 
(LPI 5% pension increases) 3.25% 2.8%
Rate of increase to deferred  
pensions (CPI) 2.35% 2.2%
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is determined by 
reference to high quality fixed income investments in the UK 
that match the estimated term of the pension obligations. 
The basis of estimating the discount rate is by using the yields 
available on AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to 
the liabilities, using the yield curve as the basis of estimation 
and differentiating between past service (the defined benefit 
obligation) and future service (the current service cost). 
Differentiating in this way represents a refinement in the 
basis of estimation applied in prior periods, where previously 
the discount rate was based on the term of the past service 
liabilities and there was no differentiation between past 
and future service. There is no impact of the refinement on 
the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2013, as 
this continues to be valued by reference to a single rate for 
past service liabilities. The use of a different discount rate 
and inflation rate for future service liabilities has no material 
impact on the 2014 income statement charge.
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the 
difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked 
Government bonds, also differentiating between past and 
future service. The inflation assumption is used as a basis for 
the remaining financial assumptions, except where inflation 
caps have been implemented. Both the discount rate and 
the inflation assumption have been selected by considering 
yields taken from yield curves at terms, and weighted by 
cash flows, consistent with the pension obligations. The 
yield curves are constructed by our actuarial advisers 
from the yields available on relevant AA rated corporate 
bonds (for the discount rate) and fixed and index-linked 
Government bonds (for the inflation assumption).

In estimating the life expectancy of pension scheme members, 
the Group has used the SAPS Normal year of birth tables with 
CMI 2013 improvements, with a 1.25% p.a. long-term trend 
and a minus one year age rating (i.e. tables are adjusted so 
that a member is assumed to be one year younger than actual 
age). At the 2012 year end, PA92 year of birth tables with 
medium cohort improvements were used, with a 1% per annum 
underpin and a one year age rating. Using these tables the 
assumed life expectations on retirement are:
2013 2013 2012 2012
Retiring today at age 60 65 60 65
Males 27.8 23 26.8 21.9
Females 30.4 25.5 30.1 25.1
Retiring in 20 years at age 60 65 60 65
Males 29.8 24.8 28.8 23.7
Females 32.4 27.4 32.2 27.0
The tables above reflect published mortality investigation 
data in conjunction with the results of investigations into 
the mortality experience of scheme members. The Group 
estimates the average duration of its UK scheme’s liabilities 
to be 15 years (2012: 15 years). 
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to 
measure the defined benefit obligation are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme deficit
Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by £240 million
Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £270 million
Rate of inflation 
(Retail Price Index)
Increase by 0.5% Increase by £80 million
Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by £60 million
Rate of inflation 
(Consumer Price Index)
Increase by 0.5% Increase by £40 million
Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by £30 million
Life expectations Increase by 1 year Increase by £80 million
The above sensitivity for life expectations excludes the 
longevity swap. It is estimated that a £50 million benefit 
would arise from a one year increase in the market based 
assumption of mortality.
The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single 
change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to 
be unchanged. The inflation sensitivities allow for the 
consequential impact on the relevant pension increase 
assumptions. The sensitivity analyses have been determined 
based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the 
defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes 
in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting 
period.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied 
by offsetting changes in another assumption (although this 
is not always the case). 
The Group’s net pension deficit is the difference between 
the schemes’ liabilities and the schemes’ assets. Changes  
in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes 
in the market value of scheme assets. 
These may or may not offset the change in assumptions. For 
example, a fall in interest rates will increase the schemes’ 
liabilities, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the 
market value of certain assets so there is no net effect on 
the Group’s liability.

Total defined benefit scheme assets
Keeping it simple . . . 
The Pension scheme holds assets across a number of different classes, these being equities, bonds and other 
investments. These assets are managed by the Trustee, although the Trustee is required to consult with the Group 
on changes to their investment policy. Financial instruments are in place which provide protection against changes in 
market factors (interest rates and inflation) which could act to increase the pension deficit. 
In 2011 the scheme obtained protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of 
pensioner members by transacting a longevity swap. Under the swap, the Trustees of the Scheme agreed to make  
predetermined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, 
irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live. 
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in scheme assets. In prior periods, 
the present value as at the year end was calculated using the same assumptions applied to the defined benefit 
obligation. However, the introduction of IFRS 13 in the year means that the Group must now value the swap under 
market-based assumptions, which represents a change from previous best estimates. This results in a nil valuation of 
the swap at inception, subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates.
Pension scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following:
● ● The investment income on scheme assets is determined based on the discount rate at the beginning of the 
year and calculated as the expected percentage return multiplied by the fair value of the scheme assets. This is 
recognised through net financing costs in the income statement.
● ● Remeasurement gains and losses arise from differences between the actual and expected final asset values and 
are recognised through other comprehensive income.
● ● A deduction from scheme assets is made for scheme administration expenses, which are recognised through 
operating costs in the income statement.
● ● Employer’s contributions and cash contributions by scheme participants are paid into the schemes to be managed  
and invested.
● ● Any benefits paid out by the schemes will reduce the value of the schemes’ assets.
● ● Movements in the value of the longevity swap. The value of the longevity swap is sensitive to changes in the 
discount rate or market life expectancy and movements are recognised as a remeasurement gain or loss in other 
comprehensive income.

The Trustee holds a longevity swap to remove the risk of 
increases in pension liabilities that would arise if a significant 
portion of the scheme’s defined benefit pensioner 
population were to enjoy a longer life than currently 
expected. The recognition of the swap results in a reduction 
to the scheme’s assets. The introduction of IFRS 13 as 
discussed below has resulted in a change in the approach 
and assumptions used to value the swap. As a result, the 
negative value of the swap has reduced by £95 million, with 
the associated gain being recognised as a remeasurement 
gain on assets in other comprehensive income within equity. 
The scheme is invested in a range of asset classes and uses 
derivative financial contracts to improve the efficiency of 
the portfolio and to help manage risks.
The Trustee has a substantial holding of equity-type 
investments, mainly shares in listed and unlisted companies. 
The investment return related to these is variable, and they 
are generally considered ‘riskier’ investments. However, it 
is generally accepted that the yield on these investments 
will contain a premium to compensate investors for this 
additional risk. There is significant uncertainty about the 
likely size of this risk premium. In respect of overseas equity 
investments there is also a risk of unfavourable currency 
movements which the Trustee manages by hedging 
broadly 60% of the overseas investments against currency 
movements.
The Trustee also holds corporate bonds and other fixed 
interest securities. The risk of default on these is assessed by 
various rating agencies. Some of these bond investments are 
issued by the UK Government. The risk of default on these 
is lower compared to the risk of default on corporate bond 
investments, although some risk may remain. The expected 
yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be 
derived exactly from their market value. 
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based 
on the target asset allocation for 2014 to develop the 
expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for 
the portfolio. The benchmark for the main section of the 
scheme in 2014 is to hold broadly 47% liability-matching 
and 53% return-seeking assets. The majority of the equities 
held by the schemes are in international blue chip entities. 
The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities, 
with a target of broadly 22% of equities being held in the UK 
and 78% of equities held overseas. Within the bond portfolio 
the aim is to hold 58% of the portfolio in government bonds 
(gilts) and 42% of the portfolio in corporate bonds and other 
fixed interest securities.

The actual return on the scheme’s assets for the year ended 
31 December 2013 was an increase of £231 million (2012: 
increase of £111 million).
The Trustee is responsible for deciding the investment 
strategy for the scheme’s assets, although changes in 
investment policies require consultation with the Group. 
Varying returns from the different types of assets held by 
the scheme have resulted in Trustee investment decisions 
that have moved the asset allocation in the scheme’s 
portfolio away from the target ratio of bonds and equities. A 
rebalancing of the portfolio only occurs if equity type assets 
exceed the target allocation by 3%, but is not necessary if 
equity asset types fall below the target allocation.

The £70 million actuarial loss on the scheme’s liabilities was 
principally due to the change to mortality assumptions. The 
£118 million remeasurement gain on scheme assets 
primarily results from the change in valuation method 
applied to the longevity swap, as discussed below.
Changes to accounting standards
A revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ has been 
in force from 1 January 2013 and changes a number of 
disclosure requirements for post employment arrangements 
and restricts the options previously available on how to 
account for defined benefit pension plans. The Group 
adopted the revised standard from this date and has applied 
it restrospectively to the Group’s 2012 results.
The most notable change resulting from IAS 19 (Revised) 
which impacts the Group is the requirement for the 
expected returns on pension plan assets, previously 
calculated based on management’s estimate of expected 
returns, to be replaced by a credit on pension plan assets 
calculated at the liability discount rate. The retrospective 
application has resulted in an additional charge of 
£14 million in the consolidated income statement for 2012, 
of which £7 million has been charged to operating costs and 
£7 million is a reduction in interest income on assets, within 
net financing costs. The impact on basic and diluted EPS for 
2012 was a reduction of 0.3p. This change has not impacted 
the Group’s net assets. 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurements’ was introduced and came 
into effect from 1 January 2013. The most significant impact 
on the Group is the requirement to value the longevity 
swap using IFRS 13 market-based assumptions, instead of 
the previous requirement to apply assumptions consistent 
with those used for the defined benefit obligation. Applying 
IFRS 13 to the swap valuation results in a swap value of 
nil at inception in August 2011, and a negative swap asset 
of £23 million as at 31 December 2013. The £95 million 
remeasurement gain arising in the period, primarily as 
a result of this change in valuation method, has been 
recognised as a return on scheme assets within other 
comprehensive income, and reduced the Group’s defined 
benefit pension obligation by the same amount.

In this section . . . 
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing costs, including its balance 
sheet liquidity and access to capital markets. 
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders 
(equity) and how much is borrowed from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s activities both now 
and in the future.
The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results 
and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to deliver its business 
plan. During the year the Group’s credit rating improved, and the Board continued to focus on improving the efficiency of 
the balance sheet through the partial repurchase of the bilateral loan and the repurchase and redemption of the 2016 
convertible bond. 
In 2014 the Board will further review its policies on capital structure to support the strategy . Any potential courses of 
action will take into account the Group’s liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and 
impact on credit ratings. 
 
 4.1 Net cash 
Keeping it simple . . . 
Net cash is the Group’s key measure used to evaluate total cash resources net of the current outstanding debt. In 
defining total outstanding debt the Directors consider it appropriate to include:
● ● the currency impact of swaps held against those debt instruments;
● ● equity components of debt instruments (principally the convertible bond which was settled in the year); and
● ● the amortised cost adjustment which reflects the increase in coupon rates for specific bonds caused by the change 
in ITV’s credit status to and from investment grade in between August 2008 and August 2013.

lease commitments under programme sale and leaseback 
commitments, and gilts of £36 million (2012: £37 million) over 
which the unfunded pension commitments have a charge 
(see note 3.7 for details).
Held to maturity investments
In March 2013 gilts with a nominal value of £138 million 
secured against the £200 million bilateral loan were utilised 
in part repayment of the loan (2012: the gilts had a carrying 
value of £145 million).
Loans and loan notes due within one year
During the year the 2014 Eurobond was reclassified to 
current borrowings.  
Loans and loan notes due after one year
In March 2013 £138 million of the £200 million covenant free 
loan with a maturity of March 2019 was repaid from cash 
and with the held to maturity gilts secured against the loan. 
All other terms, including the interest cost of 13.55%, remain 
unchanged. The repayment resulted in an upfront loss of 
£38 million, shown in net financing costs, and future interest 
savings of £48 million (2012: £75 million of the October 
2015 bonds and £89 million of the January 2017 bonds were 
repurchased). 
Currency components of swaps held against euro 
denominated bonds
As at 31 December 2013 the currency element of the cross 
currency interest rate swaps is a £26 million asset (2012: 
£25 million asset) effectively reducing the net amount 
repayable on the bond at maturity.

Convertible bond
In November 2009 ITV issued a £135 million convertible 
Eurobond with a maturity date of November 2016 and a 
coupon of 4%. As the bond contained an option for the 
issuer to convert a portion of the debt into ITV’s equity (from 
November 2013), the components were treated as separate 
instruments. The accounting policy for this compound 
instrument is detailed in note 4.2 (i.e. partly debt and partly 
equity).
During 2013 the Group settled the entire convertible bond 
through a combination of repurchase and redemption, 
resulting in future interest cost savings of £16 million and 
share dilution of 95 million shares:
● ● the Group repurchased £73 million nominal for a cash 
cost of £169 million, resulting in a loss of £13 million 
recognised in net financing costs and a loss attributable 
to the equity component of £83 million, which has been 
reflected in retained earnings;
● ● the remaining nominal of £62 million was redeemed in 
exchange for 95 million new shares being issued. The 
Group recognised a loss of £10 million in net financing 
costs with respect to the redemption, and the residual 
equity element of £9 million was released to retained 
earnings.
The impact of the redemption on the Group’s equity is 
detailed in note 4.7.
Amortised cost adjustment
The purpose of the amortised cost adjustment is to exclude 
the impact of the coupon step-up on net debt. When ITV’s 
Standard & Poor’s credit rating was lowered to BB+ in August 
2008 a coupon step-up (an increased interest cost) in the 
2014 and 2017 bonds was triggered. Consequently the debt 
carrying values had to be revalued under IFRS, resulting in 
a non-cash increase in net debt and associated loss in net 
financing costs of £30 million as at 31 December 2008. Since 
then the accounting treatment has been unwinding this 
through an annual interest expense, which is excluded from 
adjusted net financing costs. 
In August 2013, the Group’s investment grade status was 
fully restored, resulting in a reversing of the previous coupon 
step up for the 2017 bond. This ‘step down’ triggered 
another revaluation of the amortised cost of the debt 
under IFRS, leading to a gain of £5 million which has been 
recognised within interest expense on financial liabilities in 
net financing costs, on a basis consistent with the unwind 
described above. 
At year end, the amortised cost adjustment remaining is nil 
(2012: £7 million). 
4.2 Borrowings and held to maturity 
investments
Keeping it simple . . . 
The Group borrows money from financial institutions 
and debt investors in the form of bonds and other 
financial instruments. The Group’s bonds generally 
have fixed interest rates and are for a fixed term. 
The interest payable and receivable on these 
instruments is shown in the net financing costs note  
in note 4.4.
Accounting policies
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less 
directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent 
measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Under the amortised cost method the 
difference between the amount initially recognised and 
the redemption value is recorded in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest 
basis. Borrowings are referred to in this section using their 
redemption value when describing the terms and conditions.
The mechanism used to determine variable interest rates 
on a loan is analysed when the loan is initially taken out to 
determine if it is closely related to the loan. If the variable 
rate mechanism is closely related to the loan it is not 
valued separately but cash flow estimates are included in 
the effective interest rate on the loan. This assessment 
is not revisited unless the terms of the loan are changed 
significantly. 
Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments are instruments that are 
classified as partly debt and partly equity due to the terms of 
the instrument.
The Group had one compound financial instrument, the 
2016 convertible bond, that was redeemed in the year as 
described in note 4.1.

Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs 
continued
The liability component of a compound financial instrument 
is recognised initially at the fair value of a normal bond 
that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity 
component is recognised initially at the difference between 
the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a 
whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any 
directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the 
liability and equity components in proportion to their initial 
carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component 
of a compound financial instrument is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. The 
equity component of a compound financial instrument 
is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition but 
is transferred to retained earnings over the term of the 
instrument on an effective interest rate basis.
Held to maturity assets
Where the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold 
financial assets to maturity, they are classified as held to 
maturity. Held to maturity financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value including any directly attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, held to 
maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

4.3 Derivative financial instruments
Keeping it simple . . . 
A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk. A derivative’s value changes over time in 
response to underlying variables such as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period. A hedge 
is where a derivative is used to manage an underlying exposure.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on its net borrowings and to changes in foreign exchange rates on its 
foreign currency transactions and net assets. In accordance with Board approved policies, which are included in note 
4.5, the Group uses derivatives to hedge these underlying exposures. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially included in the balance sheet at their fair value, either as assets or 
liabilities, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value or ‘marked to market’ at each reporting date. Movements in 
instruments measured at fair value are recorded in the income statement in net financing costs.
An interest rate swap is an instrument to exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one 
type of floating rate for another . A cross-currency interest rate swap exchanges a fixed or floating interest rate in one 
currency for a floating or fixed interest rate in another currency.
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their 
respective fair values are detailed in this section.
Accounting policies
The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial 
instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest 
and foreign exchange rates. The Group does not hold or 
issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Hedge 
accounting as defined under IFRS has not been adopted by 
the Group for the derivatives held.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with 
the movement recorded in the income statement within 
net financing costs. Derivatives with positive fair values are 
recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is 
determined by using the difference between the contract 
exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at 
the reporting date. The fair value of interest rate swaps 
is the estimated amount that the Group would receive 
or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, 
taking into account current interest rates and the current 
creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third party valuations are used to fair value the Group’s 
derivatives. The valuation techniques use inputs such 
as interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, 
volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations 
between inputs.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value 
through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to 
changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

When the Group’s 2014, 2015 and 2017 Eurobonds were 
issued, the Group used a portfolio of interest rate swaps 
and cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert a 
portion of the fixed rate coupons into floating rates. The 
Group subsequently layered on additional swaps to take 
these floating rates back into fixed rates. Consequently, 
the Group is now 100% fixed on its gross borrowings. The 
return to fixed rate locked in an interest benefit for the 
Group, since the fixed rate receivable on the original swap 
portfolio is higher than the fixed rate payable on the swaps 
subsequently layered on, resulting in a net mark-to-market 
gain on the portfolio. On the 2014 €50m Eurobond, this also 
locked in a foreign exchange benefit for the Group, whereby 
the net effect of the related swap portfolio at maturity is to 
receive €50 million (to settle the bond maturity) and to pay 
£15 million. 
Given the bond repurchases in recent periods, the remaining 
principal outstanding on the 2015 and 2017 Eurobonds is 
now less than the notional amounts on the related swaps. 
However , the notional amounts on all of the swaps in the 
portfolio match, so that there is no remaining floating 
interest rate exposure and the Group remains 100% fixed 
rate on its debt portfolio.
4.4 Net financing costs
Keeping it simple . . . 
This section details the interest income generated on 
the Group’s cash and other financial assets and the 
interest expense incurred on borrowings and other 
financial assets and liabilities. The presentation of 
these net financing costs in this note reflects income 
and expenses according to the classification of the 
financial instruments.
In reporting ‘adjusted profit’, the Group adjusts 
net financing costs to exclude mark-to-market 
movements on interest rate and foreign exchange 
derivatives, gains/losses on bond buybacks, imputed 
pension interest, interest and fair value movements in 
acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs. 
Read more on our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs in 
the Financial and Performance Review on page 46.
Mark-to-market movements reflect the change in 
value of our derivative instruments between the later 
of inception or 1 January 2013, and 31 December 2013. 
The value at year end is not necessarily the same as 
the value at which they will be settled at maturity.
Accounting policies
Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds 
invested, gains/losses on the disposal of financial 
instruments, changes in the fair value of financial 
instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance 
leases, unwinding of the discount on provisions and liabilities 
to non-controlling interest, foreign exchange gains/losses, 
and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities. 
Interest income and expense is recognised as it accrues in 
profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs can be analysed as follows:

 Losses on early settlement (61) (36)
 Foreign exchange loss (1) –
 Other interest expense (14) (9)
(125) (126)
Net financing costs (115) (106)
Gains relating to changes in fair value of instruments of 
£3 million (2012: losses of £5 million) relate principally to the 
unwinding of the interest rate swaps as they near maturity. 
As detailed in note 4. 1, losses on early settlement of £61 
million (2012: £36 million) were incurred as a result of the 
debt settlements during the year . The partial repurchase 
of the £62 million 2019 bilateral loan resulted in a loss of 
£38 million, while the repurchase and redemption of the 
convertible bond resulted in a loss of £23 million. 
Read more in the Financial and Performance Review on page 46.
Other interest expense includes the interest element of  
the acquisition related contingent liabilities as detailed in

4.5 Financial risk factors
Keeping it simple . . . 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial 
risks: market risks (including currency risk, interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks 
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance. The Group uses derivative 
financial instruments within its policies described 
below as hedges to manage certain risk exposures.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board 
for managing each of these risks including levels of 
authority on the type and use of financial instruments. 
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to 
underlying exposures, i.e. the Group does not use 
derivatives to speculate. The treasury function reports 
regularly to the Audit Committee and treasury 
operations are subject to periodic reviews.
Market risk
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed 
to currency risk arising from movements in foreign exchange 
rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro. 
Foreign exchange risk arises from: differences in the dates 
foreign currency commercial transactions are entered into 
and the date they are settled; recognised monetary assets 
and liabilities held in a non-functional currency; and net 
investments in foreign operations.
The Group’s foreign exchange policy is to hedge material 
foreign currency denominated costs at the time of 
commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency 
denominated revenues on a rolling 12-month basis using 
either a natural hedge where one exists, or through forward 
foreign exchange contracts taken out for up to two years. 
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps to manage 
foreign currency cash flow timing differences.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency 
denominated cash balances is kept to an acceptable level 
by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when 
necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The euro denominated interest and principal payments 
under the €50 million bond have been fully hedged by cross 
currency interest rate swaps.
The Group’s investments in overseas subsidiaries are not 
hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long-
term in nature.
At 31 December 2013, if sterling had weakened/strengthened 
by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 
£8 million (2012: £6 million) higher/lower . Equity would have 
been £17 million (2012: £13 million) higher/lower . 
At 31 December 2013, if sterling had weakened/strengthened 
by 10% against the euro with all other variables held constant, 
post-tax profit for the year would have been £7 million (2012: 
£8million) higher/lower . Equity would have been £15 million 
(2012: £2 million) higher/lower . 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by 
significant changes in interest rates. Borrowings issued at or 
swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Group’s interest rate policy was changed in 2011 to having 
100% of its borrowings at fixed rates in order to lock in low 
interest rates. This policy has been maintained throughout 2012 
and 2013. The Group utilises fixed and floating rate interest 
swaps and options in order to achieve the desired policy mix, as 
illustrated in note 4.3. 
All of the Group’s interest rate swaps are classified as fair value 
through profit or loss so any movement in the fair value goes 
through the income statement rather than equity .
At 31 December 2013, if interest rates had increased/
decreased by 0. 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have 
been unchanged (2012: unchanged).
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the Group’s financial instruments 
change in value due to movements in market prices. This 
excludes movements in interest rate or foreign exchange. The 
Group is not exposed to any material price risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a 
customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. It arises principally from the 
Group’s receivables from customers, cash, held to maturity 
investments and on in-the-money derivatives. There is also 
credit risk relating to the Group’s own credit rating as this 
impacts the availability and cost of future finance.

Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by 
the individual characteristics of each customer . The majority 
of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with 
advertising agencies and advertisers. Credit insurance has 
been taken out against these companies to minimise the 
impact on the Group in the event of a possible default.
Cash and held to maturity investments
The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to 
surplus cash that emphasises preservation of capital. The 
guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty 
risk and maturity profile of cash placed. Counterparty limits 
for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings 
published by the major credit rating agencies and perceived 
state support. Deposits longer than 12 months require the 
approval of the Audit Committee.
Borrowings
ITV’s credit ratings improved in 2013 with all three ratings 
agencies upgrading their long-term credit ratings. In 
March and April respectively, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch 
upgraded the Group’s long-term credit rating to investment 
grade BBB- (2012: BB+). In August Moody’s Investor Service 
upgraded their long-term credit rating to Baa3 (2012: Ba1). 
ITV’s credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap hedging 
and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants 
in the cost of new borrowings for ITV. The cost of existing 
borrowing remains subject to the terms of the instrument.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
financing policy is to fund itself for the long term by using 
debt instruments with a range of maturities and to ensure 
access to short-term appropriate facilities. It is substantially 
funded from the UK and European capital markets, 
supplemented with bank facilities (see below). Management 
monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve 
(comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash 
equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. This 
monitoring includes financial ratios to assess possible future 
credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the 
accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.
At 31 December 2013 the Group has available two undrawn 
committed facilities worth a total of £375 million (2012: 
£375 million). The first is a £125 million invoice discounting 
facility, maturing in September 2015, which is secured on 
advertising receivables and which has no financial covenants. 
The second is a £250 million Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) 
which is provided by a small group of relationship banks and 
which matures in July 2016, following an election made in 
July 2013 to extend the maturity by one year . The RCF, which 
is unsecured, can be extended by a further year subject to 
agreement by the banks. The facility has leverage and interest 
cover financial covenants normal for such a facility .

4.6 Fair value hierarchy
Keeping it simple . . . 
The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are measured at either fair value or 
amortised cost. The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs 
used in the calculations. ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values (e.g. external 
share prices) and does not calculate its own fair values. The different valuation methods are called ‘hierarchies’ and are 
described below.
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position at ‘fair value’.

Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs 
continued
Level 1
Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or 
liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their 
fair value based upon termination prices. Forward foreign 
exchange contracts are accounted for at the difference 
between the contract exchange rate and the quoted 
forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
Level 3
Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data.
Contingent consideration is the Group’s only financial 
instrument classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
As noted in the accounting policy section of note 3.3, the 
key assumptions taken into consideration when measuring 
this acquisition related liability are the performance 
expectations of the acquisition and a discount rate that 
reflects the size and nature of the new business. There is no 
reasonable change in discount rate or performance targets 
that would give rise to a material change in the liability at 
year end.
The acquisitions in the period gave rise to an additional 
£6 million of contingent consideration (see note 3.4 for 
details). The unwind of interest and fair value movement in 
the liability was immaterial in the period (2012: nil), which is 
recognised in other interest expense in net financing costs.
4.7 Equity
Keeping it simple . . . 
This section explains material movements recorded in 
shareholders’ equity that are not explained elsewhere 
in the financial statements. The movements in equity 
and the balance at 31 December 2013 are presented in 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its 
employee remuneration packages. The various ITV 
share-based compensation schemes are explained 
in this section as they are accounted for through 
retained earnings.
Accounting policies
Available for sale reserve
Available for sale assets are stated at fair value, with any gain 
or loss recognised directly in the available for sale reserve in 
equity, unless the loss is a permanent impairment, when it is 
then recorded in the income statement.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their 
approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation 
schemes. The fair value of the equity instrument granted is 
measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period 
via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding 
increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured 
using either market price at grant date or a Black–Scholes 
model, as appropriate, taking into account the terms and 
conditions of the individual scheme. For performance-based 
schemes, the relevant Group performance measures are 
projected to the end of the performance period in order to 
determine the number of options expected to vest. Based 
on this number , and the option fair values, their present 
value is determined.
The valuation of these share-based payments also requires 
estimates to be made in respect of the number of options 
that are expected to be exercised.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and 
performance conditions. Conditions other than service 
or performance conditions are considered non-vesting 
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included

in assumptions about the number of options that are 
expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Group 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
4.7.1 Share capital and share premium
The Group’s share capital at 31 December 2013 of 
£403 million (2012: £391 million) and share premium of 
£174 million (2012: £122 million) is the same as that of ITV 
plc. Details of this are given in the ITV plc Company financial 
statements section of this annual report.

interests of High Noon Entertainment and Thinkfactory 
Media, as detailed in note 3.4. 
4.7.3 Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange 
differences arising on the translation of the accounts of, and 
investments in, foreign operations.
4.7.4 Available for sale reserve
The available for sale reserve comprises all movements 
arising on the revaluation and disposal of assets accounted 
for as available for sale.
4.7.5 Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year 
attributable to owners of the Company of £326 million 
(2012: £256 million) and other items recognised directly 
through equity as presented on the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity.
The Directors of ITV plc propose a final dividend of 2.4p per 
share and a special dividend of 4.0p per share.
4.7.6 Non-controlling interests
In 2013 £4 million (2012: £1 million) of profit was attributable 
to non-controlling interests. 
4.7.7 Share-based compensation
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation 
where the Group receives services from employees and pays 
for these in shares or similar equity instruments. If the Group 
incurs a liability whose amount is based on the price or value 
of the Group’s shares then this will also fall under a share-
based transaction.
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation

payment arrangement that existed at any time during the 
period, including the general terms and conditions of each 
arrangement, such as vesting requirements, the maximum 
term of options granted, and the method of settlement 
(e.g. whether in cash or equity) are set out in the 
Remuneration Report. 
Read more on the Group’s share-based compensation schemes in the 
Remuneration Report on page 82.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be 
satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares. No new 
shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of 
the Deferred Share Award Plan. During the year all exercises 
were satisfied either by using shares purchased in the 
market and held in the ITV Employees’ Benefit Trust or by 
issuing new shares.
Share-based compensation charges totalled £14 million in 
2013 (2012: £9 million).

Employees’ Benefit Trust
The Group has investments in its own shares as a result of shares purchased by the ITV Employees’ Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). 
Transactions with the Group-sponsored EBT are included in these financial statements. In particular, the EBT’s purchases of 
shares in ITV plc are debited directly to equity.
The table below shows the number of ITV plc shares held in the trust at 31 December 2013 and the purchases/(releases) 
from the EBT made in the year to satisfy awards under the Group’s share schemes.

The total number of shares held by the EBT at 31 December 2013 represents 0.54% (2012: 0.38%) of ITV’s issued share 
capital. The market value of own shares held at 31 December 2013 is £42 million (2012: £16 million).
The shares will be held in the EBT until such time as they may be transferred to participants of the various Group share 
schemes. Rights to dividends have been waived by the EBT in respect of shares held which do not relate to restricted shares 
under the Deferred Share Award Plan. In accordance with the Trust Deed, the Trustees of the EBT have the power to exercise 
all voting rights in relation to any investment (including shares) held within that trust.

5.2 Contingent liabilities
Keeping it simple . . . 
A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently 
certain to qualify for recognition as a provision where 
uncertainty may exist regarding the outcome of  
future events.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation 
and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect of 
warranties given in connection with certain disposals of 
businesses. None of these items are expected to have a 
material effect on the Group’s results or financial position.
5.3 Subsequent events
Keeping it simple . . . 
Where the Group receives information in the period 
between 31 December 2013 and the date of this 
report about conditions related to certain events that 
existed at the year end, we update our disclosures 
that relate to those conditions in light of the new 
information. Such events can be categorised as 
adjusting or non-adjusting depending on whether 
the condition existed in 2013. If non-adjusting events 
after the year end are material, non-disclosure could 
influence the economic decisions that users make on 
the basis of the financial statements.
Accordingly, for each material category of non-
adjusting event after the reporting period we disclose 
in this section the nature of the event and an estimate 
of its financial effect, or a statement that such an 
estimate cannot be made.
On 16 January 2014, the Group repurchased the remaining 
2019 Bilateral loan, with a nominal value of £62 million, for 
£95 million. Although this resulted in a loss of £30 million 
recognised within net financing costs, the Group will receive 
future cash interest savings of £44 million.
5.4 Subsidiaries exempt from audit
Keeping it simple . . . 
Certain subsidiaries of the Group can take an 
exemption from having an audit. Strict criteria must 
be met for this exemption to be taken, and it must be 
agreed to by the Directors of that subsidiary entity. 
Listed below are subsidiaries controlled and consolidated by 
the Group, where the Directors have taken the exemption 
from having an audit of its financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2013. This exemption is taken in 
accordance with Companies Act s479A.

i Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
As permitted by section 408 (3) of the Companies Act 2006, 
a separate profit and loss account, dealing with the results 
of the parent company, has not been presented.
Under FRS 29 the Company is exempt from the requirement 
to provide its own financial instruments disclosures, on the 
grounds that it is included in publicly available consolidated 
financial statements which include disclosures that comply 
with the IFRS equivalent to that standard.
The Company has taken advantage of the FRS 1 exemption 
from the requirement to prepare and disclose a cash flow 
statement.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly 
controlled by the Company. Control exists where the 
Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. The investment in the Company’s subsidiaries 
is recorded at cost, adjusted for the effect of UITF 41 
when it was adopted in prior years. Annual FRS 20 share-
based payment compensation costs are recharged to the 
subsidiaries through the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the 
balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of 
exchange ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss 
account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured 
at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of 
exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including 
directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent 
measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. The difference between initial fair value and 
the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss 
account over the period of the liability on an effective 
interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial 
instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest 
and other foreign exchange rates. The Company does not 
hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with 
the movement recorded in the profit and loss account within 
net financing costs. Derivatives with positive fair values are 
recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is 
determined by using the difference between the contract 
exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at 
the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate swaps 
is the estimated amount that the Company would receive 
or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account current interest rates and the current 
creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third party valuations are used to fair value the Company’s 
derivatives. The valuation techniques use inputs such 
as interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, 
volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations 
between inputs.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value 
through profit or loss the fair value change and interest 
income/expense are not separated.
Compound financial instruments are instruments that are 
classified as partly debt and partly equity due to the terms of 
the instrument. The Company had one compound financial 
instrument, the 2016 convertible bond, that was redeemed 
in the year as described in note v.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument 
is recognised initially at the difference between the fair 
value of a normal bond that does not have an equity 
conversion option. The equity component is recognised 
initially at the difference between the fair value of the 
compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair 
value of the liability component. Any directly attributable 
transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity 
components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component 
of a compound instrument is measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. The equity component 
of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured 
subsequent to initial recognition but is transferred to the 
profit and loss account over the term of the instrument on 
an effective interest basis.

Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier 
of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their 
payment.
ii Employees
Two (2012: two) Directors of ITV plc were employees of the 
Company during the year , both of whom remain at the year 
end. The costs relating to these Directors are disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report.
iii Investments in subsidiary undertakings
The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed in note xi. 
The balance at 31 December 2013 was £1,648 million (2012: 
£1,646 million).
iv  Amounts owed (to)/from subsidiary 
undertakings
The Company operates an inter-group banking policy with 
certain 100% owned UK subsidiaries. The policy involves 
the daily closing cash position for participating subsidiaries 
whether positive or negative, being cleared to £nil via daily 
bank transfers to ITV plc. These daily transactions create a 
corresponding intercompany creditor or debtor which can 
result in significant movements  in amounts owed to and 
from subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet.
v Borrowings
Loans repayable in less than than one year
Loans repayable within one year as at 31 December 2013 
comprise:
● ● an unsecured £41 million (€50 million) Eurobond  
(£15 million net of cross currency swaps) which has a 
coupon of 10.0% maturing in June 2014 
Loans repayable after more than one year
Loans repayable after more than one year as at 31 December 
2013 include:
● ● an unsecured £78 million Eurobond which has a coupon of 
5.375% maturing in October 2015; 
● ● an unsecured £161 million Eurobond which has a coupon 
of 7.375% maturing in January 2017; and
● ● in March 2013 £138 million of the £200 million covenant 
free loan with a maturity of March 2019 was repaid from 
cash and with the held to maturity gilts secured against the 
loan. All other terms, including the interest cost of 13.55%, 
remain unchanged. The loss on repayment was £38 million, 
which is shown in financing costs. The repurchase resulted 
in future cash interest savings of £48 million. Subsequent 
to year end, in January 2014, the remaining £62 million 
nominal was repurchased. Details are included in note xii.
Convertible bond
In November 2009 the Company issued a £135 million 
convertible Eurobond with a maturity date of November 
2016 and a coupon of 4%. As the bond contained an option 
for the issuer to convert a portion of the debt into ITV plc’s 
equity (from November 2013), the components were treated 
as separate instruments. 
During 2013 the Company settled the entire convertible 
bond through a combination of repurchase and redemption, 
resulting in future interest cost savings of £16 million and 
share dilution of 95 million shares:
● ● the Company repurchased £73 million nominal for a 
cash cost of £169 million, resulting in a loss of £13 million 
recognised in net financing costs and a loss attributable 
to the equity component of £83 million, which has 
been reflected in the profit and loss account within 
shareholders’ funds.
● ● the remaining nominal of £62 million was redeemed in 
exchange for 95 million new shares being issued. The 
Company recognised a loss of £10 million in net financing 
costs with respect to the redemption, and the residual 
equity element of £9 million was released to the profit 
and loss account within shareholders’ funds.

The Company’s ordinary shares give shareholders equal 
rights to vote, receive dividends and to the repayment of 
capital. The Company issued 20 million new ordinary shares 
during the period, for total consideration of £2 million.  A 
further 95 million new ordinary shares were issued as a 
result of the conversion of £62 million of the £135 million 
convertible Eurobond into equity, creating an additional 
share premium of £52 million.

The profit after tax for the year dealt with in the accounts of 
ITV plc is £996 million (2012: loss of £107 million).
The profit and loss account reserves of £995 million at  
31 December 2013 are all distributable.
The Company received £1, 117 million of dividends from 
subsidiaries in 2013 (2012: £nil). 
The Directors of the Company propose a final dividend of 
2.4p per share and a special dividend of 4.0p per share.
viii Contingent liabilities
Under a group registration, the Company is jointly and 
severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2013 of £51 million 
(31 December 2012: £33 million). The Company has 
guaranteed certain finance and operating lease obligations 
of subsidiary undertakings. 
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation 
and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect of 
warranties given in connection with certain disposals of 
businesses. None of these items are expected to have a 
material effect on the Group’s results or financial position.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee 
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies 
within its Group, the Company considers these to be 
insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In 
this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as 
a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.
ix Capital and other commitments
There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2013 
(2012: none).

Unauthorised brokers (Boiler Room Scams)
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. These are typically from overseas based 
brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US 
or UK investments. These operations are commonly known 
as boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
● ● Make sure you get the correct name of the person and 
organisation.
● ● Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA 
before getting involved by visiting:
www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do
● ● Report the matter to the FCA either by calling their 
Consumer Helpline 0800 111 6768 or by completing an 
online form at:
www.fca.org.uk/scams
● ● If the calls persist, hang up.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be 
eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. 
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company 
endorses will only be included in Company mailings. 
Keep in mind that it is very unlikely that an authorised firm 
that you have no relationship with would contact you out 
of the blue offering to buy or sell shares or offer other 
investment opportunities.
More detailed information can be found on the FCA website:
www.fca.org.uk

Identity theft
Tips for protecting your ITV plc shares:
● ● Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold 
your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
● ● Keep all correspondence from Capita in a safe place, or 
destroy correspondence by shredding.
● ● If you change address inform Capita in writing or via the 
Shareholder Portal. If you receive a letter from Capita 
regarding a change of address but have not recently 
moved please contact them immediately.
● ● Consider having your dividend paid directly into your bank. 
This will reduce the risk of the cheque being intercepted 
or lost in the post.
● ● If you change your bank account, inform Capita of the 
details of your new account. You can do this via post or 
online using the Shareholder Portal. Respond to any 
letters Capita sends you about this.
● ● If you are buying or selling shares only deal with brokers 
registered in your country of residence or the UK.

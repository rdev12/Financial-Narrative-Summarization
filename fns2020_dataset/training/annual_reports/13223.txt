Chairman’s statement
We remain focused on growth
I am pleased to report that Regus has delivered another year of record results
this year, surpassing £100 million of post-tax earnings for the ﬁrst time.
The business model continues to work well
with proﬁtability growth from our mature sites
and recent expansions driving our ability to both
return cash to stakeholders as well as invest in
further capacity growth.
In the year to 31 December 2007 we grew
our average available workstations by 23.9%.
At the same time as increasing capacity we
have also returned £20.6 million to shareholders
and still increased our net cash balance from
£23.4 million to £101.4 million.
Financial performance
Group revenue has increased by 26.8% to
£862.4 million and gross proﬁt by 36.8% to
£251.9 million. Excluding the impact of new
centre growth the “like for like” improvement
was 7.0% and 20.9% respectively. This overall
result was driven by average occupancy
increasing to 82.7% from 81.8% in 2006 and
revenue per available workstation (“REVPAW”)
increasing 2.3% from £6,340 to £6,487.
Earnings (proﬁt after tax) grew by 25.9% to
£103.6 million and basic earnings per share
increased by 25.0% to 10.5p.
Sustaining growth
Our strategic expansion remains a controlled
blend of organic growth and carefully targeted
acquisitions. During the ﬁnancial year, we
opened 146 centres for a total investment
of £68.7 million.
Looking forward we expect to be able to
continue this balanced expansion programme.
Dividend
Given this strong performance the Board is
recommending a 67% increase in the total
dividend per share to 1.0p for the year.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the
2008 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will be paid on
30 May 2008 to shareholders on the register
at the close of business on 2 May 2008.
Our stakeholders
The Group recognises its economic, social
and environmental impacts on society through
its operations and interaction with all key
stakeholders, including our investors,
customers, landlords, suppliers and employees.
Accordingly, we continue to be focused on,
and committed to, managing our business in
a responsible and positive manner to address
these impacts. Critical to achieving this will
be our people, who continue to play a pivotal
role in delivering our goals and ensuring our
customers experience continually high
standards. I personally want to extend my
thanks to all of our staff for their continued
commitment and efforts throughout 2007.
Looking forward
While clearly aware of potential adverse market
conditions we believe our business model is
capable of delivering further proﬁtable growth
in 2008.

Directors’ Report Business Review
Chief Executive’s review
A focused business model
Our strategy remains one of measured and sustainable growth.
By keeping focused on our consistent, long term
strategy – that of measured, sustainable growth
– we have been able to demonstrate our ability to
deliver continued beneﬁts for all of our stakeholders.
Through the ongoing implementation of our
core strategy of controlled, disciplined growth
– via both organic expansion in existing and
new markets and acquisitions – the Group
has delivered substantial workstation growth
in all regions during 2007. Average workstations
grew 25,681 or 23.9% to 132,938 during 2007.
The total number of available workstations
at 31 December 2007 was 142,601. If
non-consolidated workstations arising from
franchise operations, joint ventures and
managed ofﬁces are also taken into account,
the total number of workstations under
management increases to 155,270.
We have seen the number of centres we operate
increase by 128, including franchises, joint
ventures and managed ofﬁces. New locations
include Kolkata in India, Winnipeg in Canada,
Lille in France, Turin in Italy and we opened our
ﬁrst centres in Bulgaria, Qatar, Jordan, Kenya
and New Zealand. The largest Regus centre, the
Regus Silver Centre in Shanghai with over 1,400
workstations, opened for business in January 2007.
Strategy and objectives
Throughout 2007, we have remained clear on
our strategic approach, which at its core seeks
to ensure continued proﬁtable growth and
cash generation driven by a scalable business
model with considerable potential for further
development. With a substantial existing
footprint of established, performing centres
forming a network across 70 countries, we
have been able to leverage these assets for
long term growth and value creation for
shareholders, and also to continue to grow
in line with our strategic short and longer
term goals.
Central to this strategy is driving continued
improvement in
• our brand and products
• our systems and technology
• our processes

Business model
A scalable business model with considerable potential
for further development.
Future prospects
We believe that we are in a good position to capitalise
on our flexible product offering which makes us an ideal
choice for many companies in times of uncertainty.
The unique nature of our business will ensure
that we continue to drive sustainable growth:
Strategy
Our consistent long term strategy is that of measured,
sustainable growth to maximise benefits for our stakeholders.
2007 has been another very successful year
for the Group, with excellent growth in revenues,
proﬁtability, earnings per share and cash
generation all resulting in a fourth successive
year of record results. I am particularly pleased
to have passed for the ﬁrst time the milestone
of achieving £100 million of earnings. Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 7
and more generally, in our knowledge of existing
and future markets. Our people will continue to
be the engineers of change in this respect.
Brand and product development
By continuing to develop and reﬁne our product
and service portfolio we recognise that our
customers’ needs are continually evolving,
in different ways, around our global network.
Our core business continues to be driven by
regionally targeted campaigns which focus
on local speciﬁcs but also leverage global
strategies. Examples of such targeted
campaigns which have driven our brand and
product recognition include 1.2 million mail
shots to homes in the UK and 870,000 targeted
e-mail communications to prospective ofﬁce
customers across the 41 countries in EMEA.
In addition, during 2007, we launched our
Business Lounge concept in both the UK
and US, and have continued to invest in our
Membership card initiative. We are conﬁdent
that as our scale increases, the ability for
Regus to offer continued, enhanced operational
beneﬁts to our customers will also increase.
I am delighted to see our card membership
levels doubling in 2007.
Systems and technology
We have also continued to invest in our systems
and technology.
The roll-out of our internally developed inventory,
reservation and billing system across our
worldwide network has proceeded well. By
31 December 2007, we had 495 of our centres
utilising this technology in their day to day
operations. This system will deliver tangible
improvements in our customers’ day to day
experiences with Regus.
The second half of 2007 saw a refresh of our
website – part of our objective of developing
further the Regus brand. This has already
started to show measurable improvements
in our customers’ website experience, notably
in site navigation, as well as driving an increase
in enquiry conversion levels globally.
Finally, Regus continues to operate the world’s
largest video-conferencing network from the
perspective of global reach. We have continued
to see an increase in demand and usage for
this product during 2007, reﬂecting what we
believe to be an increasing recognition by our
customers of environmental concerns coupled
with a desire for a cost-effective business driver.
1
Our priorities for 2008 A leading strategy for growth
Expanding our network
We will continue to grow our network in key cities
where we have minimal representation, expand into
new markets and, within the Asia Pacific market,
continue to consolidate and develop our position
as the largest provider of serviced offices.
Innovative products and services
The re-launched Membership card recognises the
mobility demands of our customers and we will
continue to extol the clear benefits that this initiative
provides to our thousands of customers worldwide.
Investments in systems and technology
The refresh of our website has now encompassed
33 countries, with another 26 in test and due for
implementation in early 2008. We anticipate the
implementation and use of our internally developed
inventory, reservation and billing system within our
entire network by the end of 2008.

Processes
During 2007, we have further developed our
business processes and procedures throughout
our network.
The rollout of our internally developed inventory,
reservation and billing system has been a
signiﬁcant enabler of this allowing us to drive
consistent structured processes across all our
regions of operation. We see beneﬁts in this
scalable model not only to our existing centres,
but also to all future new centre openings
and acquisitions.
We have implemented improvements to our
Human Resources (HR) systems in certain
of our regions, allowing us to capture more
effectively all HR data in one place, with
substantial process beneﬁts for employees
and for managing our growing workforce. An
example of this is the successful implementation
of HR.Net, a web-enabled system throughout
EMEA, which has allowed us to move away
from a large number of local limited functionality
manually managed HR applications.
Throughout the year, we have also continued to
ensure our growth plans are supported by strong
administration frameworks, encompassing local
ﬁnance, HR, procurement and operations teams
where required, whilst at the same time
employing subject matter experts in regional
centres or head ofﬁce. A central operations
function, based in the UK and established in
2007, has also allowed us to identify areas of
operational compliance improvement throughout
our network, with the result being stronger
controls and tangible revenue beneﬁts.
People
Our results in 2007 would not have been
possible had it not been for our 4,730 team
members throughout the world and I extend
my thanks to each of them for their commitment
and enthusiasm. Their continued customer-
focused ethos and approach have seen
improvements in operational execution and
levels of satisfaction throughout our network.
We will continue to seek to employ the best
candidates, and to encourage their growth and
development through vesting appropriate levels
of responsibility and challenge for each role.
We recognise our employees’ achievements in a
variety of ways, be it through internal recognition
or in ongoing career development within our
regional training centres. During 2007, Regus
invested a substantial amount in the training
and development of its people, with several
signiﬁcant programmes offered including: Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 9
• structured training for newly hired General
Managers (“GMs”) and Operational Managers
(“OMs”). Throughout our regions, over
485 GMs and OMs completed this three-week
induction course during the year.
• sales and operations training for GMs and
OMs (all regions);
• online learning programmes accessed and
delivered via the web;
• Management Development for Area Directors
(“ADs”) in the Americas (to be launched
globally in 2008); and
• General Human Resources and Supervisory
training led by the EMEA HR Team.
The outputs of these courses have been
signiﬁcant, with positive feedback from
participants coupled with tangible outputs
in increased sales levels shortly thereafter.
Regus has also invested in establishing
professional trainers in Asia Paciﬁc, EMEA and
the UK to complement the internal training team
in the Americas, and we anticipate continuing to
strengthen the Global Training teams’ resources
and global reach during 2008.
Outlook
While clearly the current economic climate
remains uncertain we believe we are in a
good position to continue growing proﬁtably.
Our global footprint means that we can capitalise
on opportunities wherever they exist and in
particular in the developing markets. Our
revenues in the “BRIC” economies and the
“N11” grew 45.7% and 28.6% respectively in
2007 and we expect these signiﬁcant growth
rates to continue.
As the business has grown, inherent risk
has been extensively diversiﬁed as we have
acquired a broader range of customers across
geographies, business segments and size
categories. Our cost base is also signiﬁcantly
more ﬂexible as we increase the number of
ﬂexible leases in our portfolio and we reduce
our exposure to longer leases.
The year has started well with enquiries showing
no sign of weakness. We believe that we are in
a good position to capitalise on our ﬂexible
product offering which makes us an ideal choice
for many companies in times of uncertainty.
Overall we look forward to generating further
proﬁtable growth in 2008.

two of these new centres, with the balance of

delivered revenues of £208.1 million – up 23.6%
on the full year 2006 – and achieved an average
occupancy in the 2006 acquired centres of 84%
through the year (2006: 77% post-acquisition).
On 19 April 2006, the remaining 58% interest in
Regus UK was acquired for a gross consideration
(including fees) of £89.4 million. At the date of
acquisition our UK business operated 91 centres.
In the full year 2006, Regus UK generated
revenues of £168.4 million.
Since acquisition, we have seen a signiﬁcant
increase in occupancy – rising from 72% at
April 2006 to 84% during 2007. A restructured
management team, renewed investment in our
centres and in targeted marketing and a drive
on enquiry development and conversion has
helped to achieve this improved performance.
Outlook
Looking ahead in 2008 we will continue to drive
margin improvements through higher enquiries

Performance
Our business in Asia operates in 92 centres
across 13 countries. During the year we opened
25 new centres, which increased the average
number of workstations from 9,009 in 2006 to
14,748 in 2007. Acquisitions accounted for
three of these new centres, with the balance of
22 coming from the opening of 21 fully owned
centres and one managed centre. During the
year, we opened one centre in the new market
of New Zealand. The region delivered revenues
of £77.7 million – up 52.7% on 2006 – and
achieved an average mature occupancy of
82% through the year (2006: 77%).
Outlook
Looking ahead into 2008 we will continue to
consolidate and develop our position as the
largest provider of serviced ofﬁces across all
Asia Paciﬁc markets. To achieve this objective
we plan to continue our aggressive growth
plan while continuing to improve the efﬁciency
of our current portfolio of centres. To facilitate
this increase in demand and capitalise on scale
efﬁciencies we will be adding a new customer
service centre in the Philippines to handle all
customer enquiries.

Directors’ Report Business Review
Corporate responsibility
Driving competitive advantage
We increasingly view Corporate Responsibility as central to our business strategy
and as a critical driver to the sustainable growth of our business.
The global footprint which Regus has established
brings with it considerable responsibilities, and
we are committed to managing our business
in a responsible manner, continually identifying
opportunities to make a positive contribution
to our local communities.
Corporate Responsibility Committee
In 2007, we established a formal Corporate
Responsibility (“CR”) Committee to oversee CR
strategy, encompassing members from a variety
of areas in our business. The Committee’s aim is
focused on ensuring that we take a sustainable
approach to business, considering the
economic, social and environmental impacts
which matter most to our key stakeholders.
The remit of the Committee is primarily to provide
strategic direction and guidance on all aspects
of business practice and responsibility and
ensure consistent implementation.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee will
meet at a minimum quarterly to:
• Assess social, environmental and ethical risks
• Develop CR strategy
• Review our social, ethical and environmental
policies and practices
• Identify opportunities to improve the
effectiveness and sustainability of the business
• Review, agree, monitor and report on corporate
responsibility Key Performance Indicators
• Improve stakeholder awareness
In 2007, we also commissioned an independent,
third party report focused on identifying what CR
practices could lead to a sustainable competitive
advantage. This report was primarily focused
on our UK operations, but its core outputs are
scalable to our global network. The underlying
conclusions of the report identiﬁed the following;
People: for employees, career advancement,
structured training, work/life balance and a
clearer recognition of their efforts would lead to
greater employee CR engagement.
Environment and sustainability: a core priority
amongst customers and suppliers is a clearly
communicated policy, and the implementation
of simple tools, systems and processes for
reducing the Group’s environmental impact.
Business Partners: a desire in both our customers
and suppliers for building longer term relationships
which support their business and values.
Community: clearer and more deﬁned policies
need to be implemented with respect to
philanthropic and community initiatives and
ensuring that these are communicated.
Accordingly, partly as a result of this research
and partly due to our underlying commitment
to positive development in CR, we anticipate
that our CR Priorities for 2008 will include:
• Establishing and communicating a more formal
CR Framework
• Implementing an updated environmental policy
and guidelines
• Continuing the development of employee
talent planning/appraisal processes and
career development initiatives
• Continued customer focus – maintaining high
quality services and expanding our offerings
• Identifying more clearly and consistently the
core philanthropic and community initiatives
Regus is committed to supporting
People
With over 4,700 employees throughout our
70 countries, most of whom are interfacing
directly with our customers, our people are
critical to our success. Our goals are aligned
with those CR practices most likely to drive
employee engagement.
Our primary aim remains to maximise and
develop the skills of our team members, Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 19
providing clear opportunities for career
advancement and recognition whilst at the same
time ensuring an appropriate work/life balance.
The global roll out of Management training for
our Area Directors in 2008, coupled with more
local HR and supervisory training, demonstrates
our commitment to a clearly deﬁned training
framework, driven by a growing global training
team. Over the past 18 months, investment in this
training has exceeded £750,000, or approximately
£750 for each of the team members who have
received this formal training.
A Group-wide Code of Ethics sets out a number
of fundamental principles which all our companies
and employees are required to follow, and are
complemented by local practices which recognise
regional speciﬁcs. We continue to operate a
conﬁdential whistle blowing service to support
employees who want to eliminate wrongdoing
in the workplace, and monitor the ﬁndings of
this service both immediately at a local level
and quarterly at a senior management level
to ensure an adequate response.
Environment and sustainability
The focus of our environmental efforts continues
to be to minimise potentially harmful impacts
of our business wherever we can. Although our
operations already have a limited impact due to
the nature of our business, the product offerings
we can deliver have potentially signiﬁcant
incremental positive impacts to the environment:
• Video-conferencing; we commenced an
assessment of the number of air miles saved
during 2007 and estimate that over 10 million
air miles were saved during the last ﬁve
months of 2007
• Regional, National, Global networks; with an
increased focus on mitigating pressure on
existing transport infrastructures, our network
of ofﬁces regionally and globally continues
to offer signiﬁcant scope for reducing the
environmental impact of longer distance
journeys and times
• Ofﬁces; we have continued to push for
enhanced use of low-wattage light bulbs,
a greater array of recycling options and the
sourcing of energy and utilities from suppliers
focused on energy conservation standards
throughout our network
Business Partners
Our customers are our business and developing
long term relationships with them is a critical
facet of our strategy. We have continued to
monitor the levels of customer satisfaction
throughout our business via questionnaires
and exit interviews and this feedback forms
an integral part of our centres’ ongoing
performance tracking. Our “mystery shopper”
initiative continued throughout 2007, and has
driven tangible improvements in performance,
attitudes and behaviour of customer-facing staff
by providing tangible feedback about each sales
person’s customer handling technique. It has
also allowed us to embed greater consistency
in the standards in and around each centre.
We also promote long term relationships with
our business partners and our operations work
closely with suppliers to maintain the service
expected by our customers.
Community
We have continued to be active supporters of
local communities and charities, be this through
direct fundraising initiatives by our employees,
through reduced price space provision or via
other means. We are focused on providing
longer term beneﬁts through maintaining an
ongoing relationship with our charities and
communities, which allows the Company,
participants and recipients to beneﬁt from clearly
experiencing and developing these partnerships.
Direct beneﬁciaries of Company and employee-
led initiatives during the year have included:
• Great Causes and Debra via the 2007 London
Triathlon (£15,000 of direct contributions)
• Worldwide Fund for Nature and Make a
Wish Foundation, Australia (ofﬁce and service
beneﬁts at reduced or no cost)
• The Rainbow Children’s Hospice, UK (all funds
from recycling toner cartridges)
• St Michael’s School, Uganda (computers
for schools) 20_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Business Review
Financial review
Market leading growth
We have produced another record performance delivering earnings of over
£100 million with our net cash also now exceeding £100 million.
The business model continues to work well.
In addition to seeing proﬁtability improvements
from the sites we opened and acquired in 2006
we are continuing to see the proﬁtability of
our older more mature sites improve. This has
enabled us to both grow the strength of our
balance sheet while at the same time continue
our expansion programme which then forms
the basis for future proﬁtable growth.
Taking the business as a whole, we grew its
capacity as measured by the weighted average
number of workstations by 23.9% to 132,938.
At the same time the average occupancy of
these workstations increased from 81.8% to
82.7% and we sold each one on average for 1.4%
more. This was despite the effect of adverse
exchange rate movements. At constant exchange
rates the price increase would have been 5.3%.
These factors have delivered a £40.4 million
increase in operating proﬁt rising from
£82.2 million in 2006 to £122.6 million in 2007.
Revenue and gross proﬁt (centre contribution)
Revenue for the Group rose 26.8% to
£862.4 million (2006: £680.0 million) and
gross proﬁt (centre contribution) increased
36.8% to £251.9 million (2006: £184.1 million).
This movement can be analysed in the table below:

Sterling strengthened in value against the US
dollar by an average of 8.7% in 2007 when
compared to 2006, although this was partially
offset by a weakening of sterling against the
euro. This reduced our revenue by £24.8 million
and contribution by £7.1 million. However, this
exchange impact was then more than offset
by improvements in the underlying business.
Our mature or “like for like” business increased
its revenues by £61.1 million and contribution
by £41.5 million driven by improvements in
occupancy and price.
Centres that were added in 2006 contributed a
further £115.7 million of revenue and £39.7 million
of contribution, heavily driven by the impact of
the UK acquisition and its continued growth.
The Group purchased the remaining 58% interest
in Regus UK and acquired full control of the
ﬁnancial and operating policies of the UK
business on 19 April 2006.
The overall increase arising from 2006 centres
can be analysed:
(£ million) Revenue Gross proﬁt
Improvement arising
from UK 74.2 23.2
Improvements elsewhere
in the Group 41.5 16.5
Overall improvement
from 2006 centres 115.7 39.7
New centres added in 2007, both organic and by
acquisition, contributed a further £36.6 million of
revenue but reduced contribution by £4.7 million
due to the normal start-up losses incurred in
establishing new centres.
The year on year impact of centre closures was to
reduce revenue by £6.2 million and contribution
by £1.6 millon.
Taking all this together contribution margins
improved from 27.1% to 29.2%.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by
£27.4 million in 2007 compared to 2006 although
remained at a constant 15% of revenues.
This investment reﬂects the year on year impact
of the UK acquisition as well as substantial and
continued investment in our infrastructure, in our
people and in process efﬁciencies, with a particular
focus on leveraging savings in procurement and
centre operations as our network continues to
expand. In addition, there has been considerable
investment in enhancing our marketing
capabilities, incorporating a re-launch of our
website, recruitment of a core number of sector
experts and a strengthening of our regional
teams to ensure a consistent marketing
message globally.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt was £122.6 million (2006:
£82.2 million), representing a margin of 14.2%
(2006: 12.1%).
Share of proﬁt in joint ventures and associates
In the 12 months ended 31 December 2007, the
share of joint venture proﬁts attributable to Regus
increased to £0.8 million (2006: £0.1 million loss).
This reﬂected the improving proﬁtability in mature
joint ventures in the Americas and EMEA regions
as well as improved performance from joint
ventures in the Middle East that commenced
trading at the end of 2006. These improvements
were partially offset by normal losses from new
joint ventures commenced in 2007.
During the period 1 January 2006 to 19 April
2006, the UK business was equity accounted as
an associate. Following the acquisition of the UK
business on 19 April 2006 the business became
fully consolidated as a subsidiary. 22_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Business Review
Financing costs
Financing costs can be analysed as follows:
(£ million) 2007 2006
Interest payable on bank loans (4.4) (4.6)
Interest receivable 3.4 1.8
Finance lease interest (0.2) (0.5)
Non-cash: Amortisation of deferred ﬁnancing fees (0.5) (0.4)
Non-cash: UK acquisition related (2.3) (2.1)
Total net ﬁnancing costs (4.0) (5.8)
The lower interest payable reﬂects the reduction
in the Group’s average debt over the year, largely
offset by the impact of rising interest rates in the
Group’s primary markets. The average Libor rate
for 2007 was 5.85% compared to 4.79% for 2006.
The substantial increase in interest receivable
reﬂects a continued increase in the Group’s
average free cash balance to £81.4 million
(£49.7 million in 2006) and the average increase
in global interest rates year over year. The
movement in the cash balance is explained
in the cash ﬂow section below.
Underlying ﬁnance lease costs have fallen in
line with the reduction in ﬁnance leases. The
amortisation of deferred ﬁnancing fees relates
to loan arrangement costs incurred for the new
credit facilities entered into during 2006 to fund
the UK acquisition and reﬂects a full 12 months
of amortisation in 2007 compared to a partial
period in 2006. The unwinding of discounted fair
value adjustments on the Regus UK acquisition
resulted in a non-cash net ﬁnancing charge of
£2.3 million in the period to 31 December 2007,
an increase compared to 2006 reﬂecting the
timing of the UK acquisition in 2006.
Taxation
The continued improvements in the Group
results have meant that there are less
unrecognised losses available to be offset in
the income statement against rising current
tax charges. Consequently, the Group has
recognised a £15.8 million tax charge for the
period (representing an accounting tax rate of
13% of proﬁt before tax) compared to a credit
of £4.8 million in the comparative period.
The current tax charge for the period was
£22.3 million (2006: £8.1 million charge) – an
increase from 10% to 19% of proﬁt before tax.
Deferred tax was a £6.5 million credit in the
period (2006: £12.9 million credit) which includes
the adverse impact of the reduction in the UK
corporation tax rate on the deferred tax asset.
On a cash tax basis the Group paid £16.1 million
in tax. This represents approximately 13.5% of
proﬁt before tax compared to 8.5% in the same
period in 2006.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for the year increased
25.0% from 8.4p to 10.5p. The average number
of shares in issue during the year reﬂected the
re-purchase of 12,853,001 Regus shares in June
and December 2007 and therefore reduced to
980,961,569 (2006: 984,791,524).
Cash ﬂow
Strong operating cash ﬂow remains a prime
feature and continued objective of the Group.
The improvement in operating proﬁt and an
improved working capital performance resulted
in the operating cash ﬂow increasing by
£78.3 million to £211.1 million (2006:
£132.8 million). Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 23
The Group’s cash ﬂow statement has been summarised below.
(£ million) 2007 2006
Cash generated from operations 211.1 132.8
Tax and net interest paid (16.9) (10.1)
Maintenance capex (29.8) (19.7)
Free cash ﬂow 164.4 103.0
New centre openings (50.9) (26.7)
UK acquisition – (61.4)
Other acquisitions and JV investments (17.8) (27.1)
Loan repayment, share buyback and dividend (37.6) 23.0
Exercises of share options 0.5 –
Change in cash 58.6 10.8
Opening cash 80.9 74.1
Change in cash 58.6 10.8
Effect of exchange rates on cash held 3.4 (4.0)
Closing cash 142.9 80.9
The strong cash performance has enabled the Group to invest in growth. Speciﬁcally, during the
year, 101 new centres were opened at a cost of £50.9 million. A further 43 business centres plus
two joint ventures were acquired for a net cash consideration of £17.8 million.
To highlight, during the year, the Group has
• repaid to our investors £20.6 million through both our share buyback and dividend activity
• reduced our debt by £17.0 million
and still ended the year with an increased cash position.
This can be can be analysed as follows:
(£ million) 2007 2006
Cash and cash equivalents 142.9 80.9
Bank and other loans (40.3) (54.2)
Finance leases (1.5) (3.9)
Un-amortised ﬁnancing fees 0.3 0.6
Financial assets 101.4 23.4
Overall the Group enters 2008 in a strong ﬁnancial position to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.

The Board is committed to the high standards of corporate
governance set out in the Combined Code published in

1 November 2006. The Board is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders and this report describes how the Board applied
the principles of good governance.
The Board
At 31 December 2007, the Board of Directors was made up
of seven members comprising the Chairman, three executive
directors and three non-executive directors. Biographical
details of the directors are set out on pages 24 and 25.
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial
leadership and to review the overall strategic development
of the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan and
the annual budget and reviews performance against targets
at every meeting. Through the Audit Committee, the directors
ensure the integrity of ﬁnancial information and the effectiveness
of financial controls and the internal control and risk management
system. The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration
Committee to set the remuneration policy for directors and
senior management. The Nomination Committee recommends
the appointment of Board directors and has responsibility
for succession planning at Board level. The various Board
Committees have authority to make decisions in their areas
of expertise.
Frequency of meetings
There were six scheduled Board meetings during 2007.
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and
individual attendance by the directors are shown below.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its
decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers
of decision. These include:
• Approval of regulatory announcements including the interim
and annual ﬁnancial statements
• Terms of reference and membership of the Board and
its Committees
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure
• Changes to the Group’s management and control structure
• Capital investment in excess of £1 million
• Material contracts (annual value in excess of £5 million)
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions and decisions and all
directors are encouraged to request inclusion of any unresolved
concerns that they may have in the Board minutes.
Roles of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman
John Matthews is responsible for leadership of the Board, setting
its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures effective
communication with shareholders and that the Board is aware of
the views of major shareholders. He facilitates both the contribution
of the non-executive directors and constructive relations between
the executive directors and non-executive directors.
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, are
responsible for ensuring all directors are properly briefed on
issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and
timely access to relevant information.
The Chairman is not deemed to be independent because he
has been a non-executive director for more than ten years.
The Chief Executive
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision-
making and responsibilities accordingly.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each bring their own senior level
of experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent
counsel brought to the Group by the non-executives enhances
the overall decision making of the Board. Non-executives are
appointed for an initial three-year term, subject to election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
after their appointment.
The Board consider the non-executive directors to be
independent. Roger Orf has been a director for over nine years,
which would ordinarily render him not to be independent under
the Code. However, having taken into account his senior role
within Citigroup, his sound commercial judgment and his
considerable contribution to the Company and its governance,
the Board considers that he remains independent. Roger has
never received an award under any employee share scheme
operated by the Company and there are no plans to make
any such award to him.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for advising
the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters
Governance framework Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 29
and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken of all Board
meetings and discussions. The appointment and removal of
the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain of its governance responsibilities
to the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the Board
Committees and minutes of meetings are circulated to all
Board members.
The terms of reference of these Committees have been
documented and approved by the Board and are available on
the Company’s website www.regus.com. A brief summary of
the members, activities and terms of reference of the Board
Committees is provided below.
Audit Committee
Roger Orf (Chairman until 10 March 2008)
Stephen East (Chairman from 10 March 2008)
Martin Robinson
The Board has delegated the responsibility for applying an
effective system of internal control and compliance, accurate
external ﬁnancial reporting, fulﬁlling its obligations under law
and the Combined Code, and managing the relationship with
the Company’s external auditors to the Audit Committee.
The Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors.
The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year. At the
request of the Chairman, the external auditors, the executive
directors, the Company Secretary and the Head of Risk
Management attend each meeting.
Summary terms of reference:
• Financial reporting – provide support to the Board by monitoring
the integrity of the published ﬁnancial statements of the Group
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s
ﬁnancial performance, and ensuring that they comply fully
with the relevant statutes and accounting standards.
• Internal control and risk systems – review the effectiveness of
the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems.
• Internal audit – monitor and review the annual internal audit
programme ensuring that the internal audit function is
adequately resourced and free from management restrictions,
review and monitor responses to the ﬁndings and
recommendations of the internal auditors.
• External audit – the Committee advises the Board on the
appointment, re-appointment, remuneration and removal of
the external auditors. The Committee has the opportunity to
meet with the external auditors without senior management
being present.
• Employee concerns – the Committee reviews the Company’s
arrangements under which employees may in conﬁdence
raise any concerns regarding possible wrongdoing in ﬁnancial
reporting or other matters. The Committee ensures that
these arrangements allow proportionate and independent
investigation and appropriate follow up action.
The Committee also meets independently with the Company’s
auditors and with the Head of Risk Management to informally
discuss matters of interest.
External auditors
KPMG Audit Plc were the Company’s auditors for the year
ended 31 December 2007. For 2008, the Committee has
recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint
KPMG Audit Plc as the Company’s auditors be proposed at
the AGM. The Committee will continue to keep under review
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors,
the effectiveness of the audit process and the rotation of
the lead audit partner.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the
Company’s external auditor is monitored and, above certain
thresholds, requires prior approval from the Committee to
ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not
impair their independence or objectivity. During the year,
KPMG performed due diligence work on certain acquisitions.
KPMG is prohibited from providing services that would be
considered to jeopardise their independence such as
bookkeeping services, valuations and system design.

performance and leadership were discussed informally by
the Board as a whole.
Summary terms of reference:
• Board appointment and composition – to regularly review
the structure, size and composition of the Board and make
recommendations on the role and nomination of directors for
appointment and reappointment to the Board for the purpose
of ensuring a balanced Board in respect of skills, knowledge
and experience. 30_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Corporate Governance

and commercial matters affecting the Company and to keep
under review the leadership needs of the organisation to
enable it to compete effectively.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have
an impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group
has a risk management structure in place designed to identify,
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment and
evaluation is an essential part of the annual planning,
budgeting and forecasting cycle.
The directors have identiﬁed the following principal risks and
uncertainties affecting the Company. These do not constitute
all of the risks facing the Group.
Economic downturn in signiﬁcant markets
The Group has a signiﬁcant proportion of its centres in the
Americas (predominantly the USA) and UK. An economic
downturn in these markets could adversely affect the Group’s
operating revenues thereby reducing operating performance
or, in an extreme downturn, resulting in operating losses.
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
• The Group has entered into performance-based leases with
landlords where rent costs vary with revenues earned by
the centre.
• Building lease contracts include break clauses at periodic
intervals to allow the Group to exit leases should they become
onerous. In cities with a number of centres this allows the
Group to stagger leases such that an orderly reduction in
exposure to the location may be facilitated.
• The proﬁle of clients in a centre is continually reviewed to
avoid undue reliance on a particular client or clients in a
particular industry group.
Additionally, in the event of a downturn, the Group has a
number of options for mitigating losses, for example by
closing centres at lease break points.
The Group’s strategy also focuses its growth into emerging
markets that will reduce the proportion of the Group’s revenue
generated from the USA and UK over time and provide better
protection to the Group from an economic downturn in a
single country.
Exposure to movements in property markets
A number of the Group’s lease contracts contain market rent
review clauses. This means that the costs of these leases may
vary as a result of external movements in the property market.
In particular, in the UK, lease contracts typically contain
‘upward only’ rent reviews which means that should open
market rents decrease, then Regus could be exposed to
paying higher than market rent in these locations.
If the Group is unable to pass on increased rent costs to
customers due to local property market conditions then this
could result in reduced proﬁtability or operating losses in
these markets.
Equally, for Group lease contracts without market rent review
clauses, the Group may beneﬁt from paying below market rent
in a market with increasing open market rents. This may allow
the Group to improve proﬁtability if the movements in open
market rents are passed on to clients.
Exposure to movements in exchange rates
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas operations whose
businesses are generally conducted in the currency of the
country in which they operate. The principal exposures of the
Group are to the US dollar and the euro, with approximately
37% of the Group’s revenues being attributable to the US
dollar and 20% to the euro respectively.
Given that transactions generally take place in the functional
currency of Group companies, the Group’s exposure to
transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. However, the
translation into sterling of overseas proﬁts and net assets will
be affected by prevailing exchange rates. In the event that
either the US dollar or euro were to signiﬁcantly depreciate
or appreciate against sterling, this would have an adverse or
beneﬁcial impact to the Group’s reported performance and
position respectively.
Governance framework continued Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 31
The ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of the
Group, together with an analysis of the exposure to such risks
as required by the Companies Act 1985, are set out in note 23
of the Accounts. Wherever possible, the Group attempts to
create natural hedges against currency exposures through
matching income and expense and assets and liabilities in the
same currency. The Group does not hedge proﬁt translation
exposure since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining a sound
system of internal control and for periodically reviewing
its effectiveness.
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined
Code”, an ongoing process has been established for identifying,
managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. The
Group’s system of internal controls is designed to:
• facilitate the effective and efﬁcient response to risks which
might affect the achievement of the Group’s objectives
• safeguard assets from inappropriate use or from loss or fraud
• help ensure the quality of internal and external ﬁnancial reporting
• help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system
of controls helps to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally
be prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for
appropriate action.
Strategy and risk management
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, quarterly
plans and performance targets for 2008 have been set by the
executive directors and are regularly reviewed by the main
Board in the context of the Group’s overall objectives.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks
and their ﬁnancial implications are appraised by the responsible
executives as a part of the budget process and these are
endorsed by regional management. Key risks are reported to
the Board and the Audit Committee. The appropriateness of
controls is considered by the executives, having regard to
cost/beneﬁt, materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising.
Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are regularly
considered by the Board and are formally reviewed and
approved by the Board annually.
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at all
levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place to
support this:
• the induction process is used to educate new team members on
the standards required from them in their role, including business
ethics and compliance, regulations and internal policies
• all team members are provided with a copy of the “Team
Member Handbook” which contains detailed guidance on
employee policies and the standards of behaviour required
of staff
• policies and procedures manuals and guidelines are readily
accessible through the Group’s intranet site
• operational audit and self-certiﬁcation tools which require
individual centre managers to conﬁrm their adherence to
Group policies and procedures.
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the Group’s policy
to recruit and develop appropriately skilled management and
staff of high calibre, integrity and with appropriate disciplines.
The Group has also established an externally hosted whistle
blowing channel to all staff to report issues and concerns
in conﬁdence.
Control processes
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the year
and up to 14 March 2008, the date of approval of this Annual
Report, which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for
directors on the Combined Code. These include the following:
• The Board normally meets together with regional executives
every six months to carry out a wide-ranging review of Group
and regional ﬁnancial performance, business development
opportunities, Group infrastructure and general Group
management issues.
• The annual budget process is driven by senior management.
Budgets are prepared at a detailed level by business centre
and roll-up at a country and regional level. The executive
directors review regional budgets to ensure consistency with
regional strategic objectives, and the ﬁnal budget is reviewed
and approved by the Board. The approved budget forms the
basis of business management throughout the year.
• Operational reports and ﬁnancial reports are prepared and
distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results
are reviewed against budget and forecast and explanations
are received for all material movements. 32_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
• Key policies and control procedures (including ﬁnance,
operations, and health and safety) are documented in manuals
having Group-wide application. These are available to all staff
on the Group’s intranet system.
• The Board has formal procedures in place for the review and
approval of investment and acquisition projects. The Group
Investment Committee (comprising the executive directors)
review all investments prior to approval by the Board. The
form and content of investment proposals is standardised
to facilitate the review process.
• The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard
to the approval of transactions. Purchase orders must be
obtained in advance for all purchases in excess of £1,000.
• Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales and
operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to
provide management at all levels with performance data for
their area of responsibility which helps them to focus on
operational issues that may require their input.
Information and communications processes
The senior management team are integrally involved in the
business and to this extent regularly discuss and address
issues and opportunities with regional and functional teams.
Formal business review meetings, chaired by Mark Dixon,
are held with the regional teams and functional heads on
a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include general information on
the business from senior management as well as operational
guidance on changes in policies and procedures.
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend
sales or management conferences at which information on
operational issues is shared, the most recent global conference
was held in February 2007. Delegates present the key
messages to employees who did not attend the event.
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board at
various times during the year in the conduct of its review of
internal controls:
• Review of the Group’s monthly management accounts which
contain detailed analysis of ﬁnancial performance for the Group
and each of the Group’s geographic reporting segments.
• An ongoing process of review, through Board meetings, senior
management meetings and divisional reviews as well as other
management meetings, for the formal identiﬁcation of
signiﬁcant operational risks and mitigating control processes.
• Internal audit reviews of key risk areas. The ﬁndings and
recommendations of each review are reported to management
and the Audit Committee.
• Quarterly post-investment reviews are presented to the
Audit Committee to allow appraisal of the effectiveness
of investment activity.
• A bi-annual internal control self-assessment and management
certiﬁcation exercise covering the effectiveness of ﬁnancial
and operational controls. This is based on a comprehensive
internal control questionnaire collated and reviewed by
Internal Audit. Results and any necessary mitigating action
plans are presented to senior management and the Board.
Other matters
Board performance evaluation
During 2007, a formal annual performance evaluation has been
conducted in respect of the Board, its Committees and of each
individual director by means of an internally produced written
questionnaire. This required performance to be scored on a
scale of 1 to 5 against a number of criteria with 1 representing
a need for urgent improvement in performance, 3 representing
adequate performance and 5 representing excellent performance.
The results of these evaluations were consolidated by the Chairman
and presented to the Board for formal consideration. All criteria
were scored as adequate or better and therefore no formal
corrective actions have been initiated. The independent senior
non-executive director reviewed the Chairman’s performance.
Training and resources
Appropriate training is made available for all new directors to
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training
is provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with
the emphasis on governance and accounting developments.
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting
developments through presentations from management,
internal audit and the external auditors. The Board programme
includes presentations from management at which, together
with site visits, increases the non-executive directors’
understanding of the business and sector.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures, corporate governance and regulatory compliance
are followed and complied with. Should a director request
independent professional advice to carry out his duties,
such advice is available to him at the Company’s expense.
Governance framework continued Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 33
Directors and ofﬁcers insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually and
appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the directors
and senior management in the event of a claim being brought
against any of them in their capacity as directors and ofﬁcers
of the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders
Regus reports formally to shareholders twice a year, with
the interim results announced in August/September and the
preliminary ﬁnal results announced normally in March. There
are programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer to give presentations of these results to the Company’s
institutional investors, analysts and media in London and other
locations. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
maintain a close dialogue with institutional investors on the
Company’s performance, governance, plans and objectives.
These meetings also serve to develop an ongoing understanding
of the views and any concerns of the Company’s major
shareholders. The non-executive directors are given regular
updates as to the views of the institutional shareholders and the
Chairman is available to meet with these shareholders on
request. The principal communication with private shareholders
is through the Annual Report, the Interim Report and the AGM.
The Company has engaged the services of Brunswick Group
plc as their Investor Relations adviser.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM is held normally in May in London and is attended,
other than in exceptional circumstances, by all members of the
Board. In addition to the formal business of the meeting, there
is normally a trading update and shareholders are invited to ask
questions and are given the opportunity to meet the directors
informally afterwards.
Notice of the AGM, together with any related documents are
mailed to shareholders at least 20 days before the meeting and
separate resolutions are proposed on each issue. The level of
proxy votes cast and the balance for and against each resolution,
together with the level of abstentions, if any, are announced to
the meeting following voting by a show of hands.
Financial and other information is made available on the
Company’s website www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board
All directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders
at least every three years and directors appointed during the
period are required to seek re-election at the next AGM.
Non-executive directors are subject to the re-election
requirements and serve the Company under letters of
appointment, which have an initial three year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in
section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year ended
31 December 2007, with the exception of the following:
• Provision D.1.1 – The independent senior non-executive
director, Roger Orf, does not have regular meetings with
major external shareholders.
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to be the
main conduit with investors, rather than the independent senior
non-executive director. The Chairman participates in investor
meetings and makes himself available for questions, in person,
at the time of major announcements. The Chairman regularly
updates the Board and particularly the independent senior
non-executive director on the results of his meetings and the
opinions of investors. On this basis, Regus considers that the
independent senior non-executive director is able to gain full
awareness of the issues and concerns of major shareholders.
Notwithstanding this policy, all directors have a standing
invitation to participate in meetings with investors. Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the
annual report and ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and
parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice and applicable law.
The Group ﬁnancial statements are required by law and IFRSs
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides
in relation to such ﬁnancial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to ﬁnancial statements giving a true and
fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company ﬁnancial statements are required by
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial
statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• For the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• For the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the parent company ﬁnancial statements; and
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the parent company
and Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the parent company and to enable
them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply
with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statutory statement as to disclosure to auditors
The directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this
Directors’ Report conﬁrm that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information
of which the company’s auditor is unaware, and
• each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditor is aware of that information.

Director statements Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 35
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee
(the “Committee”) of Regus Group plc and approved by the
Board of directors of Regus Group plc. The report complies
with the UK Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
and, in compliance with such regulations, a separate resolution
approving this report is being put to shareholders at this year’s
Annual General Meeting.
This report sets out the Company’s policy on directors’
remuneration for the forthcoming year as well as information
on remuneration paid to directors during the year.
Information relating to the emoluments and pension contributions
to the directors, directors’ interests in the Company’s shares
and under Employee Share Plans has been audited.
Unaudited information
Membership and responsibilities of the Committee
The members of the Committee throughout the year were
the Company’s independent non-executive directors: Roger
Orf, Stephen East and, the Chairman of the Committee,
Martin Robinson.
The Committee met four times during the year.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations
to the Board on the compensation of senior executives and
determining, within agreed terms of reference, the speciﬁc
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to:
• make recommendations to the Board in respect of
remuneration policy for the executive directors and the
Group’s other senior management.
• approve any new service agreement entered into between
the Group and any executive director.
• make recommendations to the Board on the implementation of
the Group’s performance bonus schemes and share schemes.
The Committee receives advice on executive remuneration from
Halliwell Consulting, an external consultancy which has wide
experience of executive remuneration in UK listed companies.
Halliwell Consulting has no other connection with the Company.
Directors are not permitted, under Regus Group plc’s Articles
of Association, to vote on their own terms and conditions
of remuneration.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website, www.regus.com. The members of the
Remuneration Committee attend the Company’s AGM and
are available to answer shareholders’ questions about
directors’ remuneration.
Compliance with the best practice provisions
In accordance with the Board’s commitment to maintaining
high standards of Corporate Governance, the Committee has
complied during the year with all remuneration related aspects
of the Code during the year.
Remuneration policy
The principal objective of the Committee’s remuneration policy
is to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and
motivate people of the highest calibre and experience needed
to shape and execute the Company’s strategy and to deliver
shareholder value.
The guiding principles which the Committee has regard to and
balances as far as is practicable, in determining policy and
objectives for 2007 were:
• to ensure that it maintains a competitive package of total
compensation, commensurate with comparable packages
available with other similar companies operating in similar
markets (the “Comparator Group”);
• to make a signiﬁcant percentage of potential maximum
reward conditional on short and long-term performance;
• to ensure that the interests of the executives are closely
aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through
the provision of share-based incentives;
• to link reward to the satisfaction of targeted objectives
which are the main drivers of shareholder value; and
• to be sensitive in determining executive directors’ remuneration
to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
In order to achieve the above policy, the Committee sets the
ﬁxed elements of the executives’ compensation package at
a conservative level, taking into account the median level of
salaries in the Comparator Group. This is balanced with the
opportunity for overall compensation packages to be in the
upper quartile of the Comparator Group dependent upon
the degree to which the associated stringent performance
conditions attached to the short and long term incentive
schemes have been satisﬁed.
The table below illustrates the balance between ﬁxed and
performance related (variable) compensation for each
executive director for the year ended 31 December 2007:
Mark Dixon Rudy Lobo Stephen Gleadle
Chief Chief Chief
Executive Officer Operating Officer Financial Officer
Fixed 32.8% 30.0% 30.2%
Variable 67.2% 70.0% 69.8%
Remuneration report 36_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
Fixed compensation comprises salary, beneﬁts and pension
contributions. Variable compensation comprises the annual
bonus paid in relation to the year ended 31 December 2007
and the total fair value of share awards granted in the year.
The main elements of the packages and the performance
conditions are described below.
The Committee has recently undertaken a detailed review
of the remuneration policy and structure to ensure that it is
aligned to the Company’s strategy and that the executives are
appropriately motivated and retained to execute that strategy.
As a result of this review the following conclusions have
been drawn:
– there is a need for a greater emphasis on exceptional pay
for exceptional performance. The Committee believes that
executives should be focused on delivering exceptional returns
to shareholders over both the short and long term and given
the opportunity to receive exceptional levels of reward if such
performance is delivered; and
– where returns are conservative then total compensation
levels will be extremely conservative.
In order to bring into effect the above policy changes the
Committee is intending to:
– implement only inﬂationary salary rises (unless there is a real
requirement for otherwise) across the senior executive team;
– change how the annual bonus for the year ending
31 December 2008 is operated (see below); and
– implement a new equity incentive. Further details of this
arrangement are currently being discussed with the
Company’s major shareholders and will be set out in a circular
seeking formal shareholder approval of the new share scheme.
The Committee is of the opinion that this new policy is in line with
the Company’s long term objectives and shareholders’ interests.
Non-executive directors are remunerated with fees, set at levels
that are sufﬁcient to attract and retain their services and are in line
with market rates. The non-executive directors do not receive any
pension or other beneﬁts, other than appropriate expenses, nor
do they participate in any bonus or share option schemes.
Martin Robinson, Stephen East and Roger Orf have chosen until
further notice to use the whole of their directors’ fees (net of tax)
to purchase Regus shares in the open market on a quarterly
basis. In addition, John Matthews has chosen to use part of his
fees to purchase Regus shares in the open market.

Remuneration packages
The remuneration for executive directors during the year
comprised a basic salary, a beneﬁt package, an annual
performance based short term incentive award paid partly in
cash and partly in shares and participation in the Company’s
share incentive arrangement, the Regus Co-Investment Plan.
Basic salary and beneﬁts
The basic salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually
and any increases are effective from 1 January.
As part of the new remuneration policy focusing on exceptional
pay for exceptional performance, the pay rise for all senior
executives for 2008 will be capped at 2.5% to ensure that there
is a greater weighting towards variable remuneration. As such
the salaries for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Operating
Ofﬁcer will be £522,750 and £280,338 respectively.
However, in the case of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Committee
has increased his salary from £250,000, which was a probationary
salary agreed on his joining the Company in late 2005, to
£300,000 per annum.
Beneﬁts comprise a company car or allowance, fuel, private
medical insurance and a living allowance for the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer.
Annual bonus scheme
Overview
The Committee believes ﬁrmly in the ﬁnancial effectiveness
of short-term incentives. Accordingly, every employee in the
Group participates in some form of incentive scheme.
The Committee sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility
each year.
Remuneration report continued Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 37
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December
2007 was 125% of salary for the executive directors. The following
table sets out the performance metrics relating to the bonus:
Percentage of
Condition maximum bonus potential
Financial and personal measures
and targets set at the beginning of
the year as well as other factors the
Committee determined were relevant 80%
Substantially exceeding EBIT targets. 20%
The Committee were of the opinion that all ﬁnancial and
personal measures and targets were achieved by the executive
directors and as such, bonuses of 100% of salary were paid
for this element. 50% of this bonus payment was paid in cash
and 50% deferred to purchase shares (“Investment Shares”)
in Regus Group plc. These shares are awarded under the
Co-Investment Plan with the opportunity to receive an
additional award of shares (“Matching Shares”) after a three
year period subject to certain conditions. Share awards will
be granted either in the form of a nil cost option or conditional
share award.
Although the cash element of the bonus has been paid, at
the time of the drafting of this report the award of Investment
Shares and associated Matching Shares has not been made
due to the Company being in a close period. The Committee
will provide full details of the award and relevant performance
conditions in its Remuneration Report for the year ending
31 December 2008. The maximum number of share awards will
be granted to the executive directors based on the price of an
ordinary share at the time of the grant and the monetary value
of Investment Shares will not exceed 50% of salary and 200%
of salary for Matching Shares.
In addition, the Company signiﬁcantly exceeded the EBIT
targets set at the start of the year and as such the additional
bonus equating to 25% of salary was paid to the executive
directors for exceptional performance against budget. This
part of the bonus has been paid in cash and will not attract
any Matching Shares under the CIP .
For the year ending 31 December 2008 the Committee has
decided to change the structure of the bonus plan to emphasise
its policy of exceptional pay for exceptional performance.
Although the standard maximum bonus potential will remain
at 100% of salary, linked to the achievement of stretching short
term ﬁnancial and individual performance targets, the additional
element for exceptional out-performance will be based on
a self-ﬁnancing bonus “pool” system rather than a ﬁxed
percentage of 25% of salary. The pool will be deﬁned by
reference to a percentage of operating proﬁts in excess of
external forecasts based on a consensus of analysts’ estimates.
To ensure compliance with Schedule A of the Combined Code,
the Remuneration Committee will cap the amount of the pool
distributed to individuals to 200% of salary (equating to a
maximum bonus for the year of 300% of salary).
The Committee is mindful of the commercial sensitivity of the
performance conditions applying to the bonus and considers that
more detailed disclosure is inappropriate in the circumstances.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
Non-executive directors do not receive a bonus.
Pension beneﬁts
The executive directors participate in the Company’s Money
Purchase (Personal Pension) Scheme. The Company matches
contributions up to a maximum of 7.0% of basic salary. The
Committee considers that the pension beneﬁts of the executive
directors are low compared with comparative companies but
prefers to offer enhanced variable compensation (rather than
a ﬁxed additional pension contribution).
The Group does not operate a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Long term incentives
Overview
The Company continues to operate the Regus Group plc
Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”), which was approved by shareholders
at the 2005 AGM. In addition, the Company continues to grant
options on an ad hoc basis under the existing Regus Group
Share Option Scheme to certain non-participants in the CIP .
As noted earlier, the Committee intends to introduce a new
equity incentive which will enforce the concept of exceptional
pay for exceptional performance. Details of this new arrangement
will be contained in a shareholder circular seeking formal
approval for the scheme.
This new share scheme will complement the CIP and balance
the market-competitive levels of award under the CIP linked
to the deferral of the annual bonus with exceptional levels of
reward for superlative performance.
Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”)
There are two elements to the CIP:
The ﬁrst element operates in conjunction with the annual bonus
whereby gross bonus up to 50% of salary will be taken as a
deferred award of shares to be released at the end of a three
year period with the balance paid in cash.
Matching Shares will be awarded linked to the number of
Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the
Company’s growth in Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF), EPS
targets and relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured
against the FTSE 350 Support Services Index. Matching
Shares are awarded at no cost to participants. 38_www.regus.com
Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be
awarded to a participant in the CIP is 200% of salary. As
such, the maximum number of Matching Shares which can
be awarded based on Investment Shares awarded is 4:1. The
Committee have determined that this ratio will apply to any
payout of the annual bonus.
Grants during the year ending 31 December 2007:
Mark Dixon Rudy Lobo Stephen Gleadle
CIP Award Face Value
(%age Salary) 200% 200% 200%
Fair Value* of CIP Award £713,717 £382,715 £349,435
Fair Value of CIP Award
as a %age of Salary 151% 151% 151%
* The fair value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the date
of award and adjusting this value by the probability of the performance condition
being satisﬁed at this date (in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2).
The second element is that the Committee may also make
standalone whole share awards (“LTIP Awards”) without
reference to annual bonus, up to a maximum of 100% of
salary per annum under the CIP . An LTIP Award is a conditional
right over a whole number of shares with the release being
dependent on the extent to which (if at all) the challenging
performance conditions set by the Committee at the time
the LTIP Award is made are satisﬁed.
No LTIP award was made in 2007.
It is unlikely that future standalone LTIP Awards will be made
to existing executive directors unless there are exceptional
circumstances.
The performance conditions with the associated percentage
of the award vesting for the grant of awards under the LTIP and
CIP are set out in the following table:
For LTIP and 2006 CIP awards: EPS (p) for the year ended 31 December 2008.
For March 2007 CIP awards: % increase in EPS for the year ended 31 December
2009 compared to the prior year
Growth in FCF 11p 12p 13p 14p
per share over 3 years 15% 20% 25% 30%
10% 6% 13% 19% 25%
15% 13% 25% 38% 50%
20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
In determining whether the growth target has been met, EPS
for the year ending 31 December 2009 will be basic and fully
diluted as disclosed in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Company’s
TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of
the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services
Sector at the date of grant.
The Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ﬂow
performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of
the Company’s performance at this time. In addition, the TSR
condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus
on ensuring that the Company’s return to shareholders is
competitive compared to comparable companies.
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of the
bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2007 will be made
subsequent to the publication of this report. However the
maximum number of awards granted to the executive directors
will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of
grant and the monetary value will not exceed 200% of basic
salary. Full details of the levels of award and performance
conditions will be disclosed in the Committee’s Remuneration
Report for the year ending 31 December 2008.
Details of share options granted to executive directors prior to
the introduction of the CIP are set out in the audited section of
this report.
External appointments
Executive directors are permitted to accept appointments on
external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed
to interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees received
in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the
relevant executive director. At 31 December 2007, the executive
directors did not hold any external positions for which they
receive fees.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The above graph shows the Company’s performance, measured
by TSR for the Group compared with the performance of the
FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index. The
Committee considers the FTSE 250 Index relevant since it is an
index of companies of similar size to Regus Group plc. As
detailed earlier in the report the Company considers its TSR
performance for share awards under the CIP in comparison to
that of the FTSE 350 Support Services Index.

Chairman, Remuneration Committee
14 March 2008 42_www.regus.com
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Regus Group plc
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial
statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Regus Group plc
for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
and the related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We
have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company
ﬁnancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 34.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
speciﬁc information presented in the Chief Executive’s Review,
the Financial Review and the Corporate Responsibility Report
that is cross-referenced from the business review section of the
Directors’ Report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2006 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.

(a) Total reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent:
– Share capital and share premium account represents the net proceeds (both the nominal value and any premium paid) on the issue
of the Company’s equity share capital.
– Treasury shares represent 11,947,702 ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the purposes of the Group’s employee
share option plans and the share buyback programme. During the year 12,853,001 shares were purchased. 905,299 shares were
utilised to satisfy the exercise of share options by employees. At 14 March 2008, 33,972,702 treasury shares were held following the
purchase of a further 22,025,000 shares subsequent to the balance sheet date for a total consideration of £16.6 million. As a result
of the purchase of treasury shares, the distributable reserves of the Group were reduced by £13.4 million.
– The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements
of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.
– The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic cost to fair value at the
time of the the acquisition of the outstanding 58% interest (see note 25).
– Other reserves include £29.2 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken in 2003, partly offset by £6.5 million relating
to merger reserves and £0.1 million to the redemption of preference shares.
(b) On 28 June 2006 the Group executed a court order granting the cancellation of the share premium account under a Scheme of
Arrangement. The effect of this was to increase by the same amount the distributable reserves for the Group. The cancellation was
undertaken in the books of Regus Group plc where the share premium was held. Details of the Scheme of Arrangement were
contained within the notice of the Annual General Meeting dated 3 April 2006. 48_www.regus.com
Financial Statements Notes to the accounts
Notes to the accounts
1. Authorisation of ﬁnancial statements
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for the year ended
31 December 2007 were authorised for issue by the Board of
directors on 14 March 2008 and the balance sheets were signed
on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Stephen Gleadle. Regus
Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled
in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded
on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved
by the directors in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”).
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on
pages 82 to 85.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those of the Company
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and equity
account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly controlled
entities. The parent company ﬁnancial statements present
information about the Company as a separate entity and not
about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in
these Group ﬁnancial statements. Amendments to adopted
IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (IFRIC) with an effective date from 1 January 2007
did not have a material effect on the Group ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure” was applicable for
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007. The
principal impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 on the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements relates to certain disclosures regarding ﬁnancial assets
and ﬁnancial liabilities and the Group’s risk management strategy.
IAS 1 Amendment “Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital
Disclosures” was also applicable for accounting periods commencing
on or after 1 January 2007. The principal impact of the adoption
of the amendment to IAS 1 on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
relates to certain disclosures regarding capital management.
Certain amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements for the period
ending 31 December 2006 relating to business combinations
completed in that period were included in those ﬁnancial
statements on a provisional basis. These provisional amounts
were ﬁnalised during the 12 month period following the acquisition.
Adjustments to the acquisition accounting have been reﬂected as
if they had been recognised at the acquisition date. As a result
the following changes have been made:
• The carrying value of goodwill was reduced by £0.4 million as
a result of the ﬁnalisation of the acquisition accounting in relation
to deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in deferred tax
assets of £0.7 million and an increase in deferred consideration
of £0.3 million.
• The carrying value of goodwill was increased by £0.4 million as
a result of the ﬁnalisation of the fair value adjustments in relation
to property, plant and equipment. This reduced the carrying
value of property, plant and equipment by £0.4 million.
Judgments made by the directors in the application of these
accounting policies that have signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial
statements and estimates with a signiﬁcant risk of material
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis,
with the exception of certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value.
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements are presented in
Pounds Sterling and all values are in million pounds, rounded to
one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The following adopted IFRSs were available for early application
but have not been applied by the Group in these ﬁnancial
statements:
• IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” will be applicable for accounting
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The Standard
requires the disclosure of segmental information on the basis of
the components of an entity that management monitors in
making operating decisions. Therefore the adoption of IFRS 8 will
have no impact on the reported income or equity of the Group.
The impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements on the initial
application of this Standard is not expected to be signiﬁcant.
• IFRIC 11 “IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions” will
be applicable for accounting periods commencing on or after
1 March 2007. The Interpretation addresses how share based
payments should be treated within a group and therefore the
adoption of IFRIC 11 will have no impact on the reported
income or equity of the Group.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the
ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that control
commences. The results are consolidated until the date control
ceases or the subsidiary qualiﬁes as a disposal group at which
point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value
less costs to sell and carrying value.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed
of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant
inﬂuence, but not control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the Group’s share
of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an
equity accounted basis, from the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence
commences until the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence ceases or Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 49
the associate qualiﬁes as a disposal group at which point the
investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell
and carrying value.
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those
entities over whose activities the Group has joint control,
established by contractual agreement. The consolidated ﬁnancial
statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains
and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted
basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date
that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualiﬁes
as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at
the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value. When
the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture,
the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of
further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group
has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments
on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the
shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the
Group. As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business
from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the
purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and
liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect
of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already
owned was reﬂected in the revaluation reserve.
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase
method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of
acquisition over the share of the fair value of identiﬁable assets
(including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of
acquisition. Identiﬁable intangibles are those which can be sold
separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether
those rights are separable. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of
interests in associates or jointly controlled entities is reﬂected in
the carrying value of the investment.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s
transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated
under the requirements of IFRS.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for
impairment in value. An impairment test is carried out annually
and, in addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated
to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred
tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life and
intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable
amount was estimated at 31 October 2007.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units
are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identiﬁable group of assets
that generates cash inﬂows that are largely independent of the
cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
speciﬁc to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely
independent cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are
capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from
goodwill if their fair value can be identiﬁed and measured
reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
Brand – Regus brand Indeﬁnite life
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software 3–5 years
Customer lists 1–2 years*
* Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of the remaining 58% interest in the
UK business are amortised over four years.
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through
administration expenses in the income statement.
Leases
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed
as ﬁnance leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s
property leases are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a ﬁnance lease is
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments
at inception. Future payments under ﬁnance leases are included
in creditors, net of any future ﬁnance charges. Minimum lease
payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charge and the
reduction of the outstanding liability. Finance charges are
recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. 50_www.regus.com
Financial Statements Notes to the accounts
Notes to the accounts continued
Operating leases
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Lease incentives and rent-free periods are included in the
calculation of minimum lease payments. The commencement of
the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use
the leased asset. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of
the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group
has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the
inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group
will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inﬂation
indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre
turnover or proﬁtability and are excluded from the calculation of
minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised in
the income statement as they are incurred.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those signiﬁcant items, which are
separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to
enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to non-recurring items are
restructuring, integration costs and onerous commitments.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
of the assets as follows:
Fixtures and ﬁttings Over the shorter of the lease
term and 10 years
Furniture 10 years
Ofﬁce equipment and telephones 5–10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 3–5 years
Revenue
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding
sales taxes).
Workstations
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the
service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred
and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised
as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as
an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only
the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services
are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees
charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement
or for other services provided during the period of the agreement,
are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the
rights used.
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned
from the provision of global workplace solutions.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group’s contributions to deﬁned contribution plans and other
paid and unpaid beneﬁts earned by employees are charged to
the income statement as incurred.
Share based payments
The share option programme entitles certain employees and
directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company;
these awards are granted by the ultimate parent. The fair value
of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with
a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured
at grant date and spread over the period during which the
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair
value of the options granted is measured using the Black Scholes
valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the
actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is
due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company
to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to
the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date
and spread over the period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share
appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions
upon which the instruments were granted.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case
it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The
following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than
in a business combination; and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in
the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
2. Accounting policies continued Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 51
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which
the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outﬂow of
economic beneﬁts will be required to settle its obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a
business reorganisation where the plans are sufﬁciently detailed
and well advanced and where the appropriate communication
to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract
exceed the economic beneﬁts expected to be delivered,
discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date
and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The results and cash ﬂows of overseas operations are translated
using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities,
including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas
operations are translated using the closing rate with all exchange
differences arising on consolidation being recognised in the foreign
currency translation reserve. Exchange differences are released
to the income statement on disposal.
Under the transition requirements of IFRS, cumulative translation
differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at
1 January 2004.
Finance charges
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income
statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that
relate to ﬁnancial liabilities are charged to interest expense using
the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the
carrying value of the related ﬁnancial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of undrawn credit facilities are
recognised as a prepayment and recognised through the ﬁnance
expense over the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being
drawn the relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised
within the carrying value of the ﬁnancial liability and charged to
interest expense using the effective interest rate method.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried
at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding
the discount is recognised as a ﬁnance expense or ﬁnance income
as appropriate.
Interest bearing borrowings and other ﬁnancial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁnancial liabilities are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption
value being recognised in the income statement over the period
of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when the Group’s
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value
through proﬁt or loss where the liability is either held for trading
or is designated as held at fair value through proﬁt or loss on initial
recognition. They are stated at fair value with any resultant gain
or loss recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classiﬁed as either at fair value through proﬁt
or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale ﬁnancial
assets or loans and receivables. The classiﬁcation depends on
the nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial asset and is determined
on initial recognition.
Trade and other receivables that have ﬁxed or determinable
payments and are not quoted in an active market are classiﬁed
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short term receivables when recognition
would be immaterial.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
can be found in note 23. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are
measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are
recognised through proﬁt or loss unless the derivative ﬁnancial
instrument has been designated as a cash ﬂow hedge whereby the
effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand
and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s geographical segments. The Group’s primary activity and only business
segment is the provision of global workplace solutions. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to
a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. There is no inter-segment trading. Management fees are
in consideration of subsidiaries use of intellectual property and Group services including, but not limited to, business development
services, purchasing, information technology, sales and marketing, ﬁnance and treasury, human resources and legal services.
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses. Segment
capital expenditure is the total cost (calculated on an accruals basis) incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are
expected to be used for more than one year. The business is run on a worldwide basis, but managed through four principal
geographical segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Paciﬁc and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom
segment was added following the acquisition on 19 April 2006 of the remaining 58% of the share capital of the UK business (see
note 25). The United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s non-trading head ofﬁce and holding companies that are based
in the UK. These are shown as unallocated. The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting
geographical results.

Assets and liabilities within the unallocated category comprise ﬁnancing and tax items which are used across the Group and cannot
be allocated to segments on a meaningful basis.
Unallocated revenue represents management fees earned from the UK business prior to the acquisition of the remaining 58% interest
and therefore it is not considered meaningful to include this within the United Kingdom segment.

Deferred tax assets recognised on short term temporary differences consist predominantly of rental income recognised for tax purposes
in different periods, provisions deductible when paid and share based payment.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £39.0 million
(2006: £26.7 million). It is considered that no signiﬁcant tax liability would arise should these reserves be remitted due to available
overseas tax credits.
The deferred tax recognised has been adjusted to reﬂect the reduction in the United Kingdom corporation tax rate from 30% to 28%
from 1 April 2008. 58_www.regus.com

Cash-generating units, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out
impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through
business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these cash-generating
units. The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows:
2007 2006
£m £m
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 123.6 115.4
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 3.1 1.8
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 7.7 7.3
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 88.6 87.6
223.0 212.1
Specific groups of cash-generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is significant
are as follows:
Goodwill Intangible assets 2007 2006
£m £m £m £m
USA 112.9 – 112.9 109.2
UK 88.6 11.2 99.8 98.8
The recoverable amount of each of the groups of cash-generating units above has been determined based on their value in use,
calculated as the present value of future cash ﬂows attributable to the group.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of cash-generating units:
– future cash ﬂows are based on budgets for 2008 approved by the Board. Thereafter a prudent growth rate not exceeding 3% has
been applied to revenues for the ﬁrst ﬁve years, with 0% growth thereafter which does not exceed the long term average growth
rate for a similar business.
– a terminal value is included in the assessment reﬂecting the Group’s expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets.
– a country speciﬁc pre-tax discount rate has been applied to future cash ﬂows for each cash-generating unit, based on an underlying
post-tax discount rate of 12%, grossed up by the applicable tax rate in each country. The pre-tax rate reﬂects current market
assessments and the risks speciﬁc to such businesses in each country.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to changes in the expected level of long-term proﬁtability and the discount rate applied
to the future cash ﬂows. The trading conditions in which the Group operates is subject to competitive and economic pressures that
can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of a signiﬁcant nature so as to result in a cash-generating units’
carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. A fall of more than 12% in the future cash ﬂows would be required to result in the
carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Group’s joint ventures. 60_www.regus.com

Included with the brand value is £11.2 million relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indeﬁnite useful life due to the fact that the
value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indeﬁnite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying
value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at 31 October 2007 against the recoverable amount of the
UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 12). Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 61

The maximum period over which the provisions are expected to be utilised expires by 31 December 2012.
Other provisions include the estimated costs of claims against the Group outstanding at the year end for which due to their nature the
maximum period over which they are expected to be utilised is uncertain. As at 31 December 2007, the Group was in a legal dispute
with a supplier and had provided £2.3 million as the best estimate of the present obligation under the dispute.

23. Financial instruments and ﬁnancial risk management
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to ﬁnancial instruments and the management of capital are
determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains overall responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Treasurer review the Group’s
risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility
for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Audit Committee
is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business. The principal ﬁnancial instruments used
by the Group to ﬁnance its operations are cash and loans.
Credit risk
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a ﬁnancial instrument and arises
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits.
A diversiﬁed customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which
contribute the majority of the Group’s revenue minimises the Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes
a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to provide against trade receivables when speciﬁc debts are judged
to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more than three
months overdue which reflects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. These
provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative ﬁnancial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region is summarised below.

During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group provided for an additional £3.1 million against potential bad debts
(2006: £1.9 million) and utilised £2.8 million directly against the balance of trade receivables (2006: £2.2 million).
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority
of its revenue in advance of the provision of ofﬁce services and requires deposits from its customers. Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 67
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufﬁcient liquidity to
meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. In addition to free cash (excluding blocked cash) of £128.5 million (2006: £63.8 million)
the Group has a senior committed facility of £136 million.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group’s debt is held at variable interest rates because further early repayment of the debt is probable. Surplus cash balances are
invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis. Whenever possible, and subject to the operational requirements
of the Group, cash is repatriated to the parent company and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas
subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
The majority of the Group’s net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros. The Group does not hedge the translation effect
of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
The Group’s investments in subsidiaries are generally not hedged as these currency positions are considered to be long term in nature.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest
rate ﬂuctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks. At 31 December 2007 there were no derivative ﬁnancial
instruments outstanding (2006: None)
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.
Capital management
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer monitors the diversity of the Group’s major shareholders and further details on the Group’s communication with key
investors can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 28 to 34. In 2006, the Board approved the commencement
of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Mark Dixon, is indirectly the major shareholder of the Company and all members of the Board
hold shares in the Company. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on
pages 35 to 41. In addition, the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2007 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share
capital in the market. In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares
under the Group’s share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders. In the year ended
31 December 2007, 12,853,001 shares were repurchased in the market and 905,299 were used to satisfy obligations under the
share option programme. No shares were repurchased in 2006.
The Group purchased a further 22,025,000 of its own shares between 31 December 2007 and 14 March 2008.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group commenced a share buyback programme during the year ended 31 December 2007 and declared a ﬁnal dividend for 2007
of 1.0p per share, 66.7% higher than 2006 (0.6p per share). There were no other changes in the Group’s approach to capital
management during the year.
The Group’s objective when managing capital (equity and borrowings) is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher
levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s return on capital employed for
the year ended 31 December 2007, deﬁned as operating proﬁt divided by total shareholders’ equity, was 39.6% (2006: 36.6%).
This compares to a weighted average interest rate on the principal Group secured ﬁnancing of 7.4% (2006: 7.0%). 68_www.regus.com

Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2007 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s proﬁt
before tax by approximately £0.4 million (2006: £0.3 million).
It is estimated that a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the
Group’s proﬁt before tax by approximately £3.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: £3.0 million). It is estimated that
a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Group’s proﬁt before
tax by approximately £1.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: £0.8 million).
It is estimated that a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased
the Group’s total equity by approximately £8.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: £8.1 million). It is estimated that
a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have increased the Group’s total equity
by approximately £nil for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: £0.2 million).

Summary of methods and assumptions
Trade and other receivables/payables and customer deposits
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reﬂect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value of ﬁnance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ﬂows at an appropriate discount rate which reﬂects
current market assessments and the risks speciﬁc to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts
The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at ﬂoating rates
where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

Performance conditions for share options
The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest.
The share options vested based on the basic earnings per share (adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible
amortisation) that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index. The basic earnings per share for performance purposes
was 1p. 100% of the options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.

* Adjusted EPS.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently
in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets
must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess
the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees ﬁt at the time, by way of example, the following
adjustments are currently anticipated:
– In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive proﬁts in future years. As such it is important
to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly those
costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current
year losses from investing in new locations.
– Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
– It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby
increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise
deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To
provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
– The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ﬂow performance targets are a transparent and accurate
measure of the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to
shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies. 72_www.regus.com

There was no contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions that has not been recognised on the Group balance sheet.
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2007, the revenue and net retained loss arising from these acquisitions would have
been £26.7 million and £0.1 million respectively. In the year these acquisitions contributed revenue of £15.0 million and a net retained
loss of £0.4 million.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reﬂects the anticipated future beneﬁts Regus can obtain from operating the businesses
more efﬁciently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services.
Adjustments to provisional fair values for 2006 and 2005 acquisitions
Additional consideration of £1.8 million was paid in 2007 due to improved ﬁnancial performance of acquisitions under contractual
earn-out provisions and additional acquisition costs. This resulted in an increase in goodwill of £1.8 million.
Details of all acquisitions completed in the year ended 31 December 2006 are set out below
The principal acquisition in the year was that of the 58% interest in the Regus UK business not already owned. All other acquisitions
in the year were individually immaterial and have been grouped together for disclosure purposes. A minor adjustment has been made
to the provisional acquisition accounting in 2005. The impact of the Group’s acquisitions on the ﬁnancial statements is summarised
in the table. Further details of the acquisitions can be found below the table:

Acquisition of the remaining interest in the UK business
On 19 April 2006, the acquisition date, the Group purchased the remaining 58% equity share in the UK associate (Regus Holdings
(UK) Limited) from Rex 2002 Limited, a company controlled by funds managed by Alchemy Partners, for a cash consideration of
£88.0 million. This entity has been fully consolidated into the Group’s results since the acquisition date.

All consideration was paid in cash. There was no deferred consideration.
The fair value adjustments include:
(a) A valuation of the UK brand was conducted at the date of acquisition. “Relief from royalty” approach was used as the valuation method. Under this method the fair value is
equal to the amount saved through the avoidance of royalty payments in perpetuity. A 1% royalty rate and 12% weighted average cost of capital was used for the valuation.
(b) The valuation of property, plant and equipment was based on a market valuation approach, unless market values were not available in which case a depreciated
replacement cost method was used.
(c) Leasehold interest valuations were based on the difference between contract rent and market rent over the lease term discounted to net present value at a weighted
average cost of 12%.
The Group’s 42% shareholding in the UK associate has been revalued in the course of accounting for the acquisition. A revaluation
of £10.0 million, representing 42% of the fair value adjustments of £23.7 million, has been applied to the Group’s existing shareholding
in the UK associate with a corresponding revaluation reserve of £10.0 million being created in equity.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reﬂects the anticipated future beneﬁts Regus can obtain from operating the businesses
more efﬁciently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services.

31. Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing
these accounts
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
IFRS requires management to make certain judgments and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of
assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market
in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a
business centre or where the books and records of the acquired
company do not provide sufﬁcient information to derive an
accurate valuation, management calculate an estimated fair
value based on available information and experience. The main
categories of acquired non-current assets where management’s
judgment has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible
ﬁxed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value
of leasehold assets and liabilities. For signiﬁcant business
combinations management also obtain third party valuations
to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation
to be included in the ﬁnancial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess
potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to
recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying
value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and
make that determination based upon future cash ﬂow projections,
which assume certain growth projections which may or may
not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the
carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated
fair value.
Deferred tax assets
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities
on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business
plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in
existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future
business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities
or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting
for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best
estimate of future events that can be appropriately reﬂected in
the accounting estimates. It is current Group policy to recognise
a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable proﬁts
will be available against which the losses can be used. The Group
considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable proﬁt in
the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a proﬁt
in the foreseeable future.
Onerous lease provisions
We have identiﬁed certain poor performing centres where the
lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to
recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the ﬁrst break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net
amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the ﬁrst break
point, discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost
of capital.
Dilapidations
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the
Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that
condition are not known until the Group exit the property so the
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However,
given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to
properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely
that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential
dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outﬂow will
occur and can be reliably estimated. 82_www.regus.com

Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and
under the historical cost accounting rules.
The Company is included in the consolidated accounts of
Regus Group plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained
in FRS8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances
with entities which form part of the Group.
In accordance with FRS1 (revised), the Company is exempt
from the requirement to prepare a cash ﬂow statement within
these ﬁnancial statements.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the
proﬁt and loss account of the Company has not been included
as part of these accounts. The Company’s proﬁt for the ﬁnancial
year was £89.1 million (2006: £64.2 million).
The following accounting policies, unless otherwise stated,
have been applied consistently in dealing with items which
are considered material in relation to the Company’s ﬁnancial
statements. The following change to accounting policies has
been applied with an effective date from 1 January 2007.
Comparative periods have been restated where applicable.
UITF 41 – ‘Scope of FRS 20’ was applicable for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006. The UITF concluded
that share based payments for which the value of the goods or
services received is less than the fair value of the share based
payment are within the scope of FRS20. As a consequence,
where a parent company awards shares to the employees who
provide services to a subsidiary company, the parent company
should recognise the fair value of the share based payment as
an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiary with a
corresponding movement in equity. The impact of applying
UITF 41 resulted in an increase in the opening cost of investment
in subsidiaries of £2.8 million and a corresponding increase in
opening equity as at 31 December 2006. The impact of the change
in accounting policy in the year ended 31 December 2007 was
an increase in the cost of investment of subsidiaries and in equity
by £4.5 million. The change in accounting policy did not have an
impact on the proﬁt and loss account. It is not possible to estimate
the impact on future periods.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision
for impairment.
Share based payment
The Company awards share options and conditional share awards
to employees of subsidiary companies. No goods or services are
received directly by the Company from the employees in exchange
for the share based payment and the services are received wholly
by the subsidiary company. The Company accounts for the fair
value of the share based payment, measured at the date of grant,
as an increase in the carrying value of the investment in the
subsidiary recognised over the period during which the employees
become unconditionally entitled to the options and awards. No
expense is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account of the Company
for share based payment. A corresponding increase in equity is
recognised for the increase in the carrying value of the subsidiary.
Full details of the share based payment provided by the Company
can be found in note 24 to the Regus Group plc accounts and
the Group Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 41.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the proﬁt for the year and
takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in
respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain
items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise
required by FRS19.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
using the rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or
losses on translation are included in the proﬁt and loss account.
Finance charges
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the proﬁt and
loss account on an accruals basis. Deferred ﬁnance fees that
relate to ﬁnancial liabilities are charged to the proﬁt and loss
account through the interest expense using the effective interest
rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the
related ﬁnancial liability on the balance sheet. Fees paid for the
arrangement of undrawn credit facilities are recognised as a
prepayment and recognised through the ﬁnance expense over
the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the
relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the
carrying value of the ﬁnancial liability and charged to the interest
expense using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised
in the proﬁt and loss account over the period of the borrowings
on an effective interest basis.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts
to guarantee the indebtedness or liabilities of other companies
within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect,
the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability
until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will
be required to make a payment under the guarantee. 84_www.regus.com

The business supplies services which enable more 
effective use of land and property in the UK through the 
application of knowledge, expertise and technology to 
the following market segments.
Local Authorities & Regeneration Agencies
There are over 400 local authorities in the UK. Our 
focus is on those with large land and property 
portfolios but with significant underutilisation of land 
and property assets. 
We address these authorities’ need for better 
utilisation of land and property assets by providing

planning services.

portfolios more effectively.

There are a very large number of property developers 
in both the public and private sectors. Some operate 
nationally, others regionally or locally. Some specialise 
in specific types of development e.g. housing and retail 
whilst others cover a range of development types.

who have large land holdings and provides web-based 
management information services aimed at enabling 
them to maximise the return on their investment.

governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present the results for 
the year ended 31 March 2008.  The 
highlights set out earlier reveal the 
mixed fortunes of the two divisions 
over the course of the last year. 
Our Care Division has continued to develop strongly, 
principally through organic growth, with an outstanding year 
of new contract wins secured.  It continues to operate within 
what we believe to be an extremely buoyant marketplace, 
and is well placed to benefit from further organic growth and 
anticipated consolidation within this sector. 
The Professional Services Division results have been impacted 
significantly by the performance of our Architectural practice 
and specifically by the charge as an exceptional item of 
the write-off of £0.77m of accrued income which had been 
recognised in the previous year’s accounts.  There have 
nonetheless been some significant developments within the 
Division.  The TerraQuest acquisition has performed ahead 
of management expectations, whilst the Engineering and 
Records Management businesses continued to perform in 
line with expectations.  
Corporate Activity
The Board notes the announcement made by Romac 
Investments Limited (‘Romac’) on 13 June 2008 and can 
confirm that on 23 April 2008 it received a letter from 
Romac outlining an indicative conditional proposal 
regarding a possible offer for the issued and to be issued 
share capital of Supporta.
On receipt of this letter the board entered into a dialogue 
with Romac seeking to clarify uncertainties surrounding its 
conditional indicative proposal, including in respect of the 
financing of any offer. The board and its advisors also had a 
number of conversations with alternative offerors and 
received an indicative proposal from a third party which 
placed a significantly higher value on the Group than that 
set out by Romac in their letter of 23 April 2008. This 
higher indicative proposal was conditional on receiving the 
support of Gingko Investments Limited (‘Gingko’), the 
wholly owned subsidiary of Romac, in any offer by the third 
party. Following discussions with the third party Gingko 
informed Supporta that it would not support the higher 
indicative offer and hence the third party formally 
withdrew from discussions regarding an offer for Supporta.
On 5 June 2008 the board informed Romac that it placed a 
significantly higher value on Supporta than that set out in 
Romac’s proposal and that it felt unable to progress matters 
on the basis of Romac’s letter of 23 April 2008.
The Supporta board also informed Romac that it would 
welcome an alternative proposal from Romac that placed 
an appropriate value on the Company; a position it 
continues to adopt.
The board has actively been evaluating strategic options for 
the Company and remains committed to taking action to 
deliver value for all shareholders.
In addition to these recent developments, the Group disposed 
of its payroll business to the Mckesson Corporation in 
May 2007 for a total consideration of £3.5 million in cash 
and it acquired the entire share capital of Hallam Healthcare 
Services (East Midlands) Limited for a maximum total 
consideration of £4.7 million in January 2008.
Strategic Review
The Board conducted a full strategic review during the 
course of the year to strengthen the focus of the Group 
and ensure that Shareholders realised the underlying and 
potential value.  The Board, in conjunction with its financial 
advisers, concluded that:
the best way to optimise shareholder value is to •	
continue to grow the Supporta Care business both 
organically and with earnings enhancing acquisitions;
the cost reduction exercise within Supporta Professional •	
Services should position that business to produce 
enhanced returns
The Board will also continue to review whether the two 
businesses are better positioned to take advantage of 
growth opportunities as separate businesses.
The Board reached these conclusions after taking into 
account the following factors:
the Supporta Care division has market opportunity •	
through both acquisition and organic growth initiatives;
the current stock market valuation of the Group does •	
not accurately reflect the value of the component parts 
of the Group; and
the current M & A environment has been adversely •	
impacted by the weakness in credit markets. 
The Directors believe that in this environment, the value 
which potential acquirers would place on the Group’s 
Divisions would be negatively affected over the short-term.
Performance in 2007/08
The financial year was adversely impacted by the performance 
of our Architectural practice.  This underperformance led to us 
issuing a trading statement on the 23 January 2008.
In December 2007, Supporta completed a placing which 
raised £4.18m net of expenses. At this time it was the Board’s 
expectation that any underperformance arising from its

Non-executive Chairman
“Our Care Division has continued to 
develop strongly whilst the Professional 
Services Division results have 
been impacted significantly by the 
performance of our Architecture Practice.”
* before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment 9
 
We believe that the Group 
is well positioned to deliver 
underlying organic growth.
Supporta plc  – Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Architectural practice would be offset by stronger 
performance from the other businesses which comprise 
the Professional Services Division, such that market 
expectations of operating performance could be achieved.
Towards the end of January 2008 it became clear that 
the results of Supporta Bay Associates would be impacted 
by contract delays. As a result, on 23 January 2008, the 
Board issued a trading statement explaining that the 
earnings before interest, taxation, exceptional items and 
amortisation for the year to 31 March 2008 would not 
be less than £2.95 million. The revised lower target, as set 
out in this release, has been achieved.
The underperformance of the Architectural practice 
in the financial year to 31 March 2008 has arisen in 
part following a review of all accrued income and 
a recognition that income previously recognised in 
the prior year’s financial statements was no longer 
considered recoverable, together with a more rigorous 
policy on revenue recognition in the current financial 
year.  As a result of the underperformance in the 
Architectural practice the management of that business 
unit was changed.
Michael Curran has taken on the role of Divisional 
Managing Director of the Supporta Professional Services 
Division.  The finance team for the division has also been 
significantly strengthened since this time.
A new divisional structure for Professional Services 
has been implemented with the appointment of John 
Gannon to lead the TerraQuest business and John Fynn 
heading up the Services business.  Alongside these two 
business streams lie a Sales and Marketing team led by 
Simon Read and a Corporate Services support function 
headed up by Trevor Fayers.
Banking Facilities   
As a result of the weak trading performance from the 
Group’s Architectural practice the Board successfully 
re-negotiated the terms of its term loan facility with its 
bank, Barclays PLC. The Board has agreed with the bank 
a revised covenant and repayment profile.
Trading Outlook   
Trading for the year to date is in line with management’s 
expectations and the Directors believe that the Group is 
well positioned to deliver underlying organic growth in 
the year.  Supporta Care continues to perform very 
positively and the Directors believe that it has excellent 
opportunities for growth.  We will continue to monitor 
the development of Supporta Professional Services and is 
confident that 2008/09 will be a year of positive growth.
Core Values
We aspire to be both the supplier and the employer of 
choice for our customers and employees.  These core 
values underpin our entire business. 
Supporta now has an impressive list of customers, 
predominantly in the public sector.  We provide a 
range of critical services which enhance peoples’ lives 
on a daily basis.  We acknowledge this burden of 
responsibility and accountability and strive to put in 
place quality controls to ensure that every customer’s 
experience of Supporta is both positive and mutually 
rewarding.  The Board regularly receives reports on 
customer satisfaction and customer feedback, reflecting 
the importance which it attaches to meeting and 
exceeding their expectations.
To be the employer of choice we need a highly 
professional, trained and motivated workforce.  We 
aim to reward staff competitively for the roles they 
undertake.  We also realise that for many of our staff 
their roles are vocations rather than simply jobs.  We 
aim to enrich their work life through training and 
development which helps them meet their aspirations 
and also improves the quality of our services.  We 
monitor feedback from staff and seek ways in which 
their working lives can be even more rewarding.
Our staff continue to show exceptional dedication to 
their roles and make a huge contribution to the quality 
of life of many thousands of people, often some of the 
most vulnerable in the United Kingdom.  On this note I 
would like to thank on behalf of the Board all Supporta 
staff who have helped deliver these results and customer 
satisfaction for the past year.
Changes to the Board   
Stephen Whiting left the business on 27 November 2007 
to pursue opportunities outside of the Group.  
Michael Curran took over the role of leading Supporta 
Professional Services forward and Simon Birks was 
appointed as Company Secretary.  Simon is a qualified 
solicitor and takes on his new role after three years 
service with the Group most recently as Group 
Commercial Manager.
The Board of Directors has the drive and determination to 
achieve our ambitious strategic objectives.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Strategic Review
During the course of the year the Board considered a 
number of strategic options for the Group.  These can be 
broadly classified as:
Status quo •	
Focus on Supporta Care •	
Focus on Supporta Professional Services •	
Demerger of the two divisions into two separate  •	
AIM listed companies
The Board concluded that Supporta Care had the better 
prospects for delivering value to shareholders.  Additionally 
the Board acknowledged that management diversion by 
trying to concentrate on the delivery of such a wide range 
of services was likely to dilute shareholder value in the 
short- to medium-term.
As noted in more detail below the Group was approached 
by a private equity house to acquire Supporta Professional 
Services at an acceptable price in the summer of 2007 
and conducted negotiations to an advanced stage which 
were ultimately unsuccessful.  During this time period the 
credit conditions in the market were adversely affected and 
the impact of the underperformance of the Architectural 
business meant that the Group’s value aspirations were 
unlikely to be met in the short-term.  As a consequence 
the Board has decided to concentrate on driving value out 
of the existing businesses until market conditions change 
when the situation will be reviewed again.
Supporta Care
During 2007/08 the Directors believe that Supporta 
Care has enhanced its reputation as a quality provider 
of domiciliary care services.  Our reputation for delivery 
of quality services has resulted in another year of solid 
organic growth with enhanced margins being achieved 
within the business.
The strategy for our Care division is to continue to grow 
a national brand for provision of home care services, 
mainly to the public sector across the UK.  The Directors 
believe that we are well placed as the fifth largest private 
provider of these services to benefit from the continued 
consolidation of this market place, driven by increased 
complexity and regulation.
Care Market
There is an ageing population in the UK, within which 
there is a more demanding expectation on choice and 
quality for the delivery and support of care for the elderly, 
shaped towards individual need. The number of people aged 
65 and over in the UK in 2006 (based on ONS data) was 
8.1 million. The Government’s actuary’s forecasts suggest 
this could increase to 9.8 million by 2016. This represents 
an increase of approximately 21 per cent. In addition to 
the accelerating growth of the elderly population, life 
expectancy at birth is also increasing at a rate of two years 
every decade. As a result of these demographic trends, 
it is likely that a larger proportion of the population will 
require some form of residential or domiciliary care for a 
longer period of time. The Directors believe that the ageing 
population will be a key driver in the allocation of local 
authority care budgets and the demand for domiciliary care 
services in the foreseeable future.
The domiciliary care market remains highly fragmented with 
4,735 suppliers registered in England on 31 March 2007. 
The top five UK quoted suppliers (including Supporta Care) 
account for approximately 15 percent of the total market.  
In 2006, independent sector agencies delivered in excess 
of 75 percent of total home care hours. The combination 
of independent, smaller agencies, local authorities moving 
towards preferred provider type arrangements, increased 
cost pressures and competition, and regulatory and training 
requirements means that in our opinion there will be a 
natural consolidation in the market.
The Directors believe that smaller independent domiciliary 
care providers will struggle to compete in delivering a cost 
effective, quality service whilst simultaneously retaining 
appropriately skilled staff and that larger independent 
providers however are able to offer cost effective 
solutions based on economies of scale and increased 
efficiency in their investment towards quality.
Local authority purchasing power has a major impact on 
the independent domiciliary care sector; it is estimated 
that 60 per cent of independent providers are thought to 
rely on local authorities for more then 75 per cent of their 
business, with almost 15 per cent of providers dependent 
on their local authority as their only customer.

“During 2007/08 Supporta Care 
enhanced its reputation as a quality 
provider of domiciliary care services.”

Supporta Professional Services
The Board took the decision to create the Supporta 
Professional Services division with effect from 
1 April 2007.  This new division was formed from  
the previous Property and Services Divisions.  
In November and December 2007 the board 
implemented a cost savings plan within the Supporta 
Professional Services division that is expected to save 
the Group approximately £1.7m on an annualised 
basis. The implementation of this significant cost 
saving initiative had a £0.8m positive impact on 
this current financial year’s results. Of the £1.7m 
savings approximately £0.5m of this relates to the 
Architectural business.  The Board delayed making 
these savings whilst an approach for the Supporta 
Professional Services division from a private equity 
house was being considered. These negotiations, 
despite being at an advanced stage, did not result 
in a successful disposal. Subsequent restructuring 
led to the departure of the Managing Director of 
the Supporta Professional Services division and the 
Managing Director, Chief Architect and Financial 
Controller of the Architectural practice.
Michael Curran was appointed Managing Director 
of the Supporta Professional Services Division on 
27 November 2007.  Since then he has conducted a 
full review of the Division’s activities and prospects.  
Following this review we decided to organise the 
division into two principal units, Supporta TerraQuest 
headed up by John Gannon and Supporta Services 
headed up by John Fynn.  Supporta TerraQuest is now 
responsible for the Division’s management consultancy 
and Business Process Outsourcing activities.  Supporta 
Services has four principal trading units Architecture, 
Engineering, Healthcare and Records Management.
The 2007/08 revenue and operating profit before 
share-based payment charge, amortisation and 
exceptional items for each of these units is set out in 
the following table:

Chief Executive’s Statement continued
The focus for the Division during the course of the next 
financial year will be to improve sales performance and 
secure longer term contracts.  The Directors believe that 
this should begin to reduce the risk in the Division as 
currently we enter the financial year with approximately 
two thirds of our forecast income for the year unsecured.
The focus on sales performance is already beginning to yield 
benefits.  We have secured a number of contracts recently 
which should help to improve the prospects for the division:
Supporta TerraQuest relationship with BT extended to •	
include Local Government. 
Appointed by Transport for London to mapping services •	
framework for Property Asset Register. 
Secured a place on the Geographic Information Services •	
and Solutions (GISS) Catalist Framework agreement with 
OGCbuying.solutions.
Award of a contract by Cross London Rail Links to •	
provide Land Referencing and Property Information 
Management Services. 
Award of a contract by Cross London Rail Links  •	
to provide a web based Property Register as a  
hosted service. 
Appointed by Taylor Wimpey to provide a web-based •	
Strategic Land Database as a hosted service.
Appointed by Department for Transport to undertake •	
a property recording review across the department, 
including all Executive Agencies and Non-Departmental 
Public Bodies.
The forward order book for Professional Services is £6.5m 
(2007: £8.1m), with additional anticipated revenues from 
framework agreements of £12.3m (2007: £8.0m).
The management of Supporta has further identified 
synergies and cross-selling opportunities for the Division, 
which it anticipates will lead to further organic growth in 
2008/09 and beyond.

Finance Director’s Report
This year’s annual report presents the Group’s 
results for the first time using the recognition and 
measurement principles of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union.  A reconciliation of the results 
between UK and IFRS financial reporting standards 
(UK GAAP) is set out on pages 61 to 66.
The Group’s accounting policies under IFRS are set 
out in more detail on pages 28 to 35.
The Group’s overall results from continuing operations 
for the year ended 31 March 2008 and percentage 
change from year ended 31 March 2007 show:
Revenue £50.76m +19%
Operating profit £1.02m +169%
Operating profit margin 2.0% +158%
Loss before tax from  
continuing operations (£0.37m) +85%
Cash generated from operations £1.90m -45%
Loss per share from  
continuing operations (0.91p) +75%
Revenue
In 2008 Group revenue from continuing operations 
increased by 19% to £50.76m (2007: £42.71m). 
Growth has been generated both from acquisitions 
and from underlying organic revenue growth of 
1%.  The acquisitions contributing to growth in 
2008 include the full year effect from Datacare 
Business Systems Limited, Bay Associates Limited 
and TerraQuest Solutions Limited acquired in the 
previous year.  Additionally, the Hallam Healthcare 
(East Midlands) Limited acquisition completed during 
the year:
The disposal of Supporta’s Payroll business completed 
on 4 May 2007 and consequently the results 
presented here do not include any contribution from 
that business.
Operating profit
The Group’s operating profit before share-based 
payment charge, amortisation and exceptional items 
profit from continuing operations increased by 14% 
to £4.03m (2007: £3.53m), including £0.14m from the 
Hallam Healthcare acquisition.
The Group incurred a number of exceptional charges 
during the year, relating principally to the write-off of 
accrued revenue in Architecture, restructuring of the 
business and redundancy which are summarised in 
note 4 to the financial statements.
During the course of the year it became apparent that 
£0.77m of accrued revenue which had been recognised 
in 2006/07 was not recoverable.  This arose from a 
policy in the business to recognise revenue where 
work had taken place but no order had been secured.  
We have taken a more prudent approach to income 
recognition in this financial year and only revenue in 
relation to Prison Service work is now recognised in 
this manner, which historically has been collectable.    
Taxation
Corporation tax of £0.28m (2007: credit of £0.16m) 
has been provided for, which is equivalent to an 
effective tax rate of -74% (2007: 6%).  This charge 
and high apparent effective tax rate is impacted by a 
number of disallowable items including share-based 
payment charge, amortisation and timing differences. 
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share* reduced by 30% to 
2.66p (2007:3.78p).
The reported loss after taxation for the year was 
£1.59m (2007: loss of £6.06m) which equates to a loss 
per share for the year of 2.24p (2007: loss of 9.40p).
Cash flow
Net cash outflow for the Group in the year was 
£1.78m compared to an outflow in 2007 of £1.75m. 
Cash inflow from operating activities reduced by 
45% to £1.90m in the year (2007: £3.43m inflow).  
This was driven by financing the Group’s growth in 
the final quarter of the year and settling creditors 
carried over from the previous year.  Financing 
activities raised £4.01m in the year (2007: £8.70m), 
of which £5.26m (net of expenses) came from new 
share issues, £2.76m from the drawdown of banking 
facilities offset by loan repayments of £3.10m and 
a repayment of loan notes amounting to £0.89m.  
The net cash outflow from investing activities was 
£5.42m (2007: £12.34m).

Finance Director’s Report continued
Treasury management  
and financial instruments
Financial instruments include all assets and liabilities 
of a financial nature such as cash, loans, finance leases, 
overdrafts and long-term liabilities.  All such instruments 
play an important part in the operations of the Group to 
enable it to operate smoothly and effectively and to pay its 
obligations as they fall due.  They also enable the Group to 
fulfill its investment strategy including making appropriate 
acquisitions.  The Group’s objectives are twofold: to use 
financial instruments to minimise the cost of capital at an 
acceptably low financial risk; and to maximise flexibility to 
take advantage of investment and acquisition opportunities 
as they arise.  
The Group is primarily a UK provider of outsourced services 
to the public sector and does not have significant foreign 
exchange risks.  
In March 2008 the Group renegotiated its banking facilities 
with Barclays PLC in order to give it greater headroom in 
relation to its covenants and to reduce the repayments due 
under its term loans.
At the end of the year the Group had net borrowings  
of £17.40m.
The Group’s policy is, and has been throughout the year, 
that no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The volatility in 3 month LIBOR, the basis for interest 
charging for the Group’s floating debt has impacted 
adversely the level of interest incurred through this year’s 
consolidated income statement.
The Group entered into a hedging arrangement in May 
2008 to fix the remainder of the Group’s current term 
debt at a fixed rate of 5.445% for four years.  The Group’s 
current margin applicable over and above the fixed rate is 
2.5% increasing to 3.0% in September 2008 which then 
reduces as the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest 
tax and amortisation falls.
Risks
Supporta has identified the five most significant 
operational risks faced by the business - and measures to 
counterbalance them - as follows:
Staff recruitment and retention – •	 our business needs 
access to appropriately skilled employees to enable us 
to grow in a sustainable fashion.  We have implemented 
our Employer of Choice initiative to mitigate this 
risk.  In addition to progress already made on training 
and development, we will continue to review our 
remuneration and employment policies to ensure we can 
maintain good staff retention within our businesses.
Quality failure – •	 the business provides life critical 
services to many thousands of people in the UK, in 
often complex and challenging situations.  Within our 
businesses, as part of our Supplier of Choice initiative 
we have implemented best practice procedures and 
manuals, health and safety working practices, customer 
service initiatives and relationship management 
procedures.  These are regularly reinforced through staff 
training and development.  During the year we intend 
to invest significantly in our Care operational IT systems 
to further strengthen our commitment to quality.  The 
operational management team meets regularly to review 
operational quality issues and items of a significant 
nature are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
Long-term contracts – •	 a number of our subsidiaries 
enter into long-term contracts.  These involve significant 
elements of subjectivity in relation to revenue 
recognition and can be subject to delays as a result of 
external factors, for instance planning permission.  We 
will implement improved controls over the course of the 
year to ensure that rigour is applied in areas requiring 
judgment. We will also continue regular client progress 
review meetings to ensure that visibility of future 
earnings are based upon the best possible information. 15
 
Uncontracted revenue – •	 some of our businesses 
within the Supporta Professional Services division 
commence work prior to the receipt of a signed 
order from customers.  Such work is recognised 
within accrued income.  Our experience of 
dealing with these customers shows that there is 
limited risk in relation to recovering such income, 
however the Board will continue to monitor the 
appropriateness of this practice and policy.
Exposure to UK property sector – •	 a large 
part of our Professional Services Division’s 
revenue is derived from the UK property sector.  
Approximately 36% of Divisional revenues are 
derived from the private sector property industry.  
Whilst in recent history this has been an area 
of significant economic activity, the current 
slow-down in this sector will inevitably impact 
on our activity in this area.  Alongside this 
private sector exposure we also run a significant 
element of work on behalf of the public sector 
and we aim to shift resources into this sector 
as economic activity in the private sector 
slows.  However we will continue to monitor the 
resourcing levels of the affected businesses and 
flex them appropriately.

StateMeNt oF DiReCtoRS’ ReSPoNSiBilitieS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and parent Company financial statements under United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and •	
explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will •	
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ Report continued Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 20
StateMeNt oF DiReCtoRS’ ReSPoNSiBilitieS (continued)
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and •	
the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit •	
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
eMPloyee iNvolveMeNt 
The Group has continued its practice of keeping employees informed of matters affecting them as employees and the 
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Group.
This is achieved through consultations with employee representatives.
DiSaBleD eMPloyeeS 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair consideration for all vacancies in accordance with 
their particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to accommodate 
their requirements and disabilities in order that their employment with the Group may continue.
It is the policy of the Group that training, career development and promotion opportunities should be available to  
all employees.
PayMeNt PoliCy aND PRaCtiCe 
It is the Group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction, to ensure 
that suppliers are aware of these terms and abide by them. Trade creditors at the year end amount to 88 days (2007 66 
days) of average supplies for the year. 
ChaRitaBle DoNatioNS 
The Group made no charitable donations in the year (2007 nil). 
CReSt 
Supporta plc share dealings have been settled on CREST since the admission of the ordinary shares to AIM. CREST is 
the computerised system for the settlement of share dealings on the London Stock Exchange. It reduces the amount of 
documentation required and also makes the trading of shares faster and more secure. CREST enables shares to be held 
in electronic form instead of the traditional share certificates. CREST is voluntary, and shareholders can keep their share

Directors’ Report continued Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 21
iNtRoDuCtioN 
Supporta PLC is an AIM Listed Company and while the AIM rules do not require the Group to comply with any specific 
corporate governance principles, the Group adopts generally accepted corporate governance good practice wherever size 
and resources permit. 
the BoaRD oF DiReCtoRS 
The Group supports the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Group. The Board is responsible for 
approving Group policy and strategy. It meets periodically and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for 
decision. Management supplies the Board with appropriate and timely information and the Directors are free to seek any 
further information they consider necessary.
The current Board consists of five executive Directors and two Non-executive Directors. The Non-executive Directors 
are independent of management and any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgment. The Non-executive Directors provide a strong independent element on the Board and bring 
experience at a senior level to business operations and strategy. The Non-executive Chairman of the Board is Dr. C Grace 
and the Group Chief Executive is J Jasper.
RelatioNS With ShaReholDeRS 
The Group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the Group’s strategy and performance, 
Board membership and quality of management. It therefore holds regular meetings and presentations to its institutional 
shareholders to discuss objectives.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is used to communicate with private investors and they are encouraged to participate. 
The Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees is available to answer questions. Separate resolutions are 
proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there is a resolution to approve the annual 
report and accounts. The Company counts all proxy votes and will indicate the level of proxies lodged on each resolution, 
after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
aCCouNtaBility aND auDit 
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group position and prospects in all interim 
and price-sensitive reports, reports to regulators and in the information required to be presented by statute.
The Audit Committee comprises Dr. C Grace and N Scholte who are Non-executive Directors. The terms of reference of the 
Committee include keeping under review the scope and results of the external audit and its cost effectiveness. The Committee 
reviews the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. This includes reviewing the nature and extent of non-audit 
services supplied by the external auditor to the Group, seeking to balance objectivity and value for money.
iNteRNal CoNtRol 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives. It should be recognised that such systems can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
aSSeSSMeNt oF BuSiNeSS RiSK 
A system of business risk identification, assessment, and evaluation is in place within the management process throughout 
the Group. Strategic risks are regularly reviewed by the Board. Risks relating to the key activities within the subsidiary 
operating units are assessed continuously.
Corporate Governance Statement Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 22
CoNtRol eNviRoNMeNt 
The Group’s operating procedures include a comprehensive system for reporting financial and non-financial information to 
the Board, including:
preparation of 3-year strategy plans for business development; •	
preparation and review of annual budgets; •	
review of the business at each Board meeting, focusing on any new risks arising (for example key changes in the market). •	
CoNtRol PRoCeDuReS 
Detailed operational procedures have been developed for each of the Group’s operating businesses that embody key 
controls. The implications of changes in law and regulations are taken into account within these procedures.
MoNitoRiNG PRoCeSSeS 
There are clear procedures for monitoring the system of key controls. The most significant component is a review by the 
Audit Committee of the process for identifying and assessing risks and the effectiveness of controls.
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but has decided that this is not justified at present. 
However, it will keep the decision under review on at least an annual basis.
GoiNG CoNCeRN 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
DiReCtoRS’ ReMuNeRatioN 
The Board recognises that Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders and is committed to 
following current best practice. The particulars of the remuneration of the Directors and their interests are set out in the 
Directors’ Report. The Remuneration Committee comprises Dr. C Grace and N Scholte. 
Corporate Governance Statement continued Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 23
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Supporta Plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise 
the principal accounting policies, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated 
cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, the consolidated statement of 
recognised income and expense and notes 1 to 37. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Supporta Plc for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
ReSPeCtive ReSPoNSiBilitieS oF DiReCtoRS aND auDitoRS 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set  
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review that is cross 
referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for  
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Report, the Financial Director’s Report, and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BaSiS oF auDit oPiNioN 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements.
oPiNioN 
In our opinion: 
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, •	
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and •	
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. •

GeNeRal iNFoRMatioN 
Supporta plc is a public limited Company (‘Company’) incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly 
traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered 
address is 3 Kingmaker Court, Warwick Technology Park, Warwick, CV34 6UT, United Kingdom. 
The Group’s principal activities are the provision of outsourcing services to the public sector. These services are typically 
provided under long term contracts or framework agreements, with shorter term consultancy assignments being delivered 
under letters of engagement. Our Supporta Care Division specialises in the provision of domiciliary care services which 
are designed to help people live independently in their own homes. The Supporta Professional Services division delivers 
Architecture, Business Process Outsourcing, Engineering, Land & property Consultancy & Records Management services.
BaSiS oF aCCouNtiNG 
The financial statements comply with EU adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The accounting 
policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these consolidated financial statements  
and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2006 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS.
BaSiS oF PRePaRatioN 
For all years to 31 March 2007, the Group prepared its audited financial statements under UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). For the year ending 31 March 2008 the Group is required to prepare its annual 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting standards adopted for use in the European Union 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below, taking into 
account the requirements and options in IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ . The 
transition date for the Group’s application of IFRS is 1 April 2006 and the comparative figures for 31 March 2007 have 
been restated accordingly. Reconciliations of the income statement (previously profit and loss account) and balance sheet 
from previously reported UK GAAP to IFRS are shown in note 36.
BaSiS oF CoNSoliDatioN 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of Supporta plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings for the year, 
made up to 31 March each year.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, any intra-group balances, unrealised gains and losses or income 
and expenses arising from intra-group trading are eliminated. Where accounting policies used in individual financial 
statements of a subsidiary Company differ from Group policies, adjustments are made to bring these policies in line with 
Group policies.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies to obtain 
economic benefit to the Group. Subsidiary companies acquired during the year are consolidated using the purchase 
method. The results of subsidiary companies acquired are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the 
acquisition date.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair values of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised 
as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount 
on acquisition) is recognised directly in the income statement.
Unrealised gains on transactions between Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
tRaNSitioN to iFRS 
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRSs in the transition period. The following exemptions 
have been taken in these consolidated financial statements:
(i)  IFRS 3 – Business combinations 
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ retrospectively to acquisitions that took place  
prior to 1 April 2006. As a result, the carrying amount of goodwill in the UK GAAP balance sheet at 31 March 2006  
is brought forward to the IFRS opening balance sheet without adjustment. 
Accounting Policies Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 29
tRaNSitioN to iFRS (continued)
(ii)  IAS 19 – Employee benefits – actuarial gains and losses 
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses to 1 April 2006 for all defined benefit 
pension schemes.
(iii)  IFRS 2 – Share-based payment 
IFRS 2 has not been applied to share-based payments granted before 7 November 2002 nor those granted after  
7 November 2002 that had vested prior to 1 April 2006. The Group has adopted IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payment’ for share 
options granted after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 1 April 2005. The adoption of IFRS 2 has not required 
numerical adjustments to be made to the balance sheet at 1 April 2006 or to the income statement for the year ended 
31 March 2007. 
NoN-CuRReNt aSSetS helD FoR Sale 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through 
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the 
date of classification.
ReveNue ReCoGNitioN 
Group revenue is the fair value of the consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services 
provided, excluding VAT and trade discounts.
Revenue generated in Supporta Care is attributable to the provision of both home care services and qualified social care 
staff, primarily to local authorities.
Revenue generated by Supporta Professional Services is attributable to the provision of architectural and engineering 
consultancy services primarily to Registered Social Landlords and the Home Office, and on business process outsourcing 
and consultancy. 
Where services are provided on annual contracts, revenue is spread evenly over the duration of the contract. Where annual 
contracts do not apply then revenue is recognised at fair value by reference to the estimated percentage of completion of 
the provision of services.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life  
of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
eXCePtioNal iteMS
Exceptional items are disclosed where these are material and considered necessary to explain the underlying financial 
performance of the Group. They are either one off in nature or necessary elements of expenditure to derive future benefits 
for the Group which have not been capitalised in the balance sheet.
SeGMeNtal RePoRtiNG 
A business segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or service and that is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from other business segments. 
FiNaNCe CoStS 
Finance costs comprise interest payable, net foreign exchange losses, and finance charges on finance leases. Interest 
payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.
iNtaNGiBle aSSetS 
Intangible assets purchased separately from a business are capitalised at their cost. 
Customer related intangibles 
The Group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on business combinations. An intangible asset 
will be recognised as long as the asset is identifiable and its fair value can be measured reliably. Amortisation is provided 
on the fair value of the asset and is calculated on a straight line basis over its useful life, the range of which is between 
one and nine years. 
Accounting Policies continued Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 30
iNtaNGiBle aSSetS (continued)
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions being the excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and tested for impairment on an annual basis. There is 
no restatement of goodwill that was amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not 
written back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal. 
Computer software costs 
Expenditure on the development of new software products is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is 
incurred with the exception of expenditure on the development of certain new product projects where the outcome of 
those projects is assessed as being reasonably certain as regards viability and technical feasibility. Such expenditure is 
capitalised and amortised over a period not longer than three years following the completion of the product project.
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an 
intangible asset. This is then capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
Amortisation is provided by equal annual instalments over its expected useful life of 3 years, down to its residual value.
Computer software licences capitalised are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected useful life of 3 years, 
down to their residual values.
PRoPeRty, PlaNt & eQuiPMeNt 
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value of assets over their estimated useful economic lives. 
The range of estimated useful lives for each major asset category, which are reviewed annually, are:
Leasehold property  – Term of the lease 
Freehold property  – over 50 years 
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings  – 3 to 8 years  
(including computer equipment)  
and motor vehicles 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
iMPaiRMeNt oF aSSetS 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
Impairments when they arise are shown in share-based payment charge, amortisation and exceptional items line of the 
Consolidated Income Statement and are disclosed further in note 4 to the financial statements. 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (or group of cash 
generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognised. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to IFRS, even though no indication of 
impairment existed.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
 
Accounting Policies continued Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 31
iMPaiRMeNt oF aSSetS (continued)
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been 
adjusted. Any resulting changes are recognised in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Except in the case of goodwill, an impairment loss is only reversed if there is a subsequent increase in the recoverable 
amount that can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. An impairment loss 
in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
Impairment losses are shown in the share-based payment charge, amortisation and exceptional items line of the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
leaSiNG 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is to be included in 
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion 
of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
BoRRoWiNG CoStS 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred in accordance with the benchmark accounting treatment 
under IAS 23. 
taXatioN 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit  
is different from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure  
which are not taxable or deductible in the year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact that it is taxable  
or deductible in another period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax base and 
accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination. Deferred tax is not provided for 
on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
FiNaNCial iNStRuMeNtS 
Financial assets or liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Classification of financial instruments 
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.

Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that 
they meet the following two conditions:
They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are potentially •	
unfavourable to the Group; and
Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that •	
includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will 
be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the 
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial 
statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as equity are dividends and are recorded directly 
in equity. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
Recognition and valuation of financial assets 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost, less impairment.
Impairment of trade receivables is recorded if there are objective indicators that suggest that the debts are not full 
recoverable or that the fair value of the receivable is impaired at the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank. Cash and cash equivalents excludes overdrafts.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. Financial liabilities include loan notes issued on acquisition and deferred consideration. These financial 
liabilities are recorded at their fair value. Finance charges are allocated to the income statement using an effective interest 
rate, on the outstanding carrying value of the instrument.  
Bank borrowings 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at their fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost. 
Finance charges are allocated to the income statement using an effective interest rate, on the outstanding carrying value 
of the instrument.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and thereafter at amortised cost.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are initially measured at fair value. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap 
contracts to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of Directors, which provide written 
principles in the use of financial derivatives. The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is 
available to meet foreseeable cash requirements and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. Interest rate risk is managed 
through the use of hedging arrangements.

FiNaNCial iNStRuMeNtS (continued)
Recognition and valuation of financial assets (continued)
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (continued) 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash 
flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the 
cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the same 
time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised 
in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of 
an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statements in the same period in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period.
RetiReMeNt BeNeFitS 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Any contributions 
unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension plan. For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising are recognised directly in equity in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the 
period in which they arise.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, at the balance sheet date. 
Gains and losses on curtailments/settlements are recognised in the income statement when the curtailment/settlement occurs.
ShaRe-BaSeD PayMeNt 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ . In accordance with the IFRS 1 exemption, IFRS 2 
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not been vested prior to 1 April 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for share options.
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined 
indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant 
date using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes) and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Equity-settled share-based payments are expensed in the income statement with a corresponding credit to “share-based 
payment reserve” . Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to 
share capital, and where appropriate share premium.
PRoviSioNS 
The Group has provisions in place for onerous leases and dilapidations. The provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be 
reliably estimated. Any differences between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period 
when such a determination is made.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information
for the year ended 31 March 2008

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
The Group makes estimated and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting estimates and assumptions that  
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the  
next financial year are described below: 
Revenue recognition on projects 
At the year end, there were projects which were partially complete. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
revenue and profit are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract. This is based on costs 
incurred to date and an estimate of future costs.
Share-based payments 
The charge to the income statements in relation to options and incentive plans is based on the Black-Scholes valuation 
technique. This technique requires a number of assumptions to be made such as those in relation to share price 
volatility, movement in interest rates, dividend yields and staff behavioural patterns. 
Property provisions 
The Group occupies leasehold properties for which a provision is made for dilapidations or other future expenditure 
commitments. At 31 March 2008 the provisions are £0.27m (2007: £0.34m). These provisions reflect conditions existing 
at the year end, and are judgemental by their nature. 
Fair Value Adjustments 
The valuation of customer related intangible and adjustments as permitted under the hindsight period are based on a 
number of assumptions including customer retention and growth rate. Further details are included in the intangible 
assets accounting policy.
Key areas of judgment include the distinction a valuation of intangible assets acquired as detailed in the intangible 
assets note and the recognition of revenue as detailed in the revenue recognition policy.
Impairment 
The impairment tests require a number of assumptions and judgments to be made. An explanation of these judgments 
and estimates are detailed in the impairment accounting policy. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
Assumptions are used in the actuarial valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes. Details of these 
assumptions are disclosed in note 25. Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 36

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from 
the business combination. The carrying value of goodwill has been allocated to the following cash generating units:

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill might be impaired. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the value in use, determined from 
estimated discontinued future net cash flows or recoverable amounts, goodwill is written down to the value in use 
and an impairment charge is recognised.
The recoverable amount of the CGU’s has been determined by value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculations, are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, and expected changes to selling price 
and direct costs during future years. The pre-tax discount rate of 9.8% was used in the value in use calculation. In 
determining the value in use, cashflows have been increased by 4% to reflect potential growth over future years. 
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on management’s expectations of future changes in the market.

Bank loans of £7.13m (2007: £9.81m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest 
rate risk. Other borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Group’s borrowings is not significantly different to the carrying value.
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
Working capital facilities of £2.00m (2007: £2.00m) have been secured by a charge over the Group’s assets.  i. 
The average effective interest rate on the working capital facility approximates 5.0 per cent (2007: 4.9 per cent) 
per annum and are determined based on 2.5 per cent plus prime rate.
The Group has three principal bank loans:     ii. 
a loan of £1.55m (2007: £2.19m). The loan was taken out in the year ending 31 March 2007. Repayments a. 
commenced on 31 December 2006 and will continue until 31 December 2011. The loan is secured by a fixed and 
floating charge over the Group’s assets. This loan carries interest rate at 2.5 per cent above 3-month LIBOR.
a loan of £6.14m (2007: £8.65m). The loan was taken out in the year ending 31 March 2007. Repayments b. 
commenced on 31 December 2006 and will continue until 31 December 2011. The loan is secured by a fixed and 
floating charge over the Group’s assets. This loan carries interest rate at 2.5 per cent above 3-month LIBOR.
a loan of £7.57m (2007: £4.95m). The loan was taken out in the year ending 31 March 2007. Repayments will c. 
commence on 31 December 2008 and will continue until 31 December 2011. The loan is secured by a fixed and

The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for 
the Group’s operations.
The Group’s capital includes the capital and long-term loans. Long-term financial projections are prepared and capital 
requirements are assessed using these projections along with sensitivities. The Group’s banking agreements require us 
to comply with covenants for net debt to normalised earnings before interest, tax and amortisation, interest cover and 
debt service to cashflow ratios. As a result of the renegotiation of the banking facilities the Group was not required 
to measure covenants at 31
st
 March and the next testing date is now 30
th
 June 2008. The Group had met each of its 
covenants at the other quarterly testing dates during the year ended 31
st
 March 2008.
The main risks arising from the Group financial instruments are interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. The board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Short-term debtors and creditors
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency  
risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of cash, bank borrowings and hire purchase contracts. The fair 
value of the financial instruments is not materially different to book value.  Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 49

At 31 March 2008 bank loans amounting to £8.33m were subject to floating interest rates. The floating rate 
borrowings bear interest rates based on LIBOR.
The Group entered into a hedging arrangement in the year ended 31 March 2007 to fix an additional £6.60m of its 
borrowings at a fixed rate of 5.00% for four years. This was reduced by £0.83m by a loan repayment and will reduce 
further as the loan is repaid. This arrangement has 3.25 years remaining.
The Group has derived a sensitivity analysis based on readily available information for forward fixed and floating 
interest rates.

The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into at 31 March 2008 is estimated at £0.02m (2007: £0.11m). These 
amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. The balance in equity at 
31 March 2008 will continuously be released to the income statement over the term of the loan agreement.
The weighted average fixed interest rate and weighted average period for which the rate fixed for liabilities at  
31 March 2008 was 7.6% and 2.0 years respectively. 
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable cash 
requirements and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of working capital facilities.
Credit risk
Credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The Group policy is to assess 
the credit quality of each customer before accepting any terms of trade.

The onerous lease provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s net liability for unavoidable costs 
(i.e. the net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or 
penalties arising from failure to fulfil it) to be incurred for onerous lease contracts. The estimate is based on the terms 
of the leases.
The dilapidations/rectification provision has been made for costs expected to arise at the termination of leases. The 
provision is based on the expected dilapidation costs at the point of acquisition, and can be summarised as follows:

Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution Group personal pension scheme for the benefit of certain employees. 
The Group contributes to personal pension plans of certain Directors and employees. The Group also operates a 
stakeholder pension plan available to all employees. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group 
in funds under the control of trustees.
The total cost charged to income of £0.26m (2007: £0.35m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the 
Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 March 2008, contributions of £0.27m (2007: £0.38m) 
due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit plan
The Group contributes to defined benefit pension schemes for the benefit of certain employees of Supporta Services 
Limited; previously employed by Parys Snowdon Payroll Services Limited and Parys Snowdon Group Limited and its 
subsidiaries which have been hived up into it. 
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits which accrue at a rate of either 1.25% or  
1.67% per cent of final salary for each year of pensionable service up to attainment of a normal retirement age of 65. 
Some members are entitled to retire at age 60 with unreduced benefits. In addition, members who, as described above, 
accrue pension at the rate of 1.25% receive a lump sum on retirement equal to 3 times their pension. No other post-
retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded schemes. The funding level at 31 March 2008 was 63%  
(2007: 62%) and there are no partly or wholly unfunded liabilities.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried 
out at 31 March 2008 by KPMG, the schemes independent actuaries. The present values of the defined obligation, the 
related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The overall expected rate of return on assets (see table of assumptions used) has been derived as the weighted 
average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The expected return for each assets class reflects 
a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking view on the financial markets (as suggested by 
the yield available) and the views of investment organisations.

The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares for the three 
dealing days prior to the date of the grant. There is no vesting period. If the options remain unexercised after a period 
of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited after the expiry of 30 days 
from the date the employee leaves the Group.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended  
31 March 2007 82.0p per share. No share options were exercised in the current year. The options outstanding at  
31 March 2008 had an exercise price between 40.0p and 89.5p (2007: 40.0p to 89.5p). The estimated fair value  
of options granted in the year using the Black-Scholes method, was 2.0p per share (2007: 30.9p per share).
The inputs into the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the year were as follows:
2008 2007
Weighted average share price 36.6p 71.1p
Weighted average exercise price 60.8p 65.6p
Expected volatility 24.3% 44.0%
Expected life 4 years 4 years
Risk free rate 4.5% 5.0%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
The weighted average contractual life of the options is 8.51 years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous 
6 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural conditions.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.26m (2007: £0.25m) relating to equity-settled share-based payment

The adoption of IFRS does not impact on the cash flows previously disclosed under UK GAAP in any of the periods of 
account in the interim results. The IAS 7 cash flow statement is presented in a different format than required under 
UK GAAP with cash flow split into three categories of activities – operating, investing and financing.
IFRS does however have a different definition of cash and cash equivalents for cash flow statement purposes, this has 
had the effect of moving bank overdrafts to financing activities.
Explanations of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS, giving rise to adjustments in the reconciliations
IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements
The format of the IFRS financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of financial 
statements”, which differs from its UK equivalent.  In particular there is greater flexibility on the presentation of 
information in the primary statements. Certain headings are mandatory but IFRS allows companies to adopt other 
headings in accordance with the nature of their business.
IFRS 3 Business combinations
On initial accounting for a business combination, fair values attributed to the acquirees identifiable assets and 
liabilities may be provisional. Subsequent adjustments to these provisional values arising within twelve months of the 
acquisition date are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill. Any adjustments to provisional fair values identified 
after this twelve month period are recognised in the income statement.
IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill. The standard requires an annual impairment test to be performed. As 
a consequence the value of goodwill at the date of transition has been frozen and the amortisation charges since 
that date have been reversed. Annual impairment tests have been performed and an impairment of £3.58m has been 
recognised at March 2007.
IFRS 3 requires that fair values are attributed to identified intangible assets acquired via business combinations. As a 
result the amount attributed to goodwill arising on consolidation correspondingly reduced. The Group has identified 
all such intangibles for the Group’s business combinations since 1 April 2006. Assets so identified amount to £3.31m 
at 31 March 2008. These represent the net present value of discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from 
customer related intangibles. This value has been transferred from goodwill to other intangible assets. The intangible 
assets will be amortised over their expected useful life. In accordance with IAS12 deferred taxation of £0.71m at 
31 March 2008 has been recognised in goodwill in respect of these intangibles and will be released in line with the 
amortisation of the intangible.  Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 66
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information continued
for the year ended 31 March 2008
36  ReCoNCiliatioN BetWeeN uK GaaP aND iFRS (continued)
On transition to IFRS, the Group has chosen not to restate acquisitions occurring prior to the date of transition. However, 
under IFRS, deferred tax would have been recognised on the fair value adjustments of acquisitions prior to that date. The 
Group has therefore provided the deferred tax at a rate of 30% based on the Group’s ongoing tax charges.
IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
In November 2006, the Group decided to sell the Payroll division of the Group. IFRS 5 requires these discontinued 
operations to be reclassified into one line on the Income Statement which is shown on page 22.
Under IFRS 5 ‘Assets held for sale and disposal groups’, the assets and liabilities of the Payroll division required 
reclassification to assets held for sale and liabilities relating to assets held for sale.
IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: Provisions
IAS 1 requires provisions to be split between current and non-current liabilities.
IAS 32/39 Financial instruments
IAS 32 and IAS 39 must be applied whereas the UK GAAP equivalent, FRS 26, is not a requirement for AIM listed 
companies. Under IAS 39 the interest rate swap derivatives are recognised at fair value and accounted for using hedge 
accounting. Any movements in fair value go to equity and a corresponding hedge reserve has been set up.

Parent Company Financial Statements
The separate financial statements of Supporta plc are presented on pages 70 to 76 as required by the Companies Act 1985 
(‘the Act’). The Group has elected not to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in the individual Company 
accounts for the parent Company and subsidiary undertakings, and accordingly these financial statements have been 
prepared under UK accounting standards and in accordance with the Act. They are therefore presented separately to the 
Group consolidated financial statements which have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards. Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 69

Company Accounting Policies
for the year ended 31 March 2008
BaSiS oF PReP aRatioN
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards and under the historical cost convention.
The Principal Accounting Policies of the Company are set out below. The policies have remained unchanged from the 
previous period. The policies remain the most appropriate for the year.
tuRNoveR
Company turnover is the total amount receivable by the Company for goods supplied and services provided, excluding VAT 
and trade discounts.
taNGiBle FiXeD aSSetS aND DePReCiatioN
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less 
estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives. 
The range of estimated useful lives for each major assets category, which are reviewed annually are:
Leasehold property Term of the lease
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings (including computer equipment) and motor vehicles 3 to 8 years
leaSeD aSSetS
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their 
estimated useful economic lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance 
outstanding and is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease. All other leases are regards as operating 
leases and the payments made under them are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
iNveStMeNtS
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
DeFeRReD taXatioN
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation 
to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of 
tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
FiNaNCial iNStRuMeNtS
Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Income and expenditure arising on the financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged  
to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
RetiReMeNt BeNeFitS
Defined contribution scheme
The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to individual policies in respect of the accounting period.
ShaRe-BaSeD P ayMeNtS
The Company operates several share option plans for key employees. All share-based payment arrangements granted after  
7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 April 2006 are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined 
indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant 
date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a 
corresponding credit to “share-based payment reserve” .
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based 
on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if 
there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior 
periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, 
and where appropriate share premium. Supporta plc  –  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 72

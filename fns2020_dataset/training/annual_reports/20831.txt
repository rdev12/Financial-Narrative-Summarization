Our markets
Reinsurance market 
•  The global reinsurance market provides 
risk transfer and contingent capital to 
insurance companies.
•  Amlin underwrites reinsurance principally 
from its Syndicate 2001 and Amlin 
Bermuda platforms. The main focus of 
Amlin’s reinsurance portfolio is catastrophe 
reinsurance which protects against major 
losses caused by natural catastrophes, 
such as hurricanes or earthquakes.
•  The market is dominated by large 
reinsurers in Germany, Switzerland, 
Bermuda, the US and within Lloyd’s.
Commercial insurance market
•  This market provides motor, property 
and liability insurance to commercial 
enterprises and individuals.
•  UK commercial business written by 
Amlin UK is sourced through Lloyd’s 
and regional brokers.
•  Amlin Corporate Insurance is a major 
participant in the commercial market in 
the Benelux countries, sourcing business 
through the Dutch Beurs co-insurance 
market and local brokers.
Global specialty market 
•  This market insures a wide range of risks 
which are typically commercial, large and 
complex, requiring specialist underwriting 
expertise and individually tailored cover.
•  Distinct markets include the US surplus 
lines market and the international marine 
and aviation markets.
•  The majority of Amlin’s specialty business 
comes from the US. The acquisition of ACI 
has significantly increased our presence in 
Continental European specialty markets.
•  Our office in Singapore covers Asian 
energy and cargo business.

Amlin distribution channels
Serving a global client base
The majority of our business is sourced 
through independent insurance brokers. 
Brokers provide a global distribution network 
and, because of their knowledge of Amlin’s 
products and services, provide an effi cient 
distribution channel for our business. 
We favour specifi c direct risk, known as 
facultative insurance, and treaty reinsurance 
which provides tailored cover for an 
insurance company client’s own portfolio. 
Business underwritten in this way provides 
us with control over the pricing and terms 
of the contract and we tend to have a 
greater connection with the ultimate 
insured, or reinsured. 
We are also prepared to partner intermediaries, 
managing general agents and insurance 
brokers, in underwriting on binding authorities 
or lineslips, where their controls are perceived 
to be good and our ability to infl uence the 
type of business accepted is high. This is 
imperative as binding authorities assign the 
day-to-day underwriting to the underwriting 
agents or brokers. For these contracts, 
we are reliant on the intermediary to apply 
judgement on our behalf, although they 
are given a clear framework within which 
to work. In these circumstances the 
intermediary is incentivised to produce 
an underwriting profi t through the payment 
of profi t commission.

A diverse 
and well 
balanced 
business
Amlin writes a diverse portfolio of risk. 
This diversity has been further broadened 
during 2009 with the acquisition of Amlin 
Corporate Insurance. 
While the business overall is inﬂ uenced 
by the cyclical nature of insurance 
markets, the diversity of the portfolio 
means that pricing and claims are not 
heavily correlated across different classes. 
Our ﬂ exible underwriting strategy allows 
us to optimise capital allocation according 
to the relative strength of our markets.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
A period of positive development
Results and dividend 
2009 was a record year for Amlin, as 
well as one of significant strategic progress. 
Pre-tax profits of £509.1 million and a return 
on equity of 37.0% sustained our long-term 
outperformance, as demonstrated by our 
weighted average return on equity of 29.1% 
since 2005. The 2009 results clearly benefited 
from a more favourable trading environment 
compared with the dual headwinds of major 
catastrophe losses and financial market 
turmoil of 2008, but they also reflect the 
continuing strength and diversity of 
Amlin’s business. 
The Board has decided to pay a second 
interim dividend, in lieu of a final dividend, of 
13.5 pence per share making total dividends 
declared for the year of 20.0 pence per share, 
a 17.6% increase over 2008. The second 
interim dividend will be paid on 31 March 
2010 to shareholders on the register at 
19 March 2010. 
Our goal remains to steadily grow the 
dividend. We also maintain the authority 
to buy back shares although we did not 
make any purchases in 2009.
Strategic progress
Amlin’s consistent record of performance is 
testament to the successful implementation 
of the Amlin Vision and investment in the 
five year strategy put in place in 2004. 
We believe we have achieved our principal 
goal of delivering long-term value to our 
shareholders, with a cross-cycle return on 
equity which is one of the strongest in the 
global non-life industry. Our consistently high 
level of client retention across the business 
shows that we have also remained focused 
on providing high standards of service and 
expertise to our global client base.
Amlin’s business has grown and 
diversified significantly since the Vision 
was first articulated, but the strength of our 
corporate culture and the stability of our team 
have meant that our core values have continued 
to underpin and drive our business. We have 
extended our management infrastructure 
and governance to facilitate the further 
growth envisaged in the next phase of 
our strategic plan and ensuring that we 
can sustain our culture and values into 
the future remains a key priority. 
During 2009 we reached a milestone in the 
development of one of our most important 
strategic investments. Amlin Bermuda, a 
2005 start up, paid its first dividend of 
$200 million to the Group in October 2009, 
followed by a further dividend of $169 million 
in February 2010. Amlin Bermuda was our 
first major foray away from the Lloyd’s 
market and is now a substantial and 
successful reinsurer in its own right. 
We also embarked on a major new 
strategic initiative with the acquisition 
of Fortis Corporate Insurance (now Amlin 
Corporate Insurance or ACI), which gives 
2009 was a landmark 
year in the development 
of Amlin. With our 
capital strength, 
the diversity of our 
business and the 
quality of our people, 
we are well positioned 
for the future.

us a substantial underwriting platform in 
Continental Europe from which to further 
develop our European presence alongside 
Anglo French Underwriters, which we 
acquired in 2008. We were pleased to 
welcome our new colleagues in ACI, who 
are already contributing their considerable 
experience and expertise to the task 
of integrating ACI into the Group and 
developing new business opportunities 
for the combined entity. 
We continued to invest in opportunities 
for profi table growth through further 
strengthening our existing underwriting 
teams and smaller acquisitions and 
investments focused on developing 
our distribution channels.
Outlook
Following excellent results in 2009 we are 
anticipating increased competition in the 
short term. However, the performance of 
our different classes of business will vary 
and Amlin’s excellent diversity of risk will 
continue to work to our advantage. 
We remain alert to continuing uncertainty 
in the wider economy and consequences 
such as changing regulatory regimes. Our 
response to a wide range of operational 
issues, including Solvency II, demonstrates 
that Amlin is more than ever focused 
on forward thinking and a willingness 
to embrace change. 
With our capital strength, well-established 
underwriting platforms in three major global 
markets, our strong relationships with brokers 
and clients and a wealth of talent and 
experience in the Amlin team, we are 
well positioned for the future.
Governance and the Board
As Amlin has developed from an exclusively 
Lloyd’s-based business prior to 2005 to the 
multi-platform Group that it is today, both our 
Board and executive governance structures 
have developed in order to maintain across 
a wider canvas the high standards of 
accountability and transparency to which 
we aspire. We believe that good governance 
reduces risk and adds value. 
We actively participated in the debate about 
the role of boards through submissions and 
discussion with the Financial Reporting 
Council in its review of the Combined Code 
Measuring our delivery

Our return on equity of 37.0% is an excellent result 
with strong contributions from both underwriting 
and investment returns. Our weighted average 
return on equity over the last fi ve years is now 
29.1%, set against a cross-cycle target of at least 
15% and an estimated cost of equity of between 
8% and 10%.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Committed to good governance
Our strong commitment to high standards of conduct and good governance is 
highlighted in the corporate governance section of this report on page 78.
The board believes that high standards of corporate governance are intrinsic to Amlin’s 
culture and values.
• They are central to fulfi lling many of Amlin’s core values such as integrity, 
professional excellence and sustainability.
• They underpin the objectivity of such processes as insurance reserving, risk 
management, balance sheet and investment management, the design and operation 
of executive remuneration and succession planning.
• They are the basis for the accountability of executive management to the Board and 
of the Board to shareholders.
2009 governance highlights
• Awarded 2009 ICSA Hermes Award for innovation in Governance Reporting.
• Fully compliant with the Combined Code on governance.
• Review of risk appetite and tolerances by category of risk.
• Improved reporting of risk to the Board.
• Overview and direction of the Group’s preparations for Solvency II.
• Transition of the Group’s governance arrangements refl ecting its continuing move 
from a Lloyd’s focus to a multi-platform international insurance group
(now to be the UK Corporate Governance 
Code). We await the fi nal outcome of this 
review later in 2010. In response both to this, 
and to our own changing circumstances, we 
have already made some refi nements to our 
approach, for example in the governance 
relationships between operating subsidiaries 
and the Group (both Board and executive) 
and in the area of risk governance. 
Ram Mylvaganam retired from the Board 
at the 2009 AGM, having given Amlin long 
and valued service which started at Murray 
Lawrence before the creation of Amlin. Ram 
was a loyal and supportive colleague over 
the years, not only to me but to many others 
within the Amlin organisation, and we are 
grateful to him. At the start of 2009, T ony 
Holt was welcomed back to the Board as 
a non-executive, following his retirement as 
Underwriting Director at the end of 2008. 
It is a tribute to the underwriting team and 
culture that T ony built and sustained that his 
colleagues have fi lled his executive shoes 
so effectively, and a great benefi t to the 
Group that his advice, counsel and challenge 
remain available in his new role. 
The Amlin team
2009 saw many valued additions to the 
Amlin team as we continue to position the 
business for future growth. As well as 
welcoming Patrick Coene and his team at 
ACI, we also broadened the executive team 
in areas such as Operations, Risk and 
Compliance as well as making senior 
appointments in Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
Amlin Bermuda. The quality of our people 
continues to be a core strength and I am 
delighted that we have further enhanced our 
capabilities in so many parts of the business. 
Our result this year is excellent. This is due 
to the outstanding performance of Charles 
Philipps, his management colleagues and all 
the employees who have been building the 
business of Amlin year by year. I would like to 
thank them all for their skill and hard work.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Once again, the Group’s 
ﬁnancial performance 
in 2009 was excellent, 
reﬂecting the quality 
of our underwriting 
businesses and a 
recovery in investment 
markets. We also 
made signiﬁcant 
progress strategically, 
most notably with the 
acquisition of the Fortis 
Group’s commercial 
insurance operations in 
the Benelux countries, 
which now trade 
as Amlin Corporate 
Insurance.
A year of growth and delivery
Chief Executive’s review
Financial results
2009 profit before tax, at £509.1 million, was 
a record for the Group (2008: £121.6 million). 
Our return on equity of 37.0% brings our 
average return to 25.6% since we first set 
our cross-cycle target of at least 15% per 
annum back in 2001 (2008: 7.8% and 
22.4% respectively).
As anticipated, we achieved price increases 
across many lines of business, particularly in 
catastrophe reinsurance. This, combined with 
few large catastrophe losses during the year, 
helped us to record an excellent combined 
ratio of 72% (2008: 76%) and, with a stronger 
US dollar relative to sterling, our highest yet 
contribution from underwriting of £365.8 
million (2008: £222.2 million). 
Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda 
contributed £185.0 million and £161.8 million 
respectively to the underwriting return (2008: 
£174.4 million and £46.2 million respectively) 
with a smaller contribution from Amlin 
Corporate Insurance (ACI) of £11.2 million.
Having taken a cautious approach to our 
investments in 2008, given the economic 
environment which resulted from the credit 
crunch, we were in a good position in early 
2009 to increase our exposure to risk assets 
given the low returns offered by UK gilts and 
US treasuries. With the tightening of credit 
spreads seen in the second half, record 
investment returns of £207.5 million were 
achieved (2008: £18.0 million).
Outlook
The restoration of financial strength across 
much of the insurance industry during 2009 
is affecting our ability to raise rates in 2010 
and leading to downward pressure in some 
classes. That said, markets appear to be 
demonstrating good levels of discipline 
in many areas and rate reductions over 
1 January renewals, which represent an 
estimated 20% of the year’s premiums, 
averaged only 1.2%. US catastrophe 
reinsurance rates were down 4.4% on 
peak prices achieved following the 2008 
hurricanes. However, rate increases were 
achieved in some loss-affected areas, 
particularly in France and Australia, and this 
helped balance the reductions. We have 
witnessed improving conditions in our UK 
commercial business and expect this to 
continue during 2010. This, combined with 
the improving airline rates achieved in the 
last quarter of 2009, should help offset the 
modest weakening in other areas.
Premium income levels in 2010 will benefit 
from the consolidation of ACI for a full year 
and from the actions taken to enhance the 
growth potential of Amlin UK. We anticipate 
overall premium growth of some 42% in 
the year.
We remain cautious about the economic 
outlook, and having benefited from tighter 
credit spreads in 2009, it will be more difficult 
to achieve good investment returns in 2010. 
We nevertheless believe that we are well

placed to achieve an overall return on equity 
which is above our cross-cycle target of at 
least 15%.
Capital strength
Net tangible assets increased by 29.3% to 
£1.4 billion during 2009, after £58.5 million 
spent on goodwill and intangibles associated 
with acquisitions and dividends paid of 
£83.8 million. We remain in a robust fi nancial 
position with capital and available resources 
of £655.5 million in excess of our assessed 
capital requirements. This will support 
organic growth, gives us the ability to make 
further strategic acquisitions, and leaves 
us well placed to continue to steadily grow 
the dividend even if earnings are adversely 
affected by signifi cant catastrophe losses.
There is no doubt that our capital strength, 
which supports favourable insurance 
security ratings relative to many competitors, 
contributes to Amlin being a favoured market 
for brokers and insureds. This is evidenced 
by our ability to retain income in markets 
where capacity has increased materially 
in 2009.
Amlin Corporate Insurance
The acquisition of ACI, for consideration 
of €350 million, was completed in July, 
providing us with an excellent entry to the 
Benelux markets where it is the leading 
commercial lines insurer. Following the 
growth of our catastrophe income and 
exposures over recent years, resulting largely 
from the success of Amlin Bermuda which 
we started in 2005, ACI added £225.2 million 
of diversifi ed income to the Group in 2009, 
so bringing greater balance to overall risk 
exposures and scope to further grow our 
reinsurance business in the future. 
While the Benelux market has been 
competitive over the last two years and 
performance was affected by the company’s 
nationalisation by the Dutch state in October 
2008, ACI has a good longer-term track 
record and we are confi dent that it is 
capable of delivering a long-term return in 
line with Amlin’s cross-cycle return target 
of at least 15%.
The acquisition by Amlin resulted in an 
immediate improvement in ACI’s security 
ratings which refl ects the benefi t of 
becoming part of the Amlin Group.
Work on integrating the company has 
proceeded at pace with the intention, over 
the next two years, of replacing those 
services which have historically been 
provided by other parts of the Fortis Group 
and ensuring that Amlin’s standards of risk 
management are applied to this business. 
The management of ACI’s investment 
portfolio was integrated into the Group 
portfolio shortly after the year end. The 
merger of its French business with Anglo 
French Underwriters, which we acquired 
in 2008, is on track for completion in April. 
This will create a business with increased 
market penetration and effi ciencies as it 
grows from a combined premium income 
of €54.4 million.
A key component of integration will be 
the transition, by June 2011, to Amlin’s 
underwriting systems. This will improve 
controls and provide materially better and 
more timely management information on 
both performance and risk. We believe that 
this, and our considerable experience in ACI’s 
business classes, will result in increased 
performance potential and a better platform 
for further growth in continental Europe.
Post acquisition, approximately 64% of ACI’s 
business was marine insurance, bringing 
marine to approximately 14% of Amlin’s 
overall business in 2009. We anticipate this 
will grow further in 2010. This reinforces our 
relevance to brokers and insureds in this area 
and places us amongst the leading marine 
underwriters in the world. 
As recognised at the time of acquisition, the 
ocean hull and marine cargo parts of ACI’s 
account required corrective action which 
had commenced before acquisition. This is 
resulting in a contraction of income in these 
classes as ACI declines risks where it cannot 
achieve satisfactory pricing. The company 
has also reorganised the management 
structure of its marine underwriting in 
Rotterdam, bringing it more into line with 
Amlin’s focus on the accountability of line 
underwriters and underwriting profi tability. 18
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Amlin UK
Strategic investment for today and for the future
In response to changes in the UK market and in anticipation of an upturn in UK 
commercial markets, we have taken a number of steps in the past 18 months to 
strengthen our UK proposition.
• We have made signifi cant investment in our UK marketing capability.
• We have increased the recognition of Amlin’s brand in the UK, now supported 
by Amlin’s sponsorship of European rugby.
• We have continued to expand our property insurance business and successfully 
hired a new team of property underwriters.
• We have selectively increased our alignment with UK brokers such as Miles Smith 
and TL Dallas.
• In January 2010, we acquired Lockton’s insolvency scheme business.
It was a sign of confi dence in ACI following 
its acquisition by Amlin that Räets Marine, 
a signifi cant Dutch marine agency, renewed 
its association with ACI at the end of 2009 
having moved its business to a competitor 
following nationalisation in October 2008. 
Räets sources approximately €60 million 
of good and profi table marine hull and 
liability business.
ACI contributed £53.7 million to the 
Group’s profi t before tax and a return on 
the investment, since the acquisition on 
22 July 2009, of 12.8%. Having fi nanced 
the acquisition mostly with cash, it has 
enhanced earnings per share and return 
on equity in 2009.
I have been pleased with the hard work 
and enthusiasm demonstrated by the ACI 
management and employees to deliver 
change where it is required and to adopt 
Amlin’s practices. While much remains to 
be done in optimising its potential, I am 
confi dent that good progress will continue 
to be achieved in 2010 and that it will prove 
to be a value adding acquisition.
Generating returns 
from acquisitions
In addition to ACI, we have invested 
some £59 million in acquisitions since the 
beginning of 2008. In 2008 we acquired 
the renewal rights to HCC’s fl eet motor 
account, acquired minority investments in 
two UK brokers, and bought Anglo French 
Underwriters. We also set up Leadenhall 
Capital Partners in partnership with its 
management. In November 2009, we 
purchased Crowe Livestock Underwriting 
Ltd and in January 2010, we completed 
the transfer of Lockton’s UK insolvency 
practitioners’ insurance business.
These investments have enhanced the 
balance of the Group’s overall underwriting 
portfolio, have added experienced 
professionals to the Group who we believe 
fi t well with Amlin’s culture, and importantly 
are already delivering incremental return to 
shareholders.

Where relevant, the above returns include the proﬁ t

ACI is the ﬁ ve month proﬁ t after tax over acquisition cost.
Business improvement
The changes made to our organisational 
structure in 2008, involving the creation of 
Amlin London and Amlin UK, allowing Group 
management to focus more on strategy, 
have bedded down well. We have also 
increased resources capable of managing 
change across the Group with the aim of 
achieving consistently high standards of 
process and risk management, and in 
particular integrating ACI and ensuring 
that we are ready for Solvency II, the EU 
legislation which takes effect from 2012. 
Proper preparation for Solvency II is critical 
to maintaining the Group’s ability to deliver 
superior levels of return on equity, as a failure 
to meet the standards expected by regulators 
could result in the need to carry signifi cantly 
more regulatory capital. We consider it an 
excellent opportunity to take our risk 
management practices up a level and believe 
that this could create further competitive 
advantage, for example through the prospect 
of improving our fi nancial security ratings. 
Moreover, we believe that there are likely 
to be good opportunities to take advantage 
of situations where weaker companies fail 
to meet the required standards or need 
substantial additional capital and, for 
example, are forced to shed business.

Crowe Livestock Underwriting Ltd
Leading expertise in a new class for Amlin
Established in 1996, Crowe is a leading and internationally recognised coverholder 
which provides specialist insurance to the livestock industry. 
Based in Norfolk with 16 employees, Crowe operates through a network of brokers and 
managing general agents across 45 countries and underwrites a diverse book of livestock 
business including poultry, cattle and aquatics. For the 2010 fi nancial year Crowe expects 
to handle approximately £11 million of gross written premium.
The acquisition adds further diversifi cation to Amlin’s underwriting portfolio, providing 
the opportunity for Amlin to build on its well regarded bloodstock book by entering the 
livestock class. 
People
Y et again, our employee turnover has 
been low, with total and senior underwriter 
turnover during 2009 of only 4.9% and 
1.9% respectively. 
We conducted our third Ipsos MORI survey 
of employees, which again showed very 
positive results with a high alignment 
between Amlin and our employees on 
our strategic direction and goals. We also 
compared very favourably against Ipsos 
MORI’s norms for the fi nancial services 
sector and overall.
The considerable talents and experience 
of our people is a core strength of Amlin. 
In 2009, in addition to those who joined 
the Group through acquisitions, we have 
hired experienced professionals to increase 
our expertise and penetration in a number 
of business classes, such as marine hull, 
property and US casualty, and have 
reinforced our capabilities in risk and 
change management.
The consistent delivery of superior 
performance, ensuring that acquisitions 
deliver value to shareholders and the 
attainment of our Vision of becoming ‘the 
global reference point for quality in our 
markets’ require dedication and hard work. 
I am both proud of, and thankful for, the 
efforts and achievements of our employees 
during 2009.
Summary
2009 was clearly an exceptional year, 
both in terms of fi nancial performance 
and strategic development. It would be 
foolhardy to assume that such a benign 
claims environment is the norm. However, 
underwriting markets in most classes 
remain suffi ciently strong to offer good 
margin potential and we remain focused 
on continuing to deliver superior returns 
on equity. The capability and potential of 
the Group continues to go from strength 
to strength.

Successful ﬁ ve year delivery
We believe that over the last ﬁ ve years we have made considerable strategic   progress. Financially,   we have delivered 
a weighted average return on equity of 29.1% and cumulative proﬁ t after tax of £627.1 million in excess of target 
as shown below. Consequently our total shareholder return has been very strong and at 337% it represents one of 
the highest in the global non-life insurance industry. We believe that we have achieved our Vision in many respects, 
particularly in the London insurance and reinsurance market. As we grow internationally we aim to extend the 
perception of Amlin as ‘the global reference point for quality in our markets’. Key measures of success and steps 
taken to attain our Vision are highlighted below.
1. Proﬁ t focused underwriting excellence
•  Continued low combined ratio, despite major loss activity. Major 
hurricane losses contained with no material ‘reserve creep’. 
•  Five year average claims ratio more than 11% better than 
peer average.
•  Growth of the business by volume and platform. Amlin Bermuda, 
ACI, AFU and Amlin Singapore contributed £500.1 million to gross 
written premium in 2009.
•  Average turnover amongst senior underwriters of 4.7% over 
the period.
2.  Improved understanding of client needs and 
market trends
•  Superior Insurance Financial Strength Ratings assigned to 
Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda. 
•  Start up of Amlin Bermuda in 2005, providing alternative platform 
to Lloyd’s. 16% of gross written premium in 2009.
•  Leadership of process improvement in the London market to 
meet client needs (e.g. policy issuance, electronic processing 
of claims).
3. First class client service standards
•  Strengthening of our operational processes and practices to 
control delivery and measure performance.
•  Impressive claims turnaround statistics, aided by lead position 
and focus on innovation.
•  Focus on contract certainty, with operational statistics showing 
consistent delivery in this area. 
•  Strong continuity of client relationships, highlighted by high 
retention ratios and positive client feedback.
4. Effective risk and capital management
•  Pragmatic reinsurance purchase, balancing the risk return 
relationship to optimise profi tability. Highlighted by reduced 
reinsurance purchase in 2006 contributing to then record profi t.
•  Robust investment framework and approach, delivering superior 
investment returns. Five year average return more than 1% better 
than peer average.
•  Development of an integrated risk appetite framework and 
Enterprise Risk Management system.
•  Proven commitment to return capital to shareholders with special 
dividend, B share issue, share buy back and ordinary dividend per 
share growth over the period.

Sustaining a market leading performance
Looking forward
Consistent Vision with a strategy for growth
We conclude that our Vision remains a sensible aspiration for a 
specialty insurance/reinsurance business like ours. We are convinced 
that shareholder value is delivered through a clear focus on our 
cross-cycle return on equity target and that the goal of delivering at 
least 15% return on equity through time is demanding compared to our 
estimated cost of equity of 8% to 10%. Raising the target could mean 
turning away business that is in our shareholders’ interest to accept. 
The building blocks for our Vision also remain relevant. However, 
we believe it is appropriate to adjust our strategic priorities, with 
‘effective cycle management’ more appropriately defi ned as 
‘effective management of risk and capital’. Additionally, with a high 
level of current and anticipated change both within and external to 
the Group, we have added a business focus area for process and 
change management.
Looking forward, we believe that the strategy for delivery of our 
Vision can achieve signifi cant growth through expansion of the 
platforms that Amlin operates from. Our strong capital position gives 
us the opportunity to deliver growth over the insurance cycle that will 
provide further value to our investors. Evidence suggests that there 
is a positive correlation between profi table growth and the price to 
book multiple. 
Importantly, our growth strategy is focused on keeping balance 
within our portfolios. As we have explained in the past, we aim for 
the mean expected profi tability of our business to cover the losses 
that may be sustained if one of our extreme catastrophe scenarios 
occurs. In recent years this has meant that we have constrained our 
reinsurance underwriting to ensure that this balance was maintained. 
Therefore we have been seeking ways in which we can grow our 
non-catastrophe business, in our core business or via alternative 
platforms and in different geographies. Building in this way develops 
the diversity in our business that has been fundamental to our 
fi nancial and operating performance in recent years and also provides 
the necessary balance to allow our catastrophe business to grow.
Growth through acquisition is central to our plans as we believe that 
organic growth alone is less likely to deliver the quality and scale 
of growth targeted over our strategic horizon. Investments in the 
UK and France in 2008 were initial steps in this direction and the 
acquisition of ACI in 2009 was a material step forward. We continue 
to search for suitable investment opportunities and we believe that 
we can bring added value to such opportunities through integrating 
some of the risk management philosophies and techniques which 
have contributed to the success of Amlin.
The cycle management focus of our Vision also provides exciting 
growth potential within our core businesses. The performance of our 
Syndicate 2001 and Bermudian business platforms over the last fi ve 
years has been excellent and these businesses are in fantastic shape. 
Our commitment to underwriting discipline has meant that some of 
our insurance businesses have become smaller as market conditions 
have deteriorated. However, as the cycle turns, we have the capital 
and the people in place to grow signifi cantly as others withdraw.
Our progress over the last ﬁ ve years has been substantial. The challenge looking forward is to sustain that market 
leading performance. During the year we have given thought to the Vision for the Group for the next stage of its 
development and the strategy to deliver sustained success.  23

Measuring strategic progress
Key priorities for 2010
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used alongside 
operational objectives to measure performance in each 
business area. We set targets and measure performance 
against these on a monthly basis. Our 2009 KPIs together 
with other supporting measures, are detailed in the following 
sections of this Report.
Amlin’s focus for 2010 is centred on three themes: continued optimisation of the core business, 
successfully integrating ACI into the Amlin Group and further alignment of the business and operations 
in line with Solvency II requirements.
The Group’s priorities represent the key benchmarks against which we will measure our progress in 2010. 
Other related or business area speciﬁ c objectives are recognised in the remainder of this Report.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Amlin is a respected brand in the Lloyd’s and London insurance 
markets. Prior to 2009, we had promoted the brand through 
modest UK sponsorships in sectors which we insure, notably 
sailing, horseracing and eventing. 
In late 2008 and mid 2009, we acquired two European 
businesses, Anglo French Underwriters and Fortis (now Amlin) 
Corporate Insurance. We also grew our UK commercial business 
via selective investments in niche businesses, renewal books 
and personnel. As we expanded our business, we needed 
to raise awareness of the Amlin brand among a new and 
broader client base of brokers and insureds.
We chose to partner with rugby as the sport’s values of 
honesty, integrity and teamwork aligned with our own core 
values. We also sought a European deal in support of our growth 
strategy in the region. 
In August 2009, Amlin signed a three-year partnership with the 
European Rugby Cup (ERC). We became title partner of the Amlin 
Challenge Cup and premium partner of the Heineken Cup, both 
elite club rugby competitions which run from October to May 
each season. 
We underpinned the ERC partnership with a broadcast sponsorship 
of rugby on Sky Sports television and web, for which an innovative 
campaign was created.
Finally, we appointed Lawrence Dallaglio, a well respected former 
player and commentator, as our ambassador in order to cement 
the link between Amlin insurance and the world of rugby.
Charles Philipps Amlin CEO 
“ As leaders in our respective ﬁ elds, a partnership between Amlin and 
ERC is an excellent ﬁ t. We look forward to working collaboratively for 
the beneﬁ t of European rugby and to building awareness of Amlin 
among our brokers and clients.”
Lawrence Dallaglio Amlin Rugby Ambassador 
“ Rugby has always been admired for its core values of honesty, integrity, 
team work, respect and desire for success. Amlin as a company and 
as a business shares those values”.

Amlin London
A reputation for delivery
2009 was a year of excellent underwriting and 
operational performance. We expect competitive 
pressures to provide a challenge in 2010 but our 
proposition is strong and we are well positioned 
to maintain a high level of performance.
2009 highlights
• Gross written premium up 24% to £855.7 million, driven by the stronger US 
dollar, an average rate increase of 4.7% and the addition of new business within 
Reinsurance and Property & Casualty.
• Claims ratio of 29%, refl ecting benign catastrophe loss experience and excellent 
claims development. 
• Strength of client relationships clearly demonstrated by a 91% retention ratio.
• Operational and management changes in 2008 successfully embedded.
• Formal strategy established for key broker relationship management and 
identifi cation of new business opportunities.
2010 priorities
• Further develop strategic relationships with key brokers; identify and target 
business development opportunities.
• Additional investment in underwriting where opportunities identifi ed.
• Continued development of aggregate modelling and technical pricing.
Business focus
• Amlin London differentiates itself in the Lloyd’s market by the expertise and 
experience of its underwriters, its focus on excellence of service to both brokers 
and clients and its superior capital strength.
• Our track record of performance across the pricing cycle refl ects an established 
strategy focused on a well diversifi ed account, profi table gross underwriting, 
rigorous risk management and careful risk selection.
• We write a small percentage line across a large number of risks rather than taking 
large shares of fewer risks. This controls exposures and enhances diversity within 
each underwriting portfolio.
• Catastrophe exposures are carefully managed through risk selection, line size and 
risk modelling.

Amlin London operates through Syndicate 
2001 at Lloyd’s. It is organised into four 
business units: Reinsurance, Property & 
Casualty, Marine and Aviation, covering 
25 classes of business, creating a diverse 
portfolio of risk. Although business is 
written worldwide, the key geographic 
market is the US, which accounted for 
51% of business written in 2009.
The division is managed by an executive 
team led by Underwriting Director, Simon 
Beale. Each business unit is managed by a 
Head Underwriter with extensive experience 
in their respective markets. Our specialist 
underwriters are supported by dedicated 
claims and policy wordings teams. 
Market overview
Lloyd’s is the world’s leading specialist 
insurance market, with more than 80 
syndicates and gross written premium  
of nearly £18 billion
1
.
For many years, Amlin’s Syndicate 2001 
has been among the largest underwriting 
businesses in the Lloyd’s market.
Lloyd’s offers a number of benefits to its 
underwriting members such as its global 
licensing network. While reinsurance can be 
written unlicensed in most territories, Lloyd’s 
network of licences allows syndicates to 
write insurance in more than 200 countries
1
. 
The access this gives to the US insurance 
market, the largest market by premium in 
the world, is particularly important. 
Lloyd’s syndicates also benefit from a well 
developed distribution through dedicated 
Lloyd’s brokers, which until recently were 
the only intermediaries able to access the 
Lloyd’s market. Most of Amlin’s Lloyd’s 
business is sourced through global brokers 
operating in the London subscription market, 
as shown in the adjacent table. 
Lloyd’s is predominantly a subscription 
market, where several syndicates will 
take a share of a contract rather than one 
underwriting the whole. This facilitates 
effective placement of large and complex 
contracts and allows clients to reduce 
their counterparty risk by spreading the 
placement of their (re)insurance across  
a number of carriers.
Amlin London leads 45% of its London 
market subscription business. The lead 
underwriter negotiates the price, determines 
coverage and is the primary point of contact 
for both placing broker and client. 
Product range
Amlin is a recognised leader in the 
reinsurance market. Our Reinsurance 
business unit accounts for 46% of business 
written by Amlin London. Catastrophe 
reinsurance is our largest class of business, 
accounting for approximately 60% of 
the Reinsurance portfolio. The portfolio 
is a global one with the US the largest 
geographical market. Coverage includes 
events such as US or European windstorm 
and US or Japanese earthquake. The 
majority of the portfolio is written on a treaty 
excess of loss basis.
The Property & Casualty business unit 
underwrites international insurance and 
some reinsurance business across a range 
of classes. Property insurance accounts  
for just over half of the portfolio and the 
US is the most important territory. Other 
classes include auto, casualty, and accident 
and health.

Amlin London continued
Amlin London’s Marine business 
encompasses a range of classes from 
energy, marine hull, cargo and liability to 
bloodstock, fi ne art and private yacht cover. 
The largest classes by premium are energy, 
cargo, yacht and war. The majority of 
business written is via lineslips and binding 
authorities, with 12.7% of business sourced 
directly by Amlin’s own agencies, particularly 
for yacht, bloodstock and cargo.
The Aviation business unit underwrites airline 
and general aviation insurance, covering 
areas such as airports and products liability 
as well as satellites.

Client service
The quality of our product offering and 
the high level of client service provided is 
demonstrated by the signifi cant percentage 
of renewal business maintained each year 
and the continuity of our client relationships. 
Strong fi nancial ratings have always been 
important to our clients, particularly in the 
area of reinsurance. The fi nancial crisis of the 
past two years brought this into even sharper 
focus, with a number of major participants 
in insurance markets experiencing fi nancial 
diffi culty. Amlin’s position as a preferred 
market in Lloyd’s is enhanced by its security 
rating from AM Best, which at A+ is stronger 
than that for Lloyd’s as a whole at A. 
AM Best is the most relevant rating agency 
for US business which forms a signifi cant 
part of Amlin London’s portfolio.
Amlin is committed to fair, effi cient and 
timely claims management and during 2009 
we further improved our claims service 
capability. As Amlin does not control the 
London market claims service from start 
to fi nish, relying on brokers and shared 
market services for some processes, we 
view the speed of our claims turnaround 
as a key measure of our claims service. 
Our average claims turnaround time (from 
initial notifi cation to agreement with brokers) 
reduced to 2.5 days in 2009 from 2.9 days 
in 2008. 
During the year, Gracechurch independent 
consultants conducted a further survey of 
the attitudes of over 300 UK-based placing 
brokers towards the claims services offered 
by insurers in Lloyd’s and the wider London 
market. We were pleased that Amlin was 
ranked second overall having been ranked 
third overall in 2008, beating the market 
average on all service measure attributes. 
We brought the London claims team under 
common management in 2009. This has 
facilitated the extension to the marine 
business of the class-based claims handling 
approach already in place for most property 
and casualty classes. For example, Amlin 
now has a dedicated claims team for all 
energy claims whether these derive from 
marine, property or casualty policies. This 
approach allows optimum use of specialist 
technical expertise within the claims 
operation and ensures greater consistency 
of claims management. 
Business development
In 2009, we continued to build our 
underwriting teams, initiated a more focused 
marketing capability and acquired Crowe 
Livestock Underwriting. 
Andrew Wright, the energy leading class 
underwriter, succeeded Simon Beale 
as Head of Marine and we recruited an 
experienced marine hull underwriter to lead 
the marine hull team. We also recruited 
additional underwriting expertise into our 
property, casualty and accident and health 
classes and strengthened our catastrophe 
modelling team. 
Importantly, during 2009 we appointed 
a Head of Broker Relations and Business 
Development. After an initial research project 
to analyse business fl ows and to obtain 
feedback from producing brokers, a formal 
strategy for developing relationships with 
key brokers and major clients has been 
established. A programme of regular contact 
with Amlin London’s top 30 brokers is now 
in place and a number of specifi c growth 
opportunities have been identifi ed, as well as 
a more structured liaison with our key brokers. 
In November we acquired Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting Ltd, a Lloyd’s coverholder 
which provides specialist insurance to the 
livestock industry. This acquisition presents 
an opportunity for Amlin to diversify its 
well regarded bloodstock book through an 
acknowledged leader in the livestock market. 
We expect Crowe to deliver an estimated 
premium income of £11 million in 2010.
Trading environment and 
underwriting performance
The trading environment for Amlin London 
was again mixed in 2009, with an average 
rate increase of 4.7% for the year (2008: 
reduction of 7.7%). 
In 2009 Amlin London’s gross written 
premium increased by 24.1% over 2008 
to £855.7 million (2008: £689.7 million). 
Premium growth was driven by a stronger 
dollar, rate increases and the addition of new 
business within Reinsurance and Property 
and Casualty.
More than half of the year on year growth 
was generated within our Reinsurance 
business, which wrote £389.6 million in 2009 
(2008: £275.0 million). This was achieved 
whilst maintaining net catastrophe exposures

within risk tolerances by ceding business 
to S6106 which was set up in 2009. As we 
increase our risk appetite in the future we will 
be able to grow our net premiums by ceding 
less of this business.
The contribution from Property and Casualty 
increased to £204.0 million (2008: £168.6 
million), Marine accounted for £203.9 million 
(2008: £189.5 million) and Aviation £58.2 
million (2008: £56.6 million).
Margin potential for reinsurance business 
remained good, particularly for US 
catastrophe business, where average 
rate increases of 10.2% returned pricing 
towards peak levels evident in 2007. Upward 
pressure was also evident for international 
catastrophe pricing, but the increase was 
lower, averaging 4.5%.
Rates for property and casualty classes 
increased by an average of 3.1%. 
Competition in this area was stronger than 
expected and the necessary improvements 
in rates to return the market to a position that 
we would find supportive of strong growth 
have not materialised to date. Performance 
by sector is variable. For example, US 
property insurance achieved an average rate 
increase of 5.9%, while US casualty business 
saw a rate reduction of 1.8%, We continue 
to believe that pricing in the US commercial 
market is unsustainably low, although 
lower investment returns should encourage 
competitors to increase prices.
Rates for marine classes as a whole were 
up 5.0% for 2009. Offshore energy business 
experienced a significant uplift in rates, with 
an average increase of 22.3% in the year. 
However, in response to higher rates and 
stricter terms, clients have retained more 
risk. Hull and liability classes sustained 
favourable rate improvements of 7.0% and 
6.3% respectively, with modest increases  
in most other marine classes.
Aviation markets remained challenging with 
rates which were inadequate to compensate 
for the risk assumed. However, with a 
number of notable losses, to which we were 
not heavily exposed, pushing the airline 
insurance market into loss for the third year 
running, recent rate increases have been 
between 15% and 25%. Other aviation 
classes have begun to stabilise. 
Natural catastrophe activity was relatively 
low in the year, with total insured catastrophe 
losses estimated at $22 billion
1
. The largest 
insured event was the European winter storm 
Klaus, which affected Southern France in 
January, with an estimated total insured 
loss of $2.3 billion. The table below shows 
major catastrophe losses in the year. Amlin 
London’s estimated exposure is modest. 
Amlin London’s largest catastrophe event for 
the period was winter storm Klaus for which 
we conservatively estimate claims of  
$9.7 million.
Amlin London’s combined ratio, excluding 
non-monetary exchange differences, 
improved to 68% from 81% in 2008. The 
claims ratio was 27% compared to 49% last 
year, reflecting the low level of catastrophe 
losses in 2009 and additional prior period 
reserve releases totalling £95.1 million (2008: 
£58.6 million).
The expense ratio was 41% compared to 32% 
in 2008. The majority of the difference was 
due to an adverse swing in foreign exchange.

Over the years, Amlin has established an excellent reputation for 
modelling its catastrophe exposures and we have continued our 
investment in this area during 2009. 
We use modelling to achieve four aims: to help price individual 
risks; to manage and balance our portfolio of risks; to help ensure 
that our risk remains inside the Group’s risk appetite, and, to help 
quantify our loss after an event. We license the main proprietary 
catastrophe models and strive to leverage their capabilities 
where they are most valuable: in differentiating risks at the point 
of underwriting; maintaining balance and diversifi cation in our 
portfolio, and monitoring our exposures against our set risk 
tolerances. Our philosophy remains to use catastrophe models 
as useful tools, but not become over-reliant on them. 
For this purpose, we complement our probabilistic approach with 
scenario-based assessments of our exposures, in order to mitigate 
some of the inherent uncertainty in catastrophe models. During 2009, 
we have continued to develop in-house realistic disaster scenarios to 
monitor our risks, in addition to those prescribed by Lloyd’s.
We are also collaborating with broking fi rms and research facilities 
to improve our understanding of the strengths and limitations of 
catastrophe models. In particular, we have launched an initiative to 
independently assess the relative credibility of the various models.
In 2009, our efforts have resulted in signifi cant enhancements 
in our underwriters’ capabilities to drill down into the details of 
modelling results and to visualise their exposures on a map, 
for individual accounts as well as for their portfolio. 
We have also considerably improved the quality of our exposure 
data for binders and facilities, a section of our business where 
underwriting authority is delegated to carefully selected managing 
agents and for which achieving good data quality is notoriously 
challenging.
Improved quality of data assists in providing more accurate 
modelling of the Group’s portfolio exposure in areas at high risk 
of wind, earthquake, fl ood or fi re and a combination of factors. 
This feeds into our Dynamic Financial Analysis model, developed 
over many years which, in addition to modelling event outcomes, 
takes account of the interdependence between different classes 
within the portfolio. The illustration above clearly demonstrates 
the benefi ts of our business diversity in the lower aggregate 
volatility of the whole portfolio. This lower volatility leads to a 
lower capital requirement and more effi cient use of capital.
We anticipate that continuing improvements to our portfolio 
modelling capability will prove invaluable as the Group expands. 
We were able to fully model the AFU risk portfolio within three 
months of the acquisition, and we have already reviewed the ACI 
book in the context of Amlin’s existing business. Our portfolio 
modelling development is also standing us in good stead as we 
prepare for model submission under Solvency II (see page 54).

When a client buys an insurance policy, they are buying a promise 
to pay. Prompt payment of valid claims is the most important 
aspect of our service and in many cases, as in this example, 
our client knowledge and specialist expertise are as vital to the 
claims process as they are to underwriting the risk.
During 2009, a Japanese built bulk carrier, part of a fl eet owned by 
a shipowner and client of Amlin since 1998, loaded a 25,000 metric 
tonne cargo of sugar in South America and sailed for India. Five 
days into the voyage, the crew noticed that sea water was leaking 
into one of the cargo holds through cracks which had appeared in 
the vessel’s side shell plating. 
The crew managed to rig a pump to manage the leak, but 
heavy weather later in the voyage caused the cracks to worsen 
signifi cantly and eventually, with the weather deteriorating further, 
the crew were ordered to abandon ship. All were rescued but the 
vessel capsized and sank. 
This was a signifi cant loss for the client as it concerned one of 
the largest and most valuable carriers in their fl eet. The Amlin 
underwriter and hull claims adjuster, together with the brokers, 
immediately visited the client, with the aim of quickly investigating 
and resolving the claim. We were able to reassure the client that 
all parties plus our lawyers would work closely to reach a speedy 
resolution of the claim. 
It was soon established that the crew were highly competent and 
the chief engineer had been ingenious in rigging up the temporary 
pump. However, interviews with the crew failed to establish why 
the plating failed, or why the vessel sank when it was designed 
to remain afl oat with only one hold fl ooded. 
In law, the underwriter could have imposed onerous demands 
on the ship-owner to prove the cause of the plating and sinking 
mechanism failures. However, Amlin’s longstanding relationship 
with this client and knowledge of its operational record and 
maintenance procedures meant that, despite the lack of a defi nitive 
reason for the total loss, the underwriter was satisfi ed that the 
vessel was seaworthy. The claim was validated and paid.
Valuing the relationship
Focus on claims service
“ Total Loss cases are often challenging to deal with due to the lack of 
physical evidence. From the outset Amlin worked closely with owners 
and brokers to ensure the necessary investigations were conducted 
appropriately and sensitively. Having gathered the necessary 
information and satisﬁ ed themselves the loss was recoverable, 
Amlin acted swiftly to ensure settlement funds were paid to the 
assured without delay.”

Investing for growth
The UK commercial market began to stabilise in 
2009 and we expect an upturn in the market in 
2010. We are well placed to take advantage of the 
improved rating environment, having adopted a 
disciplined approach during challenging markets 
and made signiﬁ cant investment in our business.
2009 highlights
•  Gross written premium of £190.9 million, an increase of 25% on prior year, driven 
by growth in fl eet motor business.
• Underlying margins across the market remain thin but improvements seen in 
fl eet motor.
• Recruitment of a leading property underwriting team.
• Strategic investments made in 2008 beginning to generate return. 
• Continued positioning of the business for growth through investments in resource 
and acquisitions.
2010 priorities
•  Grow core business lines as market conditions improve.
• Further develop property underwriting book. 
• Complete the integration of Lockton’s Insolvency Risk Services business.
• Develop client service performance metrics and analysis.
• Implementation of the liability product on Genus underwriting system.
Business focus
• Amlin UK writes commercial motor, liability and property business in the UK 
domestic market. 
• Specialist underwriting expertise, a willingness to consider unusual risks and 
the ability to create and price non-conventional programmes support our highly 
selective and fl exible underwriting approach.
• Business is underwritten through a variety of distribution channels supporting both 
retail and wholesale brokers. Our ability to adapt our products and services to meet 
the differing needs of a wide range of intermediaries is a key differentiator from our 
larger competitors.

Amlin UK underwrites commercial 
insurance business in the UK domestic 
market. We are a leader in ﬂeet motor 
business and have an established position 
in a full range of other commercial classes.
The business is separated into five units 
according to the insurance classes written. 
The division is led by Brian Carpenter, 
supported by underwriting and operational 
management. The management team is 
stable and has significant experience in its 
respective markets.
The division employs 284 people. Headcount 
is high relative to other divisions focused 
on specialty business due to the high 
volume, relatively low premium nature of UK 
commercial business. 
Market overview
The UK insurance market is one of the 
largest in the world, ranked third by premium 
in 2008
1
. It is a mature and sophisticated 
market with a wide range of distribution, 
products and carriers. T otal net premium 
for UK non-life insurance in 2008 was 
£59.1 billion
1
, with the top ten general 
insurance groups, including companies 
such as RSA, Aviva and Axa, accounting 
for 70% of the non-life business written
2
. 
Distribution for commercial insurance in the 
UK market is primarily through brokers. The 
majority of Amlin UK’s business is sourced 
through Lloyd’s brokers and regional brokers. 
An important trend in the market in recent 
years has been rapid consolidation among 
insurance brokers, with some of the larger 
broker networks growing substantially 
through acquisitions. Broker consolidation 
within the market continued during 2009, 
although the impact of the credit crunch 
and economic slowdown on the largest 
consolidators reduced their appetite and 
ability to make further acquisitions. 
While competing with many traditional 
insurers, Amlin UK is a Lloyd’s business and 
is one of Lloyd’s leading UK commercial fleet 
motor underwriters.
Product range
Amlin UK’s portfolio consists of commercial 
motor, liability and property business, with 
a small amount of personal lines business, 
mainly in selected niche areas such as high 
net worth property. Amlin UK generally writes 
100% of each business risk.
We focus on using the experience and 
technical expertise of our underwriters to 
target non-standard and potentially higher 
margin business such as large or complex 
risks. We work closely with brokers to create 
niche products which address specific 
industry or client needs across a wide 
range of business types and sectors. Our 
willingness to consider unusual risks and our 
ability to create and price non-conventional 
programmes give us an advantage against 
larger competitors with less flexibility. 
We also offer various insurance package 
products which combine motor, property or 
liability coverage according to the particular 
needs of the client.
Under the Summit at Lloyd’s brand we 
underwrite a wide range of commercial 
motor fleet classes, including coach, 
haulage, commercial vehicle and company 
executive fleets.

Employers’ liability insurance protects 
employers against accident or injury to 
employees. Public liability insurance covers 
accident or injury occurring to clients, 
customers or other third parties as a result 
of contact with the insured’s personnel, 
property or products.
Professional indemnity policies cover 
liabilities that may arise from services 
provided by the assured, for example as 
a result of negligence or error, which may 
lead to financial or physical loss. This 
includes services from architects, surveyors, 
advertising firms and medical professionals. 
A small financial institutions account is 
also written covering fidelity, professional 
indemnity and directors’ and officers’ liability 
for companies providing financial services. 
However, we do not underwrite institutions 
with material US exposures.
UK property covers buildings and contents 
against perils such as fire, theft and flood. 
Client service
Our commitment to high quality client service 
is illustrated in the continuity of our broker 
relationships and business retention ratios,

We recognise the importance of providing 
high quality claims management and we 
have our own in house claims and legal 
team, and specialist teams dealing with 
injury claims. This combination of a high 
standard of claims service and specialist 
expertise is a valuable part of Amlin UK’s 
business proposition. This is evidenced 
by the fact that in 2009 we gained several 
major new employers’ liability accounts 
on the strength of our service and claims 
capabilities in addition to competitive pricing. 
We continued to invest in our claims and 
customer service capabilities during the year. 
Amlin UK also benefits from Amlin’s strong 
Insurance Financial Strength ratings which 
support client confidence in our ability to 
manage the risks and support their claims.
Business development
During 2009, we maintained a disciplined 
underwriting approach amid a challenging 
rating environment for much of the portfolio. 
However, we also continued to position the 
business for growth as and when market 
conditions become more favourable. 
Opportunities to expand the fleet motor 
account became more prevalent as pricing 
maintained its upward trend through the 
year and we began to benefit from the 
strategic investments made in independent 
brokers Miles Smith and TL Dallas during 
2008. For example, Amlin benefited from the 
transfer of a substantial fleet motor portfolio 
when a major competitor withdrew from its 
Miles Smith facility. We also achieved the 
successful conversion of the majority of the 
renewal rights to the general commercial 
motor fleet insurance portfolio acquired 
from HCC in August 2008. Other initiatives 
included new facilities to enable the easy 
placement of small higher margin accounts 
and new niche products, such as Amlin’s 
‘Route 2’ coach facility.
With further growth anticipated in fleet motor 
as market conditions improve, we invested 
in additional claims resource and opened a 
motor claims unit in Norwich. 
In May we recruited a team of five 
underwriters with significant expertise in UK 
commercial property owners’ business. The 
team has been merged with Amlin’s existing 
property teams in Chelmsford and Norwich. 
While current market conditions in the 
property sector remain competitive, the team 
is well positioned to expand with a future 
improvement in the trading environment. 
A key factor for further developing Amlin 
UK’s market penetration, particularly in the 
UK property market, is our profile among 
regional and smaller brokers and their 
clients. While Amlin is well known to the 
major Lloyd’s brokers operating in the UK 
commercial property market, the Amlin 
brand is less established amongst UK 
regional brokers and their clients. T o this 
end we continued to invest in our marketing 
capability and strengthened our broker base, 
building new relationships with a number 
of specialist brokers, as well as further 
developing relationships with regional and 
national brokers. Amlin’s new European 
rugby sponsorship programme will also 
enhance Amlin UK’s profile in the UK market.
We continue to look for additional products 
that can attract new business and offer 
opportunities for cross selling to existing 
clients. For example, in January 2010 we

completed the acquisition of Lockton’s 
Insolvency Risk Services business. This is 
a sector experiencing rapid growth in the 
current economic climate and the acquisition 
of a book of business already substantially 
underwritten by Amlin, together with a 
specialist team of some 40 people, will 
further enhance our product offering in this 
area. The business will now trade as AUA 
Insolvency Risk Services Ltd.
Another strategic priority was the 
implementation of the Genus underwriting 
system. The first phase was rolled out in 
2009 for fleet motor business and further 
development of the system for liability 
classes was carried out in preparation 
for implementation in early 2010. Genus 
streamlines administrative processes as well 
as delivering better management information 
across all stages of the insurance transaction 
from quote to final policy, which will facilitate 
cross-selling and overall marketing. 
Trading environment and 
underwriting performance
After a sustained period of difficult market 
conditions, parts of the UK commercial 
market began to show signs of stabilising in 
2009. Current rating trends are illustrated in 
the table below. 
Amlin UK generated gross written premium 
of £190.9 million in 2009, an increase of 
25% on the prior year (2008: £152.8 million). 
Average renewal rate increases were 2.0%. 
Fleet motor business contributed £82.8 
million to gross written premium (2008: £60.1 
million). This includes £7.0 million of premium 
generated from the renewal rights to the 
commercial motor account of HCC. 
As anticipated, the fleet motor market 
maintained the gradual improvement first 
seen in the latter part of 2008, with an 
upward trend in pricing throughout 2009 
giving an overall rate increase for the year 
of 4.9%. Importantly, there was a continued 
increase in the number of quotations and in 
the overall conversion ratio.
Deteriorating underwriting results for a 
number of competitors led to an easing 
in competition in the fleet market and 
prompted withdrawals from the sector. 
For example, in August 2009, HSBC, a 
substantial competitor in the market, ceased 
underwriting its fleet motor account. Such 
developments have created opportunities 
for Amlin to gain market share at acceptable 
margins. We expect this trend to continue  
in 2010. 
Product liability rates on Amlin’s book also 
increased by 3.2%, reversing the downward 
trend seen in 2008.
Elsewhere, the UK commercial market 
remained generally competitive, reflecting 
ample capacity and continued competition 
for market share among the larger insurers. 
Property rates on Amlin’s portfolio declined 
by 2.1% while employers’ liability and 
professional indemnity rates fell by 1.3% 
and 0.5% respectively. However, in all these 
classes this represented an improvement 
on the prior year and signs now exist that 
the appetite of major insurers for new 
and renewal business is becoming more 
selective, particularly on higher risk and 
poorly performing business. 
Although typically an economic downturn 
can cause an increase in claims frequency, 
particularly in classes such as motor, 
property and liability, the expected trends 
have not yet emerged. However, we continue 
to anticipate an upward trend in recession-
related claims across the market during 2010 
and we are actively monitoring claims activity 
for signs of increased fraud. 
The combined ratio of 81% is a good result 
given the continued tough trading conditions 
(2008: 79%). The claims ratio was 53% 
(2008: 48%), with releases from reserves 
amounting to £38.7 million (2008: £34.4 
million). We have reviewed our reserving 
approach to UK commercial claims, where 
it has become evident that our claims case 
reserves, in aggregate, have been more 
robust than previously estimated and a 
trend of steady improvement has been 
established. As such, we have adjusted our 
approach to fleet motor and liability classes, 
which has generated a release of £16.0 
million. The expense ratio of 28% (2008: 
31%) reflects the spread of core overheads 
across a greater premium base.

Anglo French Underwriters (AFU) is 
Lloyd’s largest approved coverholder in 
France, writing a diverse book of SME 
specialty business, including property, 
cargo, professional liability and specie 
insurance through a network of more 
than 1,350 retail brokers.
AFU is led by François Martinache and 
Alexandre Martinache (they are unrelated) 
and focuses on six business classes as 
shown in the adjacent chart. Syndicate 
2001 underwrote 77% of AFU’s business 
in 2009, up from 7% prior to its acquisition 
by Amlin in November 2008. In 2010 
the Syndicate share is expected to 
increase further.
Successful integration within the Amlin 
Group was a priority for the business during 
2009 and this has progressed well across 
business strategy, underwriting, risk, 
finance and human resources. 
Market overview
France is the fifth largest non-life insurance 
market in the world and third largest in 
Europe, with direct premium volume of 
€44.8 billion in 2008, an increase of 2.5% 
over 2007
1
. The ten largest insurers by 
premium account for approximately 79%  
of the market, which is dominated by 
domestic French companies and mutuals. 
The percentage of non-life premiums written 
by foreign companies is around 25%
1
. 
AFU’s principal competitors include the 
major European multinationals such as 
Axa, Allianz and Generali as well as the 
leading French domestic insurers such 
as Groupama
1
.
The French market is competitive and 
well supplied with capacity but it is also 
a relatively stable market due to a strong 
emphasis on relationships, which makes 
it difficult for new entrants to break in. 
Distribution is well developed with brokers 
and agents producing the majority of 
commercial business written. 
Product range
AFU focuses on the French SME market, 
targeting particular market sectors where 
its specialist underwriting and pricing skills 
have the potential to generate sustainable 
underwriting profits. Recently, AFU has 
started to expand into middle market 
commercial business, particularly in 
property insurance.
Property SME insurance is AFU’s largest 
class of business, specialising in complex 
and hazardous risks, for example coverage 
for the paper recycling, plastics, biomedical 
and food storage industries.
AFU has a focus on the leisure industry 
with comprehensive property cover 
provided in niche areas such as night 
clubs, bowling alleys and camp sites.
AFU offers both general cargo coverage 
and specialist transport cover from supply 
to delivery, covering transit by air, land or 
water which can include contractual and 
professional liability cover.
Other specialist lines include jewellers’ 
coverage for stock held on the premises or 
at exhibitions and fine art cover for property 
held at art galleries, as well as high value 
property coverage for private individuals.
AFU also offers professional liability cover 
to insurance intermediaries, financial 
advisors and estate agents. General 
liability coverage is offered either as 
complementary cover to other lines 
of business or on a standalone basis.
Client service
AFU distributes its products through 
an extensive network of brokers, spread 
across France. AFU’s focus on delivering a 
personal service, tailored to the demands of 
the SME market, has enabled it to develop 
strong and long-standing relationships 
with many medium and smaller sized 
independent retail brokers. 
In 2009, the focus was on developing 
relationships with some 400 targeted local

Anglo French Underwriters continued
brokers. As part of this strategy, in May 
2009, a new AFU office was opened in 
Lyon. This new location gives AFU closer 
access to the greatest concentration of 
industry and commerce in France outside 
Paris and will provide a platform for further 
development of AFU’s broker distribution 
in the region.
AFU benefits from Amlin’s strong Financial 
Strength Ratings which support client 
confidence in our ability to manage 
their risks and support their claims.
Client retention for 2009 remained high 
at 84%. This is particularly pleasing in a 
challenging year for the business following 
its acquisition and reflects AFU’s success 
in maintaining high service levels during the 
integration process with the Amlin Group. 
Business development
The acquisition by Amlin enhanced  
AFU’s profile with brokers, leading to  
greater success in winning new business 
during the year.
Amlin’s sponsorship of European rugby 
is of particular value in France given the 
national interest in the sport and this is 
already contributing to raising Amlin’s 
profile with AFU’s existing and target 
brokers and clients. 
Looking forward, we plan to expand AFU’s 
operations and broaden its offering with 
Amlin products. For example, products 
currently being developed for launch 
through AFU include a yacht cover based 
on Amlin’s small yacht and pleasure 
craft business. We also anticipate that 
the acquisition of Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting will provide opportunities 
to develop our livestock product offering. 
The merger of ACI France into AFU during 
2010 will also create further opportunities 
for new business development.
Trading environment and 
underwriting performance
The impact of the global financial crisis 
and economic recession on the French 
market was evident in a reduced overall 
demand for commercial insurance, together 
with lower premium volume in classes 
of business where premium is related 
to client turnover. 
The market remains highly competitive 
in many areas with new entrants further 
increasing competition for new business. 
However, with commercial insurance 
pricing already at a cyclical low, we do not 
anticipate further significant deterioration 
in the rating environment in 2010. 
In its first full year as part of the Group, 
AFU contributed €31.4 million to gross 
written premium. The major contribution 
came from property SME which generated 
premium of €17.8 million in the year.
Given challenging market conditions, 
the combined ratio of 87% is a good result. 
The claims ratio is 50%, reflecting two large 
net losses for summer fire damage to 
French properties, each around €2 million, 
and a net exposure (for Syndicate 2001) 
to winter storm Klaus of €0.9 million. 
The expense ratio was 37%, below 
that of the Syndicate as a whole. www.amlin.com

• Compliance with BMA equivalent of Solvency II regulations.
Business focus
• Amlin Bermuda replicates the strengths of Amlin London’s underwriting approach, 
broker relationships and client service. 
• Amlin Bermuda offers its capacity only to London treaty reinsurance brokers. 
This is a key differentiator in the Bermudian market. 
• While building a strong local presence utilising local expertise, Amlin Bermuda 
continues to leverage the experience and relationships, as well as the technical 
capabilities, of the Amlin Group.
• Having established a strong core business in property catastrophe excess of loss 
reinsurance, the focus is now on broadening the portfolio.

Amlin Bermuda continued
Amlin Bermuda operates in the 
Bermudian reinsurance market, writing 
predominantly property reinsurance.  
At 31 December 2009 the business was 
capitalised at US$1.6 billion.
Amlin Bermuda obtains business from  
three distinct sources:
• Direct reinsurance business accessed 
from London brokers but written in 
Bermuda by an experienced 
underwriting team;
• Whole account quota share of  
Syndicate 2001; and
• Variable quota shares of  
Syndicate 2001.
While Amlin Bermuda underwrites risks 
covering most areas of the world, in 2009 
approximately 67% (2008: 63%) of direct 
business generated was domiciled in the 
US. Other key geographies include the UK, 
Japan, Europe and Australia.
Amlin Bermuda is led by its own executive 
team and the employee base consists of 
a combination of former Amlin London 
professionals along with Bermudian and 
non-Bermudian employees. The business 
has been developed with a strong core of 
local staff as we believe this is integral to 
the long-term success of the business. In 
2009 we continued to place an emphasis 
on attracting high calibre local recruits. 
Market overview 
The Bermuda market has grown since  
its establishment in the 1980s to be a 
mature and substantial insurance and 
reinsurance market.
The growth of Bermuda as a major 
reinsurance centre has been underpinned 
by a favourable tax regime but it also 
benefits from a mature regulatory 
environment, established infrastructure and 
concentration of insurance capacity. The 
rate of corporate tax is currently set at zero. 
Amlin Bermuda was created in 2005 with 
the aim of building a geographically-spread, 
predominantly property, catastrophe risk 
excess and proportional account. To gain 
access to this business and to provide 
the level of security and ratings required 
by the marketplace, Amlin Bermuda was 
established with initial capital of $1.0 billion. 
The regulatory environment falls under the 
control of the Bermuda Monetary Authority 
(BMA). As a registered Class IV reinsurance 
company, Amlin Bermuda can write 
reinsurance and international insurance 
and is regulated by the BMA’s risk-based 
supervisory process. Amlin Bermuda’s 
participation in the Group’s Solvency II 
initiatives should facilitate compliance with 
BMA equivalent requirements as they are 
further developed.
Product range
Catastrophe reinsurance continues to 
account for the largest part of Amlin 
Bermuda’s portfolio. Other forms of 
reinsurance, such as proportional and risk 
excess of loss, are written in both the US 
and international markets, together with 
specialty lines. 
Like Amlin London’s underwriting 
approach, the US catastrophe book is 
focused on cedants with regional rather 
than nationwide exposures, writing small 
commercial and homeowners business. 
This segment of the market is attractive 
because exposures are more reliably 
modelled and it provides geographical 
diversity within the catastrophe book. The 
direct catastrophe account is controlled by 
setting aggregate zonal disaster scenario 
limits. For 2009 these were a maximum of 
$300 million per event in any one zone and 
$320 million per event impacting more than 
one zone.

Business development
We have strengthened the underwriting 
team with two key appointments and 
reinforced the management team with the 
appointment of a Finance Director whose 
role had previously been combined with 
that of Managing Director.
In addition to further selective expansion 
in reinsurance classes, a strategic priority 
in 2009 was to evaluate the potential for 
developing a direct and facultative property 
insurance book. However, an unfavourable 
pricing environment combined with 
regulatory hurdles in obtaining the required 
licences prevented this during the year. 
Given the likelihood of continued regulatory 
constraints, it is unlikely that a property 
insurance account will be developed in 
the near future. However, developing a 
facultative property reinsurance portfolio, if 
pricing becomes more attractive, remains a 
part of the strategy for 2010.
The whole account quota share reinsurance 
of Syndicate 2001 continues to provide 
important balance to the overall Bermudian 
account. In 2009, it was increased to 17.5% 
from 12.5%. In addition, other reinsurance 
facilities exist between Amlin Bermuda and 
Syndicate 2001 to enable it to write larger 
lines on selected individual risks and 
specific portfolios in marine, aviation, 
property and other specialist classes. 
Continued growth, the absence of significant 
catastrophe activity and changes in UK tax 
legislation enabled Amlin Bermuda to pay 
its first dividend of $200.0 million in 
October 2009. A further dividend of $168.8 
million was paid in February 2010.
Trading environment and 
underwriting performance
At the start of 2009 Amlin Bermuda 
benefited from improving rates following 
Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008. Overall 
the market was more stable than in 2008, 
although competitive pressures began to 
increase in the second half of 2009 given 
the rebound in investment markets and 
subsequent easing of pressure on many 
reinsurer balance sheets, combined with 
an exceptionally low incidence of insured 
catastrophe losses. Competition for 
regional US and international catastrophe 
business was evident as these segments 
were viewed as offering attractive margins 
and valuable diversification.
In response to the 2008 hurricanes, US 
catastrophe rates increased by 11.0%.  
On international catastrophe business, rate 
increases varied by region and averaged 
3.6%. This was below predicted levels due 
to continued overcapacity for this class of 
business. As expected, we experienced 
improved pricing on international risk 
excess of loss business with average rate 
increases of 4.3%. However, the absence 
of sizeable market risk losses in the US 
resulted in an average decline in rates of 
1.7% for this class. On our proportional 
reinsurance account we achieved overall 
rate increases of nearly 2.9%.

Amlin Bermuda wrote gross premium of 
$628.3 million in 2009, an increase of 14.3% 
on 2008 (2008: $549.5 million). The direct 
amount totalled $381.6 million, an increase 
of 8.0% on 2008 (2008: $353.3 million). The 
growth in direct business was helped by 
healthy retention rates, new business and 
rate increases averaging 5.1% in 2009 (2008: 
rate reductions of 6.6%). 
Catastrophe activity in 2009 was below 
long-term averages, as shown on page 29. 
The largest catastrophe loss events for the 
period were the L’Aquila earthquake and 
the European winter storm Klaus for which 
Amlin Bermuda is conservatively estimated 
to have incurred claims of $10.8 million and 
$7.2 million respectively. 
In the absence of any major insured 
catastrophe events and with good rating 
levels in core lines, results were exceptional 
and Amlin Bermuda achieved a combined 
ratio of 56% (2008: 83%). The claims ratio 
of 37% (2008: 68%) benefited from reserve 
releases of $37.6 million (2008: $40.1 
million). The expense ratio was 19% (2008: 
15%). Expense ratios in Bermuda are low 
relative to London operations due to higher 
operational gearing. Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Amlin Corporate Insurance (ACI) 
is a leading provider of corporate 
property and casualty insurance in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. Capitalised at 
€317 million, it operates as a separate 
division of the Amlin Group.
ACI was acquired by Amlin from the Dutch 
State on 22 July 2009. Prior to nationalisation 
by the Dutch State in October 2008, ACI 
was part of the Fortis Group, created by 
the merger of Fortis Industrial and Amev-
Interlloyd in 1999. 
ACI is led by Patrick Coene supported by 
his executive team. It has 371 employees. 
Historically the business has been managed 
along geographical lines, with different 
management in the Netherlands and 
Belgium. This is now evolving to a more 
product-focused management structure 
across the Benelux region.
Market overview
The Benelux insurance markets are mature 
markets with a high degree of broker 
penetration. The Netherlands and Belgium 
are the 14th and 16th largest markets in the 
world in terms of non-life premium income 
with 2008 non-life premiums of €10.7 
billion
1
 and €9.8 billion respectively
2.
 
The Dutch corporate insurance market 
is divided into the co-insurance (Beurs) 
market and the provincial market. ACI 
operates mainly in the co-insurance 
market, which is focused on industrial and 
commercial risks and accounts for much of 
the premium volume in ACI’s Dutch marine, 
property and liability lines. Distribution in 
this segment of the market is via brokers, 
who issue policies, collect premium and 
handle claims on behalf of insurers.
The Belgian commercial insurance market 
also relies on brokers for distribution, but 
functions such as claims handling are not 
often delegated to brokers or agents. 
The Benelux market includes the important 
regional marine insurance centres of 
Rotterdam and Antwerp. In both the 
Netherlands and Belgium, ACI is the largest 
marine underwriter by premium
3
.
ACI’s competitors in the Benelux markets 
include international insurers such as 
Allianz, Axa, HDI/Gerling, ACE and Zurich 
as well as a number of leading local 
insurers such as Delta Lloyd, ASR and  
AG Insurance.
Product range
ACI is the market leader in marine business 
in the region, with an estimated share 
of written premium of over 40% in the 
Netherlands and 30% in Belgium
3
. This 
reflects ACI’s long-standing position in 
the market and its recognised expertise in 
marine classes, as well as its substantial 
marine capacity. 
ACI’s Dutch marine account is well 
diversified with cargo as the largest class at 
approximately 40%, followed by ocean hull 
at 27% and builders’ risk at 17%. ACI has 
a market leading position in cargo liability. 
The Dutch hull account is focused on 
specialised risks such as dredging, lifting 
and salvage.
In Belgium cargo cover represents 
approximately 84% of marine premium, 
reflecting ACI’s market leading expertise in 
this area. Other classes include inland and 
ocean hull.
A long established insurer of the Belgian 
industrial sector, ACI has a strong position 
in the Belgian property insurance market 
with a market share of approximately 16%

In the Netherlands, ACI is a major property

buildings and municipalities. ACI’s product 
offering includes cover for fire, business 
interruption, machinery breakdown and 
construction all risk (‘CAR’). 
ACI has a market share of approximately 
20%

 in the Dutch co-insurance liability and 
professional indemnity market. Coverage 
in professional liability includes notaries, 
accountants and lawyers.
ACI also holds a key position in the Belgian 
commercial liability market and is the 
leading underwriter of medical liability 
cover, with an estimated overall share of 
the liability market of approximately 10%
1
.
ACI’s Dutch motor fleet account is focused 
on lease and rental business in the non-
Beurs market, written direct and through 
agencies. In Belgium, ACI’s fleet business 
is predominantly cars at approximately 
65% of premium, with the remainder 
equally divided between vans and trucks.
ACI Belgium has a further business line 
providing specialist services including 
fronting for the captive reinsurance 
companies of large clients, typically 
major industrial businesses. As well as 
underwriting a small portion of the risk, 
ACI provides administrative and start-up 
services on a fee basis. 
In 2008 ACI established a French office 
in Paris to target French commercial lines 
business. This operation will be merged with 
Anglo French Underwriters during 2010.
Client service
ACI is recognised in the market for its 
high level of technical expertise and 
solution oriented approach. We offer a 
comprehensive service to clients which 
includes risk prevention advice as well as 
structuring appropriate insurance cover. 
ACI benefits from long-standing 
relationships with the major international 
brokers operating in the Benelux region as 
well as with a broad range of local brokers 
and agents. We are focused on actively 
managing our broker relationships through 
regular meetings and other initiatives. This 
was particularly important during the period 
of uncertainty prior to ACI’s acquisition by 
Amlin, when continuous communication 
with brokers and clients was essential.  
As demonstrated by the high level of client 
retention throughout the process, the close 
and constructive relationships we have built 
with brokers and agents form a valuable 
aspect of ACI’s competitive strength in the 
Benelux market.

Business development
The principal focus for ACI following 
its acquisition has been managing the 
separation from the Fortis Group and 
the integration with Amlin, together 
with addressing known issues in parts 
of the marine underwriting portfolio.
A priority has been on maintaining 
standards of client service, which is 
reflected in the high level of client retention 
during 2009. The acquisition was well 
received by ACI’s brokers and clients 
and very little business was lost, with the 
exception of approximately €3.8 million 
of Fortis-linked premium. An indication of 
the market’s positive reaction to Amlin’s 
acquisition of ACI was the return to ACI of 
the Räets Marine agency account at the 
end of 2009, accounting for €60 million of 
gross written premium, which had been lost 
to a competitor following nationalisation. 
The disentanglement and integration 
process, together with progress made to 
date, is discussed in more detail in the 
‘Process and change management’ section 
of this Report on page 50.
As highlighted at the time of the 
acquisition, part of ACI’s marine portfolio 
had recently been generating poor results 
following rapid growth in 2007 and 2008. 
This had already been recognised by ACI 
and a re-underwriting programme has 
been instigated in late 2008. Following 
the acquisition, this programme has been 
supported by Amlin expertise and resource 
and is making good progress. 
ACI’s marine underwriting organisation 
was reviewed during the second half of 
the year and is now being restructured to 
reflect Amlin’s class underwriter structure 
and to facilitate the adoption of Amlin’s 
underwriting approach. New measures 
introduced include peer review of business 
underwritten and better collection and 
collation of pricing information.
Trading environment and 
underwriting performance
ACI’s key markets in both the Netherlands 
and Belgium were competitive during 2009. 
As well as the impact of lower economic 
activity on turnover-related policies such 
as liability, business interruption and 
CAR, the effect of the global economic 
recession was also evident in reduced 
overall demand for cover in these and 
other classes, which increased competition 
for the remaining business. The property 
market in both territories also remained 
competitive. 
Fleet motor demand was affected by 
sharp declines in new vehicle registrations 
during the year in both the Netherlands 
and Belgium. With capacity abundant in 
many commercial lines, market conditions 
remained soft. A relatively benign loss 
experience across the market during 
the year, with little direct impact from 
the recession on claims frequency, also 
contributed to the competitive environment. 
The marine market was also affected by 
lower economic activity, but rating trends 
were more varied. Capacity was stable but 
market conditions remained soft in most 
areas. Premium volume was significantly 
reduced by lower activity in builders’ risk

and general cargo, but recent entrants 
continued to compete for market share. 
In cargo liability, rates increased, but this 
was offset by sharp reductions in turnover. 
Ocean hull also presented a mixed picture 
with significant declines in insured values 
and freight activity offset by higher insured 
values for new vessels in the oil and gas 
industry and increased rates, so that 
market premium volume increased during 
the year. 
Inland hull was adversely affected by lower 
freight rates and hull values as a result of 
overcapacity among inland barges, but 
this market segment remained stable with 
no new entrants. The commodities market 
saw deteriorating losses, partly reflecting 
a recession-related increase in claims, but 
market conditions remained competitive.
ACI generated €708.4 million of gross 
written premium in 2009, a decrease 
of 7.1% relative to the prior year. The 
reduction reflects the impact of lower 
economic activity on premium volumes 
as well as the deliberate non-renewal 
of some marine business as part of the 
re-underwriting process. €236.1 million of 
gross written premium was written in the 
period since acquisition.
The contribution to Group underwriting 
profit in 2009 was £11.2 million. ACI 
delivered a combined ratio of 102% for 
the full year (2008: 102%) and 96% since 
acquisition. The result post acquisition is 
improved by 4.5% through the reversal 
of an unexpired risk provision held at 
acquisition for the loss making marine 
business. The claims ratio of 72% reflects 
a good underwriting performance for 
property and liability offset by poor marine 
performance. Reserve releases since 
acquisition totalled €19.0 million reflecting 
releases of risk margins through time. 
The company’s expense ratio is 27% 
for the full year (2008: 24%) and 24% 
in the period since acquisition. These 
ratios exclude costs relating to ACI 
disentanglement costs and investment 
management fees. Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Risk management
Managing risk for reward
2009 was a period of investment where we have 
seen our risk management capability grow. 
Preparations for Solvency II have given an 
added impetus to develop our risk management 
framework to the next level. 
2009 highlights
•  Specifi c risk appetite measures defi ned for each category of risk.
• New risk assessment process implemented.
• Divisional and Group risk reporting established.
• Market risk modelling capability signifi cantly enhanced.
2010 priorities
•  Pass all Solvency II pre-application processes.
• Fully establish the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment process including 
integration with business planning.
• Ensure ACI is fully integrated with Group risk management framework.
• Embed new risk assessment methodology across Group.
• Complete review of technical pricing and expected loss cost.
Business focus
• Amlin recognises that delivery of shareholder value comes from actively seeking 
and taking risk, while managing that risk within acceptable bounds. 
• We are focused on maintaining and developing a sustainable enterprise risk 
management process as an integral part of our business model, supporting 
business planning and capital management. 
• We endeavour to provide transparency to stakeholders on risk strategy, its 
implementation and review.

Our risk management policy clearly 
articulates the importance given to 
active management of risk within the 
Group. Risk is managed in accordance 
with Amlin’s risk policy and this, together 
with the Group’s overall appetite and 
tolerances, is set by the Amlin Board. 
Key risk tolerances are clear for each 
division and clear accountabilities exist 
for managing each type of risk within 
each division and Group function.
The Risk Assessment and Monitoring 
department (RAM) is responsible for the 
evaluation, analysis and monitoring of the 
major risks faced by the business and for 
reporting the status of risks to executive 
management, the Audit Committee and 
the Board.

During 2009 significant progress was 
made in developing risk governance 
arrangements to support a larger Group 
with multiple operating locations and the 
necessary preparations for Solvency II.
This involved:
• increasing the consistency of risk language 
and definitions across the Group;
• more clearly articulated and granular 
risk tolerances agreed by the Board 
for each category of risk; and
• improved reporting of critical risk relative 
to tolerances.  
The risk review process is built bottom 
up, with each business unit and support 
function completing a risk assessment 
which measures current and emerging 
risks. The objective of the process is to 
capture and quantify risk, taking account 
of the efficacy of controls in each business 
unit and function. Based on this process 
RAM produces an aggregated view of the 
risk for the group as a whole.
With the international expansion of the 
Group and our desire to develop our 
risk management in preparation for 
Solvency II we continued to invest in our 
risk expertise during the year. In August 
2009, a new Head of Group Risk was 
appointed, charged with developing the 
Group Risk function to embed Amlin’s new 
risk management framework across the 
business. Two further risk professionals 
were recruited in January 2010. We also 
continued to strengthen the Group Actuarial 
team, which plays a key role in modelling 
our underwriting and investment risk.
Risk appetite 
A key deliverable for 2009 was to develop 
granular definitions of risk appetite for each 
category of risk. Appetites for most key risks 
were reviewed and approved by the Board 
in May 2009. 
The appetites articulate the risk-bearing 
capacity of the Group, capturing the key 
‘dimensions’ of the Group’s risk appetite 
philosophy, a clear risk appetite statement 
for each risk category and prescribed 
tolerances for these categories. For 
example, for underwriting risk, Amlin’s 
appetite statement sets out our attitude 
to catastrophe risk business, and the 
tolerances specify financial limits 
based on both deterministic and 
stochastic modelling.
Group risk appetite is centred on four 
dimensions, providing the setting for the 
appetite and tolerances for individual 
risk areas. These are shown in the 
table overleaf.
The Board and the Audit Committee 
receive quarterly monitoring reports 
highlighting the status of each key risk 
relative to approved tolerances using 
both deterministic and stochastic 
modelling techniques. An agreed 
procedure for ‘risk alerts’ informs 
management if a risk is close to 
approaching its tolerance level. 
If at any stage a risk breaches the 
prescribed tolerance, the Board and 
the Audit Committee will be informed 
and appropriate remedial action will 
be taken to bring the risk within 
agreed levels.
For example, in January 2009 remedial 
action was taken to bring our Japanese 
earthquake risk back to within appetite, 
as the depreciation of the Yen relative to 
Sterling by 30% in the final three months 
of 2008 had materially increased the 
downside to our balance sheet from such 
an event. Most Japanese business renews 
on 1st April and we therefore purchased 
short term loss warranties to protect our 
position until the inwards risks could be 
adjusted at the next renewal.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Our key risk categories are closely aligned 
to those laid down by the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA) and Solvency 
II regulations. Our principal risks and 
mitigation strategies are summarised 
in the table on page 49.
The detailed risk disclosures for 
underwriting credit, market and liquidity 
risk are set out in detail starting on page 
132 of the financial statements.
Modelling and exposure 
management 
Amlin aims to deliver an attractive 
cross-cycle return on capital through the 
maintenance of a diversified portfolio of 
business combined with excellent capital 
management. Diversification of business 
across different business lines and 
geographies provides a strong balance 
of catastrophe versus non-catastrophe 
exposures and reduces the risk of any 
one event, or series of events, causing 
unacceptable impairment to the Group’s 
balance sheet. Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
48
Risk management continued
Our Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) 
model, which has been progressively 
developed since 2001, is able to provide 
a holistic view of the probability of 
outcomes, in terms of expected profi tability, 
for the Group and for each regulated entity. 
As our most extreme risks are signifi cant 
catastrophes, or a multitude of 
catastrophes in any one period, we are 
able to monitor the probability of 
impairment to the balance sheet relative 
to the risk tolerances set by the Amlin plc 
Board. This is a dynamic equation as the 
changes in our exposures and levels of 
inwards pricing affect the risk tolerances 
which are set specifi cally for catastrophe 
risk. For example, as expected margins 
increase, the Group is able to expand its 
catastrophe risk tolerances. Conversely, 
as profi t potential decreases, tolerances 
are reduced. 
This requires a good understanding of 
technical pricing and the expected loss 
cost of policies which are underwritten. 
During 2009 our actuaries initiated a 
thorough review of these areas. RAM 
regularly monitors the adequacy of pricing 
in each class of business as well as 
price movements so that expected risk 
tolerances and/or the acceptance of risk 
can be adjusted where appropriate.
Modelling of market risk
Over the last two years RAM has invested 
in better modelling of market risk, providing 
an independent check that the Group’s 
investments are being managed within 
the agreed risk appetite. Market risk 
tolerance is based on Value at Risk (VaR
1
) 
which changes according to the portfolio 
composition. RAM also monitors and 
reports risk as indicated by other measures 
which include drawdown, volatility and 
Sharp ratio.
1
  VaR is a statistical measure, which calculates the 
possible loss over a year, in normal market conditions. 
As VaR estimates are based on historical market data 
this should not be viewed as an absolute gauge of 
the level of risk to the investments

The change landscape
Our business growth 
strategy
The Amlin Group has developed signifi cantly over the last fi ve 
years. We have established a business of greater scale, evidenced 
by growth in gross and net assets over the fi ve year period. Our 
business is also increasingly diverse – both in the classes of 
business that we write and also in the multiple geographies within 
which we now operate. Growth has been organic, for example 
the start up of Amlin Bermuda in 2005, and also more recently 
through acquisition, for example the purchases of Anglo French 
Underwriters (2008) and Fortis Corporate Insurance (2009). We 
continue to search for suitable opportunities to develop and grow 
the Group in pursuit of our declared fi nancial return objectives.
Our markets and the 
regulatory environment
Our markets continuously re-price in response to the demand 
for insurance and the supply of available capital. We believe that 
our ability to adapt our approach to the markets in response to 
the rating cycle is a key differentiator in driving superior fi nancial 
performance, a feature we will preserve as we grow. 
Beyond regular market forces, insurance markets have been 
affected by turbulence in capital markets and will continue to 
see change in distribution channels, regional market hubs and 
the development of alternative risk transfer mechanisms such 
as in those capital markets. 
Signifi cant regulatory developments will also affect the non-life 
insurance industry: Solvency II will overhaul insurance regulation in 
the EU and have infl uence elsewhere; the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s IFRS 4 Phase 2 will change the accounting 
framework for insurance contracts. 
Our business operations have grown 
and diversiﬁ ed in recent years and 
further growth forms a signiﬁ cant 
part of the Group’s future strategy. 
We recognise that to sustain our 
market leading performance, we 
must maintain and build on our core 
strengths and values, whilst addressing 
the challenges of scale and diversity 
of markets and geography. 
The importance of consistent and 
well-managed processes, operational 
economies of scale and the avoidance of 
unnecessary duplication grows in line with 
scale and diversity. We aim to complement 
our disciplined approach to profi table 
underwriting with increasing focus on 
operational excellence as a response 
to the challenges of growth. Our change 
management capabilities will continue to 
develop as the means through which we 
deliver operational excellence across the 
businesses and functions of our enterprise.
Understanding the change 
landscape
Our context is managing growth and 
responding to the changing market and 
regulatory environment. As shown in the 
table top right, the business environment 
in which we operate is conditioned 
by a number of important internal 
and external factors.
Operational excellence
Operational excellence is our approach to 
managing the effectiveness of business 
processes and controlling the operational 
risks inherent in doing business. We focus 
on the business process as it crosses 
boundaries within our organisation 
and we look through the process from 
the perspective of the customer, the 
shareholder and the regulator.
Our approach to operational excellence 
is captured in the diagram on the right.

Process and change management continued
Change management
Our approach to change management is 
centred on change governance (deciding 
what we do) and change delivery (how we 
do it). Change management applies to the 
continuous improvement of our existing 
operations and the integration of acquired 
businesses.
Change governance takes a principled 
and structured approach to enabling 
the leadership of the Group and the 
divisions to set priorities for discretionary 
project expenditure, assess the return 
on investment and to determine the 
effectiveness of our change portfolio in 
helping to deliver our strategy. Our priority 
is to ensure that the capacity of the Group 
is deployed on our highest priorities, 
whether Group-wide or division-specific.
Change delivery involves a best practice, 
structured approach to the planning and 
execution of change programmes that 
ensures that the owners of our business 
processes, and all others involved in 
delivering change, whether internal 
providers or external partners and vendors, 
are clear what business change we seek 
to deliver. Our priority is to ensure that 
the outcomes intended are captured 
and preserved through the lifecycle of a 
programme and that the business process 
solutions we deliver are fit for purpose.
Development of change 
management capabilities
In 2009 we made significant investment 
in developing our change management 
capabilities in order to deliver operational 
excellence. The investment has been 
targeted not only to support existing 
operations and key change initiatives, 
but also to further prepare for a larger 
and more diverse business.
In May, Andrew Grant was recruited to the 
role of Group Operations Officer. Andrew 
brings extensive experience of integrating 
and transforming the operations of large 
financial services groups which will help 
ensure that, as the Amlin Group expands, 
we will do so efficiently and to the benefit 
of our shareholders and customers.
During the year, we have added to our 
strengths by recruiting experienced 
personnel into the new structure and have 
built up teams to address the integration of 
ACI and our preparations for Solvency II. 
T echnology
With the future growth strategy of 
the Group in mind, in April 2009 we 
commissioned a review of our information 
technology systems by a firm of external 
consultants. The purpose of the review was 
not only to assess the strength of Amlin’s 
information technology proposition in terms 
of the current business, but also to form 
a view on the scalability of the existing 
infrastructure to support anticipated growth 
plans. The conclusions of the review were 
positive. Not only did Amlin’s existing 
information technology infrastructure 
represent best practice in our markets, our 
strategy roadmap was judged well placed 
to support future plans.
Delivering change
The successful integration of AFU, which 
was acquired in November 2008, was a key 
objective in 2009. While there is further work 
to do as we bring together the new Amlin 
France division (our French managing general 
agent, built from AFU and ACI’s business in 
France) we are pleased with the progress that 
has been made in the year. Attention has also 
been given to further developing underwriting 
processes and controls. 
We continued to commit significant 
management priority and resources to 
our Solvency II programme, with the aim 
of ensuring that our own capital and risk 
management model will be accepted by 
the FSA, the Dutch National Bank and 
the Bermuda Monetary Authority for the 
purposes of setting our capital requirement 
in 2012, under the new EC Directive that 
will be introduced for the insurance industry 
at that time. Solvency II and our associated 
programme of work are described in detail 
on pages 54 to 55.
In 2010, in addition to the continued 
integration of ACI, two further acquisitions, 
Crowe Livestock Underwriting and Lockton’s 
Insolvency Risk Services business, will be 
integrated within the Group. 
Alongside key activities around 
the acquisition and integration of ACI, 
preparation for Solvency II, and technology 
and infrastructure developments, we have 
reviewed the role of Group Operations to 
deliver our vision for operational excellence. 
The objective of the review was not only to 
identify how we further develop operational 
excellence across the firm, but also to 
develop our ability to involve our 
management and staff in defining 
and driving activities that address 
the change landscape. 
Importantly, we have integrated existing 
technology and business process groups 
into Group Operations and re-organised 
around our key objectives. Group Operations 
now consists of the following teams:
Group Operations Management Ofﬁce 
whose role is directing the strategy 
for operational growth. This includes 
dedicated teams for Operational 
Governance, Planning and Reporting, 
Acquisition Integration Management and 
Communications.
Change Management whose role is leading 
and managing change across functions and 
businesses. This includes developing and 
implementing best practices and standards 
based around the Prince 2 methodology 
and aligned to Amlin’s organisation.
Business Process Management whose 
role is the identification and delivery 
of improvements to processes.
Operational Risk Management whose role 
is the development and embedding of the 
operational risk framework, the application 
of operational risk appetites to processes 
and the controlling of operational risk levels.
Design Authority whose role is quality 
assurance of business change, oversight 
of business technology solutions and 
confirmation with stakeholders of the match 
between requirements and solutions.
Technology Management and Services 
whose role is the management of the 
Group IT infrastructure, services and 
applications, and which supports Group 
functions and our business divisions with 
consistent and scalable solutions. www.amlin.com

Successfully integrating ACI
The purchase of Fortis Corporate Insurance 
(now Amlin Corporate Insurance or ACI) 
was completed on 22 July. At the time of 
the announcement we described how the 
acquisition was in line with the strategy set 
out in Amlin’s 2008 Annual Report. 
In the past two years we have taken a 
number of steps to prepare for a larger and 
more geographically diverse Group. For 
example, in 2008 we made a number of 
organisational changes, both to the Group’s 
divisional structure and to strengthen the 
wider executive management team. These 
preparations have not only played an 
important role in supporting the successful 
acquisition of ACI, but are now fundamental 
to ensuring that the business is effectively 
integrated within the Group.
Our approach to ACI’s integration within the 
Group distinguishes between immediate, 
medium-term and platform replacement 
activities. Each of these areas is being 
addressed at pace. The integration 
programme is led by the Group 
Operations Officer. 
Immediate and medium-term integration 
tasks focus on areas including business 
strategy, underwriting, risk, finance, human 
resources and communications. 
Progress to date has been pleasing. 
Key highlights are illustrated in the 
table opposite.
Platform Replacement Programme
The ACI Platform Replacement Programme 
(PRP) is a longer-term deliverable, 
focusing on both separation from Fortis 
and the implementation of new systems 
and associated business processes and 
controls. At the same time as we build the 
future platform for ACI, based on existing 
Amlin group systems components, we 
are disentangling the ACI business from 
former Fortis Group companies who, under 
transition agreements, continue to supply 
certain support services and infrastructure 
until 2011. 
Given the scale and challenge of the work 
involved, an important step has been to 
ensure that the appropriate programme 
structure, processes and resource are  
in place. We have made strong progress 
in building an integrated PRP team, 
completing planning and moving into the 
delivery phase.
Managing integration risk has been a 
constant focus since acquisition. Shortly 
after the transaction was announced, an 
executive steering group was put in place 
to direct the priorities of the business and 
support functions during transition. Amlin 
Group executive management and the ACI 
management team have worked together 
closely to ensure that we address the key 
risks and productive capacity on the priority 
integration and risk management tasks, 
involving people, financial return, risk 
exposure and operational capacity.
Our work in 2009 puts us in a good position 
from which to complete the integration of 
ACI into Amlin processes and systems, 
while addressing the improvement of 
financial returns through transferring Amlin 
best practice underwriting.

Our approach to Solvency II is based 
upon delivering an end state defi ned 
as our Target Operating Model (TOM), 
illustrated in the diagram to the right.
The TOM is business focused and is 
based upon protecting our successful 
underwriting culture, while further 
embedding actuarial analysis and formalised 
risk management into our operations.
Our TOM is fully aligned to the principles 
of Solvency II and covers the output of an 
independent gap analysis based upon 
our current state compared to existing 
regulatory guidance. It will introduce 
greater formality which will enable us 
to evidence the depth of embedding 
within the business. This will support our 
application for Internal Model approval.
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Focus on Solvency II
Background
Solvency II is an EC Directive aimed at 
overhauling the regulation of all life and non-
life insurers. Implementation is scheduled for 
October 2012. A key objective is to introduce 
a more risk based approach to regulation, 
with strong incentives for fi rms to assess 
their own capital requirements internally. In 
this regard, there are a number of similarities 
with current FSA rules which require all 
insurance fi rms to produce an Individual 
Capital Assessment (ICA).
Solvency II goes beyond existing regulation 
by aiming to instil a high standard of risk 
management and governance within 
each insurer. A fundamental aspect of 
this is infl uencing the ‘risk culture’ of an 
organisation. The diagram below 
summarises the three pillars of Solvency II.
Amlin has for some time focused on 
maintaining high standards of risk 
management and is therefore in a strong 
position to meet Solvency II standards. 
However, we view this as a business 
opportunity to raise our standards further 
and to increase our competitive advantage.
Within Amlin, Solvency II is a Group-wide 
initiative drawing on resources from across 
the organisation. Importantly, we do not 
regard Solvency II as a purely compliance 
exercise. Instead, adherence to Solvency II 
will be the product of a well run company, 
with risk management fully embedded in 
strategy and the decision making process. 
Capital requirements
For many organisations, the proposals may 
materially impact the perceived fi nancial 
strength of the company. The balance 
sheet is restated on market-consistent 
principles, with insurance liabilities valued 
on an actuarial best estimate basis and 
discounted for future investment income. 
A margin is then added to cater for risk. 
In Amlin’s case, this margin should result 
in the substantial reserve being realised as 
an explicit asset for solvency purposes.
Capital requirements are determined by 
either a standard formula or an internal 
model which has been pre-approved by 
the regulator. The design of the standard 
formula is still to be fi nalised, but it is likely 
to encourage fi rms to develop their own 
internal model. Internal model approval 
for the Lloyd’s market is being closely 
managed by Lloyd’s.

Group operating structure
Amlin employed a total of 1,161 people 
at 31 December 2009 with 512 new staff 
joining the Group during 2009. This 
includes 371 people joining through the 
acquisition of ACI, 47 ﬁlling vacancies 
created by leavers and 94 new roles.
Underwriting expertise and a consistent 
approach to underwriting risk management 
and control are critical to our success, 
making the retention of skilled and 
experienced underwriters a business 
priority. Our senior underwriters

One of our principal objectives is to 
maintain voluntary turnover, excluding 
retirements, of our senior underwriters, 
below 10% per annum and our overall 
employee turnover below 15%. During 
2009 turnover of senior underwriters  
was 1.9% with overall staff turnover

Organisational development
2009 has been a year of considerable 
change, in terms of both organisational 
structure and numbers of staff, underlining 
the continued growth and development of 
the Group. It is a testimony to the strength 
and depth of the Group’s talent base 
that these changes have been managed 
successfully and without major interruption 
to business operations or performance.
The changes in 2009 were driven by the 
strategic direction of the business which 
has included greater growth through 
acquisition. The organisational changes, 
described on page 18, providing clearer 
separation of Group and business unit

management, have been delivered through 
a number of key internal and external 
appointments. These have given Amlin the 
opportunity to provide meaningful career 
development for our existing staff and also 
to recruit fresh talent and experience into 
the organisation. In particular, the Group 
appointed a new Group Operations Officer 
during the year whose primary remit is to 
advise and support the Chief Executive 
in the execution of the Group’s growth 
strategy and to take a leading role in 
integrating the Group’s acquisitions. 
Other key appointments have provided 
the opportunity to further strengthen our 
expertise in the areas of underwriting, 
risk management, risk modelling, 
compliance, finance, investor relations 
and investment management.
People development
During 2009 the Group continued to sponsor 
and promote the Compass Leadership 
Development Programme, initially launched 
in 2007, with a further group of staff attending 
an assessment centre. The Programme is 
intended to identify leadership potential and 
to provide a basis for future development. 
As with previous attendees, this intake have 
subsequently been provided with tailored 
development plans. 
Amlin continues to offer a number of core 
development programmes focused on 
people management. Where appropriate, 
development programmes are run in 
conjunction with external providers such as 
Roffey Park and Coverdale. Approximately 
50 employees attended these personal 
development programmes during the year.

In addition to these management 
programmes the Charity & Community 
Panel believed that there was scope for 
the Group to play a more active part in 
supporting a preferred charity, with the 
benefit of providing further learning and 
development opportunities for staff. 
The aim was to incorporate a UK-based 
community project into a personal 
development event, to create a powerful, 
dynamic and challenging environment for 
learning and to provide a direct link with 
Amlin’s Corporate and Social Responsibility 
policy. Further details of this activity are 
provided in the Corporate and Social 
Responsibility section of this Report. 
In addition to our core development 
programmes, all managers and supervisors 
have been encouraged to attend two 
specific training modules; Grasping the 
Nettle and the Diversity Workshop. These 
programmes help managers address poor 
performance and to understand the benefits 
of diversity in the workplace. Since 2007, 
170 managers have attended Grasping the 
Nettle and, during 2009, 140 managers 
attended the Diversity Workshops.
In order to support the Group’s growth 
strategy and increase our long-term 
capability, January 2010 marked the start 
of the new Amlin Graduate Development 
Programme. Amlin recognises that in 
order to compete for the best talent in the 
market we need to offer a dynamic, high 
performance, development programme 
which provides graduates with the 
opportunity to experience a wide range 
of business disciplines within a structured, 
development framework. To this end a 
two-year rotational programme has been 
designed to accommodate four graduates, 
rotating through eight business areas. 
Graduates will be encouraged to study 
for and sit the ACII examinations.
The attainment of professional 
qualifications is becoming increasingly 
important in the financial services industry 
and continues to be strongly promoted by 
the Group. The importance of achieving 
relevant qualifications has been highlighted 
with the launch of a new Professional 
Qualification Policy which identifies the 
recommended qualifications for key roles 
and the standards and study support that 
is provided. 
Employee engagement
Amlin is committed to seeking the views 
of its employees and a third Employee 
Opinion Survey was carried out by Ipsos 
MORI in July 2009 covering UK and 
Bermuda staff. This survey again provided 
the opportunity to obtain feedback from 
staff and enables the Group to track 
performance against the positive results 
received in 2006. Ipsos MORI also 
provides normative data that enables 
Amlin to compare its results with other 
organisations, both within the financial 
services sector and more generally. 
80% of targeted staff participated in the 
2009 survey (72% in 2006) providing a 
high level of confidence in the efficacy 
of the results. The survey collected staff 
views against key subject areas including 
organisation strategy, leadership and 
management, recognition and reward  
and communication.
The survey recorded significant 
improvements in staff responses in all 
areas, both against the 2006 results and 
against the MORI norm groups. There 
were material improvements in views on 
leadership and line management and we 
are delighted that Amlin had MORI top 10 
level scores in the following areas:
• job satisfaction
• feeling valued and recognised
• understanding business and personal 
goals and objectives
• confidence in and clear vision from 
leadership
• line management
• feeling part of a team
• management and pace of change 
• level, credibility and nature 
of communications

Remuneration
During 2009, the Remuneration Committee 
reviewed a number of aspects of the 
Group’s remuneration structures, seeking 
to ensure that they continue to support the 
strategic objectives of the Group and that 
the stated remuneration objectives are in 
practice being delivered. The background 
and conclusions to this review are 
discussed in more detail in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Amlin Corporate Insurance – developing the capability Amlin Corporate Insurance – developing the capability
The acquisition of ACI increased the 
number of staff employed by the Group by 
371, an increase of approximately 50%. 
Staff within ACI are located across fi ve 
offi ces: Amstelveen (184), Rotterdam (49), 
Brussels (96), Antwerp (26) and Paris (16).
Included within head count are 109 staff 
previously employed by Fortis Insurance 
Belgium, although they worked for ACI. 
The successful transfer of these staff 
to ACI was a key integration risk and it 
is pleasing that in September 2009 the 
majority of individuals chose to take up 
employment in the Group.
Elsewhere, human resources integration 
is progressing well. Key achievements 
since acquisition have been effective 
communication of the employer brand, 
integration of management reporting, job 
mapping and the design of variable pay 
and bonus arrangements.
However, there remains work to 
be completed. Key objectives for 
2010 include further integration of 
management information and reporting, 
harmonisation of job evaluation and 
salary administration structures, the 
implementation of the new bonus 
arrangements and the communication 
and roll-out of the Group’s core values 
throughout ACI. Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Understanding and management of our 
capital and ﬁnancial position has been 
a key area of focus for a number of 
years. This has enhanced our return to 
shareholders and places us in a good 
position to meet the new Solvency II 
requirements for insurance companies 
that are effective from October 2012. 
As shown below, we have achieved growth 
in gross assets and net assets over the 
past five years.

Analysing the level of capital required
Understanding the level of capital required 
to operate is critical for our business. 
That understanding, and its articulation to 
stakeholders, is important in providing our 
clients with confidence in our ability to pay 
their claims, to our regulators in allowing us 
to trade, to our financing partners in lending 
to us and to our shareholders in investing in 
the business. It also allows the business to 
plan for the future and consequently affects 
our strategic direction.
Amlin uses Dynamic Financial Analysis 
(DFA) to model its capital needs. The 
model forecasts a range of potential 
financial outcomes for each area of our 
business, incorporating underwriting 
and investments, running thousands of 
simulations through a stochastic model, 
which is derived from historic and expected 
variability in claims. We have developed 
models for Syndicate 2001, Amlin 
Bermuda and the Group, and are currently 
developing a model for ACI.
For Syndicate 2001, Amlin uses the 
modelling to submit an Individual Capital 
Assessment (ICA) to Lloyd’s. The ICA, a UK 
regulatory requirement, sets out the level of 
capital required in the business to contain 
the risk of insolvency to no greater than 
a probability of 0.5%. Lloyd’s reviews the 
submissions for all syndicates in the market 
with the intent of bringing all ICAs to an 
equivalent level. At that point the ICA figure 
is uplifted by 35% to support its financial 
strength rating.
For Syndicate 2001, our uplifted ICA for 
the 2010 underwriting year is below the 
minimum ratio of 40% of premium income 
(2009: 47%) that Lloyd’s requires and so 
our capital ratio defaults to that minimum. 
This is a decrease on the prior year 
reflecting an increase in the credit provided 
for the level of reserve margin held.
Amlin Bermuda has net assets of US$1.6 
billion. We continue to believe that US$1.0 
billion is the minimum amount of capital 
required to trade with our preferred client 
base, an amount which exceeds the local 
regulatory capital requirement of US$424.6 
million. The local regulatory requirement is 
formula based. However, on an equivalent 
basis to our Lloyd’s business, including 
the 35% uplift, the required capital would 
increase to $514.0 million.
At the end of the year, ACI held net assets 
of €316.6 million and long term debt of 
€30.0 million relative to the local regulatory 
capital requirement of €111.4 million. 
We believe that the current level of 
capital is in line with what economically 
the Company requires.
In addition to regulatory capital 
requirements, we believe that the Group 
should retain a level of capital sufficient 
to allow material growth in the aftermath 
of a major insurance disaster and also to 
respond to other opportunities to enhance 
long-term growth, including through 
acquisition. The table below sets out our 
capital position at 31 December 2009.

Adjusting the capital deployed
The type of capital deployed to meet the 
short and long-term business needs is 
important in balancing the requirements of 
various stakeholders. We have two broad 
choices: the provision of capital through 
equity or debt. Our strategy in this area 
is well established. When underwriting 
margins are sufficient to limit the impact 
of a large catastrophe loss to equity, debt 
capital will form a greater proportion of the 
overall capital deployed. When margins 
weaken, the proportionate level of debt 
capital employed will fall back.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
62
Financial management continued
In recent years, our debt to total capital 
ratio has fluctuated in line with this 
philosophy. For example, in 2005 debt 
increased in order to allow us to open Amlin 
Bermuda and increase our catastrophe 
underwriting risk. Margins were very strong 
and we believed that funding growth 
through debt was appropriate. Since 2006 
the debt ratio has reduced as profits have 
increased net assets. At the end of 2009 
the net debt to total capital ratio stands  
at nil (2008: nil).
The type of debt utilised is also critical 
to ensure that, for example, the needs of 
regulators and rating agencies for long 
term, unrestricted debt is balanced with 
short term cost and flexibility. 
Our subordinated debt is regulatory 
compliant, longer-term, unsecured and 
contains no financial covenants that  
could lead to early forced repayment.  
Some of the debt is recognised as capital 
by a number of the rating agencies. In 
addition we have a £250 million unsecured 
revolving credit bank facility. This is 
currently undrawn. 
Managing equity capital 
for shareholders
We focus our financial management on 
delivering a cross-cycle return on equity 
in excess of 15% and achieving profitable 
trading through the insurance cycle. Given 
the Group’s cyclical underwriting approach, 
we recognise that at certain points this 
will lead to the Group holding surplus 
equity capital. In order to enhance our 
return on equity, as actual levels of capital 
exceed our forecast capital requirements, 
we will look to return excess capital to 
shareholders in the absence of appropriate 
ways to enhance our long-term potential. 
Our commitment to return capital has 
been clearly demonstrated over recent 
years and we have employed a number 
of different mechanisms to do so, so as 
to appeal across the shareholder base. In 
the near term and against the backdrop of 
Solvency II we expect to hold additional 
capital to support our medium and 
longer-term growth ambition, in line with 
our stated strategy. We will also look to 
buy back shares if we believe it is in our 
shareholders’ interest to do so.

Importantly, we have also been able to 
continue to grow the dividend to our 
shareholders. The chart above shows the 
steady increase in our dividend over time. 
We intend to grow our dividend per share 
consistently over the next few years. Our 
current capital strength should allow us 
to pursue this policy even if earnings are 
affected by significant catastrophe losses.
Liquidity and cash management 
During the year the Group’s cash and 
investments increased by £1,216.8 million to 
£4,099.0 million at 31 December 2009. The 
growth follows the acquisition of ACI which 
added €1.4 billion and further profitable 
trading in 2009. Cash and investments 
now represent a multiple of 2.6 times 
shareholders’ equity (2008: 2.4 times).
The strength and liquidity of the balance 
sheet are critical to our proposition as an 
insurer of choice, providing us with the 
ability to respond quickly to claims in the 
event of a large catastrophic loss. Amlin’s 
investment management approach and 
capital strength mean that the Group can 
readily absorb the losses from the worst of 
our realistic disaster scenarios. Liquidity risk 
is discussed further in the risk disclosures to 
the financial statements on page 155.
Bank facilities are also available to 
supplement the working capital strength 
of the Group. A $200 million secured LOC 
facility is available to Syndicate 2001 
to fund its US regulatory requirements 
and this reduces any potential funding 
pressures at times of catastrophic loss. 
If drawn, security is provided by a fixed 
charge over a portfolio of assets. Similarly 
Amlin Bermuda has a $200 million facility 
secured over three years in order to provide 
collateral to US cedants for their regulatory 
needs. At 31 December 2009 Amlin 
Bermuda had issued LOCs amounting  
to $124.9 million. 
Efficient cash flow management is an 
important source of value to an insurer.  
On average we retain premium for around 
three years before claims are settled. 
On large claims where reinsurance 
recoverables are due, we have to pay the 
claim before the recovery is made and 
rapid reinsurance response is important. 
Accordingly, strong credit management 
of premium and reinsurance collectibles 
improves our performance.

Investment management
Our investment process is driven by our 
investment risk appetite. This is based  
on, amongst other things, the outlook for 
underwriting profits and the strength of our 
balance sheet, rather than by targeting an 
investment return. We seek to maximise 
returns for the level of risk that we are 
prepared to accept. This is achieved through:
•  Setting appropriate strategic asset 
allocations using both qualitative and 
quantitative analysis. 
•   Taking short-term tactical asset 
allocation positions around the strategic 
asset allocations.
•   Identifying skilled external investment 
managers to manage the underlying assets.
Syndicate 2001, Amlin Bermuda and ACI 
each have their own investment strategies 
linked to the different levels of risk each 
has decided to take. The combined 
strategies are also considered at a Group 
level to ensure that the overall investment 
risk remains appropriate. We distinguish 
between policyholders’ funds, which are 
the premium received and used to meet 
future claims expenses, and capital assets, 
which support the underwriting business. 
For policyholders’ funds our risk appetite 
is relatively low. They are held in a mixture 
of government and non-government 
bonds as well as LIBOR plus funds, 
whose underlying assets are bonds and 
currencies. The duration of these assets 
references to the duration of the liabilities 
which is reasonably short. However, we will 
from time to time reduce the duration of the 
assets if we believe that yields will rise.

Currency management
The Group reports in Sterling but manages 
a Sterling business in the UK, a US dollar 
business in Bermuda and Euro businesses 
in Continental Europe.
For the UK operations, we sell trading 
currency profits into Sterling as they 
crystallise, once we are materially through 
the Atlantic windstorm season. Amlin 
Bermuda manages its US dollar trading 
position and holds its balance sheet 
mainly in US dollars reflecting its global 
underwriting profile. Similarly, ACI manages 
its Euro trading position and holds its 
balance sheet in Euros reflecting its 
European underwriting profile. At a Group 
level, we implement a policy to hedge up 
to 50% of the US dollar / Euro net asset 
exposure of the Group to Amlin Bermuda 
and ACI respectively. The Group’s hedges 
are effected through the use of derivative 
contracts and, during the first half of 2009, 
partially through Sterling investments held 
by Amlin Bermuda. 
In the year to 31 December 2009, the 
weakening in the US dollar produced 
foreign exchange losses, before hedging, 
of £98.5 million on the dollar capital 
investment in Amlin Bermuda. The hedges 
deployed reduced this loss by £31.6 
million. For ACI, the movement in the Euro 
produced foreign exchange gains before 
hedging of £7.3 million. Hedges reduced 
this gain by £2.3 million. 
Gains on derivative investments are taken 
to reserves in accordance with the hedging

rules of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. The Sterling 
assets, held during the first half of 2009, 
produced a foreign exchange gain of £25.2 
million (2008: loss of £41.3 million) in the year. 
Despite being part of the hedging strategy 
against the overall Group foreign exchange 
exposure, this gain is required to be recorded 
in Amlin Bermuda’s income statement which 
is consolidated within the Group income 
statement. An offsetting foreign exchange 
loss is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Estimation of outstanding claims 
reserves
The estimation of the Group’s outstanding 
claims reserves is another important feature 
of successful financial management. Not 
only does it have an impact on overall 
profitability, but it also impacts investment 
mix as different approaches are taken for 
capital and policyholders’ funds. At 31 
December 2009 net claims reserves totalled 
£2,010.3 million (2008: £1,332.0 million).
Insurance is an inherently uncertain 
business and much of Amlin’s business is 
large commercial insurance or reinsurance 
which can be volatile and difficult to 
estimate ultimate claims levels for. The 
subjectivities which must be considered 
when assessing the level of outstanding 
liabilities include the risk profile of an 
insurance policy, class of business, 
timeliness of notification of claims, validity 
of claims made against a policy and validity 
of the quantum of the claim. At any time 
there are a range of possible outcomes at 
which the claims reserves could ultimately 
settle. As time passes the uncertainty 
surrounding likely claims settlement 
reduces and the level of caution is reduced.
Given this uncertainty we adopt a prudent 
approach to the assessment of liabilities. 
Our underwriting teams, in the UK and 
Bermuda, are responsible for proposing the 
level of reserves to be set in their business 
units. We believe that this ensures that they 
are accountable for the evaluation and uses 
their detailed knowledge of the underlying 
exposures underwritten, particularly 
as these change through time. These 
proposed reserves are compared with an 
actuarial ‘best estimate’ set by the in-house 
actuarial team. Any required adjustments 
to the underwriters’ proposed reserves are 
then made and these are the accounted 
reserves. Consistency of reserving strength 
is our overall goal. On an underwriting 
year basis, including unexpired risks, and 
before adjustments for further major losses 
which are required for annual accounting 
purposes, net reserves for the UK and 
Bermudian business remain at least £200 
million above the actuarial best estimate 
(2008: at least £200 million).
For ACI, the local actuarial team 
produces full data on an accident year 
basis for independent external review. 
Proposed reserves are generated by local 
management according to a set formulaic 
process for the earning of premiums 
and release of IBNR. The independent 
external review involves production of 
an independent best estimate by class 
of business for comparison with the 
proposed carried reserve. The full reserving 
submission, including the external report,  
is reviewed separately by the Group 
Actuarial team. 
We estimate that the Group as a whole 
holds reserves on an accident year basis 
of at least £200 million in excess of a strict 
50:50 actuarial best estimate.
Pension obligations
The Group participates in a number of 
pension schemes, including defined 
benefit, defined contribution and personal 
pension schemes. At 31 December 2009, a 
retirement benefit obligation of £24.5 million 
was recognised in the balance sheet (2008: 
£4.0 million). Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in accordance 
with IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’. The Group 
recognised a pension charge to the income 
statement amounting to £6.4 million in the 
year (2008: £1.1 million). Note 28 to the 
financial statements provides further detail.
ACI acquisition accounting
The Group completed the acquisition of 
ACI for a consideration of €350.0 million 
on 22 July 2009. ACI’s net assets at that 
date amounted to €279.0 million. However, 
fair value adjustment required under IFRS 
3 ‘Business Combinations’ increased net 
assets at acquisition by €45.8 million to 
€324.8 million, generating goodwill of €31.6 
million (including transaction costs of €6.4 
million). Net assets at fair value include other 
intangibles relating to broker relationships of 
€31.1 million. Further detail can be found in 
note 38 to the financial statements.
Share placement
On 3 June 2009 the Group placed 
23,502,567 new Ordinary Shares with 
institutional investors representing 
approximately 5% of Amlin’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital, in order to finance 
part of the consideration for the acquisition 
of ACI. The net placing proceeds were 
£75.0 million. Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

In 2009, the ﬁnancial performance of 
the Group was exceptional with a proﬁt 
before tax of £509.1 million and a return 
on equity of 37.0% (2008: £121.6 million 
and 7.8%). Proﬁtability was enhanced by 
low natural catastrophe claims, releases 
from reserves and a strong investment 
performance. Gross written premium 
increased by 49.3% to £1.5 billion. The 
ﬁnancial performance of ACI, following 
its acquisition in July, further enhanced 
performance. 
Over the longer term the Group’s 
performance has been excellent, with a 
weighted average return on equity since 
2005 of 29.1%. This continues to materially 
exceed our cross-cycle target of at least 
15% and our estimated cost of capital over 
that period of between 8% and 10%.
For 2009 underwriting contributed 
£365.8 million (2008: £222.2 million) to 
the pre-tax result. Syndicate 2001 and 
Amlin Bermuda delivered £185.0 million 
(2008: £176.0 million) and £161.8 million 
(2008: £46.2 million) respectively, with a 
smaller return from ACI of £11.2 million. 
The result reflects good margins for our 
reinsurance underwriting, discipline in 
underwriting the core insurance lines, 
where we have maintained a profit margin 
in most classes despite tough trading 
conditions, and a relatively benign claims 
environment for catastrophes in 2009. 
The underwriting contribution also includes 
reserve releases of £174.1 million (2008: 
£114.7 million). This is the largest release 
that we have made. The release reflects 
several different factors:
• We have finalised a number of large 
single claims settlements and claims 
subrogations which have realised 
savings compared to reserves.
•  We have reviewed the reserving 
approach to UK commercial claims, 
where it has become evident that our 
claims case reserves in aggregate 
have been more robust than previously 
estimated and a trend of steady 
improvement has been established. 
Accordingly, we have adjusted our 
approach to fleet motor and liability 
classes, which has led to a release  
of £16.0 million.
• ACI generated reserve releases of  
€19.0 million.
• Generally, claims development has  
been better than expected.
For 2009, the investment return was £207.5 
million (2008: £18.0 million) on average funds 
under management of £3.4 billion. The return 
includes €59.1 million generated by ACI in 
the period since acquisition, on average 
funds under management of €1.4 billion. 
Good returns were delivered across asset 
classes with the additional risk assets that 
were added to the portfolio in early 2009 
enhancing performance.
With much of the Group’s trading 
conducted in US dollars, significant 
fluctuations in the US dollar to Sterling rate 
of exchange again had a major impact on 
the results. The income statement reflects 
foreign exchange gains of £5.4 million after 
a loss of £29.0 million due to the treatment 
of net non-monetary liabilities.
In addition, Amlin Bermuda, which reports 
in US dollars, held Sterling assets during 
the year as part of the hedging strategy 
of the overall Group foreign exchange 
exposure. These produced a foreign 
exchange gain of £25.2 million (2008: loss 
of £41.3 million). The gain is recorded 
in Amlin Bermuda’s income statement 
which is consolidated in the Group income 
statement with an offsetting foreign 
exchange loss (2008: gain) recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. At 31 December 
2009 Amlin Bermuda held no Sterling assets.
Underwriting performance
With a low level of catastrophe incidence in 
the year, a good underwriting result is to be 
expected but the Group’s overall combined 
ratio of 72% was excellent (2008: 76%). 
Divisional underwriting performance is 
described in more detail in the earlier 
section of this Report. 
Gross written premium was £1.5 billion, an 
increase of 49.3% on the prior year (2008: 
£1.0 billion). The increase was partly caused 
by the appreciation of the US dollar relative 
to Sterling. At constant rates of exchange 
written premium increased by 34.0%.
ACI added €236.1 million of written 
premium in the period since acquisition  
on 22 July 2009. Anglo French 
Underwriters, which was acquired in 
November 2008, contributed written 
premium of €31.4 million. 
The underlying increase in written premium 
reflects the overall improvement in the 
general rating environment and the addition 
of new business to our existing portfolios. 
Overall, the renewal rate of increase was 
4.4%, with a renewal retention ratio of 
90% (2008: reduction of 6.8% and 84% 
respectively).

Amlin London’s gross written premium 
was £855.7 million (2008: £689.7 million) 
with growth supported by a stronger dollar 
and both rate and volume increases. Amlin 
UK’s gross written premium increased to 
£190.9 million (2008: £152.8 million), largely 
due to new business written in the fleet 
motor account.
Amlin Bermuda wrote $628.3 million of 
income, an increase of 14.3% over the prior 
year (2008: $549.5 million). This included 
direct income of $381.6 million (2008: 
$353.3 million). 
For 2009, reinsurance expenditure as 
a proportion of gross written premium 
was 14.3% (2008: 11.4%). The increase 
is partly attributable to Special Purpose 
Syndicate 6106 (S6106) supported by 
third party capital, which was established 
in November 2008 to write a 15% quota 
share of Syndicate 2001’s excess of loss 
accounts. This provides an alternative 
risk transfer mechanism to retrocessional 
cover and has given us scope to grow 
our London reinsurance income despite 
the scarcity of traditional retrocessional 
capacity. At 31 December 2009, written 
premium ceded to S6106 was £44.4 
million. ACI has also contributed to the 
growth in reinsurance. Since acquisition,  
its reinsurance expenditure as a proportion 
of gross written premium is 16.6%.
Net earned premium was 44.2% higher 
at £1,317.3 million (2008: £913.5 million). 
Growth in net earned premium was held 
back by the impact of prior year non-
monetary gains amounting to £39.9 million 
(2008: £19.2 million reduction). The Group 
claims ratio for the year decreased to 43% 
(2008: 55%). As described on page 29, 
natural catastrophe activity was relatively 
low for 2009 and our largest catastrophe 
claims were incurred for the L’Aquila 
earthquake totalling $18.7 million (2008: 
Hurricane Ike $239.7 million).
Estimated losses for Hurricanes Gustav and 
Ike remain materially unchanged at $292 
million (31 December 2008: $302 million).
There were several large risk losses in 
the year, in particular within the aviation 
market such as the Air France, Yemenia 
and Hudson River crashes. Having been 
selective in the face of poor pricing, our 
Aviation business has limited exposure  
to these.
We have been mindful of the potential 
impact of the economic recession on 
claims patterns. There is some increased 
activity in areas such as fleet motor, 
marine hull and cargo, but to date the 
effect has not been dramatic. The UK 
professional indemnity market has seen 
increased claims related to the downturn 
in the property market and to the credit 
crunch. These trends have had a limited 
impact on Amlin due to our underwriting 
strategy which avoids exposure to large 
financial institutions or banks with material 
US activities. We have also pro-actively 
reduced our exposure to the property 
surveyors sector since 2007. 
Elsewhere, in November 2008 we 
announced the closure of our trade credit 
insurance business. This decision reflected 
our risk appetite, the prevailing economic 
climate and our medium to long-term 
view of the profitability of the business. 
The business has run off in line with our 
expectations during 2009.
Investment performance
The Group investment return for the year 
was 5.9%, and with average funds under 
management of £3.4 billion, investments 
contributed £207.5 million (2008: 0.6%, 
£2.6 billion and £18.0 million respectively). 
The return includes a return of 4.7% 
generated by ACI in the period since 
acquisition, on average funds under 
management of €1.4 billion.
Global economies and markets started 
the year in crisis mode, with policymakers 
scrambling to come up with solutions to 
shore up financial systems. Risk asset 
prices continued their freefall from 2008 
as investors made the flight to quality by 
buying government bonds. This trend 
continued until governments’ policies 
gained traction and investors started to turn 
their attention to the ‘second derivative’; 
that is, the slowing downward momentum 
of economic data. 
We started the year with the defensive 
investment stance which had stood us in 
good stead in 2008. By January the lack 
of liquidity in fixed income markets had 
produced very attractively priced securities, 
particularly to long-term investors. 
Consequently, we increased our credit 
exposure, especially to senior financial debt. 
Credit spreads have since narrowed sharply 
and this investment has added in excess 
of £30 million to our investment return for 
2009. By autumn, spreads had declined 
to more normal levels for the point in the 
economic cycle and in our core portfolios 
we scaled back our exposure to corporate 
credit, while remaining invested in the asset 
class on a selective basis. The average bond 
weighting in the year was 75%.
In July, the acquisition of ACI added a 
further €1.3 billion to our funds under  
management. 33% was invested in  
corporate bonds and had suffered heavy  
impairment to par value at acquisition.  
These assets also benefited from spread  
tightening during 2009, particularly in the  
third quarter. Towards the end of the year  
the ACI funds began to be migrated to  
new investment managers. These 
measures will provide greater asset and 
manager diversification and bring ACI’s 
investment strategy in line with that of  
the rest of the Group.
Although we added risk to the portfolio, 
our stance has remained relatively cautious 
due to high asset volatility and because of 
our scepticism regarding prospects for a 
sustained recovery in the global economy. 
The average cash balance was 16%, 
down from 31% at 31 December 2008. 
After the strong equity rally, and with the 
addition of the corporate bond portfolio 
of ACI, we reduced our equity position in 
May. Subsequent lower volatility permitted 
a higher equity weighting within our risk 
tolerance and our equity holding was 
increased during the last two months of the 
year. The average equity weighting was 5% 
which produced a return of 23.5%. 
During 2009, the insurance-linked 
securities portfolio run by Leadenhall 
Capital Partners switched from being 
a managed account to a standalone 
investment in two listed funds. The risk 
profile did not change and the investment 
was increased to $100 million across both 
funds. The return on $68 million of average 
funds was $8.3 million (12.4%).

Expenses
Total expenses, including underwriting 
and non-underwriting costs, increased 
to £461.6 million from £311.9 million in 
the prior year. Underwriting expenses, 
excluding foreign exchange movements, 
amount to £360.0 million in 2009  
(2008: £266.1 million). Non-underwriting 
expenses, excluding foreign exchange 
movements, were £84.0 million (2008: 
£43.5 million). 
Underwriting costs include costs relating  
to the acquisition and administration of 
insurance business and claims payments. 
Non-underwriting costs include head  
office costs and employee incentives.  
They also include investment fees, non-
underwriting foreign exchange gains or 
losses and, this year, ACI disentanglement 
and integration expenses.
Operating expenses, contained within 
underwriting and non-underwriting 
expenses, increased by £73.5 million 
to £171.2 million, of which £34.5 million 
was attributable to ACI. Total staff costs 
increased by £37.9 million to £97.7 million 
(ACI cost: £13.9 million). Staff incentive 
plans accounted for £36.6 million (2008: 
£21.5 million), with increases due to  
higher levels of profitability. ACI 
disentanglement costs of €12.5 million  
are included in non-underwriting expenses 
to take out one-off integration costs from 
core combined ratios.
T axation
The effective rate of tax for the period is 
10.7% (2008: 33.9%). The effective rate 
is below the UK rate of corporation tax 
primarily due to Amlin Bermuda, which 
operates locally with no corporation tax. 
We continue to believe that Amlin Bermuda 
is exempt from the Controlled Foreign 
Corporation tax provisions of the UK tax 
regime. The table below illustrates the 
source of Group profits with associated 
effective tax rates.
At 31 December 2008 a deferred tax 
provision of £16.1 million was held in 
respect of UK tax payable on potential 
future Amlin Bermuda dividends. With 
legislation enacted on 1 July 2009 to 
exempt foreign dividends from subsidiaries 
from UK tax, the deferred tax provision has 
been released. 
Dividends
The Board has declared a second interim 
dividend in lieu of a final ordinary dividend 
of 13.5 pence per share. Taken together 
with the interim dividend of 6.5 pence per 
share, this provides total dividends of 20.0 
pence per share (2008: 17.0 pence per 
share) an increase of 17.6%. 
Net assets
Net assets have increased by £377.0 
million over 2008 to £1,593.1 million. 
The main movements outside of income 
statement items are: 
•  A share placement amounting to £75.0 
million, used to part fund the acquisition 
of ACI.
• Currency translation losses on our 
Bermudian and European overseas 
operations of £61.9 million, net of currency 
hedges (2008: gains of £181.4 million). 
• Actuarial losses of £23.7 million on 
Group defined benefit schemes.
Intangibles have increased by £52.6  
million to £162.8 million following the 
acquisitions of ACI and Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting Limited. 
As a result, net tangible assets have  
risen by 29.3% from £1,105.9 million at

Amlin believes that effective investment management is an important 
element of adding shareholder value. Our team of investment 
professionals has built up a strong performance record, producing 
an excellent Sharpe Ratio*, a measure of the risk adjusted return, 
of 2.6 since 2004. This has been achieved by using risk appetite 
as the driver of the investment process, rather than a return target. 
Consequently we have delivered solid returns each year.
As described on pages 68 to 69, our approach involves setting 
strategic and tactical asset allocations commensurate with our risk 
appetite and selecting skilled investment managers to manage 
the assets in line with our strategy. The investments are run on a 
multi-asset, multi-manager basis in which proactive asset allocation 
decisions made internally are key. Changes to the asset mix are 
made when it is judged that particular assets have become over 
or undervalued for the macro environment. 
The success of this disciplined and highly responsive investment 
approval has been evident in our performance during the recent 
period of fi nancial market turbulence. Our approval led us to be 
defensively positioned in 2008, which meant that we made a 
positive return, despite the dislocation in markets in the aftermath 
of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It also meant that we were in 
a position to increase risk early in 2009 and take advantage of the 
liquidity premia that had developed in corporate bonds, which we 
believed offered a very attractive risk reward balance. This proved to 
be the case and, as the charts above show, corporate bond spreads 
subsequently fell sharply. This trade added in excess of £30m to the 
2009 investment return. In the autumn of 2009, when bond yields 
had declined signifi cantly, we shifted our asset mix toward LIBOR+ 
funds, which give our managers a wider investment opportunity set 
and scope to produce a positive return when bond yields start to rise. 
Such investment decisions are part of our ongoing active investment 
management strategy and we are confi dent that this approach will 
continue to provide Amlin with a competitive edge and contribute 
to high quality, stable earnings in the future.
Adding shareholder value
Focus on investment management
* The Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of performance, which is often used to 
evaluate the performance of a portfolio and its manager. The ratio compares the return 
of the portfolio to the risk-free rate as well as the risk generated by the portfolio.

Outlook
It will be difﬁcult for us to repeat the 
heights of last year in 2010. However, 
the continuance of satisfactory market 
conditions for many areas of the Group 
puts us in a strong position, we believe,  
to again exceed our target 15% cross 
cycle return on equity. Our trading 
volumes will also be helped by a full year 
of ACI’s premium income.
A developing rating environment
As we have commented upon previously, 
the rating cycles of different parts of our 
business have become dislocated over 
the last five years. Due to the diversity of 
our business classes and platforms, this 
provides us with the opportunity to allocate 
capacity where margins are most appealing. 
The reinsurance business, of Amlin London 
and Bermuda, remains an area where 
we expect good performance in 2010. A 
benign year for catastrophes in 2009, and 
the additional capacity that this creates in 
the reinsurance market, will mean more 
pressure is seen to reduce rates. However, 
the reinsurance market has been very 
disciplined in its approach over the last nine 
years, reflecting the concentration of risk 
that reinsurance companies bear and the 
focus that many companies now have on 
delivering a sensible cross-cycle return for 
that risk. 
The retrocessional market has shown little 
sign of resurgence to provide risk transfer 
opportunities for reinsurance companies and 
with capital markets more risk averse than 
three years ago, there is limited evidence 
of investment banking activity reigniting the 
alternative risk transfer market. 
This discipline was evident at the 1 January 
renewal season for our catastrophe 
reinsurance business. For our London and 
Bermuda reinsurance accounts, this is a 
key renewal season, with 27.7% of the 
business expected to be written for the 
year renewed at this point. It also sets the 
tone for the April and mid-year reinsurance 
renewal seasons. For US catastrophe risks, 
rate reductions averaged 4.4%, lower than 
the market averages announced by the 
major reinsurance brokers. This leaves prices 
above the level at the start of 2008. For our 
international catastrophe account rates were 
broadly flat, with rate increases achieved in 
a number of zones. Margin potential in these 
areas remains good and for 2010 we have 
increased our catastrophe risk appetite by 
£40 million. Importantly we retained strong 
support from brokers for risks that were 
oversubscribed. 
The rating environment in a number of 
specialty classes also remains good or is 
showing signs of improving. At the end of 
2009 the main airline insurance renewal 
season saw rate increases of 8.2% achieved, 
with individual accounts experiencing 
increases of between 15% to 25%. In 
our view this is still not fully sufficient to 
adequately compensate for the risk borne 
in this class but we began to selectively 
engage. Similarly, our marine teams were 
able to hold rates relatively steady at 
1 January with Amlin London’s marine 
business achieving a rate increase of 0.5%. 
ACI continued to re-underwrite its marine 
portfolio in order to return the account 
to acceptable margins. This has meant 
pushing for strong rate improvements on 
underperforming business and allowing such 
business to be lost if this is not achieved. We 
are fully supportive of this approach and it is 
clear that real progress is being made. 
The picture in more mainstream commercial 
insurance markets is mixed. We do not 
believe that many competitors are making 
good profits in the UK, US or Continental 
insurance markets in the motor, liability and 
property markets in which we compete. 
Many commentators believe that the reserve 
releases that have flattered results in recent 
times are running out. That factor, taken with 
lower investment return potential than we 
have seen for many years, must be focusing 
the minds of management on improvement. 
We also believe that lagged recessionary 
pressures will make the claims environment 
a more challenging one. 
In the UK we expect that we will continue to 
see steady improvement through 2010 and 
acceleration into 2011 as poor underwriting 
strategies of the last few years catch up 
and competitors are forced to take remedial 
action. Signs of distress became apparent 
in 2009 in fleet motor in particular where 
we have experienced improved quote 
and conversion rates, suggesting that 
competition was becoming less fierce. 
Amlin UK has taken a number of steps to 
enhance its growth prospects when pricing 
improves to the right levels and is ready to 
seize opportunities that are expected to arise. 
In Continental Europe, both for ACI and 
Anglo French Underwriters (AFU), the rating 
environment remains challenging. There is 
little evidence yet that rate improvements 
are imminent. However the combined ratios 
of ACI’s property and liability accounts, and 
AFU across the portfolio, are good for this 
point in the cycle and these businesses will 
not be pushed to pursue growth strategies 
until a better environment returns. 
In the US, there appears to remain ample 
capacity for property and casualty business 
although rates continue to be relatively stable. 
This market has been impacted by the fallout 
of the financial crisis of 2008 – not in the 
way that would have been expected with a 
return to better rates for the transfer of risk 
but rather increased competition as major 
competitors fought to retain market share. 
We still expect improvements; however, 
predicting when these will come and what 
will be the catalyst is proving difficult. 
Momentum from acquisition, 
unearned premium and reserves
While the environment may be difficult to 
predict, we are confident that the momentum 
built up in 2009 will carry us forward in 2010. 
The acquisition of ACI was completed on 
22 July 2009 and so 2010 will benefit from 
a full year’s trading. The fruits of the re-
underwriting in marine since the beginning 
of 2009 should begin to be seen in better 
margins even if volumes are reduced. 
Similarly, some of the effects on the marine 
account of the sudden drop in trade in late 
2008, both in terms of premium values and 
claims, should abate. However, we do not 
expect ACI will generate materially better 
underwriting returns until 2011 because of 
the delayed effect of re-underwriting which 
impacts the expense ratio first through lower 
premiums and the claims ratio more slowly 
as the premium written at better margins 
takes time to earn through. 
The net unearned premium at 31 December 
2009 stands at £692.0 million (2008: £518.4 
million), with much of the premium written

Outlook continued
at good margins. This provides a solid 
foundation for the year. 
The reserving position of Amlin remains 
robust. Despite record reserve releases in 
2009, we have applied our reserving policy 
consistently. We reserve above a 50:50 
actuarial best estimate, which means that 
we would expect to see reserve surpluses 
arising if claims development is in line with 
expectations. Our track record is strong 
and while we do not anticipate a repeat of 
some of the factors that increased releases 
in 2008 and 2009, we do expect releases to 
be robust.

Investment markets
Looking forward, we hope that investment 
markets lose some of the volatility that has 
been evident in the last two years. However, 
if this happens, what is clear to us is that the 
return potential is not going to be strong. 
Bond markets, particularly short-dated 
bonds, with low interest rates in developed 
economies and credit spreads for corporate 
bonds back to more normal levels, do not 
offer the return potential of 2009. Economic 
activity remains subdued and the headwinds 
against any pick up are heavy. This suggests 
that we will not see rapidly rising interest 
rates, but a steady return to more normal 
levels over the next few years should be 
expected. We see little material upside in 
yields and so have been diversifying our 
portfolios away from gilts and treasuries 
that we have used in recent years. We have 
invested more with managers that have 
less exposure to interest rate risk, such as 
LIBOR plus funds, or have the ability to short 
the bond market. The latter increases the 
opportunity to make an acceptable return.
Many companies appear to have weathered 
the recession well, with strong balance 
sheets, good performance in 2009 from 
strong control of costs, and are seeing 
improvements in revenues as economic 
activity improves. Consequently we have 
removed the hedges that we had in place 
during the second half of 2009, which were 
used to control the overall risk of the equity 
portfolio. Although economic activity is likely 
to be constrained we believe that there is 
a reasonable chance of acceptable returns 
from our equity portfolio in 2010. 
Summary
Overall, we anticipate a more challenging 
environment for 2010 but one where Amlin 
remains capable of delivering above target 
returns. Our underwriting discipline and 
good margins in areas towards which we are 
weighted, such as reinsurance, marine and 
a rising UK commercial insurance market, 
should ensure that we continue to see 
healthy underwriting returns. The investment 
market will likely deliver lower returns but 
is still capable of generating a material 
contribution if we remain agile and risk 
aware. Our capital position remains strong 
which will be attractive to clients looking for 
robust partners and also provides us with the 
ability to continue to develop the business. Syndicate 2001: AM Best: A+ (Superior)

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Reﬂecting our values
Board composition 
and independence
During the year the Board of Amlin plc 
(the Board or plc Board) comprised: the 
Chairman, at different times either six or 
seven other non-executive directors and 
three executive directors. Biographical 
details of all the current directors are 
set out on page 74.
The only changes to the Board during the 
year were the appointment of Mr Holt as a 
non-independent non-executive director on 
5 January 2009 (having retired as executive 
Underwriting Director on 31 December 2008) 
and the retirement of Mr Mylvaganam, as 
a non-independent non-executive, after 
long and valued service, at the AGM 
on 13 May 2009.
The non-executive Chairman was 
independent on his appointment in 
1998 but, as Chairman, is not classified 
as independent.
Mr Holt, as a former Amlin executive, 
is not independent. The Board believes 
that his long experience of the industry 
and of the Group’s business is of material 
benefit to the Board and, although his 
non-independence results in him not 
serving on Board committees, he plays 
a useful role as a non-executive director 
of two major operating subsidiaries. 
Five other non-executives served throughout 
the year and have been determined by the 
Board as being independent in character 
and judgement with no relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, 
the directors’ judgement. 
Mr Buchanan, the senior independent 
director, retired as a partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
in 2001 and receives a pension annuity 
from that firm that can vary if the firm’s 
financial results do not meet a certain 
threshold. The Board believes that Amlin 
is not a material enough client to a firm of 
PwC’s size ever to be likely to affect whether 
such threshold is met. Nonetheless, his 
possibly perceived conflict of interest was 
recognised during the auditor appointment 
process that took place during the year and 
managed in the manner described in the 
Audit Committee’s report that follows this 
statement. Following PwC’s appointment 
the Board has authorised the potential 
conflict involved in Mr Buchanan continuing 
to act as Audit Committee chairman, allowing 
him to be involved in all aspects of the 
Committee’s work, save that he would step 
aside from involvement in any dispute or 
litigation between the Group and PwC 
were it ever to arise. 
In addition to Mr Buchanan’s PwC interest, 
the Board has authorised a number of other 
potential conflicts of interest regarding the 
independent directors, including both Mrs 
Bosse and Mr Feinstein being directors of 
overseas insurance companies which, like 
many insurers around the world, purchase 
reinsurance from the Amlin Group on normal 
commercial terms. These transactions are 
not material either to Amlin or, the Directors 
believe, to the other companies and in 
both cases the reinsurance relationship 
is independent of, and pre-dates, their 
Amlin directorships. The Board remains 
robustly of the view that such inter-company 
transactions are an inevitable consequence 
of engaging non-executive directors 
with relevant current insurance industry 
experience (which, in view of the specialist 
and complex nature of insurance, is highly 
beneficial to the Company) and that they 
do not affect, and should not be regarded 
by an objective observer as affecting, the 
independence of the directors concerned in 
fulfilling their roles as non-executive directors 
of Amlin. 
There have been no changes in the Board 
since the year end. The Board continues 
at the date of this report to consist of the 
Chairman, five independent directors and 
four non-independent directors (Mr Holt 
and the three executive directors). 
Regulated subsidiaries within a 
Group management framework
2009 was a further year of transition for the 
Group from an insurance business focused 
on its Lloyd’s syndicate to one in which the 
Lloyd’s-based business was a less dominant 
part. This has been reflected in organisational 
changes into five newly configured business 
divisions and in a greater separation and 
distinction between Group functions and 
those of the divisions. This has particularly 
affected the UK operations which hitherto 
had been managed closely alongside the 
Group. This organisational change has been 
reflected in governance changes that took 
place both during the year and since the 
year end.
Each of the Group’s business platforms 
has its own regulated board: that of Amlin 
Underwriting Limited (AUL) for the Group’s 
Lloyd’s operations (Amlin London and 
Amlin UK), Amlin Bermuda Ltd (ABL) for 
Bermuda and, since its acquisition in July 
Board Corporate Governance statement
The Board believes that high standards of governance are intrinsic to Amlin’s culture  
and values:
•  They are central to fulﬁlling many of Amlin’s core values such as integrity, professional excellence 
and sustainability. 
•  They underpin the objectivity of such processes as insurance reserving, risk management, balance sheet 
and investment management, the design and operation of executive remuneration and succession planning. 
•  They are the basis for the accountability of executive management to the Board and of the Board  
to shareholders.

2009, Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V . (ACI) 
for its business in Continental Europe. There 
are also a number of regulated agency 
companies with their own boards that source 
business for the Group’s Lloyd’s syndicate, 
including Anglo French Underwriters in 
France which is managed as the Group’s 
fi fth business division under a holding 
company, Amlin France SAS. 
In late 2008 AUL’s executive governance was 
split between an Amlin London management 
committee and an Amlin UK management 
committee. They each hold quarterly review 
meetings with Group and AUL executives, 
which report to the AUL board. 
The distinction between Group and 
divisional/subsidiary roles has facilitated 
a greater concentration of Messrs Philipps 
and Hextall’s time on plc strategic and longer 
term issues, rather than on the day-to-day 
management of AUL. Together with the 
Chief Risk Offi cer (Mr James Illingworth), 
and a new Chief Operations Offi cer recruited 
during the year (Mr Andrew Grant), they 
comprise a focused Group Executive. 
The new structure also facilitated the 
management of the acquisition of ACI 
in July 2009 and the subsequent start to 
its integration with the Group and should 
facilitate the smooth management of further 
additional business platforms for the Group 
should appropriate opportunities arise.
The relationship between the corporate 
and management structures is illustrated in 
the ‘Corporate and management structure’ 
chart below. 
Separate management with a 
strong Group governance input
Each regulated subsidiary has its own 
executive management separate from that 
of the Group, with Group executives including 
the Chief Executive (Mr Philipps) and Finance 
Director (Mr Hextall) sitting as non-executives 
on subsidiary boards along with the relevant 
business’s executive management either 
on the board or on a management board. 
One of the main ways in which the 
Company ensures that there is suffi cient 
Group infl uence and control within this 
delegated structure is through overlapping 
board memberships (the year end position is 
illustrated in the ‘Board memberships’ chart 
overleaf). In the UK the Chairman and three 
other non-executive directors of the 
Company serve as non-executives on the 
AUL Board in addition to the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director who 
moved to ‘internal non-executives’ roles 
within AUL in late 2008, with AUL now being 
managed by its own Managing Director, 
Finance Director and the Underwriting 
Directors of Amlin London and Amlin UK. 
Mr Illingworth, a director of AUL and ACI, 
is Chief Risk Offi cer at both Group and AUL 
levels. The ABL board has three executive 
directors and three non-executives from the 
Amlin plc board (the Group Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director and a non-executive). 
ACI has a two tier board structure comprising 
a Supervisory Board made up of an 
independent Chairman (with a further 
independent planned to be appointed in 
2010) and three plc/Group executives and a 
Management Board (whose members 
usually attend Supervisory Board meetings) 
of fi ve ACI executives. Anglo French 
Underwriters (AFU) has a local parent 
company board (Amlin France) of four 
Group executives and three AFU executives. 
Thus, rather than performing dual roles 
at Group and subsidiary (particularly 
AUL) levels, the roles of the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director have 
become more distinctively Group ones, 
being involved in subsidiaries at board and 
strategic levels and, in a few limited areas, 
where a specifi c function may have been 
internally outsourced to the Group (such 
as investments).
In terms of plc Board reporting, key indicator 
reports on each of the fi ve business divisions 
are made to the plc Board in addition to 
consolidated reports on a Group level. 
Achieving greater focus of divisional 
business reporting to plc, enabling the 
Board to concentrate on its key strategic 
and control roles, has been an important 
Board objective during the year.
Evolving Board 
Committee structures
As the plc Board has overall responsibility 
to shareholders and other stakeholders for 
the Group’s operations, it is necessary not 
only for the plc Board to direct the overall 
strategy, values and standards for the Group 
but for its Board Committees to be able 
effectively to oversee the aspects of the 
whole Group relevant to their responsibilities.

Board Corporate Governance statement continued
subsidiary governance responsibilities is also 
refl ected in evolving committee structures. 
During the year the operation of both the 
Audit and Nomination Committees as 
joint committees with AUL enabled those 
Committees to report directly to AUL the 
conclusions of its reviews of matters that 
are that board’s regulatory responsibility. 
As discussed in the Audit Committee’s own 
report, since the year end AUL has set up its 
own separate Audit Committee and both that 
and ACI’s Audit Committee will make reports 
to the Amlin plc Audit Committee as well 
as to their respective boards. 
Since the year end the Nomination 
Committee has also ceased to be a joint 
committee with AUL but now reviews 
succession planning for key roles within the 
whole Group, reporting the conclusions of its 
reviews to the relevant subsidiary boards as 
well as to the plc Board. The Remuneration 
Committee remains a plc Board committee 
but, similarly to the Nomination Committee, 
it reports the conclusions of its reviews 
of matters within the control of regulated 
subsidiaries to the boards of the relevant 
subsidiaries. This committee structure is 
illustrated in the chart below.

of a review and decision-making structure 
that goes much deeper. It remains the 
philosophy of the Group that key decisions 
and processes, including purely executive 
ones, take place within an objective 
governance framework, whether they 
be at Group, subsidiary or divisional level. 
The Group Executive team referred to above 
is responsible, through the Chief Executive 
and directly, to the plc Board. Executives 
in the business areas report both to the 
Group Executive and to their relevant 
operational boards and management 
committees. In addition to the Group 
Executive, an Executive Strategy Group 
(ESG), including representatives from some 
of the businesses, assists the Group Chief 
Executive on strategic issues, joining the 
Board for its annual planning and strategy 
session after which the Group strategy 
is determined or refined.
The business functions themselves are 
all described in more detail in the Review 
section of the Annual Report. Summaries 
of the governance arrangements for some 
key functions now follow. 
Reserving
Responsibility for reserving is that 
of the regulated boards and, at Group 
consolidated level, the plc Board but it is 
important that the process through which 
executive management reach their reserving 
decisions is objective and robust. This role is 
performed for Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
ABL by their respective quarterly review or 
board meetings, which review and finalise 
the preliminary reserving conclusions for 
their businesses, reporting at subsidiary 
board level each quarter and, twice-yearly, 
to Amlin plc’s Audit Committee. Quarterly 
review meetings receive actuarial reports 
from the Group Risk Assessment & 
Monitoring department reviewing 
the consistency of the key reserving 
judgements. Similar processes are being 
implemented as part of the integration 
of ACI and AFU. 
Risk management
Whilst processes vary in each business, 
there is a clear line of responsibility for risk 
management from business managers to 
their local management and to the Group 
Executive. For Amlin London and Amlin 
UK, that line is to an AUL (previously a 
Group) executive Risk Committee and, 
from there, to the AUL board. AUL’s 
Risk Committee also reports back to 
the management of each of its divisions 
in order to ensure that recommendations 
for risk assessment, control and mitigation 
are carefully considered and acted upon at 
executive level. At ABL, ACI and AFU, risk 
governance is a Board level responsibility. 
At Group level, the Audit Committee has 
specific responsibilities for risk, as outlined 
in more detail in that committee’s report. 
That Committee, as well as the plc Board, 
receives reports from the Chief Risk Officer 
on the whole Group. Further details of 
the Group’s risk management, and its 
development during the year, are also set out 
in the Review section of the Annual Report. 
The conclusions of the Board’s review 
of internal control is set out in the ‘Board 
internal control statement’ later in this report. 
Investments
The setting and execution of the Group’s 
investment strategy has its own hierarchy 
of responsibilities. The relevant boards 
(AUL for Syndicate funds, which includes 
its underwriting and capital assets, ABL 
and ACI for their own funds, and Amlin plc 
for surplus capital and a Group overview) 
are responsible for setting and monitoring 
their own investment risk appetites within 
the overall Group investment appetite. 
Investment advice and many elements 
of management are outsourced to the 
Group Investment function headed by the 
Chief Investment Officer. An Investment 
Management Executive consisting of 
the Group Finance Director, Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Investment Officer has 
responsibility for important tactical asset 
allocation decisions and advice, with 
operational decisions being taken by the 
Chief Investment Officer. The executive 
is assisted in its decision making and 
recommendations to the boards by an 
Investment Advisory Panel (IAP) consisting 
of members of the Investment Management 
Executive plus three external investment 
experts. Investment management itself is 
outsourced to external managers. The whole 
process is governed by an investment 
framework, which documents what decisions 
may be taken at what level. In late 2009 
ACI was integrated into this Group structure 
already in place for AUL and ABL (AFU, 
as an agency, not having its own 
material investments).
Corporate responsibility
The Chief Executive has Board level 
responsibility for all corporate responsibility 
matters. The Group operates a Charities and 
Community Panel and a Climate Change and 
Environment Panel, each of which inputs into 
management’s review of the Group’s overall 
corporate responsibility activities. The fruits 
of this structure are reflected in the separate 
Corporate Responsibility report that follows 
the corporate governance reports. 
Board and Committee meetings 
and attendance
The plc Board held six regular Board 
meetings in 2009 (2008: six) and one 
two-day planning and strategy session 
(2008: one). T wo Board meetings were 
held during the year to consider specific 
corporate transactions (2008: one) as well 
as a number of informal conference calls 
for the same purpose attended by most 
directors. The subsidiary operating boards 
met quarterly. The attendance of each 
director at plc Board meetings (out of nine 
possible meetings, including the planning 
and strategy session) are shown on the 
following page. The committee attendances 
of those directors who were members of any 
of the principal board committees for all or 
any part of the year are also shown on the

Compliance with Combined Code
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Company complied with all of the provisions of section 1 (companies) of the Combined Code. 
This report, the following Committee reports, the Directors’ Remuneration report and the summary table below together describe how the 
Company applied the Main and Supporting Principles of the Combined Code during the year.
Area of section 1 of the Combined Code Commentary
A. Directors
A.1  The Board
“an effective board…collectively responsible 
for the success of the company”
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its own and its committees’ decisions provides that the 
Board’s primary obligation is to lead and control the Company and its business, with exclusive decision 
making powers over such matters as: overall strategy and resources; risk appetite; investment strategy; 
remuneration policies; accounting policies; capital expenditure, acquisitions and debt facilities over certain 
thresholds; and certain key Group policies, appointments and categories of public announcements. The 
detailed implementation of all these matters, and day-to-day business, are left to management, which reports 
formally to the Board at least quarterly on underwriting, financial and other operational matters and objectives. 
The current schedule of matters reserved to the Board is available in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of 
‘Investor Relations’ on the Company’s website or from the Company Secretary on request.
The Board meets regularly, usually at full strength, as demonstrated in ‘Board meeting attendance in 2009’ 
table above. The NEDs met during the year without executive directors or other executive management 
present, including at least once without the Chairman. The Chairman chairs full NED meetings and the senior 
independent director chairs meetings when the Chairman is not present.
A.2 Chairman and Chief Executive
“clear division of responsibilities”
There is a division of responsibilities on the Board between the Chairman, who is responsible for leading 
and running the Board and related matters such as Board induction and evaluation, and the Group Chief 
Executive, who has executive responsibility for running the Group’s business. A statement detailing this 
division of responsibilities, which includes provision for the Chairman’s role in ensuring accountability of 
the Chief Executive to him and to the Board, in shareholder relations and in ensuring constructive relations 
between executive and non-executive directors, has been approved by the Board.
A.3 Board balance and independence
“a balance of executive and non-executive 
directors (…in particular independent NEDs)”
The balance of the Board, its strong independent representation and the sharing of Committee work are set 
out in earlier sections of this Board Corporate Governance statement. Mr Buchanan is the senior independent 
director designated as an appropriate director to whom shareholders’ concerns may be conveyed if contact 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve them or 
is inappropriate. 83

A. Directors
A.4 Appointments to the Board
“formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors…expected time 
commitments of NEDs”
The Company’s Articles of Association (“Articles”) set out clear powers of removal, appointment, election 
and re-election of directors. 
The process for nomination to the Board and for considering succession planning is set out in the Nomination 
Committee report that follows this report. The Board continues to satisfy itself that the Chairman has sufficient 
time available to devote to his duties as non-executive Chairman of the Company (and of AUL). The letters 
of appointment of the Chairman and the other NEDs, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office, set out the following expected minimum annual time commitments to the Company and AUL:
• Chairman of the companies: 75 days
• Senior independent, including chairing Audit Committee (Mr Buchanan): 30 days 
• Chairman of Remuneration Committee (Sir Mark Wrightson): 25 days
• Member of both a Board Committee and of the AUL Board (Mr Feinstein): 25 days
• Others (including either a Board Committee or membership of the AUL Board): 20 days.
• Mr Holt’s time spent as a non-executive director of ABL is not included in the above.
A.5 Information and professional development
“timely quality information…induction on joining… 
regular update (of) skills and knowledge”
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate information to enable it to discharge its 
duties, including providing constructive challenge to, and scrutiny of, management. Further information is 
obtained by the Board from the executive directors and other senior executives as appropriate. All directors 
are provided with written materials on their responsibilities as directors of a public company and on other 
relevant regulatory, legal, accounting and insurance industry matters. Updating information on technical 
and/or industry matters is provided to the Board with opportunities for discussion. During 2009 special 
sessions were held on risk and a special Board visit was made to AFU. In addition, the Company encourages, 
facilitates and monitors other professional development for both executive and non-executive directors as is 
required for their particular roles. 
The Company maintains a model director induction programme but this was not operated during the year 
as there were no new directors. Procedures are in place for directors to take independent professional advice, 
when necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board and its committees are supported by the Company Secretary who, under the direction of the 
Chairman, advises the board on all governance matters and helps to ensure good communication and 
information flows within the Board, including between executive and non-executive directors and between 
the Board and its Committees. He also facilitates the Board updating and induction work outlined above. 
Subsidiary Boards (other than ABL which has its own local arrangements in Bermuda) and executive level 
committees are also serviced, attended and minuted by the Secretary or another member of his team.
A.6 Performance evaluation
“formal and rigorous annual evaluation 
of its own performance”
Since the last annual report the Board has completed an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and each director. The annual evaluations were initiated by a questionnaire completed by 
each director giving his assessment of both collective and individual performances. The results of the latest 
Board evaluation were summarised by the Chairman at its meeting in February 2010 and the Board agreed 
its conclusions. Each Board Committee evaluated its performance at the turn of the year, and the conclusions 
were also reported to the Board in February 2010.
The Chairman also discussed any issues arising from the evaluation of each individual director, including 
the performances of executive directors in respect of their boardroom as opposed to executive roles (which 
are evaluated as part of the Group’s regular Performance Development Review process), with the director 
concerned. The Chief Executive’s total performance is reviewed by the Chairman.
The Chairman’s own evaluation was conducted by the non-executive directors led by the senior independent 
director, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The senior independent director discussed 
and agreed the conclusions with the Chairman.
A.7 Re-election
“re-election at regular intervals…planned and 
progressive refreshing of the board”
The Articles of Association of the Company provide for re-election at regular intervals, as more fully described 
in the next section of this report.
Details of the procedures whereby appointments and re-appointments to the Board are considered are set out 
in the Nomination Committee report below. Board and individual directors’ evaluations are taken into account 
by that committee when considering specifications for new NEDs, succession planning and nominations for 
re-election at AGMs. Further details of the terms of appointment of both the non-executive and executive 
directors are also set out in the Directors’ Remuneration report.
B. Remuneration
B.1 The level and make-up of remuneration
“levels…sufﬁcient to attract, retain and motivate 
directors…avoid paying more than is necessary…
signiﬁcant proportion (of executive remuneration)
The Directors’ Remuneration report starting on page 98 sets out the policies and practices which demonstrate 
the Company’s implementation of this Code principle and provisions. 84
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
B. Remuneration
B.2 Procedure
“formal and transparent procedure”
The above sections entitled ‘Board composition and independence’ and ‘Board and Committee meetings 
and attendance’ demonstrate the appropriate membership and meeting frequency of the Remuneration 
Committee. There are generally five or six main meetings each year with a varying number of other meetings 
to implement formally decisions that have already been made or to deal with urgent matters. Further details 
of the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference and the Board’s policy and practices regarding NED 
remuneration and terms of office are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration report.
C. Accountability and audit
C.1 Financial reporting
“present balanced and understandable assessment 
of… position and prospects”
The Audit Committee’s role in ensuring that the Group’s financial reporting meets the standards of 
transparency and balance that are required and in monitoring reporting to regulators is set out in more 
detail in the Audit Committee report following this report. A ‘going concern’ statement is included in the 
Directors’ report.
C.2 Internal control
“sound system of internal control”
The Board’s statement and commentary on its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control is set out in the ‘Board internal control statement’ below.
C.3 Audit Committee and auditors
“formal and transparent arrangements for…
(applying) ﬁnancial reporting and internal 
control principles”
The role of the Audit Committee and the conduct of the relationship with the auditors is set out in the Audit 
Committee report below.
D. Relations with shareholders
D.1 Dialogue with institutional shareholders
“dialogue based on mutual understanding 
of objectives”
The Company is committed to a process of continuing dialogue with its shareholders, including making 
appropriate contact with institutional investors and their representative bodies when there are specific 
matters to discuss. Other details of the dialogue, and its reporting to the Board, are set out in the ‘Investor 
relations’ section of the Annual Report on page 90. 
D.2 Constructive use of Annual General Meeting
“use AGM to communicate with investors and 
encourage their participation”
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM by the Chief Executive making a presentation there on the 
Group’s progress. The voting participation at its last three AGMs was proxies representing 73%, 68% and 
77% of its shares in issue in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. Electronic proxy voting, details of which are 
included in the 2010 AGM circular and Notice of Meeting, is made available. The totals of proxy votes on 
each resolution, including details of any votes withheld, are announced at the meeting after each resolution 
has been dealt with on a show of hands and the full proxy voting results are always announced through a 
regulatory news service and on the Company’s website. In the event of a close result as indicated by the 
proxies held by the chairman of the meeting, the chairman would call a poll but this did not prove necessary 
at any of the AGMs referred to. The Board believes that the immediacy of voting on a show of hands with 
the proxy votes immediately being announced, rather than a laborious process of conducting a formal poll 
on every resolution, is appreciated by the shareholders who attend the meeting. 
Director and shareholder governance provisions in the Articles of Association
The following summaries of certain aspects of the Company’s current Articles of Association (Articles) are incorporated by reference into 
the Directors’ Report starting on page 114. None of these provisions is proposed to be materially changed in the new Articles proposed 
for adoption at the 2010 AGM.
Aspect of Articles Commentary
Directors
Appointments to the Board The Company’s Articles set out clear powers of removal, appointment, election and re-election of directors. 
A director may be removed either by a unanimous resolution of fellow directors or by an ordinary resolution of 
the Company in general meeting. As regards appointments, the Board may appoint additional directors at any 
time but such appointees must, if they wish to continue, be elected by shareholders by an ordinary resolution 
at the AGM following their appointment. The Articles also provide that no term of office may exceed the 
period between election or re-election by shareholders and the AGM in the third year following such election 
or re-election. In certain circumstances, directors are proposed for election for shorter periods. 
Re-election to the Board The Articles of Association of the Company provide that, following a director’s election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting immediately following his or her initial appointment by the Board, each director’s term 
of office before being required to submit himself or herself to shareholders for re-election is three years. If an 
NED has served on the Board for nine years or more, this is shortened to one year. 
Relations with shareholders
Procedure at Annual General Meeting Amendments to the Articles may only be made by special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders of 
the Company, usually the AGM. In order for a special resolution to be passed, it must be approved by 75% 
or more of the shares voted on the resolution, either in person or by proxy.

Board internal control statement 
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and has 
complied with Principle C.2 of the Combined 
Code by establishing a continuous process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks the Group faces. This 
process has been in place from the start of 
2009 to the date of approval of this report, 
has been regularly reviewed by the Board 
and accords with the Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code (October 
2005) (the Turnbull guidance). This process 
explicitly includes the risks and opportunities 
to enhance value that arise from social, 
environmental and ethical matters. 
The Board is also responsible for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control and the directors are aware 
that such a system is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement 
or financial loss. 
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of 
the Combined Code, the Audit Committee 
(Committee) reviews regularly, on behalf of 
the Board, the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control. Monitoring covers 
all controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
processes. We can confirm that necessary 
actions have been or are being taken to 
remedy any significant identified control 
failings or weaknesses and the Committee 
has received regular reports from management 
to assist with this process. 
Control framework
The Board has put in place a management 
structure with defined lines of responsibility 
and clear delegation of authority. This 
structure cascades down through the 
operating elements of the business with 
clear responsibilities for ensuring that 
appropriate controls are in place at an 
operational level. A reporting mechanism to 
monitor how these initiatives are working has 
also been established. Key elements of the 
overall control environment are the various 
executive governance bodies discussed 
earlier in this Board Corporate Governance 
statement, including the Group Executive 
committee, which meets at least monthly 
and is responsible for all strategic and 
operational activities on a day-to-day basis. 
The other key control elements are the 
subsidiary boards and review committees, to 
which the relevant management committees 
or management boards report. The latter are 
responsible for the day-to-day operation of 
Amlin’s individual businesses, including 
internal control. 
Business planning
The Group has developed a formal structured 
business planning process which operates 
for all business elements. This operates 
on an annual cycle with proposed plans 
being presented to and agreed by relevant 
subsidiary boards prior to being consolidated 
and approved by the plc Board. Monitoring 
processes operate monthly and the Group’s 
financial performance monitoring includes 
detailed reporting against budgets and the 
preparation of longer-term projections.
Risk assessment
Amlin’s risk assessment process has, in 
2009, included output from a new system 
introduced from 2008 for reporting on all 
the identified risks to the achievement of 
Group objectives and on the nature and 
effectiveness of the controls and other 
management processes to manage the 
key risks. This system encompasses self 
assessment of controls by risk owners 
throughout the business coupled with 
independent challenge of these assertions 
by the Group Risk team. Significant risks, 
their potential impact on the Group’s financial 
position, and the actions taken to manage 
those risks were reviewed regularly during 
the year by the Risk Committee of senior 
executives and by the Committee.
Internal audit
Internal audit and compliance monitoring 
work is carried out respectively by the 
Group’s Internal Audit and Risk Assessment 
and Monitoring departments. The latter also 
provides compliance advice. The heads of 
both departments report to the Group Chief 
Executive and to the Committee. The Group 
has established risk based audit and 
compliance programmes for reviewing 
and evaluating the internal controls 
and compliance procedures used 
in the management of risk.
Assessment
During the year the Committee simultaneously 
reviewed and monitored matters which are 
the regulatory responsibility of the board 
of AUL (on which it reported directly to 
that board) and of the boards of ABL, 
AFU and, since its acquisition, ACI. 
The plc Board receives regular reports 
from the Committee which reviews the 
main processes established and operated 
within the Group. These processes are 
designed to ensure that significant risks are 
identified, evaluated, managed and controlled. 
They also permit the Committee to determine 
whether any significant weaknesses are 
promptly remedied or indicate a need 
for more extensive monitoring. 
The Committee has also performed a 
specific assessment for the purpose of this 
Annual Report. This assessment considers 
all significant aspects of internal control 
arising during the period covered by the 
report, including the work of internal audit. 
The Committee assists the Board in 
discharging its review responsibilities.
The Board has not identified or been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which 
it has determined to be significant during the 
course of its review of the system of internal 
control. However, as the integration of ACI 
into the Amlin Group has progressed it has 
become evident that the standards of risk 
management and internal control within 
that operation are not consistent with 
those operating in the rest of the Group, 
although the Board is confident that 
management’s plans to address 
this situation are appropriate.
The Committee remains satisfied with 
the arrangements by which staff may, in 
confidence and if they wish via an external 
reporting line, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other matters.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Nomination Committee
Appointments and succession
T erms of reference
The Nomination Committee (the Committee), 
which during the year operated as a joint 
committee of the boards of the Company 
and of its UK operating subsidiary, Amlin 
Underwriting Limited (AUL), is responsible for 
identifying, and nominating for the approval 
of the Board, all candidates for Board 
appointment and proposed election or 
re-election to the Board, whether non-executive 
or executive. Since the year end, reflecting 
the expansion of the Group, the Committee 
has reverted to being a committee solely 
of the Board of the Company, with its role 
regarding subsidiaries being to assist the 
Board in its oversight of key senior Group 
appointments and succession planning.
Re-nomination of directors to the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
is considered on a case by case basis before 
recommendations are made. The Committee’s 
terms of reference require it to give full 
consideration to succession planning, both 
in respect of the Board and senior executive 
roles below Board level, taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing the 
Group and what skills and expertise are 
needed in the future. It also recommends to 
the Board the appointment of, and changes 
in, members of the Board’s main Committees. 
No director may participate in any decision 
regarding his or her own position. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available 
in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of 
‘Investor Relations’ on the Company’s website 
or from the Company Secretary on request.
Membership, meetings 
and attendance
The Committee’s membership, number of 
meetings and attendance during the year are 
set out in the ‘Board and Committee meetings 
and attendance’ section of the Board’s 
corporate governance statement.
Activities
During the year the Committee reviewed the 
general structure, size and composition of the 
Board and reaffirmed that the present Board 
balance and the composition of each main 
Board Committee remained appropriate.
Following the appointments as non-executive 
Directors of Mrs Bosse in 2008 and Mr Holt 
in early 2009, and the planned retirement of 
Mr Mylvaganam as a non-executive Director 
at the AGM in May 2009, the Committee 
decided that no further changes to the 
Board were appropriate at present. 
In reviewing the make-up of the non-executive 
members of the Board, the Committee noted 
that out of the present seven non-executive 
Directors including the Chairman, four 
are insurance sector specialists with the 
remaining three bringing wider financial sector 
experience, and that two are from overseas. 
Six have served as non-executives for less 
than six years, with one of the present five 
independent Directors having been first 
appointed to the Board in each of the 
years 2004 to 2008 inclusive. The 
executive members of the Board also bring 
complementary skills and experience to the 
Board. There is also regular , formal and direct 
reporting to the Board by other senior Group 
executives, most frequently from the active 
underwriter of Amlin London, the Chief Risk 
Officer and the Chief Investment Officer . 
In September the Committee concluded 
its regular review of the succession plan 
regarding all senior executive roles in 
the Group. The plans for AFU and Amlin 
Corporate Insurance were included in the 
Committee’s review for the first time. The plan 
continues to identify short term contingencies 
for fulfilling each role at short notice as well as, 
in most cases, one or more potential internal 
candidates as permanent successors. The 
Committee was satisfied that the overall plan 
is well conceived and effectively managed. 
The Committee paid particular attention to 
the few areas where plans for particular roles 
require further development. The Committee 
also discussed the continuing renewal of the 
non-executive directors, considering likely 
retirement dates, Committee succession, 
and the likely timing of future appointments. 
The Committee recommended to the Board 
the nomination at the 2009 AGM of Mrs Bosse, 
Messrs Buchanan, Carpenter , Davey, Hextall, 
Holt and Philipps, and Sir Mark Wrightson, 
all of whom were elected or re-elected by 
shareholders for the usual term of three years. 
No Directors’ terms of office are due to end 
at the 2010 AGM. 
Committee evaluation
The Committee took account of Board 
evaluation conclusions when considering 
nominations for re-election at the 2009 AGM. 
The Committee has also recently conducted 
its own annual self-evaluation, covering its 
terms of reference, composition, procedures, 
contribution and effectiveness. The Committee 
also concluded that it had during 2009 fulfilled 
the duties placed upon it by its terms of 
reference. The conclusions of the Committee 
evaluation were reported to the Board early 
in 2010.
By Order of the Board, on the recommendation 
of the Nomination Committee
C C T Pender Secretary 
26 February 2010
The Nomination Committee is responsible for recommending board appointments and 
considering succession planning, so that the Board, its committees and those ﬁlling other 
senior Group positions comprise executives and non-executives with the appropriate balance 
of experience and qualities to deliver the strategic direction, entrepreneurial leadership, 
values, management, standards and framework of controls that are required for the 
Company’s success.

Board Corporate Governance statement. 
Both the Nomination Committee in making 
its recommendations to the Board, and 
the Committee in its own self-evaluation, 
reviews the Committee’s membership. 
All of the Committee’s members (Messrs 
Buchanan, Davey and Feinstein) have, in the 
Board’s view, recent and relevant financial 
experience. Mr Buchanan, the Committee 
Chairman, is a former senior audit partner 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers, responsible 
before his retirement from the firm for the 
audits of several major UK-based financial 
services organisations. Mr Davey’s banking 
career included service on executive 
management and risk committees as well as 
corporate finance advice to major insurance 
companies. He currently serves on the Audit 
Committee of a major UK building society 
and was also at one time Finance Director of 
an international financial group. Mr Feinstein, 
a former CEO of one of the largest property 
and casualty insurers in the USA, has some 
35 years’ commercial experience of the 
insurance industry. This combination of 
audit, wider financial services and insurance 
executive experience provides, in the 
view of the Board, an appropriate group 
of experienced professionals to fulfil the 
duties of the Committee.
The Chairman of the Company, the Group 
Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director usually attend the Committee’s 
meetings, as do the Chief Risk Officer 
and the Head of Internal Audit and, during 
2009, the Managing Director and Finance 
Director of AUL. 
The Committee received and considered 
detailed papers and information sufficiently 
in advance of its meetings for its 
understanding and monitoring risk, 
including review of the outcomes of the 
‘Own Risks and Solvency Assessment’ 
prepared by the Chief Risk Officer. 
The review recommended not setting 
up a separate Board risk committee on 
the grounds that divorcing committee 
review of risk from that of internal 
control and audit, and potentially 
diluting the Board’s own focus 
on risk, would not be helpful. 
• An explicit authority has been added 
for the Committee to engage its 
own independent external advice 
at the Company’s expense should 
it deem it necessary (previously this 
was implicitly authorised by means 
of the general procedure whereby 
any Director or Directors may obtain 
independent advice if needed). During 
2009 no member of the Committee, 
nor the Committee collectively, found 
it necessary to obtain such separate 
advice beyond the advice that is directly 
provided to the Committee by the 
external auditors.
The Committee’s new terms of reference, 
which continue to take full account of 
the Smith Report on the role of audit 
committees, are available in the ‘Corporate 
Governance’ section of ‘Investor Relations’ 
on the Company’s website or from the 
Company Secretary on request. 
Membership, meetings 
and attendance
The Committee’s membership and number 
of meetings and attendance level during the 
year are set out in the ‘Board and Committee 
membership and attendance’ section of the 
T erms of reference, 
relationship with subsidiaries 
and independent advice
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee (the Committee), which during 
the year operated as a joint committee of the 
boards of the Company and its UK operating 
subsidiary, Amlin Underwriting Limited 
(AUL), are designed to enable it to take an 
independent view of the appropriateness of 
the Group’s: accounting policies, practices 
and reporting; risk management, compliance 
and internal control processes; and internal 
audit process and effectiveness. They also 
place responsibility on the Committee to 
consider the appointment and fees (both 
audit and non-audit) of the external auditors, 
who have unrestricted access to it. Since the 
year end, the terms of reference have been 
reviewed with the following main changes 
adopted in February 2010:
• The previous joint Committee of the 
Company and AUL has been split into 
separate Audit Committees for the 
Company and for AUL (with overlapping 
membership). This recognises that AUL 
is a less dominant operating subsidiary 
than in the past, owing to the Group’s 
expansion, including the acquisition in 
July 2009 of Amlin Corporate Insurance 
N.V. (ACI) which already had its own 
Audit Committee. The Group Finance 
Director is a member of both the AUL 
and ACI Audit Committees alongside 
independent non-executive directors 
(with the membership of the Company’s 
Committee remaining exclusively 
independent non-executives).
• Greater emphasis has now been 
placed on the Committee’s role in 
Independent review
The Audit Committee makes recommendations on the reporting, control, risk management 
and compliance aspects of the Directors’ and the Group’s responsibilities, providing 
independent monitoring, guidance and challenge to executive management in these 
areas. Its aim is to ensure high standards of corporate and regulatory reporting, controls, 
risk management and compliance, in the belief that excellence in these areas enhances 
the effectiveness, and reduces the risks, of the business.
Nigel Buchanan
Committee Chairman
Audit Committee 88
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
In addition, each Interim Management 
Statement of the Company was reviewed 
by the Committee as well as, in its capacity 
as AUL’s Audit Committee, Syndicate 
2001’s Annual Report and Individual Capital 
Assessment (ICA) and AUL’s own accounts.
The Committee reviewed the external 
auditors’ engagement and service plans, 
their independence and the extent and 
reasons for them providing non-audit 
services (a breakdown of the fees for 
which is set out in note 13 to the Accounts). 
A new policy governing the types of 
non-audit services for which the external 
auditors may be appointed was adopted 
by the Committee in early 2010. Reports 
were received from the external auditors 
in respect of each set of financial statements, 
highlighting the material judgmental areas, 
which were then discussed by the 
Committee with the auditors alongside 
the reports from management.
Following the acquisition of ACI, which 
resulted in existing auditor appointments 
being spread between three firms, the 
Committee decided to combine its annual 
review of the external auditors’ effectiveness 
with a review of the Group external auditor 
appointment. Having appraised the attributes 
sought, the Committee conducted a rigorous 
competitive selection process between the 
incumbent (Deloitte LLP) and two other 
firms. Key selection criteria included sector 
expertise and experience, the strengths of 
the firms in all the jurisdictions in which the 
Group now operates, the organisation and 
depth of the teams proposed for Amlin’s 
account and the added value that each firm 
was judged to be likely to be able to provide 
to the organisation as its auditors. The 
Committee Chairman, Mr Buchanan, took 
no part on the selection between the three 
firms, and expressed no opinion between 
them, in recognition of his conflict of interest 
(the potential conflict having previously 
been authorised by the Board before any 
new auditor appointment was envisaged) 
as a recipient of a pension annuity from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
(as a former partner).
The result of the process, as announced 
in September 2009, was that PwC were 
recommended to the Board by the two 
unconflicted members of the Committee 
(Messrs Davey and Feinstein) and were 
subsequently appointed as auditors to 
all Group entities. The Committee was 
grateful to all three firms for responding to 
the challenge of the selection process, and 
particularly to Deloitte who had served the 
Group with diligence and skill since their 
appointment as Group auditors in 2000. 
Those who recommended the appointment 
are confident that the PwC team is well 
placed to assist the Group as it meets the 
challenges of its next period of development. 
Procedures operated throughout the year 
for the approval of any appointments of 
the external auditors (or its associated 
entities) to provide non-audit services. 
The Committee remained satisfied that 
the provision of such non-audit services 
by Deloitte LLP (until September 2009) 
and PwC (since their appointment) has not 
compromised either auditors’ independence.
Risk 
For many years the Committee has had the 
responsibility of reviewing the Group’s risk 
management processes but the extent of 
this involvement deepened materially during 
2009 alongside the further development of 
the Group’s risk management processes 
operated by management as set out 
in the Risk Management section of 
the Annual Report. 
The Chief Risk Officer (and occasionally 
other members of the Risk Assessment 
and Monitoring department as appropriate) 
attended each Committee meeting to report 
on the overall work of the department.
In addition to detailed quarterly reporting by 
the Chief Risk Officer to the Committee, the 
Committee held a special meeting on risk, 
also attended by non-executives who are not 
members of the Committee. Management 
made presentations on risk management, 
its governance and the processes for 
recommending risk appetite and for 
reviewing both existing and 
members to consider them appropriately, 
making suggestions for improvements when 
required. At least once a year the Committee 
meets, both on its own and with the external 
auditors, without any executive management 
present. The Committee also meets privately 
with the Head of Internal Audit, who has 
a private line of communication with the 
Committee Chairman. His executive 
reporting line is to the Group Chief Executive 
and he is both appointed, and may only 
be dismissed, by the Committee.
Activities
The Committee’s activities may be divided 
between its review and decisions relating 
to four interlinked areas: financial reporting 
and external audit; risk; internal control; 
and internal audit. 
Financial reporting 
and external audit
The prime financial reporting focus of the 
Committee during the year was, as ever, 
on the integrity of the Company’s interim and 
preliminary results statements and its Annual 
Report. In addition to the usual consideration 
of the appropriateness of the accounting 
policies being adopted, the Committee 
particularly concentrated on: foreign currency 
translation effects; accounting for acquisitions 
(Amlin France/AFU and, in preparation for the 
2009 Accounts, Amlin Corporate Insurance 
(ACI)); the appropriateness and basis of 
mark-to-market valuations of investments; 
changes in the basis of the Group’s pension 
fund accounting; taxation provisioning; 
and the consistency and robustness of the 
Group’s insurance reserves. On the latter 
both the reserving process and its results 
were reviewed, including comparisons of 
actuarial estimates and actual reserves held, 
and, where necessary, challenged. The 
Committee was satisfied that the significant 
assumptions underlying the reported figures, 
including those relevant to determining fair 
values and to the recoverability of reinsurance 
debt, were justified and that there was 
appropriate and meaningful disclosure of the 
critical judgement and key estimates made, 
which took account of the volatile nature of 
the markets to which the Group is exposed.

emerging risks for the Group. The meeting 
also reviewed the key components of the 
Group’s Dynamic Financial Analysis model, 
which is a key component in setting the 
Group’s risk management framework and 
AUL’s Individual Capital Assessment (the 
latter of which was subsequently approved 
at a later meeting of the Committee).
Internal control
Details of the Committee’s role regarding 
internal control issues are set out in the ‘Board 
internal control statement’ on page 85 within 
the Board Corporate Governance statement. 
Internal audit
The Committee reviewed the plans and 
work undertaken during the year by the 
Group’s Internal Audit department, including 
reports relating to overseas subsidiaries, 
and the consequential actions agreed with 
management. Reporting to the Committee 
includes summaries of the findings of all 
internal audit reports, enabling members 
of the Committee to question the Head of 
Internal Audit on any report. The Committee 
closely scrutinised management’s progress 
in addressing the relevant issues, challenging 
management to move more quickly when 
it considered it appropriate. During the year 
the Committee has been mindful of the 
need to ensure that internal audit focus is 
aligned with the areas of greatest risk facing 
the Group, and further development of such 
alignment is planned for 2010. 
The Committee also monitored the 
Group’s compliance with the Financial 
Services Authority, Lloyd’s and 
other regulatory requirements and 
recommendations, and reviewed the 
Group’s ‘whistle blowing’ procedures 
(under which no matters were raised by 
staff during the year). 
Committee evaluation and reporting
During the year the Committee conducted 
a self-evaluation of its terms of reference, 
composition, procedures, contribution and 
effectiveness. The Committee concluded 
that during 2009 it had received sufficient, 
reliable, and timely information from 
management to enable it to fulfil its 
responsibilities and that it had fulfilled the 
duties placed upon it by its terms of reference. 
The Committee also concluded that it had 
during 2009 fulfilled the duties placed upon  
it by its terms of reference. These and other 
more detailed conclusions of its evaluation 
were agreed and reported to the Board early 
in 2010 at the same time as the amendments 
to its terms of reference mentioned at the 
start of this report were approved. 
The Committee has been actively involved 
in the preparation of this report.

recommendation of the Audit Committee

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Investor relations
At the start of the year we appointed 
Financial Dynamics as Investor Relations 
advisers to assist with Amlin’s Investor 
Relations strategy. Among other services, 
Financial Dynamics provides detailed pre 
and post meeting feedback from equity 
analysts on the issues analysts perceive 
as relevant to Amlin, as well as broader 
commentary on market sentiment and 
trends. These reports are used to inform 
Amlin’s communications with the stock 
market and ensure that relevant issues 
and concerns raised by analysts are 
addressed. We also actively seek feedback 
from institutional investors both informally 
on a direct basis and through formal reviews 
conducted by Financial Dynamics and RBS 
Hoare Govett, Amlin’s stockbroker. These 
reviews are made available to the Board.
Shareholder proﬁle
Amlin’s current institutional shareholder base 
is high quality, with a substantial proportion 
of shares held by supportive long-term 
institutional investors. As shown in the chart 
on the next page, the proportion owned by 
US institutions is around 15% compared 
with about 12% for the UK market as a 
whole. The proportion held by continental 
European investors is around 5%, which 
is in line with the UK market as a whole.
At the year end an estimated 1.1% of the 
Company was owned by directors and staff 
(2008: 1.4%), including shares held on their 
behalf by trustees of the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust and the Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP). An estimated 15% (2008: 17%) 
of Group employees (excluding the new 
ACI employees) were shareholders and 
84% including ACI (2008: 84%) held shares 
through the SIP at the year end. Excluding 
the SIP , 41% (2008: 61%) of staff had 
outstanding options or conditional share 
awards under one or more of the company’s 
share plans at the year end. Reductions 
in most of these percentages reflect the 
lower participation in most categories of the 
employees of ACI, which joined the Group 
during the year. They comprised 32% of 
year end Group employees. 
Sector proﬁle
The two principal stock market indices of 
which Amlin shares were a constituent over 
the last five years are the FTSE350 index and 
the FTSE All Share Non-Life Insurance index. 
As shown in the chart opposite, the total 
shareholder return generated by Amlin has 
outperformed both these indices in the past 
five years. 
On 22 December 2008 Amlin’s shares 
entered the FTSE100 index for the first 
time. However, the shares dropped 
out of the FTSE100 index and rejoined 
the FTSE350 index on 22 June 2009. 
This short-lived sojourn in the FTSE100 
index reflected the volatility of the UK 
equity market at the end of 2008 and 
in the first few months of 2009. 
At the year end Amlin was ranked 
116 in the FTSE350 index by market 
capitalisation (2008: 93). The average 
volume of shares traded daily on the 
London Stock Exchange was 2.1 million 
or 0.42% of total shares, compared with 
a daily average of 3.0 million or 0.63% 
in 2008.
Amlin’s continued growth, record of out 
performance and its entry into the FTSE100 
index for six months from December 2008, 
have all contributed to increasing interest 
in Amlin from investors and equity analysts. 
At the start of 2009 we recruited a full time 
Investor Relations specialist to assist the 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
in managing this interest and to ensure 
that Amlin communicates effectively 
with its investors and the wider 
investment community.
During the year we instituted various 
initiatives to facilitate further broadening 
of Amlin’s shareholder base among 
appropriate target investors and maintain 
positive engagement with existing investors. 
These include a sophisticated investor 
database and the identification of target 
investors in both the UK and the US. We 
continued proactive communication with 
existing and targeted investors through 171 
meetings between investors and the Chief 
Executive and/or Group Finance Director 
during the year (2008: 178). 
In addition to presentations following the 
Preliminary and Interim results, we gave 
presentations to analysts and investors 
on the subjects of Amlin’s Approach to 
Solvency II and Amlin Corporate Insurance. 
These presentations are webcast, so that all 
investors can access them simultaneously, 
and slide presentations are also made available 
on Amlin’s website. We also hosted two 
receptions for analysts and investors attended 
by senior Amlin managers and underwriters. 
Research coverage expanded during the year 
with the number of equity analysts actively 
covering Amlin increasing from 11 to 18. 
Engaging with shareholders
We aim to:
•  Be open, transparent and accessible in communications about our business and its performance, so that 
investors and other stakeholders can make informed judgements about the company
•  T ake account of shareholder views on our business and strategy
•  Communicate with our investors and the wider investment community in the most appropriate and 
effective manner.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
scientific research into the natural hazards 
most relevant to our business. 
Amlin specifically funds the Forecasting 
Group, whose research into probabilities 
of extreme weather events relates directly to 
our underwriting business. A major research 
output this year was a study from Jim Elsner 
of Florida State University on the conditions 
present in the years of multiple hurricane 
formation or clustering. The study examines 
the records of surface sea temperature, sun 
spot activity, La Niña and their correlation 
with severe frequency hurricane formation. 
For the next study we have recommended 
European windstorm as a subject, linking 
academic and commercial advances in 
catastrophe risk analysis. Another study 
by Bob Hart, also of Florida State University, 
is using the tropical cyclone track data and 
re-analysis of the global atmosphere to 
create two tools. The first is a system that 
tracks landfall probability depending on the 
storm location and the second focuses on 
the climate of the winter season following 
a hurricane season. 
RPI research is regularly published and 
peer reviewed in prestigious journals and 
director T ony Knap shares this work with 
insurance industry bodies such as the 
Geneva Association. 
Amlin’s Chief Risk Officer was a panellist 
at the 2009 Global Insurance Summit in 
Zurich. Our Catastrophe Modelling manager 
is participating in a new Climatewise 
Collaboration to explore what insurers 
can do in the short term to respond to the 
long-term step-changes in weather patterns.
2009 saw the launch of two insurance-
linked securities funds from our joint 
venture fund manager, Leadenhall Capital 
Partners. Amlin’s involvement in this capital 
markets venture enables us to maintain 
an active involvement in developing 
risk transfer mechanisms for insurance 
risk. It is possible that instruments such 
as catastrophe bonds could be used 
more widely to transfer weather-related 
catastrophe risk for insurers, companies 
and even government or neo-governmental 
organisations. Amlin will play a role in 
the development of such solutions for 
institutions requiring catastrophe insurance.
2: Inform public policy making
As a leading capital provider and underwriting 
insurer in the Lloyd’s Market, Amlin supports 
the actions of the Corporation’s management 
in keeping climate change high on the public 
policy agenda. Lloyd’s is engaged with the 
finance group of the London Climate Change 
Partnership (Greater London Authority) and 
has lobbied MEPs in Strasbourg on ABI 
or CEA initiatives.
In 2009, Amlin was a signatory to the 
Copenhagen Communiqué on Climate 
Change and supported the Prince of Wales’ 
Rainforest Project.
3:  Support climate awareness 
amongst customers
Amlin underwrites catastrophe schemes 
and reinsurance in developed and third world 
regions. We believe our role is to provide key 
recovery services and we initiated a payment 
on account scheme with key brokers to 
provide fast settlement in the wake of major 
catastrophe events. This was made possible 
by the modelling capability developed by 
Amlin over several years and we work closely 
with reinsurance brokers to ensure that 
clients have the most up-to-date modelling 
and assessment of their risk. 
We continue to improve the quality and 
transparency of our corporate reporting. 
In 2009 we received the ICSA Hermes 
award for Innovation in Governance 
Reporting (FTSE250 category). Previously 
we have won PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Building Public Trust Awards in the 
following categories: FTSE250 
T elling It How It is, People and 
Remuneration reporting.
In this review we summarise our corporate 
responsibility activity under the four key 
pillars: Environment, Marketplace, 
Employees and Community.
Environment
Amlin is a recognised leader of catastrophe 
insurance and reinsurance and we estimate 
that some 35-40% of all global insured 
property risks are affected by climate 
change. The risks and opportunities 
presented by climate change are considered 
and evaluated by the Climate Change and 
Environmental Panel, composed of senior 
underwriters and chaired by the Chief Risk 
Officer, which meets on a quarterly basis. 
The Panel also reviews Amlin’s initiatives 
in support of the six key principles from the 
ClimateWise organisation, a collaborative 
insurance group of which Amlin was a 
founder signatory. The six principles 
are as follows:
1: Lead in risk analysis
Amlin’s leadership position in catastrophe 
(re)insurance is supported by a strong 
analytical underwriting stance, backed 
up by research. In 2009, we continued as 
one of eleven industry sponsors of the Risk 
Prediction Initiative (RPI), with the dual aim of 
enhancing our knowledge while encouraging 
Corporate responsibility
Underpinning all our actions
Amlin is committed to building a sustainable business through the consistent application of 
our values in relationships with our shareholders, employees, clients and other stakeholders. 
We aim to make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate, placing 
integrity and professional excellence at the heart of our business practice.

1. Overview 03
2. Strategy 15
3. Performance 25
4. Governance 73
5. Financial statements 113
6. Shareholder information 201
Amlin UK has invested in the latest Mapflow 
technology to enable underwriters to analyse 
UK flood risk probability and thus provide 
clients with the optimum cover for their 
commercial property.
Amlin is interested in developing 
commercial insurance policies to protect 
new technologies that tackle climate 
change. We insure European wind farms 
and solar energy capture and we can offer 
a green repair or reinstatement option on 
selected UK property products. We have 
also developed specialist insurance for the 
recycling and waste reprocessing industries 
and the transport of hazardous chemicals. 
Amlin also provides marine liability insurance 
against accidental pollution during transport 
of materials to recycling or disposal sites 
between ports within Europe.
Amlin is keen to engage with the insurance 
market in the design and delivery of solutions 
for the developing world for protection 
against severe weather-related disasters. 
Our reinsurance underwriting teams are 
able to consider risk transfer mechanisms 
such as catastrophe pools and we have 
instigated a discussion with Lloyd’s and 
the UK Department for International 
Development (DFID) to consider where 
our capital markets expertise may be of 
use in assisting developing countries to 
deal with the potential for severe disruption 
from catastrophic events. As well as making 
investments through Leadenhall Capital 
Partners managed funds, we have also 
invested in catastrophe bonds through the 
purchase by Syndicate 2001 of Mexican 
earthquake and windstorm bonds during 
the year.
4:  Incorporate climate change 
into investment strategy
Amlin has a policy of carefully selecting asset 
classes for investment but outsources the 
majority of specific investment management 
decisions to a panel of investment managers. 
The majority of assets are allocated to cash 
or fixed income investments, although 
there is a small equity content as well. 
The fund managers selected to manage 
a segregated portfolio must sign an 
Investment Management Agreement (IMA) 
which contains the following responsible 
investment clause: 
“Amlin encourages the Manager, taking due 
account of the investment objectives that 
have been set by Amlin for the Manager, to: 
• incorporate environmental, social 
and corporate governance issues 
into its investment analysis and 
decision-making processes;
• encourage high standards of performance 
on environmental, social and corporate 
governance issues as an integral part of its 
engagement/dialogue and voting activities;
• seek appropriate disclosure on 
environmental, social and corporate 
governance issues by the entities in 
which it invests;
• promote responsible investment across 
the investment industry, and to work with 
other in achieving this goal; and
• report to Amlin on an annual basis on 
its responsible investment activities, in 
particular the four points above. This will 
be delivered to Amlin in an electronic 
format as specified by Amlin, within at 
least 10 business days from the year end.”
Where Amlin invests in pooled funds, which 
does not require an IMA to be entered into, 
Amlin establishes the firm’s SRI philosophy 
by reviewing the documentation around 
such policies. 
T aube Hodson Stonex, our equity fund 
manager, with close to £200 million of Amlin 
funds under management at year end, 
has a clear interest in environmental issues. 
Specific investments of our assets with a 
Clean Energy theme include nuclear utility 
companies EDF and Exelon, solar energy 
through Q-Cells and Orkla’s subsidiary 
Renewable Energy Corporation.
We have also engaged with our pension 
trustees on the adoption of a similar 
SRI approach.
5:  Reduce the environmental 
impact of our business
In last year’s Annual Report, we undertook 
to measure the carbon footprint of Group 
companies over which financial control 
was exercised and results published in 2008. 
Data collection and analysis using GHG and 
Defra protocols was included in our Carbon 
Disclosure Project submission.
For completeness, we elected to include 
employee commuting (determined by a 
survey which generated a 66% response), 
waste/recycling and water usage. These 
are generally included in FTSE company 
environmental audits but somewhat 
illogically not included in CO
2
 footprint 
calculations. Amlin’s total CO
2
 per employee 
was 6.19 tonnes inclusive of these factors, 
or 5.42 tonnes if compared with the scope 
of most FTSE calculations. This is within 
the estimated average CO
2
 range for a UK 
financial services company of between 
5.0 and 5.5 tonnes per employee.
Air travel and electricity usage are Amlin’s 
greatest CO
2
 impacts. Since we added 
512 new employees and six new offices 
to the Group during 2009, we are not yet in 
a position to set travel reduction targets for 
the Group as a whole. However, we propose 
to compare the 2009 carbon footprint of 
our existing business to that for 2008, with 
a view to reducing our impact over time.
In late 2009 we leased additional office 
space in our St. Helen’s headquarters 
and are taking this opportunity to install 
sensor lighting and video conferencing 
facilities on both the new and existing 
floors. We regularly review the direct 
environmental impact areas under our 
control to reduce waste and energy 
usage and maximise recycling.
6: Report and be accountable
In July we engaged Deloitte LLP to carry out 
limited assurance on the compilation of our 
2008 carbon footprint in accordance with 
the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000. The independent 
assurance statement, together with the 
basis of reporting and results summary 
is published on our website. Similarly our 
Carbon Disclosure Project and Climatewise 
submissions are available online.
Amlin has been a member of the 
FTSE4Good Index since 2003, a clear 
indicator that the company is recognised 
for its approach to corporate responsibility.
For the first time, the ClimateWise Managing 
Committee commissioned Forum for the 
Future to carry out an independent review 
of the 2009 reports. Amlin was commended 
for our strong governance, clarity on risk 
analysis and commitment to engaging  94
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
employees in environmental sustainability. 
Amlin was selected as a best practice case 
study for the ClimateWise annual report.
Marketplace
Broker relationships
Amlin accesses business through a wide 
range of brokers and intermediaries 
(see page 8 table). The diversity of our 
businesses, providing a full spectrum of 
commercial and specialist insurance and 
reinsurance, means our client base is 
similarly diverse, ranging from large global 
brokers, through regional brokers and local 
intermediaries to some direct customers. 
Client relationship management is discussed 
in the divisional business reviews on pages 
26 to 45.
Service quality 
Amlin’s Vision for a second fi ve-year term to 
2014 continues “to be the global reference 
for quality in our markets” and we aim to 
provide excellence client service from risk 
placement to claims payment. We focus 
on retaining business over the long term 
and on building strong relationships with 
both brokers and insureds. Our depth of 
knowledge of the insureds’ business allows 
us to respond effectively in the event of a 
claim or endorsement as illustrated in the 
case study on page 31.
Gracechurch Consulting, an independent 
research fi rm, conducts regular research 
into claims performance in the London 
Market. Having been ranked second for 
our overall 2009 claims performance, 
we are participating in their quarterly 
Claims Performance Monitor for 2010.
We are committed to providing an excellent 
claims service, resolving and paying 
valid claims as quickly as viable given 
the complexity of some of the risks we 
underwrite. In our Bermuda reinsurance 
division for example, the service level 
standard for payment of claims is ten 
business days and during the last quarter 
of 2009, the division took just eight business 
days from receipt of the valid claims request 
to payment being received by the broker. 
Amlin also operates in the SME market, 
notably in the UK and France, and in niche 
businesses such as yacht and pleasurecraft, 
bloodstock and livestock. As part of our 
commitment to treating customers fairly, 
we conduct regular client satisfaction 
surveys among 5,000 (20%) of direct 
customers of our two yacht brands, Haven 
Knox-Johnston and St. Margarets. In 2009, 
our call handling and documentation was 
rated good or very good by 98% of Haven 
(2008: 98%) and 99% of St. Margarets 
(2008: 95%) customers. Claims service 
was similarly rated by 89% of Haven 
(2008: 100%) and 97% (2008: 93%) 
of St. Margarets customers.
Nonetheless, on rare occasions we do 
receive complaints which are handled 
in line with procedures which are FSA 
compliant in the UK and compliant with 
local regulations elsewhere. 
Amlin Underwriting Limited operates a 
client complaints policy with procedures 
for reporting, investigating and responding 
to complaints relating to all business placed 
with Syndicate 2001. Complaints are logged 
centrally, their resolution is monitored and 
their nature and frequency are reported 
to relevant boards. 
Of the 87 complaints received in 2009 
or brought forward (2008: 96), 33% were 
settled within 4 weeks, 17% within 4 to 8 
weeks, 30% in more than 8 weeks and 20% 
(17) remained outstanding at the year end 
(2008: 16). It is important however to put this 
data into perspective; for example, Amlin’s 
yacht division , which accounted for 13 of 
the 87 complaints received, managed 29,321 
policyholders during 2009. 
Amlin Bermuda received no complaints 
and Anglo French Underwriters received 4 
complaints during 2009. Amlin Corporate 
Insurance in the Netherlands received 11 
complaints, 4 of which are outstanding 
and in Belgium ACI received 10 of which 
2 remain outstanding. 
Developing our business
Having established international operations 
in Singapore, Amlin continues to engage 
with the Lloyd’s worldwide markets team 
as they investigate potential new markets, 
most recently in Brazil, Russia and the Middle 
East. However, our 2009 acquisition of Amlin 
Corporate Insurance has provided a solid 
continental European platform for growth and 
we are focused on ensuring the successful 
integration and development of this region. 
Amlin remains one of the largest participants 
in the Lloyd’s market and 75% of our 
2009 gross written premium (2008: 88%) 
was written through Lloyd’s. We seek to 
contribute positively to all aspects of the 
Lloyd’s community, including the sound 
governance and operation of the market,

so that it remains attractive to brokers 
and clients for the placement of their risks.
Amlin professionals continue to work with 
the Lloyd’s market associations to drive 
forward market reform technologies, both 
as pilot (Claims Transformation Programme) 
or early adopter (Lloyd’s Exchange) and 
by encouraging our peers and broker 
counterparties to use them. Specifi cally, 
our Group Finance Director is a board 
member of the Lloyd’s Market Association. 
Amlin representatives served on the Lloyd’s 
Claims Service Review Board and many of 
its committees, including those for Marine, 
Motor, US Casualty Reinsurance, Aviation, 
Finance and Risk.
Amlin helps to fund the Lloyd’s 360º Risk 
Insight programme which explores business 
risk and opportunities at a macro-level. 
In May 2009 it published a joint study 
with the International Institute of Strategic 
Studies on the potential impact of climate 
change on global security, with the subject 
further debated at November conferences 
in London and New Y ork, organised in 
collaboration with NATO. Other subjects 
explored in 2009 included piracy in the 
Gulf of Aden, cyber-terrorism and cyber-
crime and the political risk potential of 
the economic downturn.
Lloyd’s also joined the consortium funding 
the super computer managed by the Centre 
for Earth System Intelligence at Hartree 
which will improve forecasting of weather 
and catastrophe claims. Lloyd’s also 
participated in the IBM Global Innovation 
Outlook meeting on water; sponsored the 
second Catastrophe Modelling Forum and 
funded two PhDs at the London School of 
Economics on global climate model output 
and its use in the insurance industry.
The Insurance Intellectual Capital Initiative 
(IICI) is a new consortium of organisations 
associated with the Lloyd’s insurance market 
which are working together to stimulate and 
fund research into areas of interest to the 
broader insurance industry and build closer 
links with the academic community. Amlin 
has committed £25,000 per annum for three 
years, together with Hiscox, Aon Benfi eld, 
Liberty, Lloyd’s Tercentenary Foundation, 
the Society of Lloyd’s and the Worshipful 
Company of Insurers. Our Chief Risk Offi cer 
is a member of the Steering Group.
The fi rst project is an ethnographic study 
of the London and Bermuda insurance 
markets, conducted by Professor Paula 
Jarzabkowski of Aston University and 
part-funded by the Economic and Social 
Research Council. It began in July 2009 
with interviews and observation of Amlin’s 
reinsurance team and selected peers at the 
Lloyd’s box. The project aims to compare 
the basis of trading and the implications for 
future evolution of the specialist insurance 
market in London and Bermuda.
The IICI is commissioning an academic 
institution to undertake a second study, 
which will look at the challenges and 
practical approaches to measuring the 
risk associated with exposure to large 
commercial losses in situations where 
historical data is limited. This project 
will be supported and part-funded by the 
Natural Environment Research Council 
and the Technology Strategy Board.
Having successfully completed his term as 
President of the Insurance Institute of London 
in October 2009, Amlin’s Chief Executive 
Charles Philipps was invited to join the new 
Insurance Profession T ask Force set up by the 
Chartered Institute of Insurers with the primary 
aim of raising standards of professionalism and 
transparency within the insurance industry.
Employees
Amlin’s Vision includes being recognised 
as “the place to work”, with staff who 
understand our strategy and their role 
in delivering and exceeding our goals. 
An important element in achieving this is 
being a responsible employer, operating fi rst 
class employment practices and engaging 
with our employees. 
The 2009 acquisition of Amlin Corporate 
Insurance increased employee numbers 
by over 50% and presented us with new 
challenges in relation to European working 
practices, languages and the need to build 
a new Human Resources team in Belgium 
to replace services previously provided by 
the Fortis Group. Over the second half of the 
year, signifi cant progress has been made in 
aligning ACI’s employee offering with that 
of the remainder of the Amlin Group.
Amlin’s strong culture and values proved 
an important factor in attracting ACI’s 
staff to join a group with little brand profi le 
in their local markets. This strength was 
demonstrated in the results of the 2009 Ipsos 
MORI employee survey, conducted prior 
to the acquisition of ACI, which delivered 
80% job satisfaction, 78% trust in the senior 
leadership team and 85% agreeing the latter 
Our core values
Professional excellence

We are fair and honest and we deliver on our commitments.
Leadership
We take clear and considered views of the future. We communicate our objectives and 
empower our team to achieve them.
Superior performance
We seek to excel in both the levels of service and the results we achieve.
T eamwork
We work together to deliver excellent performance, taking responsibility, holding ourselves 
accountable and respecting the contribution of others. We communicate effectively and 
give each other the space to do the job.

We take a measured approach in our business strategy and in our acceptance and 
management of risk to secure the long-term viability of the business. 96
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
have a clear vision of where the company is 
going.
The majority (92%) of employees 
understand the need for change and 
71% feel the pace of change is ‘about 
right’. While this is significantly higher 
than the Ipsos MORI financial norm of 
37%, we appreciate the need to continue 
to communicate the benefits of change 
effectively across the enlarged Group. 
Currently, 73% of staff feel well informed 
about what is happening within Amlin and 
85% feel the information they receive is 
credible, in line with the T op 10 norm.
ACI employees are represented by a Works 
Council and Amlin’s UK employees by a 
Consultation Forum. Since the Group’s 
combined workforce now exceeds 1,000 
in more than four European countries, we 
will be examining options for a Group-wide 
employee representative group.
Amlin seeks to align employee interests 
further by awarding share options to all 
eligible employees under the Share Incentive 
Plan. The 2009 award means that those 
employed since the middle of 2007 now 
have a stake in the Company equity valued 
in excess of £10,000 at 31 December 2009.
We offer sabbaticals of up to six months to 
employees with more than ten years’ service. 
This opportunity for more extended family 
time, travel or other life-enhancing activities 
proved popular again in 2009, with 10 staff 
(2008: 16) taking sabbatical leave.
The good conduct of employees in their 
management of business relationships 
and with colleagues is critical to creating 
pride in the Company and to our aspiration 
to be a socially responsible company. We 
also believe that initiatives creating a better 
work/life balance are directly beneficial 
to the Group by improving efficiency and 
morale. Amlin’s core corporate values are 
an important part of the Code of Conduct 
(available on our website) to which all 
employees are expected to adhere.
Community
UK
Amlin’s UK charity and community activities 
are guided and facilitated by a panel, chaired 
by the Group Finance Director, which meets 
at least quarterly and comprises senior 
representatives from each UK business area.
In 2009, the Charity and Community Panel 
launched a new initiative called Community 
Action Learning, which we believe is unique 
within the Lloyd’s market. We were keen to 
advance Amlin’s corporate responsibility 
from fundraising challenges to providing 
practical support and engagement within 
a community that would present challenges 
of a different kind. The feedback presentation 
and video clearly demonstrated that the 
objectives for all parties had been achieved 
and the Panel agreed to a repeat programme 
in 2010.
We retained Macmillan Cancer Support as 
our UK corporate charity in 2009, and our 
£15,000 corporate donation, together with 
over £20,000 of staff fundraising, contributed 
to Macmillan Grants for patients in the 
London area. From 2010, we resume our 
support of a Palliative Care Clinical Nurse 
Specialist at Imperial College Healthcare on 
the basis that, once the fixed term expires, 
the post will be funded by the NHS Trust.
Amlin UK, based in Chelmsford, retained 
local charity Farleigh Hospice as their 
partner for 2009, adding over £15,000 
of staff fundraising to a corporate donation 
of £3,000. Following a review and greater 
publicity of our matched funding policy, 
2009 saw an increased number of staff 
participating in charity fundraising activities. 
Each panel member has a separate budget 
for their business unit, which has led to a 
broader range of charities being supported 
over the year.
We again donated £3,500 to the Lloyd’s 
Community Programme, under whose 
auspices we again ran a personal 
effectiveness programme for the National 
Skills Academy and undertook a gardening 
challenge at a sheltered housing scheme 
for the elderly, both in T ower Hamlets.
Bermuda
Philanthropy is an important part of 
corporate life in Bermuda and, despite 
having only 32 staff, Amlin Bermuda plays 
an active role in the local community. Having 
established that their colleagues wished 
to support organisations involved in youth, 
education and sport, the charity committee 
developed multi-year strategic partnerships 
with three charitable organisations – 
WindReach, Y outhNet and the Y outh Athletic 
Organisation – each of which was allocated 
US$20,000 in 2009.
The balance of the US$100,000 charity 
budget was donated to the School for 
the Performing Arts, to fund a school 
programme, and to the Bermuda Autism 
Support and Education Society, to fund a 
Board Certified Behavioural Analyst. Amlin 
Bermuda also sponsored two charitable 
events in 2009; the Physical Abuse Centre 
30th anniversary Gala Dinner and Troika, 
a youth event. On 2nd October, all ABL 
staff participated in an office volunteer day 
at WindReach, an organisation that exists 
to enrich the quality of life for people with 
special needs. The day involved helping 
WindReach prepare for its harvest festival. 
Activities included painting the camping 
and playground equipment and giving the 
sensory/nature trail a facelift. It was an 
enriching experience for all who participated.
Amlin Bermuda continued to work with 
the Association of Bermuda International 
Companies Education Awards (ABICEA) 
donating a total of US$45,000 to two-
year college sponsorships for Bermudian 
nationals. Several Amlin employees were 
themselves scholarship recipients and 
participate in the mentoring programme. 
Amlin Bermuda’s Managing Director 
continues to be a committee member 
for ABICEA and a BFIS Advisory Trustee.
Singapore
Amlin Singapore continued its support 
of the General Insurance Association’s 
Global Internship Programme and provided 
speakers for the Association’s T alent 
Outreach Project.
Europe
Neither Amlin Corporate Insurance nor 
Anglo French Underwriters has a formal 
charity and community policy, although 
the former previously participated in charity 
fundraising through the Fortis Foundation. 
We have advised them that the Amlin 
Group is supportive of corporate social 
responsibility initiatives in local markets and 
both divisions are formulating plans for 2010.

During the summer of 2009, twelve managers participated in Amlin’s 
fi rst Community Action Learning project at Newlands Bishop Farm, 
near Solihull. The Farm is run as a commercial enterprise and 
enables people with learning diffi culties, known as ‘project workers’, 
to gain valuable skills including woodwork and horticulture. They 
then employ those skills by working in the local community, thus 
generating some £200,000 annual income for the centre.
The Amlin team was presented with three challenges to be completed 
over three days to: erect a shelter by the vegetable garden including 
storage for tools; design a rainwater collection and irrigation system 
and create a farm shop from a derelict building. Existing skills in 
project planning and teamworking combined with a real camaraderie 
with the project workers and some very hard work to successfully 
complete the project on time. 
This project provided a novel and valuable development opportunity 
which really benefi ted our community partner and is, we believe, 
unique among our London market peer group. There was no 
mistaking the enthusiasm and sense of achievement refl ected 
in the project video presented to the Charity and Community 
Panel, the project sponsors, and we look forward to returning 
with a second team of volunteer managers in 2010. 
Developing potential together
Focus on the community

“Everyone at Newlands Bishop Farm, and the project workers in 
particular, really enjoyed having (the Amlin team) at the Farm and 
helping make their place of work even better. The work that was 
done by the group was of a very high standard and will be there for a 
long time to come. It is always beneﬁ cial to have large organisations 
work alongside us and we would very much welcome any future 
involvement with Amlin.” 
– Centre Manager, Newlands Bishop Farm 
“A fantastic and worthwhile experience that provided the opportunity 
to put into practice the time management, teamworking and problem 
solving skills acquired in previous development programmes. The Farm 
itself is something rather special and I am proud to have been involved 
with the project.” 
– Deputy Claims Manager, Amlin UK

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Driving performance 
Amlin’s remuneration policies are designed to support its vision and 
strategic objectives, speciﬁcally:
•  T o secure the maximum possible alignment between the interests and long-term 
career development of executive directors and other senior employees with the 
ambitions of the Company and the creation of value for its shareholders.
•  T o have ﬁrst class employment practices, contributing to Amlin being “the place 
to work” for high quality people in its sector. This requires levels and structures 
of remuneration that are appropriate to attract, retain, incentivise and reward 
the high calibre talent that is required for the success of the Company.
•  T o reward management focus both on immediate ﬁnancial measures, such as 
return on equity and underwriting returns, and on longer-term objectives such as 
underwriting cycle management and the long-term sustainability of the business.
Directors’ Remuneration report
Executive remuneration structure  
in 2009
The present structure of the various 
elements of senior executive remuneration, 
distinguishing between directors who are 
underwriters and those who are not, is 
summarised in the chart below. Senior 
executives participate in a Long T erm 
Incentive Plan measured over a three year 
performance period (the L TIP) and through one 
of two other long-term plans with the potential 
to earn significant rewards by reference 
to five year performance periods, thereby 
incentivising the longer-term sustainability 
of the business (the Capital Builder Plan for 
underwriters and the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) for non-underwriters).
The splits of remuneration of each current 
executive director in 2008 and 2009 is 
summarised in the chart on the opposite 
page. These include amounts paid (or due 
at the year end) in the annual performance 
reward category but not long term incentive 
plan payments or awards. The splits 
between fixed and annual performance 
payments show that a significant proportion 
of directors’ remuneration in respect of 
both years was performance related and 
that the annual performance rewards for 
non-underwriters increased in 2009 as a 
result of the materially higher returns in 
2009 compared with the previous year. 
Underwriters’ performance related annual 
rewards are similarly increased, principally 
as a result of the closure of a very profitable 
2007 underwriting year. The splits between 
the categories of reward, together with the 
longer-term performance rewards described 
later in this report, reflect the Committee’s 
objective of aligning management and 
shareholders’ interests.
 Further details of each element of the above 
components of 2009 remuneration are set 
out in later sections of this report.
Overview
Core values
The Remuneration Committee of 
independent non-executive directors is 
responsible for ensuring that the Group’s 
vision and strategy are supported by its 
remuneration policies and practices. It 
seeks to perform its role consistently with 
Amlin’s stated core values, which include:
• Integrity (independence, objectivity);
• Professional excellence (proper 
process and governance, on the basis 
of full information and professional 
advice); and
• Leadership (being aware of market 
trends, but shaping Amlin’s policies 
to its own specific needs).

External background
2009 has been a year of public focus on 
senior executive remuneration like no other. 
Not surprisingly, the greatest focus has 
been on the banks but, to varying degrees, 
stakeholders, regulators and commentators 
have also directed some of their concerns 
and proposed prescriptions to the wider 
financial services industry and to listed 
companies generally. During the year the 
Committee has monitored the developing 
debate and the various proposals made, 
including those by the Financial Services 
Authority, the Walker Report on banking and 
the Financial Reporting Council in its revised 
Governance Code proposals published 
in December. Some of the new principles 
and proposals, if adopted in their present 
form, will explicitly apply to Amlin (i.e. the 
new Governance Code) but many are 
more narrowly directed at banks and major 
financial institutions (Amlin has a material 
presence in the general (non-life) insurance 
industry but is not considered to be a “major 
financial institution”). The Committee’s 
approach regarding proposals that may 
not strictly apply to Amlin is to consider the 
analysis behind each such new principle 
or proposal on its merits and to decide the 
extent to which it is either already followed 
by Amlin or, if not, ought to be applied or 
taken into account in order to support the 
Company’s remuneration or wider objectives. 
With both the Governance Code proposals 
and the final Walker Report only having been 
published at the end of the year, and the 
former still not definite until later in 2010, this 
process of assessment and review continues 
as at the date of this report. 
Committee internal review in 2009
In parallel with these considerations spurred 
by external developments, the Committee 
has during the year reviewed a number of 
aspects of the Company’s remuneration 
structures, seeking to ensure that they 
continue to support the strategic objectives 
of the Company and, almost as importantly, 
that stated remuneration objectives are 
in practice being delivered. The two main 
focuses of review to date have been on the 
underwriters’ annual incentive arrangement 
(the Profit Commission scheme) and on 
the levels of senior non-underwriters’ total 
remuneration, particularly in the event of top 
quartile performance.
Underwriters
The underwriters’ Profit Commission 
scheme has many merits and has been 
a significant factor in incentivising upper 
quartile performance and retaining key 
talent, over a long period of time. Despite it 
being an annual scheme, rewards are based 
on assessments of liabilities, and hence 
underwriting profits, struck between two 
and three years after business is written, 
by which time much of the uncertainty over 
the level of those liabilities has reduced. 
Payments to participants are hence adjusted 
upwards or downwards as claims mature. 
This provides a strong incentive for business 
to be written with long-term merit rather 
than with inappropriate risk/reward ratios 
which may only be exposed by the passage 
of time. In common with all the Company’s 
other incentive schemes, its Rules include 
discretion to withhold payment in the event 
of non-compliance with standards required 
by the Company or a participant causing 
reputational damage to the business. 
However, the Committee has identified a 
number of aspects of the scheme that may 
benefit from reform. During the year the 
Committee made progress in designing 
changes to the scheme and expects to be 
able to resolve the outstanding issues in time 
for a reformed package to be implemented 
for 2011. This will combine maintenance of 
the present positive aspects of the scheme 
with the improvements designed to better 
align rewards with risk and to recognise 
behaviours that contribute towards the 
achievement of non-financial objectives 
that complement the essential focus of 
underwriters on underwriting returns.
Non-underwriters
Whilst the Committee believes that it has 
been successful in the case of underwriters 
in ensuring that top quartile financial 
performance results in top quartile rewards, 
it has become concerned, on the basis 
of both its own assessment and external 
advice from its independent advisers 
Hewitt New Bridge Street, that this has not 
been the case for senior non-underwriters, 
including the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director. The Committee first 
reviewed and re-affirmed its policy, stated 
in previous editions of this report, that:
“ In determining individuals’ remuneration, 
the Group has regard to their performance 
in the role, job evaluation of the role and 
remuneration statistics for the non-life 
insurance sector in which the Group 
operates and, where applicable for certain 
roles, wider remuneration statistics. Across 
all categories of staff, including executive

directors, the Group’s policy is to have 
regard to market or peer group median 
salaries for the role, with the potential for 
top quartile remuneration for top quartile 
performance. This policy aims to encourage 
and reward superior rather than merely 
average performance.”
The main issue was identified as being the 
levels of the potential performance-related 
rewards, reflected in top quartile rewards not 
being achieved by senior non-underwriters 
in respect of periods when top quartile 
performance has been delivered. T o 
address this shortfall and thereby reduce 
the risk to the Company, the Committee 
has adjusted the scales for the 2010 Group 
Bonus Scheme and intends to increase the 
long-term incentive awards to be granted to 
executive directors in 2010 to close to the 
maximum permitted annual awards under 
the plans (previous practice having usually 
been to fall well short of such levels for all 
participants, including the Chief Executive).
The Committee, its advisers and 
terms of reference
Details of the Committee’s membership and 
attendance are set out on page 82 in the 
Board Corporate Governance Statement 
and are hereby incorporated into this report. 
The Committee is assisted by the Group’s 
HR Director (Mr Farrow) and by advice and 
recommendations from the Chief Executive 
(Mr Philipps). The Chairman of the Company 
(Mr T aylor) is also invited to attend meetings 
for most agenda items. The Company 
Secretary (Mr Pender) acts as secretary to 
the Committee and advises it on governance 
and related matters.
In summary, the Committee’s terms of 
reference, which are published on the 
Company’s website and are available on 
request from the Secretary, are to determine 
the total individual remuneration packages of 
each executive director of the Company and 
of the Chairman, the Company Secretary 
and certain other senior Group employees 
(in each case including exit terms), and to 
recommend to the Board the framework 
and broad policies of the Group in relation 
to senior executive remuneration. 
The Committee determines the targets for 
all of the performance-related remuneration 
paid by the Group and exercises the Board’s 
powers in relation to all the Company’s share 
and incentive plans. It acts in accordance 
with the Principles of Good Governance 
and Code of Best Practice and its terms 
of reference reflect the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance. 
The Committee was advised during the 
year by its approved advisers Hewitt New 
Bridge Street (HNBS) on the structuring and 
utilisation of the Group’s performance-related 
incentives and on remuneration policy 
generally, including providing benchmarking 
data. On occasion HNBS also advises 
executive management on remuneration 
matters which may not be within the direct 
purview of the Committee and advises the 
Board as a whole on the remuneration of 
the non-executive directors. A statement 
regarding the Company’s relationship with 
HNBS is published on the Company’s 
website. Legal services have also been 
provided for the Committee on specific 
matters by Linklaters LLP , Dechert LLP 
and Addleshaw Goddard LLP . 
Remuneration policies
Overall remuneration levels and factors 
speciﬁc to the non-life insurance 
underwriting sector
In determining individuals’ remuneration, 
the Group has regard to their performance 
in the role, job evaluation of the role and 
remuneration statistics for the non-life 
insurance sector in which the Group 
operates and, where applicable for certain 
roles, wider remuneration statistics. Across 
all categories of staff, including executive 
directors, the Group’s policy is to have regard 
to market or peer group median salaries for 
the role, with the potential for top quartile 
remuneration for top quartile performance. 
This policy aims to encourage and reward 
superior rather than merely average 
performance and, as mentioned above, was 
re-affirmed by the Committee during the year 
as being the most appropriate to support 
the success of the Company. Salaries are 
generally reviewed as at 1 April each year. 
Remuneration for underwriters and those 
performing other technical insurance-related 
roles in the UK is strongly influenced by 
the Lloyd’s sector in which the Group’s UK 
employees operate. Lloyd’s underwriting 
businesses tend to relate a significant 
proportion of the potential rewards of 
underwriters to the absolute profitability of 
the relevant underwriting unit. Historically 
such profit share schemes have operated 
on an uncapped basis in money terms 
although they are capped as a percentage 
of the relevant profit pool which in turn is 
capped by the overall regulatory capacity 
and/or capital of the syndicate and the 
Group. Similar remuneration structures 
and policies have been adopted for staff 
in Amlin Bermuda Ltd. As outlined in the 
above section entitled ‘Committee internal 
review in 2009’, a number of aspects of this 
scheme, which include it being uncapped, 
are under review and likely to change for 
2011. The remuneration policies applied 
in Anglo French Underwriters (AFU) in 
France, and in Amlin Corporate Insurance 
NV (ACI) in the Netherlands, Belgium and 
France, businesses that were acquired by 
the Group in November 2008 and July 2009 
respectively, are currently in the process of 
being integrated into the Group on the basis 
of an appropriate balance between local 
and Amlin Group practice. Other than where 
specifically mentioned, these businesses 
are not covered in detail in this report. In 
all spheres of operation, the Committee 
aims to keep the market practices of its 
competitors for staff under review and 
believes that, as market and Amlin’s own 
practices evolve, it is always important to 
ensure that remuneration structures support 
the Group’s competitive advantage. 
Structure of directors’ and employees’ 
remuneration, and alignment of 
interests with shareholders
As summarised earlier in the chart on page 
98, the remuneration of all executive 
directors consists of three principal elements: 
(1) base salary, benefits and pension 
contributions; (2) annual performance 
rewards (on an accounting or underwriting 
year basis); and (3) longer-term performance 
rewards (measured over three or five year 
performance periods). This is also the case 
for all other senior executives in the UK 
and Bermuda (longer-term rewards not 
being provided in the same way to senior 
executives in ACI and AFU).
Excluding all long-term incentive plans, 
in 2009 an estimated average of 62% of 
the three executive directors’ remuneration  101

received was performance-related 
(2008 (for same three directors only): 
52%), with a markedly higher proportion 
for the director who is an underwriter 
(79% compared with 72% in 2008) 
than for the two non-underwriters (54% 
compared with 35% in 2008). Details of 
the long-term incentive plan participations 
of both underwriters and non-underwriters 
are set out below. Underwriters and other 
senior executives below main Board level 
are also eligible to receive significant 
proportions of their total remuneration 
as performance-related benefits.
The Committee believes that the overall 
balance between fixed and performance 
rewards has been appropriate but that, 
for senior non-underwriters including those 
who are directors, the performance-related 
proportion in respect of periods when high 
level performance has been achieved should 
be higher. As outlined later, the Committee 
has taken steps to make this more likely 
in the future. 
Shareholding targets
An objective was set when the Long T erm 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2006 
that executive directors would retain or build 
up shareholdings in the Company to the 
value of at least 125% of their base salaries 
and other senior executives to the value of at 
least 50%. Where not already reached, these 
targets are intended to be met as current 
share plans vest, particularly as the LTIP 
vests from March 2010. The shareholdings 
of all the executive directors were above 
the target throughout the year, mostly by 
a substantial margin. Of the other relevant 
senior executives, around half already hold 
the target value of shares and the rest are 
expected to build up such shareholdings as 
incentive plans vest. The Committee believes 
that the combination of these and other 
executives’ shareholdings and the structure 
of performance incentives is ensuring 
that the interests of management and 
shareholders in the success of the Company 
are closely aligned.
Non performance-related 
rewards: beneﬁts
Non performance-related benefits to which 
executive directors and other employees 
are generally entitled are private health 
insurance, cover for death in service and 
permanent disability and a choice of 
other benefits, such as subsidised gym 
membership, private dental costs, etc. 
Senior staff, including executive directors, 
also receive a car allowance. 
Non performance-related rewards: 
employer pension contributions
The Company pays a percentage of base 
salary into either a Group occupational 
or stakeholder pension plan. Executive 
directors serving during the year participate 
in the relevant Group pension plans on the 
same basis as other senior employees. 
Pensionable salary is base salary only. 
The Group has both defined contribution 
(DC) and defined benefit (DB) schemes. 
At the year end, excluding staff in the newly 
acquired ACI business, only 66 out of 790 
staff (2008: 70 out of 714) were accruing any 
element of DB pension. This includes one of 
the three executive directors during the year 
(2008: 2 out of 4). 
In respect of DC pensions, the Group 
contributes a percentage of base salary 
depending on seniority, age and the 
percentage of salary (if any) that the 
employee chooses to contribute. The 
maximum total DC employer contribution 
made for any director in 2009, in respect 
of a director with only DC contributions who 
recently turned 50, was 20.5% of base salary 
(2008 (when under 50): 15%). 
The Group’s DB schemes for UK and, when 
applicable, UK-originated staff working 
overseas have been closed to new entrants 
since 1998. In 2006, to create greater 
equality of treatment between staff and to 
limit further the uncertainty of future pension 
costs, the Company restricted the benefit 
in certain respects. Remaining active DB 
members continue accruing additional years’ 
service under the schemes but generally only 
based on 2006 pensionable salaries, with 
salary increases from April 2006 onwards 
being pensioned through DC arrangements. 
Further details of these changes have been 
outlined in this report in previous years. 
The DB employee contribution rate in the 
UK is 5% of DB pensionable salary. DB 
employer contribution rates vary according 
to actuarial advice in order to deliver the 
promised levels of pension. Based on the 
2007 triannual actuarial review, the employer 
contribution rate for the main UK scheme is 
currently 19%. 
In 2006 the Group also raised the normal 
pension age for UK and Bermudian staff 
from 60 to 65.
Shorter term performance rewards: 
annual bonus scheme for non-
underwriting directors and employees 
(Group Bonus Scheme)
For those executive directors and other 
employees throughout the Group who 
are not directly involved in underwriting or 
claims settlement, the Group’s shorter-term 
performance incentive is a cash bonus 
scheme (the Group Bonus Scheme for all 
other than Continental European staff who 
have separate, but similar, schemes). The 
senior sections of the Group Bonus Scheme 
reward and incentivise participants against a 
mixture of business performance, measured 
by reference to the Group’s return on equity 
(ROE) compared with target returns set by 
the Committee at the beginning of each year, 
and the individual’s performance against 
agreed stretching personal objectives. 
The mix of business and individual bonus 
elements varies by seniority, with 70% 
of the potential target reward at the most 
senior role levels, including participating 
executive directors, being rewarded on 
Group business performance and 30% on 
personal performance. The total ‘on-target’ 
and maximum bonus levels also increase 
with seniority. 
In respect of 2008 and 2009, 50% of base 
salary is payable to executive directors 
for ‘on-target’ performance, rising to a 
potential maximum payment of 120% of 
base salary. Unlike the non-underwriters 
in some comparable companies, Amlin’s 
non-underwriting executives cannot benefit 
from uncapped bonuses. However, the 
Committee believes that the level of cap 
should be kept under regular review to 
ensure that the Committee’s policy of 
“top quartile remuneration for top quartile 
performance” is able to be achieved. As a 
result of a review by the Committee in 2009, 
the executive directors’ scale has been 
changed for 2010 to 75% for ‘on-target’ 
performance, rising to a potential maximum 
of 165% of base salary if both the Group  102
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Remuneration report continued
business and personal performance 
elements were to reach their maxima. 
Similarly proportional increases have been 
made to the scales applying below director 
level. The increased scales coincide in 2010 
with more demanding ROE trigger levels 
at each point of the scale than in 2009, 
reflecting the higher budgets set for 2010 
compared with the budgets set a year earlier 
for 2009. 
The Committee has also carefully considered 
the case for deferred payment of bonuses 
and/or payment in shares rather than cash. 
In view of the material potential long term 
incentive component in all senior executive 
remuneration (see below), the Committee 
concluded that there is an appropriate 
balance between immediate and deferred 
performance related pay, and between 
payment in cash and shares. However, 
for directors and those at other senior 
management levels, the Committee has 
determined that any element of payment 
of annual bonus in respect of 2010 and 
subsequent years that is above the base 
salary maximum percentage for the relevant 
management level for 2009 (for example, 
120% for executive directors) will be deferred 
for three years from the usual date of 
payment. T otal or partial claw-back of such 
deferred cash bonus will apply, in summary, 
in the event of either the Committee finding 
that a participant has not complied with 
internal standards or controls or has caused 
reputational damage to the Company, or 
if any results or accounts on which the 
bonus was based prove to be incorrect or 
are required to be re-stated. Provisions also 
apply whereby a leaver during the three year 
deferral period will forfeit the deferred bonus 
unless they leave for one of a number of 
specified ‘good leaver’ reasons, including 
circumstances agreed by the Committee 
to be exceptional.
Shorter-term performance rewards: 
proﬁt share for underwriting directors 
and employees (Proﬁt Commission 
(PC) Scheme)
Shorter term incentives for UK and 
Bermuda underwriters and certain other 
underwriting division staff (whether or not 
they are executive directors of Amlin plc) 
consist principally of a cash profit share 
relating to underwriting profits in respect 
of each underwriting year (known as 
profit commission or PC). PC is paid on 
an underwriting year basis, partly related 
to the part of the business in which the 
relevant participant works and partly to wider 
Syndicate 2001 underwriting performance. 
Rewards are also divided between those 
which are purely calculated as a percentage 
of underwriting profit and those which are 
also related to underwriting performance 
relative to external peers and/or other 
objectives. The maximum percentage 
of each business unit’s underwriting 
profit which may be paid out under the 
scheme in respect of each underwriting 
year is 4.5% unless the business unit has 
achieved a superior result for its Lloyd’s 
sector of business in which case the highest 
maximum applying to any division is 4.83%. 
Around 3% of each underwriting year’s profit 
of Amlin Bermuda Ltd is also made available 
to a parallel scheme for those contributing 
to that subsidiary’s results, with further 
discretionary payments intended to be 
managed so that up to around 4.5% of its 
underwriting profit over the long term is paid 
out under the scheme.
Rewards crystallise at the end of 36 months 
from the start of an underwriting year but, 
at the Committee’s discretion, payments on 
account of up to 30% of the forecast reward 
have in recent years been paid a year earlier. 
As outlined in the ‘Overview’ section earlier in 
this report, the Committee has been actively 
reviewing the PC Scheme during 2009 and 
expects to be able to implement changes  
for 2011.
Longer-term performance rewards: 
long-term incentive plan for non-
underwriting directors and other senior 
management (Performance Share Plan)
The Amlin Performance Share Plan 2004 
(PSP) is intended as an aid to the recruitment, 
retention, motivation and reward of a small 
number of key senior executives who are not 
underwriters, including relevant executive 
directors. Awards have been made each year 
since 2004. During the year awards were 
made to a total of 22 participants (2008: 18) 
over an aggregate of 435,181 shares (2008: 
498,261), including, in addition to the main 
awards in March, awards taking account of 
local requirements to AFU staff in June and 
ACI staff in August. The main awards, as in 
previous years, were in the form of nil cost 
share options (over shares to be provided 
by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership 
Trust) and the AFU and ACI awards were 
made as conditional awards to be met by 
shares in treasury. 
The Committee intends to continue making 
similar discretionary annual awards, although 
the criteria for inclusion may vary. The rules 
of the PSP provide that no individual may 
receive an annual award over shares valued 
on grant at more than 100% of base salary. 
In 2009 the maximum such value awarded 
under the PSP to any participant (the Chief 
Executive) was 70% of base salary. The 
Committee intends that for the forthcoming 
2010 award both the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director will receive close to 100% 
of base salary, as part of the initiative 
referred to above to ensure that top quartile 
performance, if it is achieved, is rewarded 
with top quartile total remuneration.
The extent to which awards vest depends 
on a sliding scale of the Group’s average 
annual post tax return on net tangible assets 
(Return on NTA) over the ensuing five years. 
The Committee believes that such a Return 
on NTA measure most appropriately aligns 
participants’ and shareholders’ interests. This 
absolute performance measure balances the 
relative measures that apply to the Group’s 
Long T erm Incentive Plan. The average 
return is calculated after five years, with 
no re-testing. The targets and scales may 
vary with each grant at the discretion of the 
Committee but the scale for all of the grants 
to date has been as follows: 103

Once the vesting level is determined 
after five years, and provided the relevant 
participant is still employed by the Group, 
an award can be exercised over a specified 
period. For the 2004 and 2005 awards, 
the period for exercise was six months. 
In the case of the awards made in 2006 
and subsequent years, the Committee 
extended this period in 2009 to 30 months 
to give participants more flexibility. In certain 
restricted or exceptional circumstances, 
including redundancy and early retirement 
with the agreement of the Committee, an 
early leaver may be able to exercise early on 
a pro rata, but still performance condition 
related, basis. The Committee can make 
adjustments to take account of variations in 
capital and similar matters. In the event of 
the Company being subject to a takeover or 
similar event before the normal vesting date, 
vesting will take place early to the extent 
that the Committee is satisfied that the 
performance condition has been satisfied up 
to that date, with the proportion of the award 
which vests also depending on the time that 
has elapsed since the award was made.
Longer-term performance rewards: 
long-term incentive plan for 
underwriting directors and other 
senior underwriters (the Capital 
Builder Plan or Plan)
The Amlin Capital Builder Plan 2006 
replaced an earlier 2001 Plan under which 
the final payments were made in 2008. It is 
designed to reward senior underwriters if 
they exceed long-term target underwriting 
returns over rolling five year performance 
periods. The Committee believes that the 
Capital Builder Plan and its predecessor 
have acted, and continue to act, as a 
significant retention and recruitment tool 
for those underwriters who are likely to be 
most significant in determining the Group’s 
underwriting profitability and development 
over each performance period. Awards have 
been made under the Plan to around 50 
participants from Amlin London, Amlin UK 
and Amlin Bermuda in 2006 to 2009 inclusive 
and are intended to be made on a similar 
basis in 2010. 
The basis of the Plan is that participants 
benefit to the extent that, in the class or 
classes of business that they write or 
oversee, demanding underwriting return 
targets, consistent with the Company 
achieving an overall average return on 
equity of at least 15% per annum over the 
insurance cycle, are exceeded over a five 
year performance period. Excess returns 
are defined as those resulting from the 
achievement of underwriting loss ratios 
(i.e. the level of claims, net of reinsurance 
recoveries, as a percentage of premiums) 
below (i.e. better than) demanding 
target claims ratios set for each class. 
The maximum permitted excess profit 
percentage that may be paid out to Plan 
participants is 10% (i.e. 2% in respect of 
each overlapping five year performance 
period), although in most business classes 
this is lower. Variations in each class’s target 
claims ratio and excess profit percentage 
depend on the Committee’s assessment of 
the risk, historic experience and long-term 
market prospects of the class. 
Payments under the Plan may be made 
at the Company’s discretion in either cash 
or shares and have a cap of £1 million on 
the total amount that may be paid to a 
participant in respect of each rolling five 
year performance period. Payments will be 
made over the two years after the end of 
each performance period. Hence the first 
payment under the current Plan, in respect of 
the performance period 2006 to 2010, will be 
payable in 2011 based on results to the end 
of 2010. This payment will be of up to 70% 
of each pool allocated, with the balance of 
each award being paid a year later. With the 
final payments under the earlier plan having 
been made in 2008, no long-term incentive 
payments are therefore payable under these 
plans in 2009 or 2010.
Longer term performance rewards: the 
Amlin Long T erm Incentive Plan 2006 
(the LTIP)
The L TIP replaced grants of executive share 
options from 2007 onwards. Awards were 
made in 2009 (in March) to 61 participants 
(2008: 49), over a total of 747,533 shares 
(2008: 1,080,897). Participants included senior 
staff at ABL and (under a French schedule to 
the plan with minor variations to meet local 
requirements) AFU. (Senior management at 
ACI have to date been made awards under 
the PSP but not the L TIP .) The L TIP’s primary 
performance condition is a relative T otal 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measure, providing 
a balance to the absolute performance 
measures used in the Capital Builder Plans 
for underwriters and the PSP for non-
underwriters. Both senior underwriters and 
senior non-underwriters, including executive 
directors, participate in the L TIP . 
Awards are made subject to performance 
conditions set by the Committee at each 
award. For all the awards made to date 
the extent to which awards vest will depend 
on the Company’s TSR over the ensuing 
three years relative to an unweighted index 
of TSRs for a comparator group of Lloyd’s 
insurers, on the following scale: 
LTIP TSR condition
The Company’s TSR compared 
with the comparator group index
Vesting 
percentage
Below index Nil
Equal to the index 25%
Between index and index  
plus 25%
25% to 100% 
on a straight line 
basis
Index plus 25% 100%
The constituents of the index for the 2009 
awards were: Beazley Group, Brit Insurance, 
Catlin Group, Chaucer Holdings, Hiscox, 
Lancashire Holdings and Novae Group. 
Irrespective of relative TSR, no award will vest 
unless the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s financial performance over the 
performance period has been satisfactory. 
The performance period is always a single 
three year period with no provision for 
re-testing the performance conditions. 
As with the PSP , awards are usually made 
in the form of nil cost share options to be 
satisfied by shares held in the ESOT (or, to 
participants in certain overseas jurisdictions,  104
Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Remuneration report continued
as conditional awards of shares to be 
provided from treasury) and may be made 
each year at the discretion of the Committee, 
based on seniority and with no individual 
receiving awards over shares having a market 
value on grant in excess of 100% of annual 
base salary (or, exceptionally, 200% for a 
senior new recruit). The maximum percentage 
of base salary awarded in 2009 was 70% 
and, as with the PSP , the Committee 
intends to increase this in 2010 at the 
most senior level to close to the maximum 
100% permitted. Once the vesting level is 
determined after three years, and provided 
the relevant participant is still employed by 
the Group, the award made in 2007 will be 
capable of exercise within the following six 
months. As with the PSP , this period was 
extended during 2009 to 30 months for 
awards vesting in 2011 onwards. The LTIP 
contains broadly similar provisions to the 
PSP , as referred to above, on such matters 
as early leavers and variations in capital. 
Longer-term performance rewards: 
executive share options (Executive 
Option Schemes)
Executive share options were granted at 
the discretion of the Committee under the 
Approved and Unapproved Amlin Executive 
Share Option Schemes each year from 
1997 to 2006 to executive directors and 
other staff (whether underwriters or not) 
above a certain level of seniority. Grants 
were subject to performance conditions 
which are summarised in respect of 
directors’ outstanding options in the notes 
to the table ‘Directors’ PSP , LTIP and share 
options held’ later in this report. No further 
grants can be made. 
All-employee share plans
The Company offers HM Revenue and 
Customs approved Sharesave options, 
the current plan having been adopted in 
2008 with a ten year life for new grants. 
An annual offer was made in September 
2009. Sharesave offers are open to all 
Group employees (other than at present 
those in Continental Europe) who have been 
employed for more than a specified number 
of months at each grant. Exercises are 
not subject to any performance condition. 
The Committee considers that the plans are 
successful in encouraging staff at all levels 
to build up interests, and subsequently 
shareholdings, in the Company at an 
acceptable accounting and administrative 
cost to the Company.
Since 2007 the Company has also operated 
an HM Revenue and Customs approved 
all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
allowing offers of Free Shares at no cost to 
employees. At the outset the Committee 
adopted a policy of making an award of Free 
Shares each year, on an equal basis to all 
executive directors and staff (subject to a 
pro rata adjustment for part time employees 
and to an employment qualification period 
of approximately nine months), subject to 
the annual results. The quantum, between 
nil and the annual maximum level of £3,000 
worth of shares per employee, is decided in 
the light of the ROE achieved in the previous 
year. The 2007 and 2008 offers were at the 
maximum level of £3,000 and in March 2009, 
reflecting the lower ROE in 2008, at a level 
of £1,000. 2009 take-up was 98% of eligible 
employees (2008: 97%). In the light of the 
ROE achieved in 2009, the Committee has 
decided to make an offer of £3,000 worth 
of Free Shares in March 2010.
Sharesave offers are made under the plan 
to staff in all jurisdictions where local tax 
and regulation makes this practicable 
without amending the plan. This does not 
include Continental Europe but possibilities 
for similar plans are being considered. In 
contrast, the SIP Free Shares are offered 
to all staff, if necessary by adopting similar 
local plans. Accordingly eligible staff at AFU 
received standard £1,000 allocations in April 
2009 and ACI staff received allocations to 
the same value in September 2009. 
The SIP also allows offers of Partnership 
Shares whereby employees may buy 
shares on a tax deductible basis but it is 
not intended generally to make such offers 
and no such offer was made in 2009. 
Policy on service agreements and 
their termination
The Group does not offer service agreements 
with notice periods in excess of six months, 
except in the case of executive directors 
of the Company and the most senior level 
of management when up to a 12 month 
notice period may apply. The Company is 
mindful of the need to balance the potential 
contractual advantages of longer notice 
periods against the potential cost in the 
event of termination at the Group’s initiative.
In cases of early termination by the Group, 
the Company seeks to observe the guidance 
on best practice issued in December 2002 
by the Association of British Insurers 
and the National Association of Pension 
Funds. In such circumstances, the Group 
seeks to reduce, where practicable, the 
compensation payable by taking account 
of the duty of the employee to mitigate 
his or her loss. In particular, consideration 
is given to structuring a proportion of 
termination payments on a phased 
payment basis pending the executive 
finding new employment. The need to take 
a robust view in settling cases involving poor 
performance is also recognised.
Details of each executive director’s service 
contract applicable during the year are 
set out in the section entitled ‘Executive 
directors’ service contracts’ below.
Policy on outside appointments
The Company’s policy is to allow executive 
directors and other appropriate senior 
employees to accept one substantive 
non-Amlin related outside non-executive 
appointment, subject to permission being 
obtained in each case and to acceptable 
procedures for managing any potential 
conflicts of interest. Such appointments 
are in the public interest and can often 
provide useful experience for the executive 
concerned. Suitable outside appointments, 
including limited term secondments, relating 
to Amlin’s business, such as to Lloyd’s 
bodies, are encouraged on the additional 
ground that such appointments are often  105

directly in the Company’s interest. Fees from 
outside appointments related to Amlin’s 
business are generally payable to the 
Group rather than retained by the director 
or employee concerned. In other cases, 
some or all of such fees may be retained.
Executive directors’ 
service contracts
The dates of the service or employment 
contracts of each director who served as 
an executive during the year, all of which 
are with the Company’s subsidiary, Amlin 
Corporate Services Limited, are as stated 
below. Salaries have been periodically 
reviewed since the original contract dates, 
with the current annual base salaries as at 
the date of this report being as stated below.

R A Hextall 26 November 1999 £385,000
C E L Philipps 20 February 1997 £532,000
All of the contracts, as amended where 
applicable, remain in force at the date of this 
report and are on a full time basis, provide 
for 12 months’ notice of termination on 
either side and automatically terminate on 
the director’s contractual retirement date. 
The retirement dates of Messrs Hextall 
and Philipps were agreed in 2006 to be 
amended to each of their sixty-fifth birthdays 
(previously sixtieth) in line with a choice given 
to employees generally. Mr Carpenter has 
retained his retirement date of sixty. There 
are no special provisions for compensation 
on termination in any director’s contract 
other than that the employer has the right 
to pay salary in lieu of any required period 
of notice. Executive directors’ service 
or employment contracts, including 
amendments, are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office. 
Remuneration received
The remuneration received in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2009 by each 
of the directors in respect of their periods 
of service as directors, excluding pension 
contributions and long term incentive plan 
payments, is shown in the table above. In 
addition, Mr Hextall received and retained 
a non-executive director’s fee of £23,000 
from the City of London Investment Trust 
PLC (2007: £23,000). Where applicable, the 
amounts shown as paid to non-executive 
directors include fees paid by or on behalf 
of the Company’s subsidiaries (Amlin 
Underwriting Limited and Amlin Bermuda, 
Ltd). The total base salaries received in 
2009 by Messrs Carpenter, Hextall and 
Philipps increased by 3.0%, 6.7% and 3.6% 
respectively over 2008. In addition to the 
results of the usual 1 April salary review, 
Mr Hextall received a special salary increase 
from 1 October 2009 of 10% as it had 
become clear to the Committee that, in the 
light of his experience and performance in the 
role, his previous salary was not competitive.
The annual bonuses and/or profit 
commission amounts shown [above] 
are those paid or payable in respect of the 
year. Messrs Hextall and Philipps received 
performance bonuses under the Group 
Bonus Scheme, in respect of which they 
had the following business performance 
ROE targets and percentage payments:

items relating to hedging
The bonus thresholds reflected similar 
internal ROE budgets at the start of 2008 
and 2009 although the outcomes were very 
different. In addition to the above business 
performance-related element of their bonus, 
Messrs Hextall and Philipps are eligible to 
receive a personal performance-related 
element. In view of each of their exceptional 
personal performances in 2009, as 
determined by the Committee, this was 
awarded at the maximum level of personal 
performance payment for the year of 36% 
of salary, making a total bonus payment 
for each of the maximum of 120% of 
current salary.

As reported last year, the Committee 
agreed in 2008 that Mr Holt would be 
treated as a ‘good leaver’ as a result of 
his early retirement from executive office 
on 31 December 2008. He received no 
compensation for loss of office but his share 
based incentives were therefore eligible for 
early vesting within six months of that date 
(subject to apportionment and performance 
conditions in the case of the LTIP). In 
consideration for Mr Holt agreeing not to 
take up any position with a competitor, he is 
also permitted to receive his PC entitlements 
in respect of the years of account up to and 
including 2008 as they fall due for payment. 
The payments falling due as at 31 December 
2009 are included above. In the case of the 
2007 underwriting year he was not made an 
interim payment and therefore the amount 
shown is his full PC for that year. This year 
the Committee has exercised its discretion 
to make a 30% first instalment in respect 
of 2008, as would have been the case 
were he still an executive. All PC amounts 
include those paid to Mr Holt in respect 
of his contribution to both Syndicate 2001 
and Amlin Bermuda. He will similarly receive 
any payments due to him under the Capital 
Builder Plan, apportioned for the relevant 
periods up to his retirement from executive 
office, when they fall due in the future. Other 
than in accordance with these arrangements, 
no payments were made during the year 
in respect of any director leaving the Board 
or ceasing to be employed as an executive 
by the Group, and nor were any such 
arrangements agreed. 107

Executive directors’ pensions 
The pension details, as applicable for each 
executive and former executive director 
(non-executives not being eligible), of whom 
Mr Holt retired as an executive director on 
31 December 2008 and the other three 
served throughout the year, are shown in 
the table on the previous page. Mr Holt’s 
total accrued DB pension is shown in 
that table on the basis of him drawing his 
pension from his normal retirement age 
(although he is presently below that age 
and now eligible to draw his pension when 
he chooses, subject to actuarial adjustment). 
He accrued no pension during the year and 
the only changes to his DB pension during 
the year were as a result of inflation and 
market changes affecting transfer values. 
The total DC employer contributions for the 
directors were £184,936 (2008 (including 
Mr Holt): £170,074). The increase during 
the year in Mr Carpenter’s accrued pension 
excludes that due to inflation. The transfer 
value of such increase, and changes in 
total transfer values during the year, are 
shown before the effects of inflation and, in 
Mr Carpenter’s case, after deduction of his 
own DB contributions during the year. T otal 
transfer values of both Mr Carpenter’s and 
Mr Holt’s accrued pensions have increased 
materially during the year as a result of 
reduced expectations for future returns in 
the fund. Transfer values are calculated in 
accordance with regulations 7 to 7E of the 
Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer 
Values) Regulations 1996, as amended. 
Only base salary is pensionable. 
Executive directors’ Capital Builder 
Plan participations and estimates 
to date
The applicable classes of business which 
will determine the rewards payable to each 
of the directors of the Company participating 
in the Capital Builder Plan are the classes 
which they themselves underwrite (or 
underwrote), the wider performance of the 
respective divisions that they headed at the 
relevant time and the Group’s underwriting 
as a whole (excluding ACI). There was no 
material change in the classes in which 
Mr Carpenter participates between the 2008 
and 2009 awards. Mr Holt participates on a 
time apportioned basis in underwriting years 
up to his retirement as an executive at the 
end of 2008. 
Since 2006 Amlin Bermuda Ltd’s underwriting 
has been included, with different applicable 
percentage participations, in the results 
of those classes written in both the UK 
and Bermuda. 
Awards were made in each of the years 2006 
to 2009 inclusive, in respect of performance 
periods of five underwriting years 
commencing in the year each respective 
award was made. As no payments will be 
made under the 2006 Plan until mid-2011 
(on the basis of reserving as at 31 December 
2010), forecasts of rewards in respect of all 
performance periods are subject to material 
change. Subject to that caveat, the forecast 
rewards based on earned premium and 
reserving as at 31 December 2009, for 
the periods stated to date, are as follows:

Executive directors’ Performance 
Share Plan, Long T erm Incentive 
Plan and share options 
participations
As described in the ‘Remuneration policies’ 
section earlier in this report, all of these 
incentive plans involve options being granted 
to relevant UK-based participants over 
shares in the Company, whether at exercise 
prices determined in relation to the market 
price at the date of grant (executive options), 
a discount to such price (Sharesave) or at 
a nominal exercise price of £1 in total per 
exercise (PSP and LTIP). 
As at 31 December 2009 the options held 
under these plans by executive directors 
serving at the year end, all of whom were 
directors throughout the year, and their 
changes during the year, are set out in the 
following two tables. Mr Holt, as a retired 
executive director, held no options at the end 
of the year but his exercises during the year 
appear in the second table below. In addition 
each executive director was awarded 284 
shares as Free Shares in the SIP in April 
2009. All SIP shareholdings, including these, 
are included in the directors’ shareholding 
interests set out in the Directors’ report. 
The share price on the date of directors’ 
2009 PSP and LTIP awards (5 March) 
was 370.25p.  109

Notes 
1. Grants shown in the ﬁrst table above as being over new shares may also be satisﬁed from treasury shares.
2. The potential proﬁt as at 31 December 2009 shown in ﬁrst table above are based on a year end share price of 358.7p (2008: 357.5p). The high and low closing market share 
prices during the year were 396.9p and 301.75p respectively (2008: 389.25p and 242.25p). These calculations are before tax and are theoretical as most PSP and LTIP awards 
were not exercisable at the year end, and may or may not meet their performance conditions in full. 
3. The primary performance conditions of each of the grants of directors’ executive options included in the tables above related to TSR against a comparator group of companies, 
with a secondary condition that the Company had returned a satisfactory overall ﬁnancial performance, both measured over a three year performance period. They were not 
subject to re-testing and, to the extent that an individual’s annual grant was over shares valued at over 50% of salary, the Company’s TSR had to be upper quartile for the options 
to be exercised in full. All of such options met their performance conditions in full at the end of the relevant periods. 
4. Changes in directors’ entitlements during the year resulted from the grants during the year indicated in the ﬁrst table and from the exercises set out in the second table above. 
Options exercised include those exercised by Mr Holt within six months of his retirement from executive ofﬁce in accordance with the relevant plans’ rules regarding time 
apportionment and performance conditions. The balance of his LTIP awards and Sharesave options (79,191 and 4,355 shares respectively) lapsed during the year.  110

Performance conditions 
measurements of PSP 
and L TIP awards
The measurement against the performance 
condition of the first PSP awards, which 
were made in May 2004, was determined by 
the Committee during the year. The average 
ROE for the five year performance period, 
2004-08 inclusive, was above the 20% 
threshold required for maximum vesting. 
The Committee has recently made a similar 
determination in respect of the March 2005 
PSP awards. The threshold for maximum 
vesting was again 20% and this time the 
relevant five year average ROE was 29%. 
These awards are therefore exercisable 
in full from 21 March 2010.
The first awards under the LTIP were made 
in March 2007. The Committee has recently 
determined that the primary performance 
condition of these awards was met in full 
as Amlin’s T otal Shareholder Return over 
the three years 2007-09 inclusive was 
more than 25% higher than the relevant 
TSR index of comparable companies 
(39% compared with 5.6% on the strictest 
measure of the index). The Committee also 
concluded that the secondary condition, in 
summary that the financial performance of 
the Company over the three year period had 
been satisfactory, had been met. In reaching 
the latter conclusion the Committee had 
regard to underlying earnings, returns 
on equity, and increases in net tangible 
assets per share over the relevant period. 
These awards are therefore exercisable 
in full from 7 March 2010.
Use of unissued and existing 
shares for incentive plans
The rules of all those of the Company’s 
incentive plans which can result in the issue 
or transfer of shares to participants include 
limits on the overall number of unissued 
shares over which options may be granted. 
The only employee schemes under which 
either unissued or treasury shares are 
committed to be issued are the executive 
share option schemes, the Sharesave 
plans and the schedules to the PSP and 
LTIP applying to awards to participants in 
continental Europe. New shares were also 
issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share 
Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares but in 
2008 and 2009 such shares were purchased 
in the market. Shares awarded under the 
PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied 
from shares held, or to be purchased, by 
the Group’s Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT) unless overseas requirements 
dictate otherwise. 
Grants of options over new and/or treasury 
shares under any selective plan, after 
deducting any such options which have 
lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued 
share capital in any 10 year period. Grants 
over new/treasury shares under any 
scheme are also limited to 10% over 10 
years. The percentages of the year end 
shares in issue, together with the equivalent 
percentages a year earlier, relating to each 
of these limits were as follows: 111

Of the total potential commitment of the 
ESOT as at 31 December 2009, it then 
held 1,056,440 shares (2008: 1,221,891 
against a commitment of 3,748,543). It is 
intended that the balance will be purchased 
in the market by the ESOT , using funds 
advanced by the Company, before they 
are required. The changes in the shares 
held by the ESOT during 2009 resulted 
from the exercises of options and vesting of 
awards over a total of 615,451 shares and 
the purchase by the ESOT in the market of 
450,000 shares principally using the funds 
advanced to the ESOT by the Group for the 
purpose. T aking account of exercises up to 
23 February 2010, the ESOT’s shareholding 
is 1,016,501 shares.

indices respectively (Amlin’s shares are a 
constituent of both) over the five years to 
31 December 2009. Comparisons are shown 
with both these indices as the performance 
of Amlin’s shares is affected both by the 
general UK stock market in companies of its 
size and by its insurance sector. The graphs 
show the values, at each year end from 
2004 to 2009 inclusive, of £100 invested 
in the Company’s shares on 31 December 
2004 compared with the values of £100 
invested in the relevant index on the same

on the graphs is the average of the relevant 
return index over the 30 days preceding the 
relevant year end.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
The fees paid during the year to non-
executive directors of the Company are 
included in the ‘Directors’ remuneration 
received’ table on page 105 earlier in this 
report. Such fees, other than those of the 
Chairman, are determined by the full Board. 
The Board receives recommendations in 
this respect from a committee chaired by 
the Chairman, with the Chief Executive and 
two other directors (one executive and one 
non-executive member of the Committee, 
each of whom rotates each year) as the other 
members. Recommendations and decisions 
are made taking account of professional 
advice and other information on the level 
of such fees paid by comparable companies 
for comparable services. 
The Chairman’s remuneration is 
determined by similar criteria, but by the 
Remuneration Committee. The minimum 
time commitments given by each director, as 
detailed in the Board Corporate Governance 
statement, are also taken into account. 
The Board’s policy is that non-executive 
fees should be set by reference to the upper 
quartile of such fees paid by companies of 
similar size, on account of the above average 
complexity and regulatory responsibilities 
involved. Each non-executive director is paid 
a basic fee and is paid further for additional 
services, such as committee or subsidiary 
Board responsibilities. 
Non-executive directors have contracts for 
services rather than employment contracts. 
They are not eligible for any of the Group’s 
pension, share or incentive schemes but 
may, by the agreement of the Board, be 
paid additional fees beyond those set out 
(calculated on an appropriate day rate) in 
the event of exceptional levels of additional 
time being required, for instance in response 
to corporate developments. No such fees 
were paid in 2009 (2008: nil). Their terms 
of appointment are formalised in letters 
of appointment, copies of which are 
available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered offi ce and which are updated 
from time to time. They are appointed on 
the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, usually for a three year term, 
and may be removed, or not nominated 
for re-election at the end of their term, in 
each case in accordance with the Articles 
of Association of the Company. The 
commencement and expected year of 
expiry of each of the non-executive directors’ 
current terms are set out in the table above.
If a non-executive director is not nominated 
or re-elected at the end of a term of offi ce, the 
director is not entitled to any extra payment 
on termination. In other circumstances three 
months’ notice of termination may be given 
by either side. 
Status of report 
As required by the Large and Medium-
Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & 
Reports) Regulations 2008, in accordance 
with which this report has been prepared,

received’, ‘Executive directors’ pensions’,

Directors’ Report
Principal activity, Business Review 
and key performance indicators
The Group’s principal activity is non-life 
insurance and reinsurance underwriting in 
the Lloyd’s market, Bermuda and continental 
Europe. A review of the Group’s business, 
and developments during the year, is set 
out on pages 16 to 72 of the Annual Report 
(overview, strategy and performance 
sections). Further information is provided in 
the risk disclosure note and the Governance 
section of the Annual Report starting on 
pages 132 and 73 respectively. The Review 
and Performance sections, risk disclosure 
note and Governance section together 
include the information and analysis required 
by section 417 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
be included in a Business Review, including 
information on key performance indicators 
and on the Group’s financial and other risk 
management and policies. Such information 
and analysis is hereby incorporated by 
reference into this report.
Share capital, treasury shares and 
dividends
The Company’s share capital during the year 
consisted of ordinary shares of 28.125p each 
(Ordinary Shares) and, until the final such 
shares were redeemed on 3 August 2009, 
redeemable non-cumulative preference shares 
of 22.4p each (B Shares). Details of the B 
Shares are set out in note 23 to the Accounts.
There were 502,076,006 Ordinary Shares  
in issue at the year end (2008: 478,573,439), 
including shares held in treasury. The 
directors exercised their authority granted by 
shareholders to issue 23,502,567 Ordinary 
Shares on 8 June 2009 in a placing for cash 
at 325p per share (2008: nil). No shares 
were bought back during the year (2008: 
10,765,000 shares bought into treasury 
at an average price of 256.09p per share). 
1,599,228 shares were transferred out of 
treasury during the year to service exercises 
of employee share options (2008: 2,001,348), 
leaving 7,164,424 Ordinary Shares in treasury 
at the year end (2008: 8,763,652). There have 
been no issues of shares or further share 
buy backs or transfers into treasury since the 
year end but a further 2,438 Ordinary Shares 
had by 23 February 2010 been transferred 
from treasury to satisfy employee share 
options, leaving 7,161,986 shares in treasury 
at that date. 
At first interim dividend of 6.5p per Ordinary 
Share (2008: 6.0p) was paid on 8 October 
2009 to shareholders on the register on  
11 September 2009. The directors have 
now declared a second interim dividend of 
13.5p per Share (2008: nil), to be paid on 31 
March 2010 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 19 March 2010. 
This makes total ordinary dividends for the 
year of 20.0p per Ordinary Share (2008: 
17.0p). No final dividend is being proposed 
(2008: 11.0p). A Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
was operated in respect of the first interim 
dividend and is likely to be offered for most 
future dividends, but is not being offered  
in respect of the second interim dividend 
as a result of the tight payment timetable. 
Details of the Plan are available on the 
Company’s website.

for the payment of suppliers within 30 days 
of the end of the month in which the Group 
receives the goods or in which the services

to the amounts invoiced during the year.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting, 
to be held at noon on Thursday 13 May 
2010 at the offices of the Company at 
St Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London, EC3A 
8ND, is contained in a separate circular 
to shareholders which is being mailed or 
otherwise provided to shareholders at the 
same time as this report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made third party 
indemnity provisions for the benefit of 
its directors and certain directors of the 
Company’s subsidiaries. The current 
indemnities of the directors of the Company 
were, in all cases other than Mrs Bosse’s, 
entered into during 2008. Mrs Bosse entered 
into an indemnity deed for the first time 
during the year. Such indemnities remain  
in force at the date of this report.
Authorisation of directors’ conﬂicts 
of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the authorisation of a director’s 
potential conflict of interest or duty, 
for instance arising from a director’s 
appointment as a director of another 
company which may have a business 
relationship with the Group. Such 
authorisations may be given by the 
remaining directors who are independent 
Corporate governance and 
Directors’ remuneration
The Board Corporate Governance Statement 
and reports from the Board’s Nomination 
and Audit Committees are set out with other 
reports in the Governance section of the 
Annual Report and are hereby incorporated 
by reference into this report. Details of the 
Company’s rules on the appointment and 
removal of directors, and on how the 
Company’s Articles of Association may be 
amended, are set out in the section entitled 
‘Articles of Association’ in the Board 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 
84. Details of Directors’ remuneration are  
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration  
report, also in the Governance section  
of the Annual Report.
Employment policies
The People section of the Review provides 
commentary on the Group as an employer, 
including its commitment to training and 
professional development and the results of 
the third Ipsos MORI staff survey. The Group 
recognises the importance of employee 
engagement and therefore operates the 
Amlin Consultation Forum in the UK as a 
framework for discussion and consultation 
between staff and management, as well as 
arrangements elsewhere such as the Works 
Council operated by Amlin Corporate 
Insurance NV . In addition to engagement 
through line managers, employee 
communication is facilitated by a 
Group intranet and a monthly Group 
‘Amlin Update’ e-newsletter. 
The Group’s equal opportunities policy aims 
to ensure that no employee, in application 
for initial employment or as an existing 
employee (including in the event of a change 
in his or her circumstances), receives less 
favourable treatment because of his or her 
sex, actual or perceived sexual orientation, 
gender (including gender reassignment), 
marital or family status, age, ethnic origin, 
disability, race, colour, nationality, national 
origin, creed, political affiliation, part-time 
status, or any other condition, unless it can 
be shown to be legally justifiable. 
Copies of the Group’s policies (some 
applying to the whole Group and some 
to the UK, with local variations outside 
the UK) on professional qualifications, 
family leave, flexible working, sabbaticals, 
staff harassment and equal opportunities 
are available on the Company’s website 
or from the Secretary on request. The 
Group’s health and safety policy and the 
relevant local policies are publicised to staff, 
including through the Group’s intranet. The 
operation of the UK policy is monitored by 
a staff Health and Safety Committee. The 
Group Chief Executive, to whom the Group 
Operations Director, Mr Andrew Grant, 
whose responsibilities include oversight of 
health and safety throughout the Group, 
reports, makes an annual health and safety 
report to the Board.
Corporate responsibility and 
charitable donations
A report on the Group’s corporate 
responsibility activities, including its 
employee, environmental and community 
engagement, is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility report in the Governance 
section of the Annual Report. The Group 
Chief Executive has direct responsibility at 
Board level for leading the Group’s initiatives 
on all corporate responsibility related 
matters, with the relevant senior managers 
and advisory groups reporting to him. 
Relevant policies and terms of reference  
are available on the Company’s website  
or from the Secretary on request.
The Group made charitable donations 
during the year of £133,668 (2008: 
£80,986), including donations in Bermuda 
by the Company’s subsidiary, Amlin 
Bermuda Ltd (ABL). The Group’s charitable 
donations were part of broader corporate 
responsibility expenditure during the year 
totalling £254,116 (2008: £154,164). The 
Group’s charities budget (excluding ABL’s) 
is managed by the Company’s Community 
and Charities Panel chaired by the Finance 
Director, Mr Hextall. The ABL budget is 
managed in Bermuda under the direction 
of the ABL board. Further details of the 
Group’s community and charitable activities, 
and of their governance, are set out in 
the Corporate Responsibility and Board 
Corporate Governance report respectively.

of the potential conflict. A number of 
authorisations have been approved by the 
Board in this manner, some of which are 
summarised in the ‘Board composition 
and independence’ section of the Board 
Corporate Governance statement of the 
Annual Report. Such authorisations do not 
remove a director’s duty to ensure that any 
actual conflict of interest or duty, should it 
arise, is dealt with appropriately, usually by 
the director taking no part in the relevant 
Board or Committee decision.
Directors’ statement on the 
disclosure of information to the 
auditors
Each director at the date of the approval  
of this report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there  
is no relevant audit information of  
which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps 
that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
The Group’s business, risk and financial 
management, performance and position, 
together with factors that are likely to affect 
future development, are described in the 
Business Review between pages 16 and 
72 Capital management strategy, which 
covers how regulatory and economic capital 
needs are measured and how capital is 
deployed, is described in the Financial 
Management section on pages 60 to 70. 
The financial position of the Group, including 
commentary on cash and investment levels, 
currency management, insurance liability 
management, liquidity and borrowings, is 
also covered in that section. 
In addition, Note 2 to the accounts describes 
capital management needs and policies, 
and Note 3 covers underwriting, market, 
liquidity and credit risks which may affect the 
financial position of the Group. 
The Group has considerable financial 
resources to meet its financial needs and 
manages a mature portfolio of insurance 
risk through an experienced and stable 
team. The directors believe that the Group 
is well positioned to manage its business 
risks successfully in the current uncertain 
economic environment.
After making enquiries, the directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the annual report and accounts. 
Auditors
Following a casual vacancy arising from the 
resignation of Deloitte LLP as the Company’s 
auditors on 22 September 2009, the Board 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) as auditors to the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2009, pursuant 
to Section 485 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 
2006. A discussion of the background to the 
re-tendering of the Group auditor position is 
included in the Audit Committee’s report in 
the Governance section on page 87 of the 
Annual Report. 
A resolution is to be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting for the re-appointment of 
PwC as auditors and to authorise the Audit 
Committee to determine their remuneration.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration report 
and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The directors are required 
by the IAS Regulation to prepare the group 
financial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and have 
also elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements on the same basis. The 
financial statements are also required by law 
to be properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
requires that financial statements present 
fairly for each financial year the company’s 
financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance 
with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of financial 
statements’. In virtually all circumstances, 
a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRS. 
However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies; and
• state whether applicable IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, each of the directors, whose names 
and functions are listed on page 74 of the 
annual report in the section entitled ‘Board 
of Directors’, confirm that, to the best of 
each person’s knowledge and belief:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and Company; and
• the Directors’ report, including the 
matters incorporated therein by reference, 
contained in the Annual Report includes 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face. 119

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Amlin plc 
We have audited the Group financial 
statements of Amlin plc for the year ended 
31 December 2009 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes 1 to 39. The 
financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
Respective responsibilities 
of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ responsibilities set out on the 
previous page, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions,  
has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 
and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the 
Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial 
statements; and
• the information given in the Board 
Corporate Governance statement set out 
on pages 78 to 85 with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and 
about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of  
the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our  
audit; or
• a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the parent company.
 
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review: 
• the directors’ statement, set out in the 
Directors’ Report on page 114, in relation 
to going concern; and 
• the part of the Board Corporate 
Governance statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined 
Code specified for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent 
company financial statements of Amlin 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 
and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.

1. Summary of significant 
accounting policies 
Amlin plc is a public limited company 
registered in England and Wales. The address 
of the registered office is St Helen’s,  
1 Undershaft, London EC3A 8ND. 
The basis of preparation, basis of 
consolidation and significant accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of Amlin 
plc and subsidiaries’ (the Group) consolidated 
financial statements are set out below. 
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted for use in the European Union (EU). 
The consolidated financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation.  
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for cash and cash equivalents, financial 
investments, share options, and pension 
assets which are measured at their fair value.  
Except where otherwise stated, all figures 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements are presented in millions of British 
Pounds Sterling (Sterling) shown as £m 
rounded to the nearest £100,000. 
The accounting policies adopted in preparing 
these financial statements are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the 
Group’s annual financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2008, unless 
otherwise stated. 
In accordance with IFRS 4, the Group has 
applied existing accounting practices for 
insurance contracts, modified as appropriate, 
to comply with the IFRS framework and 
applicable standards. 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements consolidate the 
accounts of the Company and subsidiary 
undertakings, including the Group’s 
underwriting through participation on Lloyd’s 
syndicates. Subsidiaries are those entities in 
which the Group, directly or indirectly, has the 
power to govern the operating and financial 
policies in order to gain economic benefits 
and includes the Company’s employee benefit 
trusts. The financial statements of all 
subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the Parent Company. 
Consolidation adjustments are made to 
convert subsidiary accounts prepared under 
different accounting standards into IFRS so  
as to remove the effects of any different 
accounting policies that may exist.  
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
that control is transferred to the Group and 
cease to be consolidated from the date that 
control is transferred out. All inter-company 
balances, profits and transactions are eliminated. 
Details of material subsidiaries included within 
the consolidated financial statements can be 
found in note 35. 
Adoption of new and revised Standards 
(a) Standards, amendments to published 
standards and interpretations effective on  
or after 1 January 2009 
IAS 39 and IFRS 7, ‘Reclassification of 
financial assets’ (amendment), permits an 
entity to reclassify non-derivative financial 
assets (other than those designated at fair 
value through income by the entity upon initial 
recognition) out of the fair value through 
income category in particular circumstances. 
The amendment also permits an entity to 
transfer from the available-for-sale category to 
the loans and receivables category a financial 
asset that would have met the definition of loans 
and receivables (if the financial asset had not 
been designated as available for sale), if the 
entity has the intention and ability to hold that 
financial asset for the foreseeable future. The 
Group did not elect to reclassify any financial 
assets following adoption of these standards. 
IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’, 
deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. 
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service 
conditions and performance conditions only. 
Other features of a share-based payment are 
not vesting conditions. These features would 
need to be included in the grant date fair value 
for transactions with employees and others 
providing similar services; they would not 
impact the number of awards expected to 
vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant 
date. All cancellations, whether by the entity  
or by other parties, should receive the same 
accounting treatment. The Group and 
Company have adopted IFRS 2 (amendment) 
from 1 January 2009. The amendment does 
not have a material impact on the Group’s or 
Company’s financial statements. 
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments – Disclosures’ 
(amendment), requires enhanced disclosures 
about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. 
The Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 
with effect from 1 January 2009. This requires 
disclosure of fair value measurements by level of 
the following fair value measurement hierarchy:  
• quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1);  
• inputs to a valuation model other than 
quoted prices included within Level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liability,  
 
either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) 
(Level 2); and 
• inputs to a valuation model for the asset or 
liability that are not based on observable 
market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 
(Level 3).  
The adoption of the amendment results in 
additional disclosures but there is no impact 
on the Group’s earnings per share. Please see 
note 3 for further details. 
IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’, replaces IAS 
14, ‘Segment reporting’, with its requirement 
to determine primary and secondary reporting 
segments. Under the requirements of the new 
standard, the Group’s external segment 
reporting will be based on the internal reporting 
to the Board of Directors of the Company  
(in its function as the chief operating decision-
maker), which makes decisions on the 
allocation of resources and assesses the 
performance of the reportable segments.  
The application of IFRS 8 does not have any 
material effects for the Group but has an 
impact on segment disclosure. The segment 
results have been amended accordingly.  
IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’, which was effective from 1 
January 2009, prohibits the presentation of 
items of income and expenses (that is, ‘non-
owner changes in equity’) in the statement of 
changes in equity. It therefore requires ‘non-
owner changes in equity’ to be presented 
separately from owner changes in equity  
in a statement of comprehensive income.  
As a result, the Group presents in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity 
all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-
owner changes in equity are presented in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Comparative information has been  
re-presented so that it also conforms with the 
revised standard. As the change in accounting 
policy only impacts presentation aspects, 
there is no impact on earnings per share.  
IFRIC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment in  
a foreign operation’, clarifies the accounting 
treatment in respect of net investment 
hedging. This includes the fact that net 
investment hedging relates to differences in 
functional currency not presentation currency, 
and hedging instruments may be held 
anywhere in the Group. The requirements  
of IAS 21, ‘The effects of changes in foreign 
exchange rates’, do apply to the hedged item. 
This interpretation does not have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.  www.amlin.com

(b) Standards, amendments to published 
standards and interpretations early adopted 
by the Group 
In 2009, the Group did not early adopt any 
new, revised or amended standards. 
(c) Standards, amendments and 
interpretations to existing standards that are 
not yet effective and have not been early 
adopted by the Group 
IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’. The amendment is part of the 
IASB’s annual improvements project 
published in April 2009. The amendment 
provides clarification that the potential 
settlement of a liability by the issue of equity  
is not relevant to its classification as current  
or non-current. By amending the definition  
of current liability, the amendment permits  
a liability to be classified as non-current 
(provided that the entity has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement by transfer of cash  
or other assets for at least 12 months after the 
accounting period) notwithstanding the fact 
that the entity could be required by the 
counterparty to settle in shares at any time. 
The Group and Company will apply IAS 1 
(amendment) from 1 January 2010. It is not 
expected to have a material impact on the 
Group or Company’s financial statements.  
IAS 24 (amendment), ‘Related party 
disclosures’. The amendment relaxes the 
disclosures of transactions between 
government-related entities and clarifies 
related-party definition. The amendment is  
not expected to have an impact on the Group 
or Company’s financial statements. 
IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate 
financial statements’. The revised standard 
requires the effects of all transactions with 
minority interests to be recorded in equity if 
there is no change in control and these 
transactions will no longer result in goodwill or 
gains and losses. The standard also specifies 
the accounting when control is lost. Any 
remaining interest in the entity is re-measured 
to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss. The Group will apply IAS 27 
(revised) prospectively to transactions with 
minority interests from 1 January 2010. 
IAS 32 (amendment), ‘Classification of rights 
issues’. The amended standard allows rights 
issues to be classified as equity when the 
price is denominated in a currency other than 
the entity’s functional currency. The amendment 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 February 2010 and should be applied 
retrospectively. The amendment is not 
expected to have an impact on the Group’s  
or Company’s financial statements. 
IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible assets’.  
The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual 
improvements project published in April 2009. 
The amendment clarifies guidance in 
measuring the fair value of an intangible asset 
acquired in a business combination and it 
permits the grouping of intangible assets as  
a single asset if each asset has a similar useful 
economic life. The Group and Company will 
apply IAS 38 (amendment) from 1 January 
2010. The amendment will not result in a 
material impact on the Group’s or Company’s 
financial statements.  
IAS 39 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement – eligible 
hedged items’. The amendment was issued  
in July 2008. It provides the following 
guidance. On the designation of a one-sided 
risk in a hedged item, IAS 39 concludes that a 
purchased option designated in its entirety as 
the hedging instrument of a one-sided risk will 
not be perfectly effective. The designation of 
inflation as a hedged risk or portion is not 
permitted unless in particular situations. It is 
not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group or Company’s financial statements. 
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’.  
The revised standard continues to apply the 
acquisition method to business combinations, 
with some significant changes. For example, 
all payments to purchase a business are to be 
recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, 
with contingent payments classified as debt 
subsequently re-measured through the 
income statement. There is a choice on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure 
the minority interest in the acquiree either  
at fair value or at the minority interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net 
assets. All acquisition-related costs should  
be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 
(revised) prospectively to all business 
combinations from 1 January 2010. 
IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Measurement of non-
current assets (or disposal groups) classified 
as held for sale’. The amendment is part  
of the IASB’s annual improvements project 
published in April 2009. The amendment 
provides clarification that IFRS 5, ‘Non-current 
assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’, specifies the disclosures required 
in respect of non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) classified as held for sale or 
discontinued operations. It also clarifies that 
the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, 
particularly IAS 1 paragraph 15 (to achieve a 
fair presentation) and paragraph 125 (sources 
of estimation uncertainty). The Group and 
Company will apply IFRS 5 (amendment) from 
1 January 2010. It is not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group or Company’s 
financial statements.  
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’. IFRS 9 
addresses classification and measurement  
of financial assets and is available for early 
adoption once endorsed by the EU. IFRS 9 
replaces the multiple classification and 
measurement models in IAS 39 with a single 
model that has only two classification 
categories: amortised cost and fair value. IFRS 
9 represents the first milestone in the IASB’s 
planned replacement of IAS 39. The effect of 
adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s and Company’s 
financial statements is currently being evaluated. 
IFRIC 17, ‘Distribution of non-cash assets  
to owners’. The interpretation is part of the 
IASB’s annual improvements project 
published in April 2009. It provides guidance 
on accounting for arrangements whereby  
an entity distributes non-cash assets to 
shareholders either as a distribution of 
reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also 
been amended to require that assets are 
classified as held for distribution only when 
they are available for distribution in their 
present condition and the distribution is highly 
probable. The Group and Company will apply 
IFRIC 17 from 1 January 2010. It is not 
expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s or Company’s financial statements.  
IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from 
customers’, was issued in January 2009.  
It clarifies how to account for transfers of 
items of property, plant and equipment by 
entities that receive such transfers from their 
customers. The interpretation also applies to 
agreements in which an entity receives cash 
from a customer when that amount of cash 
must be used only to construct or acquire an 
item of property, plant and equipment and the 
entity must then use that item to provide the 
customer with ongoing access to supply of 
goods and/or services. The Group will not  
be impacted by the adoption of IFRIC 18. 
Critical accounting judgements and  
key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of financial statements 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge 
of current events and actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those estimates. 
Insurance contract liabilities 
The most significant estimate made in  
the financial statements relates to unpaid 
insurance claim reserves and related loss 
adjustment expenses of the Group.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

1. Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued 
The estimated provision for the total level of 
claims incurred changes as more information 
becomes known about the actual losses  
for which the initial provisions were set up. 
The change in claims costs for prior period 
insurance claims represents the claims 
development of earlier reported years incurred 
in the current accounting period. In 2009, 
there has been a net positive development  
of £174.1 million (2008: £114.7 million) for the 
Group, reflecting favourable experience in the 
2008 and prior reported years. Note 3 provides 
further details of the method the Group applies 
in estimating insurance contract liabilities. 
Financial investments 
The methods and assumptions used by  
the Group and Company in estimating the  
fair value of financial assets are described  
in note 3. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are recognised on the 
acquisition of a subsidiary or the purchase  
of specific rights to renew a particular 
underwriting portfolio. 
The value of such intangibles is largely based 
on the expected cash flows of the business 
acquired and contractual rights on that 
business. Certain key assumptions are used to 
assess the value of the intangible such as past 
underwriting performance and past renewal 
values of underwriting business. These are the 
subject of specific uncertainty and a reduction 
in underwriting profitability or renewal patterns 
of business acquired may result in the value of 
the intangible being impaired and written off in 
the current accounting period. Note 22 provides 
further details of current impairments. 
Staff incentive plans 
The Group recognises a liability and expense 
for staff incentive plans based on a formula 
that takes into consideration the underwriting 
profit after certain adjustments. Underwriting 
profit is estimated based on current 
expectation of premiums and claims and will 
change as more information is known or future 
events occur. Where estimates change related 
staff incentive plan liabilities may also change. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
Following the departure of other key remaining 
employers in the scheme during 2008 the 
Group is now able to value reliably its 
proportionate share of the defined benefit 
obligation, plan assets and post-employment 
costs associated with its participation in the 
Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund defined benefit 
scheme. Since the acquisition of Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V., the Group also  
now operates defined benefit schemes in the 
Netherlands and Belgium.  
The amounts included in these financial 
statements are sensitive to changes in the 
assumptions used to derive the value of the 
scheme assets and liabilities.  
An expense of £23.7 million (2008: £5.9  
million) has been recognised in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income and a debit of  
£2.3 million (2008: £2.6 million credit) has 
been recognised in the Income Statement. 
Note 28 provides further details of the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations.  
Foreign currency translation 
The Group and Company present their 
accounts in Sterling since they are subject to 
regulation in the United Kingdom and the net 
assets, liabilities and income of the Group and 
Company are currently weighted towards 
Sterling. US dollar and Euro revenues are 
significant but the Sterling revenue stream is 
also currently material. All Group entities are 
incorporated in the United Kingdom with the 
exception of Amlin Bermuda Holdings Ltd, 
Amlin Bermuda Ltd (both incorporated in 
Bermuda), Amlin Illinois, Inc. (the United 
States of America), Amlin France SAS, Anglo 
French Underwriters SAS (both France), Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. (the Netherlands) 
and Amlin Singapore Pte Limited (Singapore). 
All Group entities conduct business in a range 
of economic environments, although these are 
primarily the United Kingdom, United States  
of America and Continental Europe. Due to the 
regulatory environment and the fact that the 
Group trades through the Lloyd’s market, all 
Group companies incorporated in the United 
Kingdom have adopted Sterling as their 
functional currency, although Amlin Overseas 
Holdings Limited’s Netherlands operation has 
adopted the Euro as its functional currency. 
The Group companies incorporated in 
Bermuda and the United States of America 
have adopted the US dollar as their functional 
currency. Amlin Singapore Pte Limited has 
adopted the Singapore dollar as its functional 
currency. The Group companies incorporated 
in France and the Netherlands have adopted 
the Euro as their functional currency. 
Transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing  
in the period in which the asset or liability first 
arose. Exchange differences are recognised 
within other operating expenses. 
The results and financial position of those 
Group entities whose functional currency  
is not Sterling are translated into Sterling  
as follows: 
• Assets and liabilities for each balance 
sheet presented are translated at the 
closing exchange rate at the date of the 
balance sheet; 
• Income and expenses for each income 
statement are translated at average 
exchange rates during the period (as an 
approximation to the exchange rates at  
the dates of each transaction); and 
• On consolidation all resulting exchange 
differences are recognised as a 
component of equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising  
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate.  
Where contracts to sell currency have been 
entered into prior to the year end, the 
contracted rates have been used. Differences 
arising on the translation of foreign currency 
amounts on such items are included in other 
operating expenses. 
Insurance contracts premium 
Gross written premium comprises premium  
on insurance contracts incepting during the 
financial year. The estimated premium income 
in respect of facility contracts, for example 
binding authorities and lineslips, is deemed  
to be written in full at the inception of the 
contract. Premium is disclosed before the 
deduction of brokerage and taxes or duties 
levied on them. Estimates are included for 
premium receivable after the period end but 
not yet notified, as well as adjustments made 
in the year to premium written in prior 
accounting periods. 
The proportion of gross written premium, 
gross of commission payable, attributable  
to periods after the balance sheet date is 
deferred as a provision for unearned premium. 
The change in this provision is taken to the 
income statement in order that revenue is 
recognised over the period of the risk. 
Premium is earned over the policy contract 
period. The earned element is calculated 
separately for each contract on a 365ths 
basis. For premium written under facilities  
the earned element is calculated based on  
the estimated risk profile of the portfolio of 
contracts involved.  www.amlin.com

Acquisition costs 
Acquisition costs comprise brokerage incurred 
on insurance contracts written during the 
financial year. They are incurred on the same 
basis as the earned proportions of the premium 
they relate to. Deferred acquisition costs are 
amortised over the period in which the related 
revenues are earned. Deferred acquisition 
costs are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period and are written off where they 
are no longer considered to be recoverable. 
Reinsurance premium ceded 
Reinsurance premium ceded comprises the 
cost of reinsurance arrangements placed  
and are accounted for in the same accounting 
period as the related insurance contracts.  
The provision for reinsurers’ share of unearned 
premium represents that part of reinsurance 
written premium which is estimated to be 
earned in following financial years.  
Insurance contracts liabilities 
Claims paid are defined as those claims 
transactions settled up to the balance sheet 
date including internal and external claims 
settlement expenses allocated to those 
transactions.  
Unpaid claims reserves are made for known  
or anticipated liabilities under insurance 
contracts which have not been settled up to 
the balance sheet date. Included within the 
provision is an allowance for the future costs 
of settling those claims. This is estimated 
based on past experience and current 
expectations of future cost levels. 
Unpaid claims reserves are estimated on an 
undiscounted basis. Unpaid claims reserves 
acquired through a business combination are 
measured at fair value, using an applicable 
risk-free discount rate and having regard to 
the expected settlement dates of the claims. 
Provisions are subject to a detailed quarterly 
review where forecast future cash flows and 
existing amounts provided are reviewed and 
reassessed. Any changes to the amounts held 
are adjusted through the income statement. 
Provisions are established above an actuarial 
best estimate, reflecting a risk premium 
relating to the uncertainty on the actual level  
of claims incurred. There is therefore a 
reasonable chance of release of reserves  
from one underwriting year to the next. 
The unpaid claims reserves also include, 
where necessary, a reserve for unexpired  
risks where, at the balance sheet date, the 
estimated costs of future claims and related 
deferred acquisition costs are expected to 
exceed the unearned premium provision.  
Reinsurance contracts held 
Contracts entered into by the Group with 
reinsurers under which the Group is 
compensated for losses on contracts issued  
by the Group and that meet the classification 
requirements for insurance contracts are 
classified as reinsurance contracts held. 
Insurance contracts entered into by the Group 
under which the contract holder is another 
insurer (inwards reinsurance) are included 
within insurance contracts. 
The benefits to which the Group is entitled 
under its reinsurance contracts held are 
recognised as reinsurance assets. These 
assets consist of short-term balances due 
from reinsurers, as well as longer-term 
receivables that are dependent on the 
expected claims and benefits arising under  
the related reinsured insurance contracts. 
Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers 
are measured consistently with the amounts 
associated with the reinsured insurance 
contracts and in accordance with the terms  
of each reinsurance contract.  
Where there is objective evidence that a 
reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount of the 
reinsurance asset to its recoverable amount 
and recognises that impairment loss in the 
income statement. 
Salvage and subrogation 
reimbursements  
Some insurance contracts permit the Group  
to sell (usually damaged) property acquired  
in settling a claim (for example, salvage). The 
Group may also have the right to pursue third 
parties for payment of some or all costs (for 
example, subrogation).  
Estimates of salvage recoveries are included 
as an allowance in the measurement of the 
insurance liability for claims, and salvage 
property is recognised in other insurance 
assets when the liability is settled. The 
allowance is the amount that can reasonably 
be recovered from the disposal of the property.  
Subrogation reimbursements are also 
considered as an allowance in the 
measurement of the insurance liability for 
claims and are recognised in other assets 
when the liability is settled. The allowance is  
the assessment of the amount that can be 
recovered from the action against the liable 
third party. 
Net investment income 
Dividends and any related tax credits are 
recognised as income on the date that the 
related listed investments are marked ex-
dividend. Other investment income, interest 
receivable, expenses and interest payable are 
recognised on an accruals basis. 
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision-maker. The 
chief operating decision-maker, which is 
responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing the performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Board  
of Directors of the Company.  
Business combinations 
The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted 
for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group at the date of 
exchange, plus any costs directly attributable 
to the business combination. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value 
at the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any minority interest. The excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Interests in jointly owned entities 
Investments in jointly owned entities are 
accounted for using the equity method. 
Operations held for sale 
Assets and liabilities held for disposal as  
part of operations which are held for sale are 
shown separately in the consolidated balance 
sheet. The relevant assets are recorded at the 
lower of their carrying amount and their fair 
value, less the estimated selling costs. 
Operations held for sale are being actively 
marketed to external investors. After one year 
in which in excess of 50% of the operation is 
held by the Group, the assets and liabilities 
are consolidated unless the delay in attracting 
sufficient external investment is due to 
circumstances beyond the Group’s control 
and previously considered unlikely. When the 
Group ceases to hold a 50% interest in the 
assets and liabilities, it shall be re-designated 
as fair value through income. 
Intangible assets 
i. Syndicate capacity 
The cost of Lloyd’s syndicate participations 
that have been purchased in the Lloyd’s 
capacity auctions is capitalised at cost. 
Syndicate capacity is considered to have an 
indefinite life as it will provide benefits over  
an indefinite future period and is therefore not 
subject to an annual amortisation charge. The 
continuing value of the capacity is reviewed 
for impairment annually by reference to the 
expected future profit streams to be earned 
from Syndicate 2001, with any impairment in 
value being charged to the income statement.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

accounting policies continued 
ii. Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 
January 1999 was written off to reserves. 
Goodwill recognised between 1 January 1999 
and the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 
2004) was capitalised and amortised on a 
straight line basis over its estimated useful life. 
Following the transition to IFRS this goodwill  
is stated at net book value at 1 January 2004. 
Goodwill that was recognised subsequent to  
1 January 2004 is capitalised. Goodwill is 
tested for impairment annually, or when 
events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that it might be impaired, by comparing the 
net present value of the future earnings stream 
from the acquired subsidiary, against the 
carrying value of the goodwill and the carrying 
value of the related net assets. 
iii. Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets comprise costs 
directly attributable to securing the intangible 
rights to broker and customer relationships. 
Costs are recognised as intangible assets 
where they can be identified separately and 
measured reliably and it is probable that they 
will be recovered by directly related future 
profits. Other intangible assets are reviewed 
for impairment losses annually or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Other intangible assets are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. Amortisation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis based  
on the estimated useful economic life of  
the broker and customer relationships. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and provision for impairment where appropriate. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight line 
method to write down the cost of such assets 
to their residual values over their estimated 
useful lives as follows: 
Leasehold land and 
buildings 
over period  
of lease 
Freehold buildings 5% per annum 
Motor vehicles 33% per annum 
Computer equipment 33% per annum 
Furniture, fixtures and 
leasehold improvements 20% per annum 
The carrying values of property and equipment 
are reviewed for impairment annually or when 
events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. If any 
such condition exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of impairment and the difference  
is charged to the income statement. 
Gains and losses on disposal of property and 
equipment are determined by reference to 
their carrying amount and are taken to the 
income statement. Repairs and renewals are 
charged to the income statement when the 
expenditure is incurred. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
The Group and Company classifies its 
financial assets as fair value through income 
(FV) or available for sale. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition. 
Other than investments in certain unlisted 
insurance intermediaries (see below), the 
Group and Company classifies its financial 
investments as FV to the extent that they are 
not reported as cash and cash equivalents. 
This classification requires all fair value 
changes to be recognised immediately within 
the investment return line in the income 
statement. Within the FV category, fixed 
maturity and equity securities are classified  
as ‘trading’ as the Group and Company buys 
with the intention to resell. All other securities 
are classified as ‘other than trading’ within  
the FV category. 
The Group and Company has investments  
in certain unlisted insurance intermediaries 
which are treated as available for sale and  
are measured at fair value. Changes in fair 
value of investments are included in Other 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which 
they arise. They are tested for impairment 
annually, or when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that an impairment 
might have occurred. When securities 
classified as available for sale are sold or 
impaired, the accumulated fair value 
adjustments recognised in equity are included  
in the income statement as ‘gains and losses 
from investment securities’. If in a subsequent 
period the fair value of an investment 
classified as available for sale increases  
and the increase can be objectively related  
to an event occurring after the impairment  
loss was recognised in the income statement, 
the impairment loss is reversed through the 
income statement. 
Purchases and sales of investments are 
recognised on the trade date, which is the 
date the Group or Company commits to 
purchase or sell the assets. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value based on quoted  
bid prices. Changes in the fair value of 
investments are included in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
The uncertainty around bond valuation is 
discussed further in note 3. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into. Fair values for over-the-counter 
derivatives are supplied by the relevant 
counterparty. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments are recognised 
immediately in the income statement unless 
the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument. As defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, 
the Group designates certain foreign currency 
derivatives as hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations. The Group documents at 
the inception of each hedging transaction the 
relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking 
various hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether 
the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values of hedged items. 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
related to the effective portion is recognised  
in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The fair values of 
derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are disclosed in note 17. Gains  
and losses accumulated in equity are included 
in the income statement when the foreign 
operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using an effective interest  
rate. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the 
income statement when there is evidence  
that the asset is impaired. These are reversed 
when the triggering event that caused the 
impairment is reversed. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are stated initially at the 
consideration received net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Any difference between 
amortised cost and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings. Transaction costs  
on borrowings are charged through the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs comprise interest payable  
on loans and bank overdrafts and 
commissions charged for the utilisation of 
letters of credit. These costs are charged  
to the income statement as financing costs,   www.amlin.com

 131
as incurred. In addition, fees paid for the 
arrangement of debt and letter of credit 
facilities are charged to borrowing costs  
over the life of the facility. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value. For the purposes 
of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits 
held on call with banks and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments which are believed  
to be subject to insignificant risk of change  
in fair value. 
Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury 
shares. Any consideration paid or received  
is recognised directly in equity. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases and hire 
purchase transactions are capitalised in the 
balance sheet and depreciated over their 
useful lives. The initial capital value is the 
lower of the fair value of the leased asset  
and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Payments under finance leases  
are apportioned between finance charges and 
the reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a consistent rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the lease liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to income in the period in which they 
become payable in accordance with the terms 
of the lease. 
Employee benefits 
i. Pension obligations  
The Group participates in a number of pension 
schemes, including several defined benefit 
schemes, defined contribution schemes and 
personal pension schemes. 
The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund scheme is  
a multi-employer defined benefit scheme. 
Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V., which was 
acquired by the Group in the year, participates 
in two defined benefit schemes. 
The defined benefit obligation and associated 
pension costs are calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. This method sees each period 
of service as giving rise to an additional unit  
of benefit entitlement and measures each unit 
separately to build up the final liability. The 
cost of providing these benefits is charged to 
the income statement to spread the pension 
cost over the service lives of employees. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from the 
recognition and funding of the Group’s 
pension obligations are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income during 
the period in which they arise. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in 
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the 
present value of the fair value of plan assets 
less the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date, together with adjustments 
for unrecognised past-service costs. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high quality corporate bonds that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the 
related pension liability.  
Pension contributions to defined contribution 
plans are charged to the income statement 
when due.  
ii. Equity compensation plans  
The Company operates a number of executive 
and employee share schemes. Options issued 
after 7 November 2002 are accounted for using 
the fair value method where the cost for 
providing equity compensation is based on the 
fair value of the share option or award at the date 
of the grant. The fair value is calculated using an 
option pricing model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised in the income statement 
over the vesting period. The accrual for this 
charge is recognised in equity shareholders’ 
funds. When the options are exercised, the 
proceeds received net of any transaction costs 
are credited to share capital for the par value  
and the surplus to share premium. 
iii. Other benefits  
Other employee incentive schemes and long-
term service awards, including sabbatical 
leave, are recognised when they accrue to 
employees. A provision is made for the 
estimated liability for long-service leave as  
a result of services rendered by employees  
up to the balance sheet date. 
Other income  
Fee income from providing information 
services is recognised on an earned basis. 
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of  
the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from 
net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years or that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s and Company’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities in the financial statements  
and the corresponding tax bases used in  
the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the Group and Company is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered,  
or to the extent that it has been utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or 
loss, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case  
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax is provided for on the profits of 
overseas subsidiaries where it is reasonably 
foreseeable that distribution of the profit back 
to the UK will take place and the UK dividend 
exemption is not expected to apply. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s and Company’s financial statements 
in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009 
Notes to the Accounts continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2009

2. Capital 
The capital structure of the Group consists  
of equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and note 23, and subordinated debt as 
disclosed in note 27. For business planning 
purposes, account is also taken of the 
Group’s undrawn debt facilities as disclosed  
in note 27. 
The Amlin corporate member, which supports 
Syndicate 2001, is required to hold regulatory 
capital in compliance with the rules issued by 
the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA).  
In addition, being a Lloyd’s operation it is also 
subject to Lloyd’s capital requirements. Under 
FSA rules, the corporate member must hold 
capital in excess of the higher of two amounts. 
The first is the Pillar 1 requirement, as 
prescribed by EU directives, calculated by 
applying fixed percentages to premiums and 
claims. The second, Pillar 2, is an Individual 
Capital Assessment (ICA) calculated internally 
by the firm. The ICA is defined as the level of 
capital that is required to contain the 
probability of insolvency, over a one year 
timeframe, to no greater than 0.5%. The ICA 
calculation basis is generally considered to be 
broadly equivalent to a BBB insurance 
financial strength rating. The ICA calculation 
considers all ultimate losses incurred over a 
one year business planning horizon, and any 
prior year reserve movements. 
For the purposes of setting Lloyd’s capital 
requirements, Lloyd’s currently uplifts all ICAs 
by 35% (2008: 35%) to bring the capital to  
a level to support a higher financial strength 
rating. The final capital requirement is then 
subject to a minimum of 40% (2008: 40%)  
of the syndicate’s agreed regulatory premium 
capacity limit. 
The syndicate also benefits from mutualised 
capital within the Lloyd’s Central Fund, for which 
a variable annual levy, for 2009 of 0.5% (2008: 
0.5%), of syndicate gross premium is payable. 
The ICA is reviewed annually by Lloyd’s and 
periodically by the FSA. The FSA expect 
management to apply their rules continuously. 
If a firm breaches its Pillar 1 capital it must 
cease trading; if Pillar 2 capital is breached 
steps must be taken urgently to restore capital 
to the required level. Due to the nature of the 
Lloyd’s capital setting process, Funds at Lloyd’s 
requirements are formally assessed and funded 
twice yearly at discrete periods and must be 
met for the Syndicate to continue underwriting. 
At 31 December 2009 the level of capital held 
on behalf of the Amlin corporate member was 
more than £200 million (2008: £200 million)  
 
in excess of the Pillar 1 requirement and more 
than £20 million (2008: £45 million) in excess 
of the Pillar 2 requirement. 
The Group does not seek to retain any assets in 
excess of the Lloyd’s capital requirement within 
the Lloyd’s framework and any surplus is paid to 
the corporate entities in the Group. 
Amlin Bermuda’s minimum capital 
requirements are determined by the rules laid 
down by the Bermuda Monetary Authority 
(BMA) regulations. It is classified as a Class IV 
reinsurer and the minimum solvency margin is 
the greatest of US$100 million, 50% of net 
premiums written in the current financial year, 
15% of claims reserves and the Enhanced 
Capital Requirement (ECR). The ECR is 
calculated on an annual basis through either 
the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement 
(BSCR) model or an approved internal model. 
As at 31 December 2009, the ECR was the 
largest of the four criteria at approximately 
US$424.6 million (2008: US$379.4 million).  
In addition, as a Class IV reinsurer it is 
required to maintain minimum liquidity ratio 
such that the value of ‘relevant assets’ is  
not less than 75% of its ‘relevant liabilities’. 
Amlin Bermuda met this requirement at  
31 December 2009. For trading purposes 
management believes that it is necessary to 
hold at least US$1 billion of capital, which is 
currently in excess of the required minimum. 
Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) is 
required to hold regulatory capital in 
compliance with the rules issued by its 
regulator and as prescribed by EU directives. 
Regulatory capital is calculated by applying 
fixed percentages to premiums and claims.  
At 31 December 2009, ACI’s available regulatory 
capital was €308.0 million compared to a 
minimum requirement of €111.0 million. For 
wider commercial reasons, ACI’s capital is 
managed so as to support its financial 
strength ratings. 
The method by which the Group manages  
its capital base is described on page 61 of  
the Performance section under Financial 
Management. 
In addition to regulatory capital requirements, 
the Group believes that it should retain a level 
of capital within the Group to allow it to grow 
its exposures materially in the aftermath of a 
major insurance disaster, but also to respond 
to other opportunities to enhance long-term 
growth, for example through acquisition. The 
overall capital held by the Group is driven by 
the business mix, nature and objectives of 
each business unit and its context within the 
wider Group. 
3. Risk disclosures  
3.1 Underwriting risk 
The Group accepts underwriting risk in a  
range of classes of business through Lloyd’s 
Syndicate 2001, Amlin Bermuda and Amlin 
Corporate Insurance. Syndicate 2001’s portfolio 
is underwritten by Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
through its wholly owned coverholder in France, 
Anglo French Underwriters SAS (AFU). The bias 
of the Group’s portfolio is towards short-tail 
property and accident risk but liability coverage 
is also underwritten. 
In underwriting insurance or reinsurance 
policies the Group’s underwriters use their 
skill, knowledge and data on past claims 
experience to evaluate the likely claims cost 
and therefore the premium that should be 
sufficient (across a portfolio of risks) to cover 
claims costs, expenses and to produce an 
acceptable profit. However, due to the nature 
of insurance risk there is no guarantee that the 
premium charged will be sufficient to cover 
claims costs. This shortfall may originate either 
from insufficient premium being calculated and 
charged or may result from an unexpected,  
or unprecedented, high level of claims.  
A number of controls are deployed to limit the 
amount of insurance exposure underwritten. 
Each year a business plan is prepared and 
agreed which is used to monitor the amount of 
premium income, and exposure, to be written in 
total and for each class of business. Progress 
against this plan is monitored during the year. 
The Group also operates under a line guide that 
determines the maximum liability per policy that 
can be written for each class (on a gross or net 
of facultative reinsurance basis) and for each 
underwriter. These can be exceeded in 
exceptional circumstances but only with the 
approval of senior management. Apart from  
the UK motor liability, ACI fleet and some of  
the international comprehensive motor liability 
portfolio, which has unlimited liability, all 
policies have a per loss limit which caps the 
size of any individual claims. For larger sum 
insured risks facultative reinsurance coverage 
may be purchased. The Group is also exposed 
to catastrophe losses which may impact many 
risks in a single event and again reinsurance is 
purchased to limit the impact of loss 
aggregation from such events. These 
reinsurance arrangements are described in the 
reinsurance arrangements section on page 138. 
Insurance liabilities are written through 
individual risk acceptances, reinsurance 
treaties or through facilities whereby Amlin is 
bound by other underwriting entities. Facility 
arrangements delegate underwriting authority 
to other underwriters, or to agents acting as 
coverholders, that use their judgement to write 
risks on our behalf under clear authority levels.  www.amlin.com

The insurance liabilities underwritten by the 
Group are reviewed on an individual risk, or 
contract, basis and through review of portfolio 
performance. Claims arising are reserved 
upon notification. Each quarter the entire 
portfolio of business is subject to a reserving 
process whereby levels of paid and 
outstanding (advised but not paid) claims are 
reviewed. Potential future claims are assessed 
with a provision for incurred but not reported 
(IBNR) claims being made. This provision is 
subject to review by senior executives and an 
independent internal actuarial assessment is 
usually carried out by external actuaries or the 
in-house actuarial team to determine the 
adequacy of the provision. Whilst a detailed 
and disciplined exercise is carried out to 
provide for claims notified, it is possible that 
known claims could develop and exceed the 
reserves carried. Furthermore, there is 
increased uncertainty in establishing an 
accurate provision for IBNR claims and there 
is a possibility that claims may arise which in 
aggregate exceed the reserve provision 
established. This is partly mitigated by the 
reserving policy adopted by the Group which 
is to carry reserves with a margin in excess of 
the actuarial best estimate. 
The review of claims arising may result in 
underwriters adjusting pricing levels to cater 
for an unexpectedly higher trend of claims 
advices or payments. However, this may not 
be possible in a competitive market and 
underwriters may respond either by accepting 
business with lower expected profit margins or 
declining to renew policies and thus reducing 
income. Also, there is a portfolio of risk already 
underwritten which cannot be re-priced until 
renewal at the end of the policy period. 
The Group is exposed to the impact of large 
catastrophe events such as windstorms, 
earthquakes or terrorist incidents. Exposure to 
such events is controlled and measured through 
loss modelling, but the accuracy of this exposure 
analysis is limited by the quality of data and the 
effectiveness of the modelling. The Group’s 
broad risk appetite guidelines are set out on 
page 47. It is possible that a catastrophe event 
exceeds the maximum expected event loss. 
This is particularly the case for the direct 
property proportion of the loss exposure where 
models are used to calculate a damage factor 
representing the amount of damage expected 
to exposed aggregate insured values. Errors,  
or incorrect assumptions, in the damage factor 
calculation can result in incurred catastrophe 
event claims higher, or lower, than predicted 
due to unforeseen circumstances or 
inadequacies in the models used. As explained 
on page 138 reinsurance is purchased to 
protect against the impact of any individual or 
series of severe catastrophes. However, the 
price and availability of such cover is variable 
and the amount of loss retained by the Group 
may therefore also increase or reduce. The 
Group will alter its insurance and reinsurance 
exposures to take account of the change in 
reinsurance availability in order to remain within 
the risk appetite guidelines.

Catastrophe reinsurance protects insurance 
companies against catastrophic losses, such 
as windstorm or earthquake, which may 
impact more than one risk written by the client.  
This portfolio is a key part of the insurance risk 
written by the Group. Programmes are placed 
on a layered or excess of loss basis. Territorial 
exposures, from a number of programmes, 
are much higher, but are carefully recorded 
and analysed through loss simulations or 
realistic disaster scenarios.  
Per risk property reinsurance is also written  
on an excess of loss basis but covers loss or 
damage to a single risk within the reinsured’s 
portfolio. This portfolio protects insureds 
against large individual property losses and 
will also be affected by large catastrophes. 
Proportional reinsurance covers a proportional 
share of a reinsureds portfolio of business 
subject to payment of commission and/or 
profit commission. Almost all proportional 
reinsurance written by the Group in this class 
is property business and risk exposure is 
limited to US$7.5 million for any one risk.  
The portfolio of Reinsurance business is 
written with the aim of achieving territorial 
diversification. However, a severe catastrophe 
to a major economic zone in Europe, Japan, 
Australasia or the USA is likely to result in an 
overall loss to the portfolio prior to 
retrocessional reinsurance.  
A. (ii) Other reinsurance risks 
The Group also writes other reinsurance 
classes which contribute diversified exposure

The business writes a portfolio of aviation  
and marine reinsurance risk which protects 
insurers against losses to their direct portfolios 
of business. This is written on an excess of 
loss basis. 
The special risks account is mostly terrorism 
excess of loss reinsurance which is written 
from all parts of the world and is written 
without reinsurance protection.

Property cover is provided to large 
commercial enterprises with high value 
locations and/or many locations and also for 
small commercial property. The perils covered 
include fire, flood, wind and earthquake 
damage. Business interruption cover is also 
provided for loss of earnings sustained due  
to the perils and properties covered but may 
also be extended to connected enterprises. 
Terrorism cover is given on a limited basis 
particularly where required by local regulation, 
but nuclear and bio-chemical coverage is 
excluded in most territories.  
Direct and facultative property insurance is 
written for the full value of the risk, on a primary 
or excess of loss basis, through individual 
placements, or by way of delegated 
underwriting facilities given to coverholders 
(‘binding authorities’). Binding authority 
arrangements delegate the day to day 
underwriting to underwriting agents working on 
our behalf. For these contracts, we are reliant 
on a coverholder exercising underwriting 
judgement on our behalf. Coverholders have  
to have local regulatory approval, be Lloyd’s 
registered and also be approved by the Amlin 
Binding Authority Committee. For all binding 
authorities facilities we receive a monthly or 
quarterly bordereau which is checked by our 
underwriting staff. We control the underwriting 
by setting clear authority levels for coverholders 
stipulated within the binding authority 
agreement, regularly monitoring performance 
and periodically carrying out underwriting visits 
and or commissioning third party audits. The 
coverholder is incentivised to produce an 
underwriting profit through the payments of 
profit commission. However, with the day to 
day underwriting not controlled by Amlin, there 
is a risk that coverholder underwriting or claim 
decisions are made which would not have been 
made by Amlin underwriters or claims staff.  
The maximum value insured under the Binders 
class is currently limited to US$3 million at any 
one location.  
The property portfolio is also exposed to an 
above average frequency of individual fire, 
explosion or weather related claims. The 
premium charged for the coverage given may 
not be sufficient to cover all claims made in 
any year, particularly in a year in which there is 
an abnormal frequency of claims. This account 
is mainly situated in the USA and is therefore 
exposed to large catastrophe events such as 
California earthquake and hurricane losses.  
A. (iv) US casualty risks 
The US casualty portfolio of business provides 
insurance and reinsurance cover to individuals, 
or companies, in order to indemnify them 
against legal liability arising from their activities 
and actions or for incidents occurring on their 
property. The account is currently written to  
a maximum liability of US$6 million on any  
one claim but average lines are US$0.8 million 
on any one claim. 2009 gross premium was  
£38 million.  
The portfolio is made up of specialist general 
casualty, professional indemnity, medical 
malpractice and errors and omissions cover. 
Small amounts of directors’ and officers’ liability 
and auto liability are also written. The class is 
mostly written on a claims notified basis 
(responding to all claims made during a defined 
period) except for small amounts of general 
liability business which may be written on a 
losses occurring basis (the policy responds to 
losses which occur during the period even if 
reported after the policy has expired).  
Claims from this class emanate from 
professional error, negligence or an accident 
which causes injury, damage or financial loss. 
The account is vulnerable to a high frequency 
of claims, but not individual large losses as the 
cost to Amlin of any individual claim is small. 
Claims frequency may be impacted by a 
generic claim type which impacts many 
individuals and (re)insurance policies such as 
poor housing design or bad medical practice. 
The size of many individual claims is subject  
to the decisions arising from the US court 
system which can be higher than anticipated. 
There is also the potential for US courts to 
impose a ‘bad faith’ judgement on insurers  
if it is deemed that the insurer has acted 
improperly in trying to avoid contractual 
obligations. Such awards can, in exceptional 
circumstances, be much higher than the value 
of the insurance claim. 
A. (v) Accident and health, auto and 
special risks 
The Group also writes other property and 
casualty classes which contribute diversified 
exposure to the portfolio. The main classes 
with the maximum sum insured lines are

(2) Maximum line size is after business written and

(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs. 
The accident and health class is written 
through medical expense schemes in the USA 
and direct personal accident cover, or personal 
accident reinsurance, worldwide. Medical 
expense cover is subject to a high frequency 
of claim and significant medical cost inflation. 
Personal accident insurance and reinsurance 
could be impacted by a single or series of 
accidents to high value insured individuals or 
by a multiple death and injury event such as 
an air crash or natural catastrophe.  
The auto class covers property damage only 
(fire, theft and collision) in the USA and property 
damage and third party motor liability 
combined cover in other international territories. 
This class could be impacted by unexpected 
claim frequency, a multi vehicle event such as 
a severe flood and also large bodily injury 
award claims emanating from an accident.  www.amlin.com

(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs. 
The hull and cargo account is worldwide, 
covering property damage to ships and loss, 
or damage, to a large variety of cargo or 
goods in transit. The hull account can include 
machinery breakdown and the account written 
has historically been targeted towards lower 
value tonnage, smaller ‘brownwater’ vessels 
and fishing boats. In December 2009 the 
employment of a new leading class 
underwriter for larger ‘bluewater’ ocean hull 
will result in the development of a book of 
larger tonnage vessels. These accounts can 
be impacted by attritional claims of a small 
size as well as a single individual large claim. 
The cargo account in particular could also be 
involved in a major natural catastrophe loss.  
In an economic recession, it is expected that 
premium income will fall from these areas as 
trade reduces and hull values are impacted by 
reduced freight rates. This trend has occurred 
in 2009 with reductions in the quantity and 
value of cargo shipments. It is also possible 
that claims frequency increases due to 
increased economic pressures affecting fraud 
and theft claims. 
The energy portfolio is mainly offshore rig and 
construction policies which may be impacted 
by large individual claims from construction 
fault or property damage such as fire or 
explosion, but is also exposed to severe 
catastrophe losses in the North Sea and Gulf 
of Mexico. The account includes control of 
well to limit loss of oil and avoid pollution and 
also some business interruption cover which 
indemnifies companies for loss of production. 
War business includes aviation, marine and  
on land terrorism coverage and is exposed to 
single incidents or a series of losses arising 
from concerted action. A small amount of 
political risk, confiscation and contract 
frustration is written.  
Specie business consists of the insurance 
against damage to or theft of fine art, the 
contents of vaults and other high value goods 
including jewellers’ block and cash in transit. 
The fine art may be shown at exhibitions 
which have very high aggregate values at risk. 
The class is therefore exposed to the potential 
for a frequency of small claims and also large 
individual losses. Some specie is written in 
catastrophe zones e.g. California. 
The bloodstock account protects for death, 
illness or injury to horses mainly in the UK but 
business from the USA, Australia and South 
Africa is also written. This covers racing or 
eventing horses and breeding studs. The 
average value insured is below £1 million but 
there is the potential for an aggregate loss, 
such as a stable fire, which could cause 
multiple claims.  
Crowe Livestock, a leading Lloyd’s 
coverholder for the insurance of livestock,  
was acquired in November 2009. This agency 
writes a broad portfolio of protection for 
livestock and specialist products such as zoo 
animals, with a maximum line of any one 
policy of £10 million. The company also writes 
employers’ liability cover for employees’ 
livestock business up to a limit of £10 million. 
Again, an event affecting several animals 
across many policies such as disease could 
result in a loss significantly higher than this.  
Yacht business covers property damage and 
third party injury for small leisure boats and 
craft. The bulk of the account is smaller value 
yachts in the UK and Europe, although there 
are a number of binders written by 
coverholders elsewhere, such as Scandinavia, 
Canada and Australia. There is an expectation 
of a large number of small claims, as average 
values are low in comparison to other claims 
written in the Group. Third party liability yacht 
claims arise from injury or damage caused  
by one of our policyholders to third parties. 
There is also the potential for a large 
catastrophe loss such as a UK windstorm 
where there are large aggregate sums insured 
in coastal regions such as southern England.  
The marine liability portfolio is written to 
protect ship-owners, harbours, charterers  
and energy companies against damage  
or injury to third parties. This includes the 
potential for pollution damage and clean-up 
claims. The account could suffer a large 
catastrophe incident from a collision causing 
death of crew and passengers or an oil, or 
chemical, spill which could incur large clean-
up costs.  
A. (vii) Aviation risks  
The Group underwrites a direct and facultative 
reinsurance account domiciled in most parts 
of the world. The portfolio is made up of the 
following classes with maximum lines.

(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs. 
The airline account is exposed to large claims 
arising from property damage, death or injury 
arising from aircraft accidents. The domicile  
of the airline and passengers has a notable 
influence on the cost of claims; for example 
US court awards are generally higher.  
The general aviation account covers smaller 
aircraft or cargo and covers owners or 
operators against loss or damage and third 
party injury. The risk excess account is a book 
of general aviation reinsurance business 
written to protect a small number of insurers 
against large general aviation claims. 
Airport liability insurance covers airport 
operators, refuellers and air traffic controllers 
against losses arising from injury caused by 
their activities or occurring on their premises. 
Product liability covers manufacturers against 
accidents arising from faulty parts or 
equipment, or poor servicing of aircraft. Both 
airport and product liability coverage is written 
on a losses occurring basis meaning that 
claims advices can be made after the policy 
has expired. Space insurance covers property 
and liability during launch and the operation of 
satellites whilst in orbit for a limited period, 
normally of one year.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

3. Risk disclosures continued 
The Aviation account is subject to both small 
and large claims. Claims involving loss of life  
or serious injury to high earning passengers or 
third parties are subject to the ongoing inflation 
of court awards particularly in the US. Large 
accidents involving the potential death of 500  
or more passengers are feasible and could 
potentially result in a gross claim to the 
business of more than the vertical reinsurance 
programme if, for example, two large aircraft 
were to collide. Space losses are generally large 
single claim amounts caused by launch failure 
or operational failure in orbit. The principal 
Aviation accounts are protected by a 
reinsurance programme on both a risk sharing 
(proportional) and excess of loss basis. The 
Group reinsurance arrangements are discussed 
on page 138. The space account is written with 
risks shared with Amlin Bermuda but is not 
protected by excess of loss reinsurance.

The Group writes three classes of 
predominantly UK liability. The vast majority  
of the business emanates from the UK with 
the balance mainly from Ireland and Canada.  
Employers’ liability insurance protects 
employers against accident or injury to 
employees. This is written on a losses occurring 
basis (covering events that occurred in the 
policy period even if they are not notified  
until after expiry) for limits up to £27 million  
per employer.  
Public liability insurance provides coverage, 
often written in conjunction with employers’ 
liability, for accident or injury occurring to 
clients, customers or another third party as a 
result of contact with the insured’s personnel, 
property or products. This is written on a 
losses occurring basis currently, for limits  
up to £12 million per assured.  
Professional indemnity covers liability which 
may arise from services provided by the 
assured, for example as a result of negligence 
or error which may lead to financial or physical 
loss. This includes, but is not limited to, 
services from architects, engineers, surveyors, 
advertising firms, medical professionals and 
financial advisors and is written on a claims 
made basis (covering losses notified in the 
policy period). 
Amlin UK package policies combine one  
or more of the liability coverages, mainly 
employers’ and public liability with motor 
and/or property damage protection. Stand 
alone property protection is also within this 
class, mainly on a 100% basis for small 
commercial and household properties. The 
gross line size was increased from £27 million 
to £52 million in June 2009 reflecting the 
recruitment of a new underwriting team 
specialising in property owners’ business.  
The Group also writes a small account of 
financial institutions policies covering fidelity, 
professional indemnity and directors’ and 
officers’ liability for companies providing 
financial services. The current maximum line  
is £6 million. Approximately half of the income 
is from Western Europe financial institutions 
with the balance spread broadly by territory. 
Coverage is given on a claims made basis. 
The expected claims costs from these lines  
of business may be impacted by larger than 
anticipated damage awards to injured parties 
as well as an unforeseen increase in generic 
claims such as industrial disease or other 
health hazards. It is expected that claims 
frequency will increase during an economic 
downturn as unemployment leads to an 
increase in action against employers and 
people are more likely to seek redress for third 
party advice or behaviour which may have led 
to financial loss or injury. It is also possible 
that many claims could arise under many 
policies from a common cause such as 
financial advice or generic building defect. The 
financial institutions account could be affected 
by a major fraud or a series of related liability 
claims arising from banking, investment activity, 
stockbroking or other practices. The property 
portfolio could sustain a large loss from the 
effects of a UK windstorm or flood event. 
B. (ii) UK motor insurance risks 
The Group’s motor insurance risk is 
predominantly UK business covering fire, theft, 
collision and third party property and bodily 
injury liability. 2009 gross premium was  
£81 million. Under the requirements of UK law 
third party liability coverage is unlimited, but 
matching reinsurance is purchased. The 
account is biased towards commercial clients 
such as coach operators, haulage companies, 
commercial vehicle fleets and company 
executive fleets. The Syndicate leads two 
facilities for fleets involved in the transportation of 
hazardous waste. There is also a UK agriculture 
and a specialist private car account written.  
Claims frequency has improved in recent 
years due to car and road safety measures but 
can fluctuate due to factors such as weather 
conditions. UK inflation is a key factor in 
determining the size of motor claims. Car 
values affect the size of theft claims and for 
physical damage claims size is linked to repair 
costs. Inflationary pressure on court awards 
within the UK and Irish legal systems impacts 
liability claim values. Government intervention 
such as liability award limit changes or 
expense recoveries for government bodies, 
including the National Health Service, will also 
impact claim size. For the motor account, 
severe bodily injury and catastrophe damage 
claims (e.g. UK flood) are limited through the 
purchase of a reinsurance programme, the 
highest layer of which is unlimited.  
Motor insurance is a highly competitive area  
of insurance and pricing levels fluctuate. 
Whilst underwriters accept business subject  
to sufficient rates per vehicle, in a year where 
there is an unexpectedly high level of claims 
the total premium may not be sufficient to 
cover all the claims. There is also a risk that 
legal changes impact bodily injury payments 
and result in a requirement to increase 
reserves for outstanding claims. 
C. Anglo French Underwriters 
Syndicate 2001 also writes risks in France 
through Anglo French Underwriters SAS 
(AFU). Drawing its business from a large 
network of brokers across France, AFU is able 
to offer a wide range of insurance products 
designed to respond to the needs of both 
individuals and small-to-medium-sized 
corporate clients. Whilst AFU’ s business is 
situated predominantly in France it also 
includes some exposure in Spain. It writes a 
diverse book of business including property, 
cargo, professional liability and specie through 
a network of more than 1,350 independent 
retail brokers. As anticipated, the vast majority 
of risks bound by AFU have been written on 
behalf of Syndicate 2001 in 2009 although 
there continue to be a limited number of 
policies which do not involve Amlin. The 
portfolio consists of the following classes  
with maximum and average line sizes:   www.amlin.com

In respect of property, AFU acts as both  
a leading underwriter and co-insurer for 
industrial high hazard risks providing material 
damage insurance for the industrial and 
commercial premises of small and medium 
sized enterprises. AFU also provides a 
comprehensive package, including liability 
cover for discotheques, bowling alleys, 
restaurants, bars and casinos. Perils offered 
include fire, lightning and associated risks, 
electrical damage, water damage, storm, 
tempest, hail, snow and glass breakage. 
Optional coverages include business 
interruption, indirect losses, theft from 
individuals and theft from break-ins. Building 
insurance is also offered for owners who are 
not occupiers. 
In the marine field, AFU provides yacht 
insurance which includes cover for damage, 
theft and liability as well as for the costs  
of marine assistance and marine personal 
accident. World-wide stock and transit 
insurance is also provided with All Risks 
coverage granted on a start to finish basis 
from the point of supplier to the point of 
delivery. Transit cover includes all periods 
when the goods are stocked, in whatever 
location and without any break in coverage. 
Jeweller’ s block cover is provided for high 
value contents. All risks coverage is given for 
stock within the premises, including for break-
in, hold-up, fire and water damage. Cover is 
also given for commercial retail premises such 
as gunsmiths, perfume and clothing shops 
and art galleries, including damage caused  
to art while on show at exhibitions and 
damage to art kept in private residences.  
A comprehensive multi-risk product is provided 
for retailers which includes an extension for 
fire and water damage within the premises, 
liability coverage and the preservation of 
goodwill or business interruption following  
a loss. 
Professional indemnity and financial guarantee 
insurance is provided to insurance and 
banking intermediaries as well as financial 
advisers, real estate agents and financial and 
investment consultants. This is a multi-layered 
package which responds to the particular 
needs of several regulated professions which 
may require differing types of cover. 
AFU also offers insurance for events, including 
cancellation cover, organisers’ liability, all risks 
exhibition cover and all risks coverage on 
equipment belonging to, hired by or installed 
by the assured. AFU also provides personal 
accident insurance for professions involving 
risk and the practice of sporting activities 
which are deemed hazardous.

Amlin Bermuda was formed in December 
2005 to write a short-tail portfolio of 
reinsurance business on a direct basis and to 
reinsure part of the Syndicate 2001 portfolio. 
The direct written portfolio consists of the 
following classes with maximum line sizes

Note: Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs. 
Amlin Bermuda’s direct business has strong 
similarities to the portfolio of the Reinsurance 
business unit of Syndicate 2001. All of the 
business written emanates from London 
broker markets and is frequently seasoned 
business already underwritten by Syndicate 
2001. Risk balance is provided by a whole 
account quota share of Syndicate 2001. This 
is further supplemented by a number of 
specific variable quota share treaties on short-
tail classes such as property and energy.  
Property reinsurance is written through treaty 
arrangements on a proportional, individual risk 
excess of loss, or catastrophe excess of loss 
basis. The catastrophe reinsurance portfolio  
is the largest class of insurance risk written  
by Amlin Bermuda. Exposures to each 
programme are currently limited to US$12.5 
million per risk and US$75 million for any one 
catastrophe programme, with modelled 
maximum event limits of US$330 million for 
any one zone and US$360 million for losses 
affecting more than one zone. 
The special risks account includes small 
premium classes mostly relating to terrorism 
reinsurance but also includes nuclear and 
contingency which is written in all parts of  
the world.  
The accident and health class is written 
through medical expense schemes in the USA 
and provides personal accident reinsurance 
worldwide. Personal accident reinsurance 
could be impacted by a single or series of 
accidents to high value insured individuals  
or by a multiple death and injury event such as 
an air crash or natural catastrophe.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

To date the Bermuda subsidiary has written 
risks with limited protection of a reinsurance 
programme and therefore it has higher net 
retained exposures to individual risk losses or 
catastrophe than the Syndicate currently bears. 
E. Amlin Corporate Insurance  
In July 2009 Amlin acquired Fortis Corporate 
Insurance N.V., subsequently renamed Amlin 
Corporate Insurance (ACI), a leading commercial 
insurer operating in the Benelux region. 
ACI writes four main classes of business; 
motor, liability, property and marine, mainly for 
commercial clients locally. Exposures are 
predominantly in Belgium, the Netherlands and 
France apart from marine transportation risks 
or where an insured has exposures overseas.

there is little or minimum retention of risks. 
(2) Maximum linesize is shown after facultative 
reinsurance. 
(3) Gross premium represents business written since 
acquisition only 
 (4) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs. 
ACI’s property account is mainly large 
schedules of properties (e.g. for municipalities) 
written on a co-insurance basis in the 
Netherlands and larger commercial industrial 
clients in Belgium and France. The company is 
a leader in both territories. Overseas exposure 
is written mainly from the large commercial 
industrial portfolio where there are client 
operations overseas. The engineering book  
is contractors’ all risks, machinery breakdown 
and some computer equipment. 
The marine portfolio covers general cargo,  
a large commodities book for Belgian trading 
corporations, hull, land equipment, builders’ 
risk (where ACI are a recognised market 
leader), inland hull and large yachts. This 
portfolio is being re-underwritten due to high 
loss ratios in some sub-classes and the mix  
of business is therefore likely to change.  
The non-marine liability portfolio in the 
Netherlands is professional indemnity and 
general liability written on a claims-made 
basis, particularly for property related  
professions and miscellaneous professions 
such as travel operators. In Belgium, ACI are a 
recognised leader in medical liability and general 
liability is written on a losses occurring form. 
The commercial motor account is domestic 
company fleets including a large leasing and 
rental fleet written in the Netherlands and a 
smaller portfolio in Belgium. Over 70% of the 
book is cars, vans or commercial vehicles. 
There is a large underwriting agency book  
in the Netherlands. 
Captive business is written in Belgium as 
fronting for captive reinsurers of large 
industrial companies. ACI retain small 
amounts of these risks but receive a fronting 
fee. Careful analysis is carried out on captives 
to minimise potential credit risk. 
Reinsurance arrangements  
Syndicate 2001 purchases proportional 
reinsurance to supplement line size and to 
reduce exposure on individual risks, notably 
for aviation and large property risks. A part  
of the premium ceded under such facilities  
is placed with Amlin Bermuda and, for risks 
incepting during 2009, a separate proportional 
facility is placed for the excess of loss 
reinsurance portfolio through a Special 
Purpose Syndicate at Lloyd’s; Syndicate 6106. 
Syndicate 2001 also purchases a number of 
excess of loss reinsurances to protect itself 
from severe frequency or size of losses. The 
structure of the programme and type of 
protection bought will vary from year to year 
depending on the availability and price of cover.  
On large risks, individual facultative 
reinsurance may be bought which protects 
against a loss to that specific risk. 
Specific risk excess of loss reinsurance  
is purchased for each class of business.  
The amount of cover bought depends upon 
the line size written for each class. The 
deductibles or amounts borne prior to 
recovery vary from class to class as do the 
amounts of co-reinsurance or unplaced 
protection. Specific programmes are 
purchased to deal with large individual risk 
losses, such as fire or large energy losses,  
and these programmes may be combined  
at a higher level into a general programme  
for larger losses. 
The combined claims to Syndicate 2001 from 
several losses which aggregate in a single 
catastrophe event are protected by 
catastrophe cover. A separate excess of  
loss on excess of loss programme may be 
purchased to protect the excess of loss 
reinsurance portfolio against such losses. 
Since 2006, the amount of excess of loss 
reinsurance purchased is lower and only 
responds to losses in excess of US$60 million. 
There is no guarantee that reinsurance 
coverage will be available to meet all potential 
loss circumstances as, for very severe 
catastrophe losses, it is possible that the full 
extent of the cover bought is not sufficient. 
Any loss amount which exceeds the 
programme would be retained by the Group.  
It is also possible that a dispute could arise 
with a reinsurer which reduces the recovery 
made. The reinsurance programme is bought 
to cover the expected claims arising on the 
original portfolio. However, it is possible for 
there to be a mismatch, or a gap in cover, 
which would result in a higher than expected 
retained loss. 
Many parts of the programme also have 
limited reinstatements and therefore the 
number of claims which may be recovered 
from second or subsequent major losses is 
limited. It is possible for the programme to be 
exhausted by a series of losses in one annual 
period and it may not be possible to purchase 
additional reinsurance at all or for an 
acceptable price. This would result in the 
Group bearing higher losses from further 
events occurring. It should also be noted that 
the renewal date of the reinsurance 
programmes does not necessarily correspond 
to that of the business written. Where 
business is not protected by risk attaching 
reinsurance (which provides coverage for  
the duration of all the policies written) this 
reinsurance protection could expire resulting 
in an increase in possible loss retained by 
Syndicate 2001 if renewal of the programme  
is not achieved.  
Amlin Bermuda purchased a limited amount of 
catastrophe excess of loss protection in 2009. 
ACI buys a comprehensive programme for 
each class of business. Specific cover is 
placed for engineering, personal accident, 
motor, liability, energy and builders’ risks.  
A general programme is placed for the 
remaining marine exposures and the property 
account is protected by both per risk and 
catastrophe excess of loss. 
Realistic Disaster Scenario (RDS) 
analysis 
The Group has a defined event risk appetite 
which determines the maximum net loss to 
which the Group intends to limit its exposure 
with respect to major modelled catastrophe 
event scenarios. Currently these are a 
maximum of £180 million for Syndicate 2001 
and US$330 million for any one zone or 
US$360 million for a multi-zonal loss for Amlin 
Bermuda. ACI operates with a maximum event 
limit of €30 million for the modelled European 
storm event. 
These maximum losses are expected only  
to be incurred in extreme events – with an  www.amlin.com

estimated occurrence probability of less than 
1 in 50 years estimated for the natural peril or 
elemental losses. The Group also adopts risk 
appetite maximum net limits for a number of 
other non-elemental scenarios, including 
aviation collision and North Sea rig loss. 
The risk appetite policy recognises that there 
may be circumstances in which the net event 
limit could be exceeded. Such circumstances 
include changes in rates of exchange, non 
renewal or delay in renewal of reinsurance 
protection, reinsurance security failure, or 
regulatory and legal requirements.  
A detailed analysis of catastrophe exposures is 
carried out every quarter and measured against 
risk appetite. The following assumptions and 
procedures are used in the process:  
• The data used reflects the information 
supplied to the Group by insureds and 
ceding companies. This may prove to be 
incomplete, inaccurate or could develop 
during the policy period; 
• The exposures are modelled using  
a mixture of stochastic models and 
underwriter input to arrive at ‘damage 
factors’ – these factors are then applied  
to the assumed aggregate exposure  
to produce gross loss estimates. The 
damage factors may prove to be 
inadequate; 
• The reinsurance programme as purchased 
is applied – a provision for reinsurer 
counterparty failure is included but may 
prove to be inadequate; and 
• Reinstatement premiums both payable 
and receivable are included.  
There is no guarantee that the assumptions 
and techniques deployed in calculating these 
event loss estimate figures are accurate. 
Furthermore, there could also be an 
unmodelled loss which exceeds these figures. 
The likelihood of such a catastrophe is 
considered to be remote, but the most severe 
scenarios modelled are simulated events and 
these simulations could prove to be unreliable.  
Insurance liabilities and reinsurance 
assets: Calculation of incurred but not 
reported (IBNR) and claims development 
Amlin adopts a rigorous process in the 
calculation of an adequate provision for 
insurance claim liabilities. The overriding aim is 
to establish reserves which are expected to be 
at least adequate and that there is consistency 
from year to year. Therefore, the level of 
reserves are set at a level above the actuarial 
‘best estimate’ position. However, there is a 
risk that, due to unforeseen circumstances, 
the reserves carried are not sufficient to meet 
insurance claim liabilities reported in future 
years on policy periods which have expired. 
Process and methodology 
The reserving process commences with the 
proper recording and reporting of claims 
information which consists of paid and notified 
or outstanding claims. For our London market 
business information is received through 
Xchanging (the London market bureau) and,  
in the case of Amlin UK business, service 
companies, ACI and Amlin Bermuda, directly 
from brokers and policyholders. Claims 
records are maintained for each class by the 
underwriting year in which the policy incepts. 
For notified or outstanding claims, a case 
reserve is established based on the views  
of underwriting management and claims 
managers, using external legal or expert 
advice where appropriate. This reserve is 
expected to be sufficient to meet the claim 
payment when it is finally determined. For 
some classes of business, particularly liability 
business, settlement may be several years 
after the initial notification of the claim, as it 
may be subject to complexities or court 
action. For claims received from Xchanging, 
the market reserve is generally set by the lead 
underwriter, but there are circumstances on 
larger claims where Amlin will post higher 
reserves than those notified.  
To establish a provision for IBNR claims,  
the underwriting and claims teams use their 
experience and knowledge of the class of 
business to estimate the potential future 
development of each class for every 
underwriting year. The development period 
varies by class, by method of acceptance and 
is also determined by the deductible of each 
policy written. For casualty business, the policy 
form will determine whether claims can be 
made on a claims made (as advised) or as a 
losses occurring (determined by date of loss) 
basis. This has a significant impact on the 
reporting period in which claims can be notified. 
In setting the IBNR provision estimates are 
made for the ultimate premium and ultimate 
gross claims value for each underwriting year. 
Allowance is then made for anticipated 
reinsurance recoveries to reach a net claim 
position. Reinsurance recoveries are calculated 
for outstanding and IBNR claims, sometimes 
through the use of historical recovery rates or 
statistical projections, and provisions are made 
as appropriate for bad debt or possible 
disputes. The component of ultimate IBNR 
provision estimates and reinsurance recoveries 
that relates to future events occurring to the 
existing portfolio is removed in order to reflect 
GAAP accounting practice. 
To assist with the process of determining the 
reserves, triangulation statistics for each class 
are produced which show the historical 
development of premium, as well as paid and 
incurred losses, for each underwriting year, 
from inception to the date of review. ACI has 
similar statistics based on the date of premium 
receipt and claim advice rather than policy 
inception. Each class triangulation is also 
independently analysed by either the internal 
actuarial team or appointed actuarial 
consultants using actuarial software as 
appropriate. The aim of the actuarial exercise  
is to produce ‘best estimate’ ultimate premium 
and claims amounts which can be compared  
to the figures proposed by divisional 
management. Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
AFU meetings are held in which executive 
management, actuarial staff and business 
management discuss claims issues and 
analyse the proposed and independently 
generated reserves to conclude the provision  
to be carried.  
For Amlin Bermuda, which commenced 
underwriting in 2005, historical statistics for 
Syndicate 2001’s relevant classes of business 
have been used as a guide for actuarial review 
and the review discussion is conducted in 
conference or by email correspondence. 
The process for determining ACI reserves 
differs slightly in that the ACI actuarial team 
produces full data on an accident year basis  
for independent review by external actuaries. 
The external actuaries produce an 
independent best estimate by class of 
business and generate a comparison with 
ACI’s proposed carried reserves. Proposed 
reserves are generated according to a set 
formulaic process for the earning of premiums 
and release of IBNR. These proposed reserves 
are reviewed by management. 
The full reserving submission, including the 
external actuarial report, is reviewed 
separately by the Group actuarial team and 
carried reserves are agreed by the ACI Board. 
Areas of uncertainty 
The reserves established can be more or less 
than adequate to meet eventual claims arising. 
The level of uncertainty varies significantly 
from class to class but can arise from 
inadequate case reserves for known large 
losses and catastrophes or from inadequate 
provision for IBNR. The impact on profit 
before tax of a +/- 1% variation in the total net 
claims reserves would be +/- £20.1 million 
(2008: £13.3 million). 
Large loss case reserves are determined 
through careful analysis of the individual claim, 
often with the advice of legal advisers. Liability 
claims arising from events such as the  
11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US 
are examples of cases where there continues 
to be some uncertainty over the eventual value  
of claims.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

3. Risk disclosures continued 
Property catastrophe claims, such as 
earthquake or hurricane losses, can take 
several months, or years, to develop as 
adjusters visit damaged property and agree 
claim valuations. Until all the claims are settled 
it requires an analysis of the area damaged, 
contracts exposed and the use of models to 
simulate the loss against the portfolio of 
exposure in order to arrive at an estimate of 
ultimate loss to the Group. There is uncertainty 
over the adequacy of information and 
modelling of major losses for a period of 
several months after a catastrophe loss. 
Account should also be taken of factors  
which may influence the size of claims such  
as increased inflation or a change in law.  
The long-tail liability classes, for which a large 
IBNR has to be established, represent the 
most difficult classes to reserve because 
claims are notified and settled several years 
after the expiry of the policy concerned. This is 
particularly the case for US liability written on 
a losses occurring basis. 
The use of historical development data, 
adjusted for known changes to wordings or 
the claims environment, is fundamental to 
reserving these classes. It is used in 
conjunction with the advice of lawyers and third 
party claims adjusters on material single claims. 
The allocation of IBNR to the reinsurance 
programme is an uncertain exercise as there  
is limited knowledge of the size or number of 
future claims advices. The assumption over 
future reinsurance recoveries may be incorrect 
and unforeseen disputes could arise which 
would reduce recoveries made. 
Dynamic financial analysis (DFA) 
modelling of risk 
To improve our risk management capability, 
and our assessment of capital requirements, 
Amlin has developed a stochastic model to 
analyse the potential performance of the 
underwriting businesses. A specific model is 
currently being developed for ACI. The output 
from the model includes a distribution of 
outcomes from reserves for prior written 
liabilities, investment performance, and new 
business underwriting performance. The result 
is a combined view of the expected best 
estimate mean result and the range of 
possibilities around it.  
The model requires the input of a large 
number of explicit parameters. Those inputs 
are based on many different sources of 
information including detailed historical data 
on premium and claims, forecast income  
and exposures, estimated rating levels and 
catastrophe loss data from proprietary models 
applied to Amlin’s portfolio. It enables 
projection of an estimated mean ultimate loss 
ratio and the distribution of results around it. 
The model explicitly recognises diversification 
credit, since class results are not all strongly 
correlated and thus individual classes are 
unlikely all to produce losses (or profits) in the 
same year. Due to the inherent uncertainty of 
predicting the key drivers of business 
performance, including in particular claims 
levels, any individual simulation of the model 
viewed in isolation cannot be relied upon as 
an accurate forecast. However, the output 
from many thousands of simulated results can 
provide a picture of the possible distribution  
of insurance business results. This output is 
useful in developing an understanding of the 
losses which may be borne by the business  
at varying levels of probability. 
There are a large number of uncertainties and 
difficulties in achieving accurate results from 
the model. Some of the key issues are: 
• The model is based on a best estimate 
view of business volumes and rate 
expectations, which may not be borne  
out in practice; 
• A significant change in the portfolio of 
business could result in the past not being 
a reliable guide to the future; 
• Changing external environmental factors 
may not be assessed accurately; 
• Model risk may be significant in such  
a complex and developing discipline; 
• Key assumptions over levels of correlation 
between classes may over time prove to 
be incorrect; and 
• Catastrophe model inputs, which  
estimate the severity and frequency  
of large catastrophes on the portfolio,  
may be incorrect. 
The result reproduced in the table above  
right represents the modelled loss sustained 
by the business from a single 1 in 200 bad 
year i.e. at the 0.5 percentile. This probability 
is the calculation benchmark required by the 
FSA and Lloyd’s. However, it does not 
represent the level of capital required for Amlin 
to support current and expected business 
levels, which should be considered over a 
longer period of modelling. Furthermore, Amlin 
is required to carry (higher) levels of capital 
which are sufficient in the eyes of rating 
agencies and clients. This analysis includes 
our initial modelling of the Group including the 
ACI portfolio of assets and liabilities. The 
paramatisation of the ACI portfolio is at an 
early stage and therefore this figure will 
develop as our understanding improves.

Premium development 
The tables below illustrate the development of the estimate of gross written premium for the consolidated Group (excluding ACI), Amlin London,

3.2 Financial investment risk disclosures 
Market risk 
Risk management 
The following section describes Amlin’s investment risk management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  
The Group has two main categories of assets: 
• Underwriting assets. These are the premiums received and held to meet future insurance claims.  
• Capital assets. These are the capital required by the regulators to support the underwriting business plus working capital and surplus funds. 
Apart from the outstanding borrowings, these assets do not have specific current liabilities attached to them.  
Investment governance 
Amlin manages its investments in accordance with investment frameworks that are set by the Boards of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries. These 
frameworks determine investment policy and the management of investment risk. They are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the Boards’ 
fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities are being met. The Boards delegate responsibility for the day to day management of the investments to the 
Investment Management Executive.  
The Investment Management Executive comprises the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Chief Investment Officer. They meet at least 
monthly to determine investment tactics, to ensure that asset allocation is appropriate for current market conditions and is in accordance with the 
investment frameworks. The Investment Management Executive appoints and monitors the external investment managers and the custodians that 
are responsible for the safekeeping of the assets.  
The Investment Advisory Panel, which consists of external investment professionals as well as members of the Investment Management 
Executive, meets quarterly. The Panel provides challenge to the Group’s view of future economic activity and asset class performance. In addition, 
Group Compliance and external lawyers provide advice on investment regulations. 
Risk tolerance 
The investment process is formulated from the risk tolerance which is determined by reference to factors such as the underwriting cycle and  
the requirements of the capital providers. In a hard underwriting market capital preservation is paramount in order to support the insurance 
business and, therefore, the risk tolerance for the capital assets will be low. Conversely, the risk tolerance for the underwriting assets under these 
circumstances will be relatively high due to the strong cash flows. In a soft underwriting market the opposite applies. However, the investment risk 
tolerance will never be set to such a level as to undermine the Group’s credit ratings. 
During 2009 a bespoke investment risk model has been developed. Investment risk is now independently monitored, using this model, by the  
Risk Assessment and Monitoring department. The Head of Investment Risk reports regularly to the Investment Management Executive and to the 
Risk Committee. 
Strategic benchmarks 
Strategic benchmarks are set for the neutral asset allocation taking account of the risk tolerance.  
The expected timescale for future cash flows in each currency is calculated by our Group Actuarial team. These durations form the basis for the 
strategic benchmarks for the underwriting assets against which the assets are invested. Due to the short-tail nature of the Bermudian operations 
the underwriting assets are currently held in AAA rated stable net asset value liquidity funds.  
The strategic benchmarks for capital assets are set by using a Value at Risk (VaR
(1)
) model, to determine the optimum asset allocation for the 
current risk tolerance and to ensure that appropriate solvency levels are maintained.  
Tactical ranges around these strategic benchmarks provide sufficient flexibility to ensure that an appropriate risk/reward balance is maintained  
in changing investment markets.  
Investment management 
Specialist external investment managers are used to manage each asset class on a segregated, pooled or commingled basis
(2)
. For regulatory 
reasons, the Corporation of Lloyd’s manages overseas regulatory deposits in commingled funds. Otherwise, manager selection is based on a 
range of criteria that leads to the expectation that the managers will add value to the funds over the medium to long term. Investment guidelines 
are set for each manager to ensure that they comply with the investment frameworks. The managers have discretion to manage the funds on a 
day-to-day basis within these guidelines. The managers are monitored on an ongoing basis.  
(1) VaR is a statistical measure, which calculates the possible loss over a year, in normal market conditions. As VaR estimates are based on historical market data  
this should not be viewed as an absolute gauge of the level of risk to the investments. 
(2) Segregated funds are managed separately for Amlin. Pooled funds are collective investment vehicles in which Amlin and other investors purchase units. 
Commingled funds combine the assets of several clients.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Valuation risk  
Amlin’s earnings are directly affected by changes in the valuations of the investments held in the portfolios. These valuations vary according to the 
movements in the underlying markets. Factors affecting markets include changes in the economic and political environment, risk appetites, liquidity, 
interest rates and exchange rates. These factors have an impact on Amlin’s investments and are taken into consideration when setting strategic 
benchmarks and tactical asset allocation. The price of holdings can also vary due to specific risks, such as the corporate strategy and companies’ 
balance sheet structure, which may impact the value of individual equity and corporate bond holdings. This is mitigated by holding diversified 
portfolios, as specified in the investment guidelines given to the fund managers. These guidelines limit the exposure to any one company, which 
also mitigates credit risk. In addition, the equity mandate limits the exposure to any one geographic region or industrial sector and the bond 
mandates limit the overall exposure to non-government holdings.  
Group assets are marked to market at bid price. Prices are supplied by the custodians whose pricing processes are covered by their published 
annual audits. In accordance with their pricing policy, prices are sourced from two market recognised pricing vendor sources including:  
FT Interactive, Bloomberg and Reuters. These pricing sources use closing trades, or, where more appropriate in illiquid markets, pricing models. 
These prices are reconciled to the fund managers’ records to check for reasonableness. Mark to market valuations for over the counter derivatives 
are supplied by the custodian and checked to the relevant counterparty and Bloomberg. Property funds are based on the most recent price 
available, which in some instances may be a quarter in arrears. Where a property transaction has taken place the transaction price is used if it is 
the most recent price available.  
As an additional check, where available, prices as at 31 December 2009 have been verified by Amlin using available quoted prices on Bloomberg 
to verify that the prices used are a good estimation for fair value. A month to month price check was completed to ensure that any stale prices, 
defined as prices which are one month old or more, are identified and investigated. As at 31 December 2009 no stale prices were identified. 
Further details on the fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities are included in note 3.3. 
Interest rate risk  
Investors’ expectations for interest rates will impact bond yields
(3)
. The value of Amlin’s bond holdings is therefore subject to fluctuation as bond 
yields rise and fall. If yields fall the capital value will rise, and visa versa. The sensitivity of the price of a bond is indicated by its duration
(4)
. The 
greater the duration of a security, the greater its price volatility. Typically, the longer the maturity of a bond the greater its duration. The maturity 
bands of the Group’s bond holdings at year end are shown below.

The duration of underwriting assets is set with reference to the duration of the underlying liabilities. It should be noted that the liabilities are not 
currently discounted and therefore their value is not impacted by interest rate movements. Cash is raised, or the duration of the portfolio reduced, 
if it is believed that yields may rise and therefore capital values fall. Due to the inherently short-tail nature of the Bermudian reinsurance exposures, 
these underwriting assets are all held in liquidity funds.  
The durations of the bond and cash portfolios for the underwriting assets of Syndicate 2001 and ACI at year end were as follows:

Note: The table above includes pooled investments. 
The asset durations above are calculated by the custodian. Some differences occur between custodian durations and those of fund managers due 
to the use of different prepayment assumptions. As an additional check, where available, durations as at 31 December 2009 have been verified by 
Amlin using Bloomberg data. In all instances the duration differences are within the ranges permitted by the investment guidelines.

Foreign exchange risk 
Underwriting assets are held in the base currencies of Sterling, Euros, US dollars and Canadian dollars, which represent the majority of the Group’s 
liabilities by currency. This limits the underwriting foreign exchange rate risk. However, foreign exchange exposure does arise when business is 
written in non-base currencies. These transactions are converted into Sterling, Euro, or US dollars (depending where the business is written) at the 
prevailing spot rate once the premium is received. Consequently, there is exposure to currency movements between the exposure being written 
and the premium being converted. Payments in non-base currencies are converted back into the underlying currency at the time a claim is to be 
settled, therefore Amlin is exposed to exchange rate risk between the claim being made and the settlement being paid. 
Further foreign exchange risk arises until non-Sterling profits or losses are converted into Sterling. For Amlin’s UK operations, it is policy to mitigate 
foreign exchange risk by systematically converting non-Sterling profits into Sterling. Given the inherent volatility in some business classes, a cautious 
approach is adopted on the speed and level of sales, but we seek to extinguish all currency risk on earned profit during the second year after the 
commencement of each underwriting year. This approach avoids the inherent dangers of ‘lumpier’ sales. It is not the intention to take speculative 
currency positions in order to make currency gains.  
(3) The yield is the rate of return paid if a security is held to maturity. The calculation is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity and the market price.  
It assumes coupon interest paid over the life of the security is reinvested at the same rate. 
(4) The duration is the weighted average maturity of the security’s cash flows, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

As at the end of December 2009 the investment managers held some forward foreign exchange contracts in their portfolios to hedge non-base 
currency investments. These were transacted with banks with a short-term rating of at least A1 and are marked to market in investment valuations.  
The Group is subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of the translation of the Group companies that have a functional currency different from 
the presentation currency of the Group which is Sterling. In particular, as Amlin reports its financial statements in Sterling, it is subject to foreign 
exchange risk due to the impact of changes in the Sterling/US dollar exchange rate on the converted Sterling value of Amlin Bermuda Ltd’s US 
dollar net assets, and changes in the Sterling/Euro exchange rate on the converted sterling value of Amlin Corporate Insurance’s Euro net assets. 
At 31 December 2009 these amounted to US$1,580.6 million and €316.6 million (2008: US$1,389.5 million and €nil). Foreign exchange gains and 
losses on investments in overseas subsidiaries are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates’. The loss taken to reserves for the year ended 31 December 2009 was £92.8 million (2008: £260.8 million gain). This reflects the 
movement in the US dollar rate from 1.46 at the start of the year to 1.61 at the balance sheet date and the movement in the Euro rate from 1.16  
at acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance to 1.13 at the balance sheet date. 
In order to mitigate the impact of these currency fluctuations, the Group adopts a policy of hedging up to 50% of the net currency exposure 
resulting from Amlin Bermuda Ltd and Amlin Corporate Insurance’s capital assets. Hedges in the form of options were accounted for as hedges  
of net investment in overseas subsidiaries in line with the hedge accounting rules of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
such that all realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on the hedging instruments are taken to reserves to match the underlying movement in 
the valuation of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries. At the year end hedges were in place for US$706 million and €175 million. These were 
in the form of long Sterling calls/US dollar puts funded by short Sterling puts/US dollar calls and long Sterling calls/Euro puts funded by short Sterling 
puts/Euro calls. The net valuation of these trades was £7.0 million asset (2008: £54.7 million liability) as at the year end. The net accumulated 
realised and unrealised gain from hedging options recognised in reserves was £29.3 million (2008: £74.7 million loss) as at the year end.  
The Group is also subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of a US dollar loan from Amlin Bermuda Ltd to Amlin plc for US$169 million at  
31 December 2009 (31 December 2008: US$ nil). The resulting exposure to Sterling/US dollar exchange rate movements is fully hedged. The 
hedges are in the form of long Sterling puts/US dollar calls funded by short Sterling calls/US dollar puts. The valuation of these trades as at the 
year end was £1.6 million (31 December 2008: £ nil). 
If the US dollar/Sterling exchange rate were to deteriorate/(improve) by 10%, the movement in the net underwriting assets and liabilities and 
borrowings of the Group, excluding overseas subsidiaries, would result in a £2.7 million foreign exchange gain/£2.4 million loss in the Group 
income statement at 31 December 2009. If the Euro/Sterling exchange rate were to deteriorate/(improve) by 10%, the movement in the net 
underwriting assets and liabilities and borrowings of the Group, excluding overseas subsidiaries, would result in a £4.1 million foreign exchange 
gain/£3.8 million loss in the Group income statement at 31 December 2009.  www.amlin.com

In relation to translation of overseas subsidiaries, the same exchange rate improvement would result in a £71.0 million decrease in exchange gains 
through consolidated reserves. This decrease would be offset by a valuation gain of £38.4 million on the hedges in place. The same exchange rate 
deterioration would result in an additional £98.0 million exchange gain through consolidated reserves. This gain would be offset by a valuation loss 
of £32.1 million on the hedges in place.  
Liquidity risk 
It is important to ensure that claims are paid as they fall due. Levels of cash are therefore managed on a daily basis. Buffers of liquid assets are 
also held in excess of the immediate requirements to reduce the risk of being forced sellers of any of our assets, which may result in prices below 
fair value being realised, especially in periods of below normal investment market liquidity.  
The Group funds its insurance liabilities with a portfolio of cash and debt securities exposed to market risk and foreign exchange risk. The following 
table indicates the contractual timing of cash flows arising from assets and liabilities for management of insurance contracts as of 31 December 2009:

Derivative financial instruments are included in the contractual cash flows (undiscounted) for financial assets at 31 December 2009 following the 
amendment to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments – Disclosures’ as noted in the accounting policies. No retrospective application is required. 
Liquidity, in the event of a major disaster, is tested regularly using internal cash flow forecasts and realistic disaster scenarios. In addition, pre-
arranged revolving credit facilities are available from bank facilities (note 27). If a major insurance event occurs the investment strategy is reviewed 
to ensure that sufficient liquidity is also available in the capital assets.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

3. Risk disclosures continued  
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that the Group becomes exposed to loss if a counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations, including failure to 
perform them in a timely manner. Credit risk could therefore have an impact upon the Group’s ability to meet its claims as they fall due. Credit risk 
can also arise from underlying causes that have an impact upon the creditworthiness of all counterparties of a particular description or geographical 
location. Amlin is exposed to credit risk in its investment portfolio and with its premium and reinsurance debtors.  
As well as actual failure of a counterparty to perform its contractual obligations, the price of corporate bond holdings will be affected by investors’ 
perception of a borrower’s ability to perform these duties in a timely manner. Credit risk within the investment funds is managed through the credit 
research carried out by the investment managers. The investment guidelines are designed to mitigate credit risk by ensuring diversification of the 
holdings. For each portfolio there are limits to the exposure to single issuers and to the total amount that can be held in each credit quality rating 
category, as determined by reference to credit rating agencies.  
£26.5 million (2008: £59.0 million) bonds held at 31 December 2009 were subject to downgrades during the year.  
The table below shows the breakdown at 31 December 2009 of the exposure of the bond portfolio and reinsurance debtors by credit quality
(5)
.  
The table also shows the total value of premium debtors, representing amounts due from policyholders. The quality of these debtors is not graded, 
but based on historical experience there is limited default risk relating to these amounts. The reinsurance debtors represent the amounts due at  
31 December 2009 as well as amounts expected to be recovered on unpaid outstanding claims (including IBNR) in respect of earned and unearned 
risks. Reinsurance debtors are stated net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts. 
Credit risk is managed through the employment of key controls that include broker approval, annual financial review and internal rating of brokers 
and regular monitoring of premium settlement performance. The credit risk in respect of reinsurance debtors is primarily managed by review and 
approval of reinsurance security by the Group’s Reinsurance Security Committee, prior to the purchase of the reinsurance contract. Guidelines are 
set, and monitored, that restrict the purchase of reinsurance security based on the Group’s own ratings for each reinsurer and Standard & Poor’s 
ratings. The Group holds collateral from certain reinsurers including those that are non-rated. Provisions are made against the amounts due from 
certain reinsurers, depending on the age of the debt and the current rating assigned to the reinsurer. The impact on profit before tax of a 1% 
variation in the total reinsurance debtors would be £4.7 million (2008: £3.9 million).

3.3 Fair value methodology 
For financial instruments carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to 
the respective valuation techniques used to measure fair value: 
• Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset occur 
with sufficient frequency and volume to provide readily and regularly available quoted prices.  
• Level 2 – Inputs to a valuation model other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
• Level 3 – Inputs to a valuation model for the asset that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) and are significant to 
the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are 
not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date (or market 
information for the inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions it is considered that market 
participants would use in pricing the asset. 
Shares and other variable yield securities 
Listed equities traded on a primary exchange are classified as Level 1. Unlisted equities are valued using internal models, based principally upon 
management’s assumptions, and are classified as Level 3.  
Debt and other fixed income securities 
The fair value is based upon quotes from consensus pricing services where available. These consensus pricing services derive prices based on  
an average of quotes provided by brokers. Where multiple quotes are not available, the fair value is based upon evaluated pricing services, which 
typically use proprietary cash flow models and incorporate observable market inputs, such as credit spreads, benchmark quotes and other trade 
data. If such services do not provide coverage of the asset, then fair value is determined manually using indicative broker quotes, which are 
corroborated by recent market transactions in similar or identical assets.  
Where there is an active market for these assets and their fair value is the unadjusted quoted market price, these are classified as Level 1. This is 
typically the case for highly liquid government bonds. Level 1 also includes exchange-traded bond funds, where fair value is based upon quoted 
market prices and the funds are actively traded. Where the market is inactive or the price is adjusted, but significant market observable inputs have 
been used by the pricing sources, then these are considered to be Level 2 inputs. This is typically the case for government agency debt, corporate 
debt, and mortgage and asset backed securities. Certain assets, for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable, are classified as Level 3. 
Property funds 
The fair value is based upon valuations provided by the fund manager. The inputs into that valuation are primarily unobservable and, as such, 
these assets are classified as Level 3. 
Participation in investment pools 
These are liquidity funds, which are valued using the fund manager’s net asset valuation and are highly liquid. These are classified as Level 1.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

Derivatives 
Listed derivative contracts, such as futures, that are actively traded are valued using quoted prices from the relevant exchange and are classified 
as Level 1. Over-the-counter currency options are valued by the counterparty using quantitative models with multiple market inputs. The market 
inputs are observable and the valuation can be validated through external sources. These are classified as Level 2.

The majority of the Group’s investments are valued based on quoted market information or other observable market data. A small percentage 
(3.7%) of assets recorded at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments. Where estimates are used, these are based 
on a combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. 
While such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative 
assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.  www.amlin.com

4. Segmental reporting  
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the management information reviewed by the Board of Directors of the 
Company that are used to make strategic decisions. All operating segments used by management meet the definition of a reportable segment 
under IFRS 8.  
The Group is organised into six operating segments. Segments represent the distinct underwriting units through which the Group is organised  
and managed. These segments are as follows: 
• Amlin London, consisting of the Reinsurance, Property and Casualty, Marine and Aviation business units, underwritten via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin UK, underwriting commercial insurance in the UK domestic market also via Syndicate 2001; 
• Anglo French Underwriters, which writes a diverse book of specialty business in France via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin Bermuda, which writes predominantly property reinsurance business, including reinsurance ceded by Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin Corporate Insurance, a leading provider of corporate property and casualty insurance in the Netherlands and Belgium; and 
• Other corporate companies, comprising all other entities of the Group including holding companies. 
Transactions between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to the Board of Directors is measured 
in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. Revenues are allocated based on the country in which the insurance contracts are issued. 
Management considers its external customers to be the individual policyholders, therefore the Group is not reliant on any individual customer. 
Comparative information has been restated in line with the requirements of IFRS 8. 
Segmental information provided to the Board of Directors of the Company for the reportable segments of the Group is as follows:

The net assets of Amlin Bermuda are located in Bermuda and the US. The majority of the other assets of the Group are located in the UK, the US, 
Continental Europe and Canada. The corresponding liabilities are also concentrated in these countries, but given the nature of the Group’s 
business some of the liabilities will be located elsewhere in the world. 
Depreciation has been charged on property and equipment for the year amounting to £4.8 million (2008: £3.3 million) of which £1.3 million  
(2008: £0.7 million) has been charged to Amlin London, £0.8 million (2008: £0.5 million) to Amlin UK, £0.2 million (2008: £nil million) to Anglo French 
Underwriters, £0.5 million (2008: £1.0 million) to Amlin Bermuda and £2.0 million to Amlin Corporate Insurance. 
Segmental information for the year ended 31 December 2008 has been restated to be consistent with the disclosure for the year ended 31 December 
2009. The only change to the previously reported disclosures has been the aggregation of the Non-marine, Marine and Aviation divisions within

Following the completion of the acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. in July 2009, the audit of the companies in the Amlin Group was

competitive tender. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was successful in that process.

Underwriting profits and losses are recognised in the technical account on an annual accounting basis, recognising the results in the period in  
which they are earned. UK corporation tax on the profits of Syndicate 2001 is charged in the period in which the underwriting profits are actually 
paid by the Syndicate to the corporate members. 
Deferred tax is provided on the annually accounted underwriting result with reference to the forecast ultimate result of each of the years of account 
included in the annually accounted underwriting. Where the forecast ultimate result for a year of account is a taxable profit, but the result recognised 
in the accounts is a loss to date on annually accounted basis, deferred tax is only provided for the movement on that year of account included in the 
period’s annually accounted Syndicate underwriting result to the extent that forecasts show that the taxable loss will be utilised in the foreseeable 
future. The deferred tax liability carried forward on the annually accounted underwriting result is £96.5 million (2008: £122.9 million). 
Deferred tax assets on loss provisions in respect of non-aligned syndicate participations (see note 18) are only provided for to the extent that 
forecasts show that it is more likely than not that the ultimate taxable underwriting losses represented by these provisions will be utilised within the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax has been provided in full on non-aligned syndicate loss participation provisions of £0.2 million (2008: £1.0 million). 
Reconciliation of tax expense 
The UK standard rate of corporation tax is 28.0% (2008: 28.5%), whereas the tax charged for the year ended 31 December 2009 as a percentage 
of profit before tax is 10.7% (2008: 33.9%). The reasons for this difference are explained below:

The Group’s tax provision for 2009 has been prepared on the basis that the Group’s Bermudian subsidiaries are non-UK resident for UK 
corporation tax purposes. The corporation tax rate for Bermudian companies is currently nil% (2008: nil%). 
At 31 December 2008 a deferred tax liability of £16.1 million was provided for on profits of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries expected to be 
distributed in the foreseeable future. Following the enactment of the Finance Act 2009, which exempts most overseas dividends from the UK 
corporation tax, the deferred tax liability provided at 31 December 2008 has been released.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

14. Tax continued 
Deferred tax has been provided for at the local tax rate in force when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The tax rate used for the 
UK is 28.0% (2008: 28.5%). 
The Group is subject to US tax on US underwriting profits. No provision has been made in respect of such tax arising in 2009 (2008: £nil) as any 
net provision is likely to be immaterial and would be offset by brought forward US tax losses in the Group.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised on US net operating losses of £nil million (2008: £26.5 million) carried forward due to uncertainty over 
their future use. 
Deferred tax of £20.9 million (2008: £54.1 million) is expected to be settled after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date. 
15. Net foreign exchange gains/(losses) 
The Group recognised net foreign exchange gains of £5.4 million (2008: £18.9 million net gain) in the income statement during the year. 
The Group writes business in many currencies and although a large proportion of the Group’s balance sheet assets and liabilities are matched, 
minimising the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s result, it is not possible, or practical, to match exactly all assets and 
liabilities in currency. Accounting standards also require that certain classes of assets and liabilities be translated at different rates (see foreign 
currency translation accounting policy).  
Included within the Group’s foreign exchange gain in the income statement are:

Amlin Bermuda Ltd, which reports in US dollars, held Sterling assets of £nil million at 31 December 2009 (2008: £182.1 million). Sterling assets 
held during the year produced a foreign exchange gain of £25.2 million (2008: loss of £41.3 million) which is included within the Group’s foreign 
exchange gains. These investments, together with certain foreign exchange hedge contracts, were held in Sterling as part of the Group’s overall 
strategy to hedge up to 50% of its US dollar exposure in Amlin Bermuda Ltd. They were sold in July 2009. Note 3.2 provides further details.

All financial assets and liabilities are held at fair value, with all gains and losses, realised and unrealised, recorded through the income statement, 
except for unlisted equities which are classified as available for sale and derivative instruments providing a net investment hedge for which gains 
and losses are taken to equity. Fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as trading assets, as the Group buys with the intention to resell. 
Debt and other fixed income securities include pooled exchange-traded funds, investing in bonds. The valuation of these funds is £1,076.1 million 
(2008: £228.2 million). 
Also included within debt and other fixed income securities and deposits with credit institutions are overseas deposits amounting to £71.0 million 
(2008: £71.1 million). Overseas deposits represent balances held with overseas regulators to permit underwriting in certain territories. These assets 
are managed by Lloyd’s on a pooled basis and are predominantly invested in debt and other fixed income securities. 
Participation in investment pools includes units held in money market funds. 
Unlisted equity investments are the Group’s investments of 19.9% of the shares in Miles Smith plc (£4.0 million) and TL Dallas Group Limited  
(£4.6 million), purchased in 2008, and Vega Insurance Agencies AS (£0.3 million) purchased on 9 December 2009. No provision has been made  
for the impairment of these investments as at 31 December 2009 (2008: £nil). 
As part of our process to improve the presentation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements certain changes have been made to the 
presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities in order to better reflect their nature. These changes in presentation have no effect on the 
previously reported net income or shareholders’ equity. Comparative information has been amended to reflect this change.

In connection with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of ACI, the Group adjusted claims reserves and related reinsurance recoveries to 
fair value on acquisition. The reduction to the original carrying value of £39.1 million and £6.4 million to claims reserves and reinsurance recoveries 
respectively is being recognised through a charge to the income statement over the period the claims are settled. This net charge is £0.6 million  
in 2009. 
The fair value was based on the present value of the expected cash flows with consideration for the uncertainty inherent in both the timing of, and 
the ultimate amount of, future payments for losses and receipts of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. The nominal amounts were discounted to 
their present value using an applicable risk–free discount rate. 
Further information on the calculation of claims reserves and the risks associated with them is provided in the risk disclosures in note 3. Claims 
reserves are further analysed between notified outstanding claims and incurred but not reported claims below:

It is estimated, using historical settlement trends, that £930.9 million (2008: £781.8 million) of the claims reserves, as at 31 December 2009, will settle  
in the next twelve months.

Other insurance liabilities are comprised principally of premium payable for reinsurance, including reinstatement premium. Other insurance assets 
are comprised principally of amounts recoverable from reinsurers in respect of paid claims and premium receivable on inward reinsurance 
business, including reinstatement premium. 
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a quarterly basis by reviewing counterparty payment history and credit grades 
provided by rating agencies. The credit ratings of the Group’s reinsurance assets are shown in note 3.2. As at 31 December 2009 reinsurance 
assets at a nominal value of £10.3 million (2008: £13.4 million) were greater than three months overdue and provided for to the value of £7.9 million 
(2008: £9.4 million). The Group holds collateral of £0.1 million (2008: £0.2 million) in relation to these assets.

The Group recognised a total impairment loss of £2.4 million (2008: £5.5 million) on reinsurance assets and insurance receivables. 
Of the total other insurance liabilities balance of £243.7 million and other reinsurance assets of £373.7 million, £9.6 million and £8.0 million 
respectively are expected to be settled after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date.  
From 1994 to 1999 the Group participated on a number of Lloyd’s syndicates other than those managed by the Group. From 2000 the Group 
ceased to underwrite directly on non-aligned syndicates.

Syndicate participations represent the ongoing rights, acquired in Lloyd’s auctions and by an offer to Lloyd’s Names, to trade on Syndicate 2001 
within the Lloyd’s insurance market. Amlin subsidiaries have supported all of the ongoing capacity of Syndicate 2001 since 1 January 2004. All 
remaining liabilities of the Syndicate underwritten by third party capital prior to this date were taken on by Amlin subsidiaries at 1 January 2004. 
Additions to goodwill of £27.2 million and broker and customer relationship intangibles relate to the acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. 
(ACI) and the addition to goodwill of £5.4 million relates to the acquisition of Crowe Livestock Underwriting Limited. Note 38 provides further 
details on this acquisition. The costs of acquiring rights to ACI’s broker and customer relationships are amortised using the straight line method 
over the estimated useful life of 15 years. 
Goodwill and the Group’s asset in relation to syndicate participations are considered to have an indefinite life. As such, they are tested for 
impairment annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of 
operation and business segment.  
The analysis of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU is shown below:

The intangible asset relating to the syndicate participations supports the underwriting in Amlin London, Amlin UK and Anglo French Underwriters. 
Given the nature of the participation rights, it is not practical to split this asset between the three CGUs. Accordingly, impairment testing has been 
performed based on aggregate Syndicate 2001 profit forecasts.  
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. Value in use is calculated for 
each CGU using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted 
at an appropriate discount rate. 
Key assumptions used in the calculation are: 
• Budgeted operating profit for an initial five year period for Amlin London and a four year period for Anglo French Underwriters and Amlin Corporate 
Insurance represents the operating profit in the business plans. As such this reflects the best estimate of future profits based on historical trends and 
expected growth rates. The most significant assumptions used to derive the operating profit include our assessment of the market cycle, retention 
rates, claims inflation, outwards reinsurance expenditure and long-term investment return. 
• In order to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period, a nil growth rate has been assumed for all CGUs. 
• A risk adjusted discount rate of 15.0%, representing a risk-free rate and an additional prudent margin, has been applied to each CGU’s cash  
flow projection. 
The results of this exercise indicate that the recoverable amount exceeds in each case the intangible’s carrying value and would not be sensitive  
to reasonably possible changes in assumptions.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

The Company transferred 1,599,228 shares out of treasury shares at a cost of £4.1 million (2008: 2,001,348 shares at a cost of £5.0 million). The 
shares have been transferred to meet exercises of employee share options, leaving 7,164,424 ordinary shares in Treasury at 31 December 2009 
(2008: 8,763,652 ordinary shares). 
On 3 June 2009, the Group placed 23,502,567 new Ordinary Shares with institutional investors representing approximately 5% of Amlin’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital, in order to finance part of the consideration of ACI. The placing proceeds were £75.0 million net of expenses. 
On 14 November 2007, the Group announced its intention to return approximately £120 million of capital to shareholders by way of a B share issue 
combined with a consolidation of Amlin’s existing shares on the basis of eight new ordinary shares for nine existing ones. This was subsequently 
approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 December 2007. 
B shares were issued on 17 December 2007 to existing shareholders on the basis of one B share for each ordinary share held on 14 December 
2007. Each B share enabled the shareholder to redeem the share at 22.4 pence per share at various dates in the future up to August 2009 or, 
alternatively, to receive a B share initial dividend in January 2008 of 22.4 pence per share. Following such dividend receipt, the relevant B shares 
were converted into deferred shares which were themselves redeemed on 14 January 2008 for a total redemption value of one penny in all.  
On 3 August 2009 all of the then remaining outstanding B shares were redeemed by the Company.  www.amlin.com

the award. PSP awards listed above are awards made under appropriate schedules to the PSP to employees in the Group’s French, Netherlands 
and Belgian businesses. These shares may be released to participants from five years from the date of the award. SIP shares listed above are 
awards made on an all-employee basis, to employees in France (AFU in April 2009) and the Netherlands, Belgium and France (ACI in September 
2009). In each case these awards were made under appropriate local versions of the SIP adapted to the relevant jurisdiction. In the cases of all  
of the LTIP, PSP and SIP awards, in some circumstances, such as redundancy, shares may be released earlier.

The trustee of the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) held 1,056,440 ordinary shares as at 31 December 2009 (2008: 1,221,891 ordinary 
shares) to meet potential future exercises of executive options and long-term incentive plans. The Company had also made arrangements as at that

dates between 2010 and 2014, and up to 2,049,609 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) shares, normally exercisable from three years after grant on 
dates between 2010 and 2012, and up to 37,289 shares over which options were granted in May 2008 (to a non-director employee) normally not 
exercisable until 2011 and 2012. The ESOT shares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The market value of Amlin plc ordinary 
shares at 31 December 2009 was 358.7p per share (2008: 357.5p). 
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements. The ESOT waives the right to 
dividends on ordinary shares in excess of 0.01p per each share ranking for an interim or final dividend.  www.amlin.com

The weighted average share price of Amlin plc throughout the year was 358.15 pence (2008: 290.06 pence).  
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants listed above. The assumptions used in the 
model are as follows: 
2009 2008
Weighted average grant price (pence) 227.19 213.34
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 189.09 186.03
Expected volatility 30.00% 30.00%
Expected life (years) 3.00 – 7.50 3.00 – 7.50
Risk free rate of return 2.00% – 5.00% 3.50% – 5.00%
Expected dividend yield 2.00% – 7.00% 2.00% – 7.00%
Volatility 
The volatility of the Amlin share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price. In estimating 
a 30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered. As a guide to the reasonableness of the 
volatility estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlin’s peer group. 
Interest rate 
The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields. 
Dividend yield 
The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year. 
Staff turnover 
The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades. Furthermore, historical evidence 
suggests that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier. 
In addition, senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.  
Market conditions 
Amlin issues options that include targets for the Group’s performance against a number of market and non-market conditions. Failure to meet 
these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable. In some circumstances no options may be exercised. Assumptions are made about 
the likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

The bonds will be redeemed on the maturity dates at the principal amounts, together with any outstanding accrued interest. For the US dollar and 
Sterling bonds, the Company has the option to redeem the bonds in whole, subject to certain requirements, on the reset dates or any interest 
payment date thereafter at the principal amount plus any outstanding accrued interest. The Euro bond was acquired by the Company as part of 
the acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V.  
The directors’ estimation of the fair value of the Group’s borrowings is £380.2 million (2008: £360.4 million). The aggregate fair values of borrowings 
are based on a discounted cash flow model. This model uses a current yield curve appropriate for the remaining terms to maturity. The discount 
rate used was 3.41%. 
On 3 September 2008 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a renegotiated debt facility with its banks which is available for five 
years from the date of signing and provides an unsecured £250 million multicurrency revolving credit facility available by way of cash advances or 
letter of credit (LOC) and a secured US$200 million LOC. The facility is guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries Amlin Corporate Services Limited 
and Amlin (Overseas Holdings) Limited. The secured LOC is secured by a fixed charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Insight Investment 
Management (Global) Limited with State Street Bank and Trust Company as custodian. As at 31 December 2009 the facility was undrawn. 
In September 2009, Amlin Bermuda Ltd entered into a secured US$200 million LOC facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and the Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc as lead arrangers. The facility is secured by a registered charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Aberdeen Asset Management 
Inc and with State Street Bank and Trust Company as custodian. As at 31 December 2009, US$124.9 million of LOC were issued. The total value 
of restricted assets as at 31 December 2009 was US$145.1 million. 
In February 2009, Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) entered into a secured US$1.5 million standby LOC facility with Fortis Bank Nederland 
N.V. as arranger. The facility is secured by a registered charge over a bank account managed by Fortis Bank Nederland N.V. As at 31 December 
2009, US$1.5 million of LOC was issued. The total value of restricted assets as at 31 December 2009 was US$1.5 million.  www.amlin.com

a) Defined benefit schemes 
i) The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund funded defined benefit scheme 
Scheme description 
The scheme is operated as part of the Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund (the Fund).  
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyd’s market. As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, 
employers closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only three (2008: three) employers with active members in the 
Fund. A large proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund. The assets of the Fund are pooled and 
the current active employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole. 
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustee has split the Fund into a number of notional sections. This is a notional split 
and has no legal force. Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employer’s active members and one 
combined section for non-employed members of all current and former employers. 
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustee altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, 
including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, 
deferred pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities. A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former 
employers no longer contribute to the Fund (Orphan Schemes). Amlin is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes’ liabilities. 
Since this alteration and the exit of other employers Amlin has been able to more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund 
and able to ascertain its share of the assets and liabilities with sufficient certainty to account for the pension as a defined benefit scheme and bring 
the assets and liabilities of the scheme onto the balance sheet of the Group.  
Fund contributions 
In December 2009 an additional contribution of £5.0 million was made to reduce the size of the deficit in the scheme. 
Contributions will also be paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual after the date of the valuation. The rate of contribution agreed with the 
Trustee is 19% (2008: 19%) paid by the employer plus 5% (2008: 5%) member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings, and totalled 
£0.9 million (2008: £1.3 million).  
The expected contribution to the fund for the year ending 31 December 2010 is £0.7 million by the Group and £0.2 million by plan participants. 
The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund are analysed in the table below.

Funding assessment assumptions 
The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary. Contributions are made at the funding rates 
recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include 
adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period. Amounts paid under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other 
Group companies. Actuarial amounts quoted below are for the Group’s notional share of the scheme.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2009

28. Retirement benefit obligations continued  
The last completed formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2007 and was carried out by Mr N Wharmby, Fellow of the Institute of 
Actuaries, and used the projected unit credit actuarial method. For the purpose of providing disclosure in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has 
requested the actuary to update the 2007 valuation to 31 December 2009 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 
 
2009 
% pa 
2008
% pa
Price inflation 3.7 2.8
Rate of increase in pensions payment:  
– LPI (maximum 5% pa) 3.5 2.8
– LPI (minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa) 3.9 3.5
– LPI (maximum 3% pa) 2.7 2.3
Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 3.7 2.8
Discount rate 5.6 6.3
During 2005 the Group reviewed its remaining defined benefit arrangements and made a number of changes to the schemes’ operations, which 
were implemented during 2006. In particular, in order to remove much of the risk associated with salary inflation, the scheme was changed to 
allow members to continue accruing additional years’ service under the schemes, but these accruals would be generally based on March 2006 
pensionable salaries. Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes. Therefore the salary inflation assumption 
used for the ongoing valuation is now nil%. 
The mortality assumptions used in the latest valuation included the following life expectancies: 
31 December 2009 31 December 2008 
Life expectancy (years) at age 60 for a member currently: 
Male Female Male Female
Aged 60 25.4 28.4 25.3 28.3
Aged 45 26.7 29.5 26.6 29.5

ii) ACI defined benefit plans  
Scheme description 
ACI operates defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its employees. These plans are funded partly by means of employee contributions. 
Under these plans, benefits are based on years of service and level of salary. Pension obligations are determined based on mortality, employee 
turnover, wage increases and economic assumptions such as inflation, value of plan assets and discount rate. The discount rate is set on the basis 
of the yield (on the valuation date) of debt securities issued by blue-chip companies.  
In addition to pension charges, costs of defined-benefit plans also include other post-employment benefits such as reimbursement of part of  
the health insurance premiums and favourable conditions on financial products (e.g. mortgage loans), which continue to be granted to employees 
after retirement. 
The asset and liability of the Netherlands pension plan was acquired as part of the ACI acquisition. Prior to acquisition, employees of the Belgian 
office were employed by another company within the Fortis group. Immediately following the acquisition, 109 ACI Belgian employees (from a total 
of 130) transferred their employment to ACI. Consequently the net pension obligation with respect to these employees was recognised by the 
Group immediately after the completion of the acquisition.  www.amlin.com

36. Other Group companies 
Jointly owned entity 
During 2008, Amlin Corporate Services Limited invested £1.5 million in a jointly owned entity, Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP (LCP). LCP  
was established as a new asset management company focused on insurance linked investments. LCP is incorporated in England and Wales.  
The Group holds 50% of the voting rights. The Group has committed to pay up to a further US$4 million to support the operations of the agency 
as part of the joint venture agreement. The Group’s share of LCP’s profit for the year is £nil million. Summary financial information for LCP  
is as follows:

Assets 2.6
Liabilities 1.8
Revenues 1.7
Profit for the year 0.4
£2.5 million of LCP’s assets are classified as current. £0.1 million are non-current. All liabilities are classified as current. 
During the year, LCP charged the Group management fees of £1.3 million. The Group charged LCP £0.2 million under the terms of the service 
agreement. At 31 December 2009, the Group held a debtor of £1.0 million due from LCP. No amounts were provided for doubtful recovery of this 
debtor and no expense was recognised during the year in respect of bad or doubtful debts from LCP. 
Operations held for sale 
Amlin Bermuda has invested in the Leadenhall Value Insurance Linked Investments Fund plc and the Leadenhall Diversified Insurance Linked 
Investments Fund plc which were valued at £63.7 million on 31 December 2009. These funds are managed by LCP and invest in a portfolio of 
catastrophe bonds and other alternative investments. Amlin Bermuda Limited is currently the only investor in the two funds but significant third 
party investment is anticipated in 2010. There is an expectation that sufficient external investment will be made, giving rise to a deemed disposal  
of the Group’s controlling interest in the fund. 
On 21 October 2009, Amlin Bermuda transferred insurance-linked securities worth £46.6 million to the two funds. These transfers were in partial 
exchange for the initial investment made by Amlin Bermuda and so no amounts were outstanding at the year end. No expense was recognised in 
the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from either fund. During the year, the Group recognised £7.4 million of income from its holding 
in the funds.

Reinsurance contracts between Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda Ltd (ABL) 
Syndicate 2001 placed a number of reinsurance contracts with ABL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.  
The reinsurance contracts placed with ABL in the year ended 31 December 2009 are: 
• nine proportional treaty reinsurance contracts for marine, direct property, special risks, specie, war, excess of loss treaty, combined hull, cargo and 
liability and miscellaneous classes of business;  
• a whole account quota share for the 2009 underwriting year; and  
• one excess of loss reinsurance contract for Aviation. 
In the year ended 31 December 2009 ABL placed one excess of loss reinsurance contract with Syndicate 2001. 
All reinsurance contracts were agreed on an arm’s length basis with terms that are consistent with those negotiated with third parties. These 
reinsurance contracts are eliminated on consolidation of the Group’s results and the effects on the income statements of such eliminations can  
be seen in note 4, segmental reporting under the column ‘Intra-group items’.  
The amount of gross written premium ceded to ABL during the period ended 31 December 2009 was £157.1 million (2008: £106.0 million) being 
£45.8 million (2008: £36.3 million) of specific variable cessions, £110.3 million (2008: £68.9 million) of Syndicate 2001 whole account quota share,

of reinsurance premium ceded in 2009 was £0.2 million.

For the 2009 underwriting year of account, the Group established a Special Purpose Syndicate (S) 6106 to write a 15% quota share contract of the 
excess of loss reinsurance account of Syndicate 2001. The transactions provide external members’ capital to support 2009 underwriting, enabling 
Syndicate 2001 to take advantage of strong opportunities in peak zones in the US, Japan and Europe. Brian Carpenter, a director of the Company, 
held a 0.07% share of capacity as a Name on S6106. All transactions with S6106 are undertaken on an arm’s length basis.

Year end balance with related parties 
Cash resources are held centrally within the Group. This eliminates the need for many of the Group’s subsidiary companies to maintain bank 
accounts and optimises the management of cash resources. As a result of this practice many transactions within the Group are accounted for 
through intercompany accounts. 
The following table shows the balances outstanding at the year end between Amlin plc and its related parties. The balances are all unsecured and 
no provisions are required for bad or doubtful debts.

38. Acquisition of subsidiaries 
i) Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. 
On 22 July 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and voting rights in Fortis Corporate Insurance N.V., renamed Amlin Corporate 
Insurance N.V. (ACI), for €350.0 million (£301.7 million). ACI is a leading provider of corporate property and casualty insurance in the Netherlands 
and Belgium. 
The purpose of the acquisition is to expand the Group’s non-catastrophe portfolio, providing a Continental European underwriting platform with 
scope for future growth.

The assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date are stated at their provisional fair values and may be amended in 2010 when further evidence  
of the appropriate fair values is expected to be received, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’.  
The goodwill shown above arose from the premium paid for strengthening the Group’s market position in targeted business segments and 
acquiring the skilled workforce to drive future profitability in those segments. No provision for impairment of goodwill has been made at the 
balance sheet date. 
ACI contributed £53.7 million to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between 22 July 2009 and 31 December 2009. If the acquisition of ACI 
had been completed on the first day of the financial year the Group result for the period would have been a profit before tax of £75.8 million and 
the gross earned premium would have been £672.8 million.  
ii) Crowe Livestock Underwriting Limited 
On 30 November 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and voting rights in Crowe Livestock Underwriting Limited (Crowe), an 
insurance intermediary. The purchase consideration was an initial £5.6 million with further amounts of between £1.0 million and £4.0 million to be 
paid in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The fair value of the net assets acquired was £2.0 million and the fair value of the consideration was £7.4 million, 
resulting in the recognition of £5.4 million of goodwill on acquisition. The goodwill arose from the premium paid for diversifying the Group’s 
underwriting portfolio through entry into the livestock insurance market and the opportunity to build on the current bloodstock book. The fair value  
of the contingent element of the consideration is based on the forecast performance of the business over the next three years. 
39. Subsequent events  
On 22 January 2010 the Group acquired the United Kingdom insolvency practitioners’ insurance business from Lockton for £13.0 million.

Notes to the Accounts 
For the year ended 31 December 2009

Accounting policies 
Basis of Preparation 
Amlin plc (the Company), domiciled in the United Kingdom, is the ultimate parent company for the Amlin Group. 
The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared as required by the Companies Act 2006. The balance sheet of the parent company 
has also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union (EU). In accordance with the extension permitted under 
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these accounts. The profit after 
taxation for the year of the parent company was £336.7 million (2008 restated: £66.1 million). The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for financial investments, share options and cash and cash equivalents, which are measured at their fair value.  
The accounting policies that are used in preparation of these statements are consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group as set out in those financial statements.  
The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below. 
Investment in subsidiaries 
Other financial investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost and are reviewed for impairment when events, or changes in circumstances, 
indicate the carrying value may be impaired. 
Dividend income 
Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
40. Restatement of prior year figures 
Since 2008 the Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on its net investment in 
overseas subsidiaries. In 2008 the Company recorded a revaluation loss of £74.7 million in other reserves in respect of such derivative contracts. 
During 2009 it was identified that such revaluation gains or losses, in addition to the previously unrecognised taxation charge or credit, should 
have been recognised in the Company’s profit or loss for the year. 
The 2008 comparative figures have therefore been restated in order to report the £74.7 million revaluation loss and the resulting tax credit of  
£21.3 million in the profit for the financial year. The effect has been to increase other reserves by £74.7 million, reduce the profit for the year by 
£53.4 million and increase the current tax asset by £21.3 million. There is no effect on earlier periods and therefore no restatement of the balance 
sheet at the beginning of the 2008 comparative period is required.  
41. Employees 
All Amlin employees within the UK are employed by the Group service company Amlin Corporate Services Limited, and overseas employees are 
employed by the relevant overseas entities. Therefore the persons employed by the Company is nil (2008: nil). 
42. Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents represents cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits which can be recalled within 24 hours.

51. Related party disclosure 
Full details of related party transactions are provided in note 37 to the consolidated financial statements. 
52. Parent Company risk disclosures 
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiaries. Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations of the 
Group itself and full details of the risk management policies are given in note 3.  
Its investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and are tested for 
impairment annually. Details of impairments are given in note 45. 
Financial investments are measured at fair value, details of which are given in notes 3 and 43.  
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and financial investments, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the 
balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. 
Financial liabilities owed by the Company are largely in respect of long-term borrowings (details of which are provided in note 27) and amounts due 
to subsidiaries. Amounts due to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date. 
Interest rate risk 
Loans to and from subsidiaries are at floating rates of interest. The Company is therefore exposed to fluctuations in these rates. 
Currency risk 
The Company has entered into derivative contracts on behalf of the Group to hedge the net currency exposure, which results from the translation 
of the net assets of Amlin Bermuda Ltd and Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. These derivative contracts in the form of options have been 
accounted for as hedges of net investments in overseas subsidiaries by the Group, under which fair value gains and losses are taken to reserves  
to match the underlying movement in the valuation of the net investment in the overseas subsidiaries. In the Company these gains and losses are 
taken to profit or loss.  
The Company’s amounts due from subsidiaries include a US dollar loan of $370 million, which has been swapped into Euros of €260 million.  
This forms part of the net investment in Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. referred to above and hedged at a Group level. The Company is exposed  
to gains and losses on this loan in its profit or loss.  
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through its borrowings. At 31 December 2009 the Company had a US dollar loan from  
Amlin Bermuda Ltd for $169 million. The resulting exposure in the Company’s and Group’s profit or loss has been hedged. Further details on 
currency risk are given in note 3.

The UK capital gains tax position 
regarding the B Shares issue 
(2007/2008)
The detailed UK and US tax position 
of all aspects of the return of capital and 
share consolidation that was completed 
early in 2008 was set out in a circular to 
shareholders dated 16 November 2007, 
copies of which are available from the 
Company Secretary and on the Amlin 
website. This involved the replacement 
of each 9 ordinary shares of 25p each 
in the Company previously held by 
shareholders by 9 B Shares of 22.4p 
each and 8 consolidated ordinary 
shares of  28.125p each (New Shares). 
All of such B Shares have subsequently 
been redeemed.
Further to that circular, the market value 
of a New Share for UK tax purposes on 
the first day on which its price was quoted 
(17 December 2007) was 302.125p. 
The market value on the same date 
of a B Share for UK tax purposes was 
considered to be 22.3p. As the B Shares 
were not be traded on any stock exchange, 
its value was calculated by reference to its 
redemption value of 22.4p on the first 
redemption date of 14 January 2008, 
with a discount applied to take account 
of the minimum period prior to redemption. 
Accordingly, shareholders subject to UK 
taxation of capital gains may apportion the 
allowable expenditure in relation to their 
holdings of ordinary shares of 25p each 
prior to 17 December 2007 as follows:
• Holdings of new ordinary shares 
of 28.125p each: 92.333%
• Holdings of B Shares: 7.667%

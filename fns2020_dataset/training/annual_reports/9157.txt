B&Q is the largest  
home improvement and 
garden centre retailer in 
the UK with 358 stores 
across the UK and 
Ireland offering around 
40,000 products for the 
homemaker, occasional 
to serious DIYers, and 
trade professionals.  
In China, the business  
is adapted to the  
local preference for a  
“Do-it-for-Me” model.  
It specialises in the  
fitting out and decoration 
of new apartments. 
 With up to 50,000 
products under one  
roof, Castorama France  
is one of the leading 
home improvement 
retailers in France with 
103 stores. Like B&Q, 
Castorama targets retail 
customers and DIYers 
and has an emphasis on 
style and inspiration for 
homemakers. In Poland 
and Russia there is a 
bigger emphasis on 
projects, as the home 
improvement market  
is at an earlier stage of  
its development. 
 In both France and  
Spain Brico Dépôt is 
primarily aimed at serious 
DIYers and professional 
builders. It operates a  
low-price format which 
offers customers a  
choice of 10,000 
products available in 
larger product quantities.
 Screwfix is the UK’s 
largest omnichannel 
supplier of trade tools, 
accessories and hardware 
to trade professionals and 
serious DIY enthusiasts. 
In addition to its catalogue 
and website, Screwfix 
operates 275 stores 
across the UK.  
 Koçta s ¸, Kingfisher’s  
joint venture in Turkey,  
is now the number one 
home improvement 
retailer in the country.  
Its 37 stores are  
aimed at mainstream 
consumers, homemakers 
and occasional to  
serious DIYers.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Chairman’s statement 
 
It has been a challenging year for 
Kingfisher, but I am pleased to report that 
we finished the year in good shape, with 
a strong balance sheet, higher market 
share in Europe and with our medium 
term programme of self-help initiatives 
(Creating the Leader) progressing well.  
Our reported results were affected by 
adverse currency movements, and the 
particularly poor summer weather in 
Northern Europe literally dampened 
customer demand during our peak 
season. Add to this the economic 
uncertainty our customers are facing 
across Europe and it is no surprise that 
2012 was difficult for retailers in general.  
But our teams have worked hard, actively 
managing the business, focusing on 
improving our customer offer and 
optimising our cash generation in these 
difficult markets. These are the right 
things to do to ensure we can deliver 
value for shareholders over the medium 
term. We achieved growth in France, our 
most significant market, and continued to 
expand in Poland, Russia, Turkey and 
Spain. Whilst B&Q found the UK 
consumer market difficult, our trade 
businesses in the UK, Screwfix and 
TradePoint, grew strongly. We remain 
confident in our future prospects and it is 
for this reason that we are proposing to 
raise the dividend by 7.0% despite 
adjusted pre-tax profits being down 
11.4% to £715m. 
We have also continued to make good 
progress on our sustainability agenda, 
with the launch in October of our Net 
Positive plan. You can read more  
about Net Positive on page 16. 
I would like to welcome two new directors 
who joined the Board in October. Karen 
Witts joined as Group Finance Director 
and brings with her a wealth of financial 
and operational management experience 
from her previous roles at Vodafone and 
BT, among others. Philippe Tible, a 
highly experienced retailer, who is 
responsible for our Castorama and Brico 
Dépôt brands across Europe, also joined 
the board. Euan Sutherland stepped 
down from the Board in January to take 
up a CEO role outside the Group and we 
wish him well in his new position. 
I would like to thank our 78,000 staff for 
their hard work and commitment during 
these difficult economic times. They have 
done an excellent job providing the level 
of service which customers expect and  
ensuring that we start the new year  
with confidence.

Chief Executive’s statement 
 
As the Chairman says in his review, it  
has been a tough year for Kingfisher, with 
currency movements, weather and weak 
consumer markets providing significant 
headwinds for our businesses. But I am 
pleased that the hard work of our teams 
and our firm focus on our well established 
programme of self-help initiatives, including 
cost efficiencies and sourcing gains, helped 
offset some of these headwinds and 
enabled us to end the year in good shape. 
We continued to actively manage the 
business, generating cash and a positive 
economic profit whilst successfully 
delivering the first year of our Creating the 
Leader programme, which is designed to 
increase shareholder value over the 
medium-term.  
We made good progress on the four key 
areas of this programme: Easier, Common, 
Expand and One Team. This Annual 
Report includes many examples of the key 
milestones we achieved in the year but a 
few worthy of particular note include: 
 Increased investment in online 
retailing. Screwfix launched a mobile 
‘click, pay & collect’ service for 
customers and has developed a Group 
omnichannel platform that has enabled 
B&Q’s TradePoint business to launch a 
transactional website. A lot of work also 
went into preparing for the launch of a 
new and improved online offer for  
B&Q later in 2013.  
 Grown the amount of product that is 
sourced direct from suppliers around 
the world using our global network of 
sourcing offices. Particularly strong 
growth in direct sourced product was 
achieved in our developing markets, 
Poland, Russia, Turkey and China.  
We also achieved our target of sharing 
more of our best own brand products 
across our businesses.  
 Opened 70 net new stores during  
the year in markets where economic 
returns are attractive, including 60 new 
Screwfix units in the UK. We revamped 
and extended five Castorama stores in 
France and are trialling a new format 
store in China targeting the Do-it-for-
Me apartment design market. 
 Worked more closely together as a 
networked organisation. We have  
now launched the Kingfisher ‘One 
Academy’ with the aim of attracting 
and developing a top team of the best 
talent in international retailing. We also 
launched Kingfisher’s Net Positive 
sustainability strategy. Our aim is to go 
beyond simply being ‘neutral’ or doing 
less harm, towards making a net 
positive contribution. Our focus is on 
four areas: timber, energy, innovation 
and communities and I am convinced 
that this approach is vital as businesses 
must be a force for good in society. 
During the year we developed the wider 
management team, mostly through 
internal promotion, adding Steve Willett 
and Guy Colleau to the Group Executive 
team. Steve takes on responsibility  
for our omnichannel activities as well as 
overseeing Group productivity. Steve’s 
previous role as CEO of Screwfix makes 
him ideally suited to this role. Guy, who 
was previously CEO of Castorama France, 
takes on responsibility for driving our 
product agenda across our businesses. 
So, in summary, it was a tough year but 
we ended it in good shape, with a strong 
balance sheet and with our Creating the 
Leader programme well underway. We 
will continue with this programme in  
the coming year and later in this Annual 
Report you will find more details of the 
key activities we have planned.  
Although the economic background 
remains challenging, I believe Kingfisher 
continues to have excellent prospects as 
we work towards our aim of making it 
easier for customers to have better,  
more sustainable homes.

Our markets 
 
We currently operate in eight countries, 
spanning over 500 million households. 
Our research shows that spending on 
home improvement is a key priority for 
householders, making this an attractive 
sector for retailers. It’s also attractive 
because of the relatively small  
number of well-known manufacturer 
brands. This means a specialist home 
improvement retailer provides a vital 
role for the consumer by offering a 
wide product choice and expert 
advice. They can offer a high 
proportion of ‘own brand’ product, 
achieve economies of scale and have a 
more defensible position against online 
or generalist operators when compared 
with other retail segments. 
 
Strategy 
 
Our unique contribution as a business 
to our customers is that we can 
harness our home improvement 
experience, our heritage as a leader  
in sustainability and our international 
scale and sourcing capability to bring 
new, more sustainable and more 
affordable products to market. 
 
By also providing our customers  
with project advice and new shopping 
channels to complement our stores, 
we will make it easier for them to  
adapt their homes to their evolving 
needs. Our shorthand for describing 
this purpose is ‘Better Homes,  
Better Lives’.  
 
The current phase of our development 
towards this vision – Creating the 
Leader – builds on the success of 
‘Delivering Value’, our previous  
four-year growth plan, which 
has repositioned Kingfisher as a  
stronger business in the attractive  
home improvement market.

Financial benefits 
Predicting future potential retail profit benefits from this strategy, when we don’t know the economic conditions or 
competitive landscape we will face in the future is very difficult. However, whatever the conditions, we believe our efforts will 
drive higher LFL sales, higher gross margin and more cost efficiencies than would have been delivered without this strategy. 
In 2011/12 we estimated that this would create an additional £300 million of annualised retail profit in the fifth year, net of 
price reinvestment and based on the size of the business and market conditions at that time. 
For more information on how our strategy is linked to Risk reporting and Remuneration see pages 25 and 45 respectively.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Sustainability: becoming Net Positive  
KINGFISHER LAUNCHED NET POSITIVE IN 2012, WITH AN AMBITION TO CONTRIBUTE 
POSITIVELY TO SOME OF THE BIG CHALLENGES FACING THE WORLD, WHILE CREATING  
A MORE VALUABLE AND SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS. 
Introduction 
Net Positive is a new approach to doing 
business for Kingfisher. It means going 
beyond achieving zero impact,  
and committing to make a positive 
contribution across four priority  
areas: Timber, Energy, Innovation and 
Communities. In practice it means:  
not just preventing deforestation but 
working towards net reforestation; helping 
to create homes that are generators of 
their own energy; innovating products 
and services that are restorative by 
design; and working in communities to 
connect people and equip them with 
practical skills.  
Net Positive underpins Kingfisher’s 
Creating the Leader strategy. It will help 
us secure resources, unlock opportunities 
for growth, inspire our people, and be  
a catalyst for collaboration.  
In each of our priority areas we will 
transform the way Kingfisher operates  
to become Net Positive by 2050 (see 
chart below). We will take what we learn 
and integrate it across our business. 
Progress will be reported via our Net 
Positive dashboard. 
Timber 
Deforestation and rising demand  
means wood prices could increase by  
30-75% by 2020. To maintain access to 
affordable supplies we need to protect 
and improve forests.  
Our aspiration is that by 2050 we will 
create more forest than we use. We are 
aiming for all timber and paper in our 
operations, products, packaging and 
construction to be responsibly sourced by 
2020. Our companies such as B&Q UK 
and Brico Dépôt Spain are starting  
local forest projects that benefit the 
environment and economy, and create 
local sustainable timber supplies.  
For the products we sold in 2012/13, 
89% of the timber (by volume) was 
responsibly sourced, compared with  
86% in 2011/12.  
Energy 
With super energy-efficient products and 
tools and materials for eco-retrofits and 
micro-generation, we can help customers 
save money and improve their homes. 
The market for in-home energy efficiency 
is predicted to be €70bn by 2020 across 
our European markets.  
Our aspiration is that by 2050 every 
Kingfisher store and customer home is 
zero carbon or generates more energy 
than it consumes. Over the past two 
years, sales of energy-saving products 
helped our customers save over 5 TWh  
in energy use. Our target is 38 TWh by 
2020 – equivalent to the annual energy 
consumption of every house in Scotland 
(2.3 million homes). 
We reduced our absolute carbon  
footprint (emissions from property energy 
use, dedicated delivery fleets and business 
travel by road) by 3% compared with 
2010/11, towards our target of a 25% 
reduction by 2020, which helps to reduce 
operating costs.  
Innovation 
Switching to more sustainable materials 
and business models, and designing out 
waste through closed loop systems, 
generates value for our business and 
customers. Our aspiration is that by 2050 
every Kingfisher product will enable a 
more sustainable and ultimately Net 
Positive lifestyle, so that creating and 
using products will waste nothing.  
We have set a target to offer 1,000 
different products with closed-loop 
credentials by 2020, and we are working 
towards this with partners such as the 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Many 
products already have closed loop 
credentials, such as B&Q’s New Life 
Paint made from waste paint.  
This builds on our track record in eco-
product innovation. During 2012/13 
products with eco-credentials accounted 
for 20% of retail sales (see page 15) and 
we aim for 50% by 2020. ‘Best-in-class’, 
our most innovative eco-products, 
accounted for 5% of sales.  
Communities 
In local communities we have seen a 
decline in the practical skills of making 
and mending. Equipping people with 
these skills is good for individuals and 
communities and will help galvanise 
potential customers. 
Our aspiration is that every Kingfisher 
store and location supports projects 
which build local communities or equip 
people with skills. By 2020, our target is 
to have completed 4,000 community 
projects that deliver our ‘Better Homes, 
Better Lives’ purpose. In 2012/13 we 
launched free DIY classes for school 
children in Castorama Poland, a fun way 
to learn about DIY and the environment.

Overview 
The Group’s financial reporting year ends on the nearest 
Saturday to 31 January. The current year is for the 53 weeks 
ended 2 February 2013 with the comparative financial year 
being for the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2012. This only 
impacts the UK & Ireland businesses with all of the other 
businesses reporting on a calendar basis as a result of local 
requirements. The effect of the 53
rd
 week on the results of the 
Group is the inclusion of an additional £72m sales and an 
immaterial benefit to retail profit. 
Total sales grew by 0.5% on a constant currency 52 week basis 
and declined by 2.4% to £10.6 billion (2011/12: £10.8 billion) 
on a reported rate basis. On a like-for-like basis, Group sales 
were down 2.9% (2011/12: +1.3%). During the year, a net 
additional 69 new stores were opened, including 60 Screwfix 
outlets, taking the store network to 988 stores (excluding 37 
Turkey JV stores).  
Retail profit before exceptional items declined by £101 million 
to £781 million (2011/12: £882 million) including a £39 million 
adverse foreign exchange movement representing a 7.3% 
decline on a constant currency basis. This decline was as  
a result of challenging trading conditions and unfavourable 
weather patterns. Including exceptional items, retail profit 
declined by 13.2% to £755 million (2011/12: £870 million). 
The net interest charge for the year was £4 million, down  
£6 million on the prior period. A breakdown of this is  
shown below.  
Profit before tax declined by 13.3% to £691 million. After 
removing the impact of exceptional items and fair value 
remeasurements, adjusted pre-tax profit declined by  
11.4% to £715 million. 
Profit after tax for the period was £564 million (2011/12: £639 
million). This resulted in the Group recording a basic EPS of 
24.1p in the year (2011/12: 27.5p).

Kingfisher France 
Kingfisher France sales grew by 0.3% to £4.2 billion (-1.6% LFL) 
in slower markets. Two net new stores were opened and five 
were revamped, adding around 2% new space.  
Retail profit grew by 0.2%, broadly in line with sales growth. 
Gross margins were up 10 basis points reflecting on-going self-
help initiatives offsetting some investment in pricing. Costs were 
tightly controlled and also reflect lower levels of variable pay 
during the year. 
Castorama total sales grew by 2.0% to £2.3 billion  
(-0.5% LFL). According to Banque de France data, sales for  
the home improvement market were down 0.8%. Castorama 
outperformed the market benefiting from its innovative ‘Do-it-
Smart’ approach aimed at making home improvement projects 
easier for customers.  
Brico Dépôt, which more specifically targets trade professionals 
and heavy DIYers, was impacted by a slower house building 
market, with new housing starts and planning consent data
(1)
 
down around 18% and 9% respectively. Total sales declined by 
1.7% to £1.9 billion (-2.8% LFL). Self-help initiatives progressed 
well, including new ranges introduced last year (e.g. heating 
and joinery ranges) and more ‘arrivages’ promotions (rolling 
programmes of one-off special buys), reinforcing Brico Dépôt’s 
value credentials.

the nearest Saturday to 31 January. This year this has resulted in  
a 53 week year.  
All trading commentary below is in constant currencies and % movements on 
a 52 week basis. 
Kingfisher UK & Ireland 
Kingfisher UK & Ireland total sales were down 2.0% to £4.3 
billion (-5.2% LFL) in a declining market impacted by weak 
consumer confidence and record adverse summer weather. 
Retail profit declined by 13.8% to £234 million.  
B&Q UK & Ireland’s total sales were down 3.6% (-5.6% LFL) 
to £3.7 billion reflecting the difficult UK backdrop and a 
particularly challenging environment in Ireland, where our nine 
stores incurred losses of £7 million and are now subject to an 
Examinership process.  
The market
(1)
 for the UK’s leading home improvement retailers 
was down around 3%, including seasonal ranges down 9%.  
On a comparable basis, B&Q outperformed the market, with 
sales down around 2%.  
Sales of outdoor seasonal products were down around 9%  
with average footfall down 20% in the severely weather-affected 
weeks. Sales of building products were also impacted by the 
adverse weather. Sales of indoor decorative products fared 
better as customers switched some of their home improvement 
activities indoors. Cash sales
(2)
 of showroom (kitchens, 
bathrooms and bedrooms) products were slightly higher year  
on year, showing that the new Every Day Low Prices (EDLP) 
trading strategy in this category is starting to gain traction with 
customers in a challenging market.  
Retail profit declined by 20.8% to £187 million. Gross margins 
were down 20 basis points, with the benefits from ongoing self-
help initiatives offset by some additional promotional activity, the 
decision to accelerate clearance ahead of the national rollout of 
new ranges of tiling and décor products, and a higher mix of 
‘TradePoint’ sales.  
  19
Business review Governance Accounts
 www.kingﬁ sher.com
 
TradePoint continues to progress well. Sales to TradePoint 
customers were up around 20% and now account for nearly 
20% of total store sales. Over 1.2 million customers have now 
registered as TradePoint customers, with around a third having 
shopped in the last month.  
A strong focus on operating cost efficiencies continued. Costs 
also reflect lower levels of variable pay this year and the benefit 
of a settlement of a one-off construction related claim for around 
£5 million.  
Screwfix grew total sales by 9.8% to £577 million, despite the 
challenging smaller tradesman market
(3)
, benefiting from the 
continued rollout of new outlets, the success of ‘click, pay & 
collect’ and a redesigned catalogue. Sixty new outlets were 
opened, taking the total to 275.  
Retail profit was up 33.9% to £47 million, reflecting the strong 
sales growth, gross margins benefiting from on-going self-help 
initiatives and continued tight cost control. 
UK reporting 
B&Q and Screwfix are increasingly operating together, sharing a 
distribution network, jointly developing several major initiatives, 
including omnichannel, the provision of energy efficiency 
products and services and adopting a complementary strategy 
for UK growth. As a result, from next year (2013/14) reporting  
in the UK will mirror our current practice in France and provide 
one overall profit figure along with a commentary on the sales 
performance of each major business.

All trading commentary below is in constant currencies. 
Other International total sales increased by 6.6% to  
£2.1 billion (-0.7% LFL) supported by new store openings and 
strong growth in Russia, now the second largest business in  
the division. However, with the exception of Russia, economic 
uncertainty in Europe impacted LFL sales and profitability.  
Retail profit declined by 14.3% to £150 million.  
During the year seven net new stores were opened adding 
around 3% new space. Three stores were opened in both 
Poland and Spain, one in both Russia and Turkey and one  
store rationalisation in China. 
In Poland and Spain sales grew reflecting new store space, 
however both markets were impacted by weak consumer 
confidence. Sales in Poland were up 0.6% (-5.1% LFL) to 
£1,029 million. Gross margins were down 110 basis points, with 
self-help initiatives offset by some investment in pricing. Tight 
cost control more than offset cost inflation resulting in a 15.3% 
decline in retail profit to £107 million. Sales in Spain grew by 
3.0% (-6.8% LFL) to £234 million. Retail profit was £1 million, 
down from £7 million reported last year, reflecting the difficult 
market and higher pre-opening costs after the resumption of 
new store openings.  
In Russia sales grew by 38.3% in a strong market to £426 million 
(+17.9% LFL) benefiting from new store openings. Retail profit 
was £16 million, compared to £2 million reported in 2011/12.  
In Turkey, Kingfisher’s 50% JV, Koçta s ¸, grew sales by 4.1%  
(-4.1% LFL) reflecting one new store opening offset by a slower 
economic environment and the impact of poor weather early in 
the year. Retail profit contribution was £9 million, down 28.2% 
year on year.  
Hornbach, in which Kingfisher has a 21% economic interest, 
contributed £26 million to retail profit, down 15.2% on last year 
reflecting a £5 million loss in Q1 and a weaker market in Q4. 
B&Q China sales declined by 0.8% (+0.1% LFL) to £374 million 
reflecting one less store compared to last year. The retail loss  
was £9 million (2011/12: £3 million reported loss) after reflecting 
around £3 million of costs relating to the new format store trial.

(1) FFVR represents changes in the fair value of financing derivatives, 
excluding interest accruals, offset by fair value adjustments to the  
carrying value of borrowings and other hedged items under fair value 
hedge relationships. 
Underlying net interest has fallen by £6 million driven by a fall in 
interest on net debt as a result of the repayment of €200 million 
(£162 million) EMTN
(2)
 in November 2012 and from a full year’s 
benefit of buying back debt in 2011/12. This was offset by an 
increase in the net pensions interest cost, principally due to a 
reduction in the asset return assumption.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Financial Review continued 
 
Taxation 
Kingfisher’s effective tax rate is sensitive to the blend of tax rates 
and profits in the Group’s various jurisdictions. The adjusted 
effective rate of tax, calculated on profit before exceptional 
items, prior year tax adjustments and the impact of rate 
changes is 27% (2011/12: 28%). This is higher than the UK 
statutory rate because of the amount of Group profit that is 
earned in higher tax jurisdictions and because no future benefit 
is assumed for losses incurred in overseas jurisdictions such  
as China and Ireland. The overall tax rate for the year is 18% 
(2011/12: 20%) reflecting the impact on deferred tax of the 
further 2% fall in the UK rate, release of prior year provisions 
either reassessed or time expired and a claim for the use of  
prior year losses of £33 million.

The effective rate of tax is lower than in 2011/12 as a result of 
tax rate changes in some of the countries in which we operate. 
The most significant changes were the UK statutory tax rate 
falling from 26% to 24% offset by increased levels of costs for 
which no tax relief is available in France. 
The tax rates for this financial year and the expected rates for 
next year are as follows:

Tax contribution 
Kingfisher makes a major contribution to the economies of each 
country in which it operates including the taxes that it both pays 
to and collects for governments. The Group has borne cash 
taxes on its profits, properties, in employing its workforce, in 
environmental levies, in customs and fuel duties as well as 
bearing other local taxes. The level of corporate income tax  
paid is detailed in the consolidated cash flow statement,  
whilst further information regarding the corporate income  
tax expense is contained within note 9. The most significant  
of the taxes collected are sales taxes charged to customers 
(VAT) on their purchases and employee payroll taxes. Taxes 
paid and taxes collected together represent Kingfisher’s total  
tax contribution which is shown below:

Taxation governance and risk management 
The Group’s Code of Conduct applies high standards of 
professionalism and integrity as well as a requirement to comply 
with applicable laws which underpins the Group’s approach to 
tax governance. The Group employs appropriately qualified staff 
who are responsible for ensuring tax compliance requirements 
are met. Tax matters are reviewed by the Financial Initiatives 
Tax and Treasury Committee. Further details of the governance 
framework are contained within the Governance report. 
Kingfisher’s tax strategy is to manage its tax affairs efficiently 
and in a way which enhances shareholder value whilst 
balancing the tax risks it faces. Tax risks can arise from changes 
in law, differences in interpretation of law, changes in tax rates 
and the failure to comply with the applicable tax laws and 
associated procedures. The Group manages and controls these 
risks through local management, its Group tax department and 
appropriate advice from reputable professional firms. Where 
disputes arise with the tax authorities, the Group addresses  
the areas of dispute promptly in a professional, open and 
constructive manner. 
The Audit Committee and the main Board regularly review the 
management and control of its tax affairs and related tax risks.

Following a sustained decline in trading at B&Q Ireland, the 
Group undertook a detailed review of its Irish operations and as 
a result, B&Q Ireland entered into an Examinership process in 
January 2013. The £21 million restructuring charge represents 
provisions recorded for the impairment of properties and 
estimated costs of exiting leases and other closure activities. 
Around £13 million of this cost will result in a cash outflow, of 
which around £11 million will be in 2013/14. 
The UK restructuring net charge of £16 million principally 
reflects the streamlining of B&Q UK & Ireland’s store support 
office and its kitchen, bathroom and bedroom business as well 
as IT services. It also includes a £4 million release (2011/12:  
£2 million) of an onerous property contract provision for idle 
stores either sublet or exited in the period, which had previously 
been included as part of the B&Q UK store closure and 
downsizing programme in 2005/06.  
Netted against these charges is a net pensions accounting 
credit of £11 million (2011/12: £nil), see the pensions section 
below for details.  
Tax on exceptional items amounts to a credit of £1 million 
(2011/12: £7 million credit). 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) have decreased by 12.4%  
to 24.1p (2011/12: 27.5p). On a more comparable basis, 
removing the impact of exceptional items, financing fair value 
remeasurements and the effect of prior year tax adjustments, 
adjusted basic earnings per share decreased by 11.2% to 
22.3p (2011/12: 25.1p).  
 2012/13 2011/12

Impact of prior year items and exceptional items 
on income tax (2.8)p (2.8)p
Adjusted earnings per share 22.3p 25.1p
Dividends 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.37p which results 
in a full year dividend of 9.46p, an increase of 7.0% (2011/12: 
8.84p). The final dividend reduces full year dividend cover on 
adjusted earnings to 2.4 times (2011/12: 2.8 times). 
Going forward the Group will aim to move towards a medium 
term annual dividend cover of around 2.5 times. At this level, 
the Board believes the dividend will continue to be prudently 
covered by earnings and free cash flow and remain consistent 
with the capital needs of the business. 
From 2013/14 the Group will also move away from the 
mechanistic calculation of the interim dividend as 35 per cent  
of the previous year’s total dividends and instead set both  
the interim and final dividend by reference to the current  
year’s earnings. 
The full year dividend will continue to be proposed each year  
as part of the full year preliminary announcement in March. 
The final dividend for the year ended 2 February 2013 will be 
paid on 17 June 2013 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 10 May 2013, subject to approval of shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 13 June 2013. A 
dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available to shareholders 
who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the 
Company. The shares will go ex-dividend on 8 May 2013. For 
those shareholders electing to receive the DRIP the last date for 
receipt of electing is 24 May 2013. 
Economic Returns 
Management are focused on Kingfisher Economic Profit (KEP) 
as our main measure of return on capital. KEP is derived from 
the concept of Economic Value Added and is used to ensure 
capital is being used productively and decisions made which 
will create value for shareholders. KEP takes into account a 
charge for the capital employed in the business. In doing this 
the calculation treats leases as though they were owned assets 
within capital employed, capitalising them using the long-term 
yield methodology. For the purposes of the calculation, adjusted 
post-tax profit is used, but interest and property lease costs are 
added back. A charge for the cost of capital employed is then 
deducted by applying the Group’s lease adjusted weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) to its lease and pension adjusted 
capital employed.

outs of freeholds in existing leased stores.  
(3) Includes dividends received from JVs and associates, business 
acquisitions, issue of shares and exceptional items (excluding  
property disposals). 
Net cash at the end of the year was £38 million (2011/12:  
£88 million net debt).  
Free cash flow of £330 million was generated in the year,  
a decline of £37 million year-on-year primarily due to the 
reduced profit generation offset by lower capital expenditure.  
During the year free cash flow generated was utilised to improve 
shareholder returns with the dividend being increased to  
£221 million.  
In the prior year we invested additional funds outside of our 
normal ‘free cash flow’ with £112 million allocated to strategic 
capex investments and £117 million on acquiring our own 
shares to match employee incentive schemes. The strategic 
capex spend included £73 million in the UK where we had 
actively decided to purchase freeholds already occupied and 
£39 million on the acquisition of 29 Focus stores.  
The Group will maintain a high focus on free cash flow 
generation going forward to maintain its solid investment grade 
balance sheet, fund investment where economic returns  
are attractive and pay healthy dividends to shareholders. 
Capital expenditure 
Gross capital expenditure for the year was £316 million 
(2011/12: £450 million). A total of £17 million of proceeds from 
disposals were received during the year (2011/12: £9 million).  
As detailed last year the Group has a rigorous approach to 
capital allocation and authorisation. The process includes: 
 An annual strategic planning process based on detailed 
medium term plans for all businesses for the next four years. 
This process drives the key strategic capital allocation 
decisions and the output is reviewed by the Board; 
 A capital approval process through a capital expenditure 
committee, attended by the Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, CEO Group Productivity and Development, 
Group Property Director, Group General Counsel. The 
committee is delegated to review all projects above £0.75 
million and to sign-off the projects between £0.75 million  
and £15.0 million (including the capitalised value of  
lease commitments); 
 Projects above £15.0 million are required to be approved by 
the Board although all projects above £0.75 million are also 
notified to the Board; 
 Clear investment criteria including KEP and NPV (Net Present 
Value) and challenging hurdle rates for IRR (Internal Rate of 
Return) and DPB (Discounted PayBack); 
 An annual post-investment review process to undertake a  
full assessment of all projects above £0.75 million which  
were completed in the last two to four years. The findings of 
this exercise are considered by both the capital expenditure 
committee and the Board and used to inform the 
assumptions for similar project proposals going forward. 
 An annual review of KEP by store is performed which drives 
plans to improve the returns of weaker stores.  23

Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for 
managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed, 
details of which are provided in note 24 of the accounts. 
Management of balance sheet and liquidity risk 
and financing 
The Group finished the year with £38 million of net cash on the 
balance sheet. However, the Group’s overall leverage is more 
significant when including capitalised lease debt that in 
accordance with accounting regulations does not appear on the 
balance sheet. The ratio of the Group’s lease adjusted net debt 
(capitalising leases at 8 times annual rent) to adjusted EBITDAR 
is 2.4 times as at the year end. At this level the Group has 
financial flexibility whilst retaining an efficient cost of capital. 
A reconciliation of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR is set  
out below.

(1) Calculated as Retail profit less central costs and before depreciation

(2) Kingfisher believes 8x is a reasonable industry standard for estimating the 
economic value of its leased assets. 
Kingfisher aims to maintain its solid investment grade  
credit rating whilst investing in the business where economic  
returns are attractive and paying a healthy annual dividend to 
shareholders. After satisfying these key aims and taking into 
account the economic and trading outlook any surplus capital 
would be returned to shareholders.  
Where appropriate Kingfisher may purchase current leasehold 
assets used by the Group. This may increase financial debt but 
should have no material impact on lease adjusted net debt. 
Kingfisher regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities 
required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent 
cash flow forecast for the next three years, determining the  
level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning  
for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an 
appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve  
against unexpected outflows.  
The Group derives around half its profit from the eurozone,  
and as such is exposed to economic conditions in the member 
states. The Group continues to monitor potential exposures and 
risks, and develop effective risk management solutions. 
Kingfisher has a £200 million committed bank facility maturing 
in August 2016, which remained undrawn at the year end. 
Kingfisher deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with 
the strongest short-term credit ratings and with money market 
funds which have the strongest, AAA, credit rating and offer 
same day liquidity. A credit limit for each bank or fund is agreed 
by the Board covering the full value of deposits and a proportion 
of the value of derivative contracts. The credit risk is reduced 
further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts 
across several counterparties. At the year end, the Group had  
a total of around £400 million of cash deposited with banks and 
in money market funds. The highest single cash investment was 
a £32 million money market fund investment. 
The maturity profile of Kingfisher’s debt is illustrated at: 
http://www.kingfisher.com/index.asp?pageid=76 
The terms of the US Private Placement note agreement and  
the committed bank facility require only that the ratio of Group 
operating profit, excluding exceptional items, to net interest 
payable must be no less than 3:1 for the preceding 12 months 
at half year and full year ends. At the year end the Group’s ratio 
was significantly higher than this requirement. 
The Group has entered into interest rate derivative contracts  
to convert the fixed rate payable on its bonds and US Private 
Placement notes to a floating rate of interest. The floating 
interest rates paid by the Group under its financing 
arrangements are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR plus a 
margin. The margins were not changed during the year.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Financial Review continued 
 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are: 
 To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and retain financial flexibility in order to continue  
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and 
 To maintain a solid investment grade credit rating of BBB. 
The Group manages its capital by: 
 Continued focus on free cash flow generation; 
 Setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the 
context of current year and forecast free cash flow generation; 
 Rigorous review of capital investments and post investment 
reviews to drive better returns; and  
 Monitoring the level of the Group’s financial and leasehold 
debt in the context of Group performance and its credit rating. 
Kingfisher Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, is 
subject to minimum capital requirements as a consequence of 
its insurance activities. The Group complied with the externally 
imposed capital requirements during the year.  
Property 
The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which  
is used for trading purposes. A valuation was performed for 
internal purposes in November 2012 with over one-third of the 
portfolio valued by external professional valuers where the key 
assumption is the estimated yields. Based on this exercise the 
value of this property is £3.6 billion at year end (2011/12: £3.5 
billion). This is compared to the net book value of £2.9 billion 
(2011/12: £2.8 billion) recorded in the financial statements.  
Pensions 
The approach used to prepare the pension valuation is in  
line with current market practice and international accounting 
standards, and has been applied consistently. This accounting 
valuation is very sensitive to a number of assumptions and 
market rates which are likely to fluctuate in the future. To aid 
understanding of the impact that changes to the assumptions 
could have on the reported UK pension surplus, we have 
included sensitivity analysis as part of the pension disclosure  
in note 27. Further details of key assumptions are also 
contained within the note.  
At the year end, the Group had a net position of £nil  
(2011/12: £15 million deficit) in relation to defined benefit 
pension arrangements of which a £71 million surplus  
(2011/12: £25 million surplus) is in relation to its  
UK Scheme.  
The decrease in the net deficit was predominantly due to strong 
asset returns, more than offsetting a lower real discount rate 
used to value the UK pension obligation. 
During the year, and following consultation with the active 
members, the UK final salary pension scheme was closed  
to future benefit accrual with effect from 30 June 2012.  
The scheme had been closed to new entrants in 2004. A net 
exceptional pensions accounting credit of £11 million has been 
recognised. This includes a £27 million non-cash curtailment 
gain, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities 
as benefits are no longer linked to future salary increases other 
than in line with inflation. It is offset by a £16 million charge for 
transitional payments to the active members. From July 2012 
an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered  
to all UK employees, with the reduction in cash contributions  
to the final salary scheme offset by higher contributions to the 
defined contribution scheme. Auto-enrolment will commence  
in the current year.  25

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Risks 
 
 
Given the scale of our businesses, the Board of Directors recognises that the nature, scope and potential impact of our key business 
and strategic risks is subject to constant change. As such, the Board has implemented the necessary framework to ensure that it 
has sufficient visibility of the Group’s key risks and the opportunity to regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
mitigating controls and strategies.  
During the year the Board has also considered the nature and level of risk that we are prepared to accept in order to deliver our 
business strategies and have reviewed and approved our internal statement of risk appetite. This describes both the current and 
desired levels of acceptable risk, supported by high level qualitative risk statements, ensuring that risks are proactively managed to 
the level desired by the Board.  
The Corporate governance report on page 42 describes the systems and processes through which the directors manage and 
mitigate risks. The Board considers that the principal risks to achieving its strategic aims are set out below. 
Easier 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Making it easier for  
our customers to improve  
their home 
We fail to deliver demand and value 
through the “easier” initiatives due to a 
lack of rigorous change management 
disciplines, capabilities and resources. 
Across our markets we are committed to ensuring that our stores and online 
fulfilment channels are aligned with our desire to optimise our customers’ 
retail experience. To support this we continue to evolve and innovate across 
our product ranges, formats and customer offer.  
Changes are, however, only implemented once we have completed an 
appropriate level of planning and testing, relative to the risk, and we have 
ensured that the assumptions and insight, that support the introduction of 
new products or services, will deliver the benefits to both our customers and 
our shareholders prior to their introduction. 
 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Giving our customers  
more ways to shop 
We fail to invest in the systems and 
supply chain platforms necessary to 
maintain either competitive parity or 
advantage, amongst online or 
omnichannel competitors. 
Across our businesses we recognise both the threats and opportunities 
presented by omnichannel retailing and are taking the necessary steps to 
ensure we remain competitive in our respective markets. This is supported 
by a significant investment programme across our systems and supply 
chain architectures. This includes significant investments in:  
 Warehouse management, forecasting and replenishment technologies  
to ensure we maximise operational agility and optimise the flow of product 
in order to meet customer demand. 
 Optimising distribution and logistics platforms to ensure we can deliver 
products via the most efficient routes to market. 
 The delivery of leading edge web architectures and platforms to provide  
a compelling online offer including the options to deliver enhanced  
‘click, pay and collect’ functionality, across smart phone and tablet  
based applications. 
 
Common 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Building innovative  
common brands 
We fail to unlock the potential to 
generate further shareholder value 
through the optimisation of combined 
purchasing and commercial synergies, 
while retaining accountability at our 
Operating Companies. 
The development of common brands and synergies remains a priority 
across the organisation. To ensure that we maximise the opportunities  
to deliver the differentiation of product ranges with competitors, through 
innovative and exclusive product, and to increase and maximise scale 
efficiencies we: 
 Are implementing high quality analytic technologies to ensure that we 
understand our buying behaviours, habits and product insight across all 
of our businesses and that we are able to identify specific opportunities 
to drive the optimal, and most profitable, outcomes from our common 
buying decisions.  
 Have set up a common projects team to identify the optimum 
opportunities for implementing common products across the Group.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
Risks continued 
 
Expand 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Growing our presence  
in existing markets 
Our investments in new store formats 
and customer proposition strategies  
fail to stimulate increased consumer 
spend and do not deliver the desired 
return to top line like-for-like growth  
in our mature markets. 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty surrounding the resilience 
of the global economy and volatility in 
the Eurozone continues to impact both 
consumer confidence and the long 
term sustainability and capabilities of 
our supplier base. 
Despite the ongoing challenges of global austerity programmes and  
their impact on consumer confidence, we are committed to re-investing  
in our mature markets to maintain market share and to ensure  
market leadership.  
We continue to invest in our existing store portfolio whilst seeking to 
minimise its cost base and optimise sales densities. Where there are 
opportunities to expand and innovate we will do so using a combination  
of existing and new formats, and try low risk market entry and new flexible 
store format strategies based on the utilisation of current Operating 
Company skills and resources.  
With continuing market volatility and uncertainty across all of the 
economies in which we operate, particularly within the Eurozone, we 
continue to monitor potential exposures and risks and provide effective  
risk management solutions to both our businesses and our strategic 
suppliers. These include: 
 The provision of supply chain finance programmes to support  
strategic suppliers. 
 Support from a strong portfolio of international banking partners with the 
strongest short term credit rating that provide flexibility, diversification of 
cash holdings, access to funding and reliable local retail cash and card 
payment processing services. 
 An appropriate and prudent mix of hedging policies, cash deposits and 
debt financing to minimise the impact of foreign exchange currency 
volatility on the Group. 
 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Expand in new and  
developing markets 
We lack the necessary agility  
and capability to identify, assess  
and take advantage of potential 
opportunities for overseas expansion 
and market penetration strategies  
for existing markets. 
We continually review and assess opportunities for expansion, in terms of 
both online and bricks and mortar retail, across all of the territories and 
regions in which we operate.  
Country and market entry strategies are based on the application of a 
proven operating model and supported by the Operating Company with the 
most relevant experience, capabilities and capacity to successfully lead a 
market entry strategy.  
We also ensure that any proposed acquisition or market entry strategy is 
subject to an appropriate level of challenge and due diligence from both 
the Group Executive and specialist Group functions which may include the 
Tax, Treasury, Legal, Group Finance and Group Risk and Internal Audit 
functions. This due diligence is also supported by external and 
independent advisors when necessary. 
 
 
One Team 
Strategic aim Group risks Mitigation 
 Developing leaders  
and connecting people 
We do not make the necessary 
investment in our people to ensure that 
we have the appropriate calibre of staff, 
skills and experience. 
Across our businesses we are developing our talent, building our 
leadership capability and connecting our people through intelligent 
networks. Specific examples of this include: 
 The continued investment in development of our senior leaders  
through the Kingfisher ‘One Academy’, including the 2020 Leadership 
Programme and the development of networks across our businesses. 
 Focused development activities for our store-based colleagues, including 
the roll out of national apprenticeship schemes across our UK and 
French businesses, and an increased focus on how we support and 
recognise the role of our customer advisors across the organisation. 
 Recognition of the importance of ensuring a constant flow of  
developing talent through structured graduate and management trainee 
programmes, providing sustainable career development paths supported 
by new and innovative reward and bonus frameworks.

Operational Risks 
 Risk Mitigation 
 Pricing A lack of perceived price 
competitiveness, particularly when 
compared to more discount based  
or online competitors, would affect  
our ability to maintain or grow  
market share. 
Significant investment in pricing to reinforce and communicate our  
value credentials.  
This is supported by:  
 The use of improved customer insight and analytical tools to optimise 
product ranging and pricing strategies 
 Increased margin flexibility through partnerships with strategic vendors 
and the leveraging of Group buying opportunities 
 More targeted use of online and mass media tools to communicate and 
reinforce price perception (for example, price comparison websites, such 
as kitchen-compare.com and bathroomcompare.com in the UK). 
 
 Risk Mitigation 
 Key supplier resilience  
and continuity 
 
Key product suppliers lacking the 
necessary resilience or disaster 
recovery capabilities to manage the 
impact of on-going global economic 
volatility or the increasing impacts of 
extreme weather cycles and patterns 
on their operations and extended 
supply chains. 
We continue to support our strategic suppliers through a combination of 
relationship management, and ongoing supplier vulnerability assessments, 
supported by supplier financing programmes where appropriate. 
We also proactively look to ensure continuity of supply through the 
expansion of our own brand programmes and dual sourcing strategies 
where possible and commercially viable. On-going investment in our 
sourcing offices outside of the Far East, notably in Poland and Turkey,  
also provides increased flexibility for our sourcing strategies.  
 
 Risk Mitigation 
 Health & safety We fail to maintain a safe environment 
for our customers and store colleagues 
which results in a major incident or 
fatality that is directly attributable to  
a failure in our Health & Safety 
management systems. 
With 78,000 employees and millions of customers visiting our stores  
each week, robust health and safety systems are a priority. The Board is 
committed to creating and sustaining a safe environment for both our staff 
and customers and regularly reviews and challenges Health & Safety 
performance, standards and targets across our businesses.  
As regulatory requirements vary from country to country, each operating 
company is required to designate a director with specific responsibility  
for health and safety. This person is then responsible for ensuring that a 
written health and safety policy is communicated and that appropriate 
health and safety arrangements are in place to protect our employees and 
customers and that we comply with local regulatory requirements.  
Compliance is monitored across our businesses through a programme of 
self-certification and Health & Safety audits, with issues reported through 
local Audit Committees and escalated to the Group Executive or Board 
where necessary. 
 
 Risk Mitigation 
 Environmental or ethical 
failure 
Impact on Kingfisher’s reputation  
and brand arising from a major 
environmental or ethical failure, a 
significant corporate fraud or material 
non-compliance with legislative or 
regulatory requirements resulting in 
punitive or custodial procedures. 
Both employees and suppliers working for or with Kingfisher must conduct 
themselves according to our minimum standards of ethics and behaviours 
as defined by our Code of Conduct. Responsibility for compliance with  
our Code of Conduct rests with each Group Operating Company Chief 
Executive and appropriate resources are available to our businesses to 
ensure that both staff and suppliers are aware of, and comply with, the 
code and our businesses can manage the legislative or regulatory 
challenges presented by their respective jurisdictions.  
Our commitment to sustainability remains a key value for Kingfisher and 
across the organisation we continue to ensure that we engage with our key 
environmental partners and stakeholders to ensure that, where possible, 
we integrate sustainable practices into our business models and our 
property, logistics and distribution strategies.

Directors’ report 
The directors present their report and  
audited financial statements for the  
financial year ended 2 February 2013. 
Principal activities 
The Group’s principal activity is selling home improvement 
products and services through stores, catalogues and online 
channels. Our aim is to make it easier for customers to have 
better and more sustainable homes. 
Business model 
Our unique contribution as a business to our customers is that we 
can harness our home improvement experience, our heritage as a 
leader in sustainability and our international scale and sourcing 
capability to bring new, more sustainable and more profitable 
products and services to market. Our business model aims to 
generate economic profit and cash by maximising our sales whilst 
keeping costs low within our stores, our supply chain and our 
central functions. 
This model is used to deliver Kingfisher’s Creating the Leader 
strategy, which is covered in detail on pages 6 to15. 
Business review 
The Business Review, which is set out on pages 2 to 27 provides a 
comprehensive review of the development, performance and future 
prospects of the Group’s operations for the year ended 2 February 
2013. The information set out in the Business Review includes the 
Group’s Key Performance Indicators, a statement on Corporate 
Responsibility, a Financial Review including financial and capital risk, 
and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group. These sections are incorporated by reference and deemed to 
form part of this report. 
Dividends 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.37p (2011/12: 
6.37p) per ordinary share amounting to £151m (2011/12: 
£148m) to be paid on 17 June 2013 to members appearing on 
the Register at the close of business on 10 May 2013. Together 
with the interim dividend of 3.09p (2011/12: 2.47p) per 
ordinary share, amounting to £73m (2011/12: £57m), paid on 
16 November 2012, the total dividend for the financial year 
ended 2 February 2013 will be 9.46p (2011/12: 8.84p) per 
ordinary share, amounting to £224m (2011/12: £205m). 
The Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust has waived all dividends 
payable by the Company in respect of the ordinary shares held 
by it. The total dividends waived in the year to 2 February 2013 
were in aggregate £3.2m. 
Directors 
Full biographical details of the current directors are set out on  
pages 28 and 29. Philippe Tible and Karen Witts joined the  
Board as executive directors on 1 October 2012, and will seek 
appointment by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) on 13 June 2013. Euan Sutherland joined the Board as an 
executive director on 1 October 2012 and resigned from the Board 
on 31 January 2013 to join the Co-operative Group as CEO. In 
accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all directors will retire and be submitted for appointment or 
re-appointment at the AGM in 2013. 
Directors’ indemnity arrangements 
The Company has provided qualifying third-party deeds of 
indemnity for the benefit of each director and former director 
who held office during the 2012/13 financial year. The 
Company has also purchased and maintained Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance throughout 2012/13. Neither the 
indemnities nor the insurance provides cover in the event that 
the director concerned is proved to have acted fraudulently. 
Directors’ interests 
Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and interests  
in the Company’s shares and share options are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 59. No director 
had a material interest at any time during the year in any derivative 
or financial instrument relating to the Company’s shares. 
Principal risk identification and management 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group have been 
reviewed by the Board and are shown in the Risks section on 
pages 25 to 27. The Risks section also provides information on the 
performance of the Board in actively managing those risks, to allow 
assessment of how the directors have performed their statutory 
duty to promote the success of the Company. 
Employees 
The commitment of the Group’s employees is vital to  
ensure that high standards of customer care and service  
are maintained throughout the business. The Group is fully 
committed to treating its employees and customers with dignity 
and respect, and to valuing diversity. It is Group policy to: 
 ensure there is no discrimination in employment on the 
grounds of race, gender, age, disability, marital status, sexual 
orientation or religious belief; 
 implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer 
service for disabled people equivalent to that offered to non-
disabled people; and 
 maintain a mechanism which customers and employees can 
use to give feedback on the Group’s performance and ensure 
that all customer comments are analysed, responded to and 
acted upon. 
Across the Group, women accounted for 40% of total 
employees and 30% of managers in 2012/13. B&Q UK 
continued its long-established policy of promoting age diversity, 
with around a quarter of its employees aged over 50. 
The Group’s statement on employee development is set out in the 
People section of the Company’s website, and details of employee 
involvement through participation in share incentive schemes are 
contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 59. 
There are a number of communication channels in place to 
help employees to develop their knowledge of, and enhance 
their involvement with, the Group. These channels include 
engagement surveys, briefing groups, internal magazines and 
newsletters that report on business performance and objectives, 
community involvement and other applicable issues. Directors 
and senior management regularly visit stores and discuss 
matters of current interest and concern with employees. 
Corporate responsibility 
Details of the Group’s corporate responsibility policy and 
operations are set out on page 16. 
Charitable donations 
Kingfisher and its subsidiaries made contributions to 
charity/community projects worth an estimated £2.4m 
(2011/12: £1.8m) during the financial year ended 2 February 
2013, equivalent to 0.3% of adjusted pre-tax profits. This 
included cash donations (£1.6m) and gifts-in-kind (£0.5m – 
with product donations at cost price). Support was also given 
through the donation of time by employees (£0.3m).   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

GOVERNANCE 
Directors’ Report continued 
Political donations 
The Board annually seeks and obtains shareholders’ approval  
to enable the Group to make donations or incur expenditure in 
relation to EU political parties, other political organisations or 
independent election candidates under section 366 of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The Group made no political donations during the year 
(2011/12: £nil). As with previous annual approvals, the Group 
has no intention of changing its current policy and practice of 
not making political donations. The Board seeks the approval  
on a precautionary basis to avoid any unintentional breach of 
the relevant provisions. Shareholder approval will be sought at 
this year’s AGM to renew this authority; further details are 
provided in the Notice of AGM. 
Supplier payment policy 
The Company does not impose standard payment terms on its 
suppliers but agrees specific terms with each of them, and then 
pays in accordance with those terms. The Group’s UK operating 
companies have all signed up to the Prompt Payment Code. On 
average, the Company’s suppliers are paid in 45 days. 
Significant agreements – change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following  
a takeover bid, such as bank loan agreements, Medium Term 
Note (‘MTN’) documentation, private placement debt and 
employee share plans. None of these are deemed to be 
significant in terms of their potential impact on the business  
of the Group as a whole except for:  
 the £200 million credit facility dated 8 July 2011 between the 
Company, HSBC Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the banks 
named therein as lenders, which contains a provision such  
that in the event of a change of control any lender may, if  
they so require, notify the agent that they wish to cancel their 
commitment whereupon the commitment of that lender will be 
cancelled and all their outstanding loans, together with accrued 
interest, will become immediately due and payable; and 
 the US$297 million US Private Placement notes, issued 
pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated 24 May 2006 
by the Company to various institutions, which contains a 
provision such that in the event of a change of control, the 
Company is required to make an offer to the holders of the 
US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal amount  
of the notes together with interest accrued. 
The Company does not have agreements with any director or 
officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of 
the Company’s share incentive schemes may cause options and 
awards granted under such schemes to vest on a takeover. 
Essential contracts 
There is no information that the Company would be required to 
disclose about persons with whom it has contractual or other 
arrangements that are essential to the business of the Company. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out in  
note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. All of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank 
equally in all respects. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which 
can be obtained from the Company’s website. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Annual 
Report and Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of 
the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on 
the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) where 
the Company has exercised its right to suspend their voting 
rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of their 
holder or any person interested in them to provide the Company 
with information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of 
the Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their holder is precluded 
from exercising voting rights by the Financial Services Authority 
Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt (‘ADR’) programme in the United States. 
Authority to allot shares 
At the AGM in 2012, shareholders approved a resolution to give the 
directors authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 
£124,107,897. In addition, shareholders approved a resolution to 
give the directors authority to allot up to a nominal amount of 
£248,215,795 in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue in 
accordance with ABI guidance. If this additional allotment authority 
were used, the ABI guidance would be followed. The directors have 
no present intention to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to 
employee share incentive schemes. These resolutions remain valid 
until the conclusion of this year’s AGM when resolutions will be 
proposed to renew these authorities. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM in 2012, shareholders approved a resolution for the 
Company to make purchases of its own shares to a maximum 
number of 236,933,259 ordinary shares, being approximately 
10% of the issued share capital. This resolution remains valid  
until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. As at 25 March 2013, the 
directors have not used this authority. In order to retain maximum 
flexibility, a resolution will be proposed at this year’s AGM to renew 
this authority. It is the Company’s current intention that shares 
acquired under this authority will be cancelled. 
Financial instruments 
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies 
are set out in note 24 to the financial statements on pages  
87 to 89. Note 24 also details the Group’s exposure to foreign 
exchange, interest, credit and liquidity risks. These notes are 
included by reference and form part of this report.

GOVERNANCE 
Directors’ statement of responsibility 
Going concern 
The directors confirm that, after reviewing expenditure 
commitments, expected cash flows and borrowing facilities,  
they have a reasonable expectation that Kingfisher plc (the 
‘Company’) and the Kingfisher Group of companies (the 
‘Group’) have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the next financial year and the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing these financial statements. Further details of the 
Group’s liquidity are detailed in the financial review on page 17. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that he  
or she ought to have taken as a director in order to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information. 
Responsibility for preparing financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.  
In preparing the parent Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 follow applicable UK Accounting Standards (except where 
any departures from this requirement are explained in the 
notes to the parent Company financial statements); and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements in accordance  
with IAS 1; ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the directors 
are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
 make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
 the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Company’s Corporate Governance 
report for the year ended 2 February 2013. The aim of this 
report is to provide a clear and meaningful explanation of the 
Company’s governance arrangements, which we consider to  
be essential for the long-term success of the Company, and the 
promotion of the highest standards of corporate governance.  
The Board remains committed to promoting the highest 
standards of corporate governance, understanding that an 
efficient, challenging and diverse Board is essential to enable 
the business to deliver its strategy and shareholders’ long-term 
interests, whilst generating stakeholder confidence that the 
business is conducting itself in a responsible manner.  As part 
of its overall governance arrangements, the Company’s Code  
of Conduct, which mandates minimum standards of behaviour 
for all employees and suppliers, was updated and relaunched 
across the Group during the year.   
As last year, this report reviews the operation of the Company  
by reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
and a statement of compliance with the Code is set out 
opposite. The Company is required to report its compliance 
against the revised 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code for  
its financial year commencing 3 February 2013, and we are 
confident that it will be able to report compliance with the 
revisions within our 2013/14 annual report. 
This report, together with the Directors’ Report on pages 31 to 
32, and the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 59, 
provides details of how the Company has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Code. A copy of the 
Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board constantly reviews its governance framework, 
adjusting where necessary the roles, structure and 
accountabilities of its mechanisms of governance. During the 
year, the governance structure below the Board and primary 
committee level was reviewed. As part of the review the terms  
of reference of the Group Executive Committee, the Kingfisher 
Capex Committee and the Financial Initiatives, Tax and Treasury 
Committee, were all reviewed and, where necessary, amended 
to reflect the operations of those committees and the powers 
delegated to them. As part of the review, the Group Executive 
Committee will focus on the development of the Group’s 
strategy, and its membership was expanded and enhanced.  
In addition, a new Group Operating Board was established, and 
this committee will focus on the delivery of the Group’s strategy.  
The revised Group governance structure, together with an overview 
of each of these Committees, is set out on pages 38 to 39.  
Maintaining and promoting the highest standards of corporate 
governance remains central to my role as Chairman, and I am 
pleased to endorse this Corporate Governance Report, which I 
believe demonstrates how, through its actions, the Board and its 
Committees fulfil their governance responsibilities and embed 
good governance practices on an on-going basis. 
Daniel Bernard 
Chairman 
25 March 2013 
Compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code 
The Board is required to report on the operations of the
Company by reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’), and has reviewed its operations and governance 
framework to ensure that they reflect the principles of the 
Code. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, the Board confirms that, throughout the year ended 
2 February 2013, and as at the date of this report, the 
Company has complied with the provisions set out in  
Section 1 of the Code, save for as set out below.  
Provision D.1.1 provides that grants under long-term incentive 
schemes should normally be phased rather than awarded in 
one large block. 
As reported in our 2011/12 annual report, the Company set 
stretching long-term targets for management as part of the 
Creating the Leader phase of Kingfisher’s strategy. The 
Remuneration Committee approved awards under the 
Performance Share Plan of up to 500% of base salary.  
The award was higher than the normal award of 200% but  
in making it, the Committee took into account the fact that  
no further awards would be made under the Plan until the 
financial year 2014/15, and felt that it created a better focus 
on a single performance period aligned to the next phase of 
the Group’s strategy, rather than the more commonly used 
overlapping performance periods. 
“ 
AN EFFICIENT, CHALLENGING AND DIVERSE  
BOARD IS ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE BUSINESS  
TO DELIVER ITS STRATEGY AND SHAREHOLDERS’  
LONG-TERM INTERESTS.

Leadership 
The role of the Board 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the management,

of controls, allowing risk to be assessed and managed within 
agreed parameters. The Board is collectively accountable to the 
Company’s shareholders for the proper conduct and success  
of the business. 
The Board’s powers are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, which are available to view on its website, and  
may be amended by a special resolution of its members.  
The Board may exercise all powers conferred on it by the 
Articles, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and  
other applicable legislation. 
The Board has established a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval, and has delegated other specific 
responsibilities to its princip committees: the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. These are clearly 
defined within the written terms of reference of the respective 
committees. Information on the responsibilities and work of 
each of the Board’s committees is set out on pages 40 to 44. 
During the year, as part of its annual review process, the matters 
reserved for the Board were reviewed, and, where necessary 
amended to reflect best practice. The schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board includes the consideration and  
approval of: 
 the Group’s overall strategy, medium-term plans and  
annual budgets; 
 financial statements and Group dividend policy including 
recommendation of the final dividend; 
 major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure;  
 major changes to the capital structure including tax and 
treasury management; 
 major changes to accounting policies or practices; 
 the Group’s corporate governance and compliance 
arrangements; 
 the system of internal control and risk management policy; 
and 
 review of management development strategy. 
Composition of the Board 
The Board is made up of a non-executive Chairman, four 
executive directors and six non-executive directors. The current 
balance of the Board’s skills, experience and knowledge, 
together with regular briefings by executives below Board level, 
ensures that views, perceptions and discussions are not 
dominated by any one specific view. The composition of the 
Board is continually reviewed to ensure it remains suitable for 
the needs of the business, and this continues to be the primary 
focus of the Nomination Committee. 
There is an established, formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the selection and appointment of new directors to 
the Board, and this is described in the Nomination Committee 
Report on page 43. During the year, Kevin O’Byrne stepped 
down as Group Finance Director to take up the role of CEO  
B&Q and Koçta s ¸ brands, and was replaced by Karen Witts,  
who joined the Board on 1 October 2012. Euan Sutherland  
and Philippe Tible were appointed to the Board as executive 
directors on 1 October 2012. Mr Sutherland subsequently 
stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2013 ahead of 
leaving the Group in March 2013. 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 June 2013, 
shareholders will be asked to appoint Karen Witts and Philippe 
Tible and, in accordance with Principle B.7.1 of the Code, re-
appoint their fellow directors. 
Role of the non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors provide a strong, independent and 
external insight to the Board and its Committees, and have  
a wealth of experience and business knowledge from  
other sectors and industries. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of each of the non-executive directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will also  
be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting. 
During the year, the Board considered the independence of 
each of the non-executive directors (other than the Chairman, 
who was deemed independent by the Board at the date of  
his appointment) against the criteria specified in the Code,  
and concluded that each remained fully independent of 
management and free from any relationship that could  
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  
Role of the Senior Independent Director 
Since his appointment in January 2012, Mark Seligman has 
acted as Senior Independent Director (‘SID’), supporting the 
Chairman, and is available for approach or representation from 
significant shareholders who feel they are unable to raise issues 
with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance 
Director. In accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(‘FRC’) guidelines, the role of the SID is formally set out in 
writing, and available on the Company’s website. During the 
year, there were no requests from shareholders or other  
Board directors for access to the SID. 
Roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive. As part of its  
annual review process, the Board reviewed the written roles 
of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive to ensure they  
remained compliant with, and took account of, best practice 
developments, and were in line with FRC guidance. The  
written roles are available to view on the Company’s website.  
The Chairman is responsible for the overall operation, 
leadership and governance of the Board, setting the tone and 
style of Board discussions, and creating the conditions for 
overall Board and individual director effectiveness. He is also 
responsible for ensuring that all members of the Board develop 
an understanding of the views of major shareholders, that there 
is an open dialogue with shareholders, and that the Chairmen of 
the Board’s princip committees are available to answer 
shareholder questions at the Annual General Meeting.

GOVERNANCE 
Corporate governance continued 
The Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire, is responsible for all 
executive management of the Group’s business, consistent with 
the strategy and commercial objectives agreed by the Board.  
He leads the Group Executive team in effecting decisions  
of the Board and its Committees, and is responsible for the 
maintenance and protection of the reputation of the Company 
and its subsidiaries. The Group Chief Executive is also 
responsible for promoting and conducting the affairs of the 
Group with the highest standards of integrity, probity and 
corporate governance. 
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and its 
committees and, with the consent of the Board, may delegate 
responsibility for the management of the committees to  
other suitably qualified staff. The Company Secretary is also 
responsible for ensuring that correct Board procedures are 
followed, and advises the Board on corporate governance 
matters. All directors have access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary, and their appointment and removal 
is one of the matters reserved to the Board. The Board also  
has access to the Group General Counsel for legal and 
compliance advice. 
Diversity on the Board 
In September 2011, the Board announced its approach to 
diversity. The statement, which is available on the Company’s 
website, confirmed that the Board is committed to ensuring 
directors of the Company possess, and demonstrate a broad 
balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
diversity, including gender diversity. During the year, the 
Nomination Committee considered the diversity of candidates 
short-listed for the role of Group Finance Director before 
appointing Karen Witts on 1 October 2012. The Board  
believes that balanced and diverse Boards are effective, and  
is committed to maximising the benefits of a diverse workforce 
to deliver real sustainable benefits for the Group and  
its shareholders.  
The charts below demonstrate the gender split at Board level, 
One Team Leadership Group level, and for the workforce  
as a whole. 
 
Effectiveness 
Board meetings 
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout  
the year and holds unscheduled supplementary meetings as 
and when necessary. These meetings are structured to allow 
open discussion. At each meeting the Board receives certain 
regular reports which include an update from the Group Chief 
Executive, current trading/finance (including liquidity) reports 
from the Group Finance Director, capital expenditure approvals 
and reports from the Company Secretary (including governance, 
legal, insurance and risk, and corporate responsibility updates) 
and people-related updates from the Group Human  
Resources Director. 
All directors participate in discussing strategy, trading and 
financial performance, and risk management of the Group. 
Comprehensive briefing papers are circulated to all directors 
approximately one week before each meeting in digital format. 
Should a director be unable to attend a particular meeting, they 
are provided with all relevant briefing papers and are given the 
opportunity to discuss any issues with the Chairman or the Group 
Chief Executive and, where possible, participate by telephone for 
critical discussions and approvals on specific matters. 
The Board generally meets at the Group’s head office in London 
and holds at least one meeting each year overseas. During the 
year under review, the Board held a meeting in Paris, and 
reviewed the Brico Dépôt and Castorama brands in France, 
Poland, Russia and Spain. In addition to its normal meetings,  
at least once per year, the Board holds a meeting off site, which 
focuses on presentations from the UK executive team and 
includes visits to UK stores. During the year, the Board held  
two such meetings and visited the Group’s regional Distribution 
Centre and a B&Q store in Swindon. It is the Board’s intention  
to conduct at least one meeting each year outside the UK in a 
country in which the Group operates. 
At the request of any non-executive director, the Chairman will 
arrange meetings consisting of just the non-executive directors. 
During the year, the Chairman and non-executive directors met 
without the executive directors, and there were no matters of 
concern raised at this meeting.

The Chairman maintains regular contact with the Senior 
Independent Director and met with each of the non-executive 
directors individually as part of the Board evaluation discussions. 
Activities during the year 
During the year, in addition to its regular business, the Board: 
 oversaw the development and articulation of the Group’s Net 
Positive strategy;  
 approved the process for the review of the Company’s defined 
benefit pension scheme, and approved the curtailment of that 
scheme to new members and an enhancement of the 
defined contribution scheme; 
 reviewed the Group’s risk profile and defined the process by 
which the risk appetite of the Board would be established; 
 considered and approved the commencement of the 
examinership process for its business in Ireland; 
 reviewed the Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies and 
procedures to ensure continued compliance with the UK 
Bribery Act; and  
 received regular strategic presentations from management 
and held “deep dive” discussions with management of the 
Group’s Operating Companies, information technology and 
Group sourcing management.  
Board evaluation 
The Board conducts a review of its performance each year. 
During the year under review, the Board evaluated its 
effectiveness using an externally facilitated questionnaire and  
a series of one-to-one interviews between each director and the 
Chairman. The questionnaire was developed by reference to  
the topics discussed and recommendations made during the 
previous evaluation, and drafted following discussions between 
the Chairman, the Company Secretary and the external facilitator, 
Lintstock. Responses to the questionnaire were collated and the 
output was used by the Chairman in his individual meetings 
with directors as part of the evaluation process. 
The areas considered during the evaluation were: 
 Board composition; 
 Board expertise; 
 
 strategic oversight; 
 risk management and internal control; and 
 succession planning and human resource management. 
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board at its 
meeting in January 2013. No significant issues were highlighted 
and the review clearly indicated that the Board continued to 
work efficiently and effectively, and that the contribution and 
commitment of each director, and their interaction with each 
other, was good, and that the non-executive directors offered 
robust challenge where appropriate. As a result of the 
evaluation, the Board agreed to undertake the following  
activities during the 2013/14 financial year: 
 review the forward business agenda to ensure that there is 
sufficient time to focus on common key Group programmes 
and initiatives; 
 maintain oversight of the Group’s performance relative to its 
competitors and customer trends; and  
 increase its exposure to the Group’s senior management 
below the Board.  
As part of the evaluation process, the Group Chief Executive 
carried out a performance review of the executive directors.  
In addition, the non-executive directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, conducted the performance review  
of the Chairman in respect of the financial year. 
The Board has confirmed that the contribution of each of the 
directors continues to be effective and that shareholders should 
be supportive of their appointment or re-appointment to the 
Board. Biographical details of each director are set out on  
pages 28 to 29. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead, and the Chairman will use 
the output of the most recent Board evaluation in his individual 
meetings with directors during the year. 
In accordance with Provision B.6.2 of the Code, which requires 
Boards to undertake an externally facilitated evaluation at least 
every three years, the Board intends to appoint a suitable 
independent facilitator during the year to conduct the 2013/14 
performance evaluation, and will report on the findings of that 
evaluation within the 2013/14 annual report.

GOVERNANCE 
Corporate governance continued 
 
Induction, information and professional development 
All new directors appointed to the Board receive an induction 
pack as part of their comprehensive induction programme 
tailored to their experience, background and particular areas  
of focus. The induction programme is designed to develop 
directors’ knowledge and understanding of the Group’s 
operations and culture.  
The induction programme includes:  
 individual one-to-one meetings with the Chairman, the Group 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and other directors; 
 site visits to the Group’s stores and those of its competitors; 
 meetings with management of the Group’s Operating 
Companies and other senior management; and 
 if required, external training courses at the Group’s expense. 
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman considers and 
addresses the development needs of the Board as a whole, if 
any, and ensures that each director updates their individual 
skills, knowledge and expertise. 
Following the appointment of three new executive directors  
during the year, the Company Secretary arranged for the Group’s 
corporate lawyers to provide a training session on their duties and 
responsibilities as directors of a UK listed company. Amongst other 
topics, the training covered Listing Rules compliance and the 
control and release of inside information, and provided case 
studies and practical situations for the directors to consider.  
Subsequent training in specific aspects of the Group’s 
businesses is provided to directors, when requested, or regularly 
as part of site visits. Directors are briefed on issues at Board and 
Committee meetings and have full and timely access to relevant 
information ahead of each meeting. 
The Board also receives reports on circumstances where issues 
and concerns have been raised by the Company’s institutional 
shareholders. This process allows directors to develop 
necessary understanding of the views of these shareholders  
and also enables the Board to judge whether investors have a 
sufficient understanding of the Group’s objectives. 
In addition to planned development and briefings, directors are 
expected to take responsibility for identifying their own individual 
needs and to take necessary steps to ensure that they are 
adequately informed about the Group and their responsibilities 
as a director. The Board is confident that all its members have 
the requisite knowledge, ability and experience to perform the 
functions required of a director of a listed company. There  
is also an agreed procedure whereby directors may take 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense in  
the furtherance of their duties. 
Conflicts of interest 
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to 
avoid a situation where he or she may have a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts with the interests of the Company. The 
Company has robust procedures in place to identify, authorise 
and manage such conflicts of interest, and these procedures 
have operated effectively during the year.  
A register of directors’ situational and transactional conflicts is 
maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on a regular basis. The Board confirmed during the year 
that there were no situations of which they were aware which 
would, or potentially could, give rise to conflicts with the 
interests of the Company, other than those that might arise from 
directors’ other appointments, which are set out in the directors’ 
biographies on pages 28 to 29. 
Committees 
The Board has delegated authority to its princip committees  
to carry out certain tasks as defined in each committee’s 
respective terms of reference. The written terms of reference  
in respect of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are available on the Company’s website. The  
Board is satisfied that the terms of reference for each of these 
committees satisfy the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The terms of reference of the princip 
committees are reviewed on an on-going basis. 
The minutes of committee meetings are made available to all 
directors on a timely basis. In addition, at each Board meeting, 
the chairmen of each of the principal committees provide the 
Board with a brief synopsis of the work carried out by the 
committee, if any, between Board meetings.  
In addition to the princip committees, the Board is supported 
by the work of the Group Executive Committee and its 
subcommittees. Together these committees form a fundamental 
element of the Company’s corporate governance framework, 
although they are not formally appointed committees of the 
Board. The Group’s governance structure is set out below. A 
brief explanation of the work of the Group Executive Committee 
and the other management committees is set out below:

a year under the chairmanship of the Group Chief Executive.  
The members’ details are set out on page 30.  
The Committee’s primary focus is the strategic direction of the 
Group. In addition, the Committee monitors top talent within the

of the work of the Group Executive Committee in March 2013, 
and is responsible for the day-to-day management of the 
Group’s businesses. In addition, the Group Operating Board 
reviews the overall financial performance of the Group against 
its strategic plans and budget. The Group Operating Board will 
also review people-related activities as part of its structured 
agenda, and will conduct deep-dive reviews of key areas 
affecting the business. The Group Operating Board, which 
meets monthly, comprises all the members of the Group 
Executive Committee, the CEOs of B&Q UK & Ireland, 
Castorama France and Brico Dépôt brands, the Group  
Human Resources Director, and the Finance Director  
of the Brico Dépôt and Castorama brands.  
Kingfisher Capex Committee 
The Capex Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
approving all capital expenditure projects relating to property 
and non-property proposals in excess of an agreed threshold, 
which is reviewed periodically. The decisions of the Committee 
are reported to the Board following each meeting, and the 
Committee will make recommendations to the Board regarding 
all projects exceeding its agreed approval threshold. The 
Committee comprises the Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Group Property Director, CEO, Group 
Productivity and Development, the Group General Counsel,  
and the Head of Property Finance. 
Financial Initiatives, Tax and Treasury Committee 
The primary purpose of the Committee is to monitor compliance 
of policies and control issues relating to Group Finance, and to 
review key proposals from Group Finance, Treasury, Tax and 
Secretariat functions, and where appropriate recommend 
certain initiatives for approval to the Board. The Committee 
comprises the Group Finance Director, Group Finance and 
Planning Director, Group Treasurer, Group Tax Director, Head 
of Group Pensions, Head of Corporate Development, Group 
General Counsel, Company Secretary and Group Audit and  
Risk Director.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 
2012/13. The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from 
amongst its non-executive directors, and its princip duties are 
to provide effective oversight and governance of the internal 
control and risk management processes of the Company, to 
review the financial statements and related accounting policies, 
review the effectiveness of the internal and external audit 
functions and provide updates and recommendations to  
the Board. 
During the year, the Committee continued the analysis of  
the Company’s risks and associated mitigating controls and 
focused on compliance, financial governance and internal audit 
functions. It maintained its good working relationship with the 
Group Audit and Risk Management Director, the Group Finance 
and Planning Director, the Company Secretary and Group’s 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP. The Committee maintained, 
reviewed and where necessary amended its standing agenda, 
which is linked to the Group’s financial calendars. 
In order to improve the understanding of their operations, 
during the year the Committee received in-depth presentations 
from management of the Group’s Operating Companies in  
the UK, France, Spain, Russia and Turkey, including the 
key strategic risks impacting each business. The Committee 
considered and reviewed the Group’s adequate procedures  
in relation to bribery and corruption, the provision of a 
whistleblowing service and approved accounting judgements  
in relation to the curtailment of the Kingfisher final salary 
pension scheme.  
A fuller description of the operations of the Committee is set  
out below. I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to 
answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

also obtain access to the Group’s operations and staff,  
and all members of the Committee undertake on-going  
training as required. 
The Committee is required, under its terms of reference, to 
meet at least three times a year. During the year, the Committee 
met four times. The Committee has a standing agenda linked to 
events in the Group’s financial calendar for consideration at 
each meeting, and within the annual audit cycle, to ensure that 
its work is in line with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. At the invitation of the Committee, the 
Chairman of the Board and the Group Chief Executive attended 
all meetings, as did the Group Finance Director, Group Audit 
and Risk Management Director, Group Finance and Planning

Audit Committee Report 41
Business review Governance Accounts

Detailed below is the key work undertaken by the Committee 
during the year under review and up to the date of this  
Annual Report.  
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year 
Governance processes 
The Committee conducted an externally facilitated questionnaire 
based review of its effectiveness during the year. The Committee 
considered the results of the review at its meeting in January 
2013, and concluded that it continued to operate effectively  
and provide robust challenge and support to the Board. It was 
agreed by the Committee that no specific actions were required. 
Internal controls and risk 
The Committee received and considered reports during the  
year from the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, and the 
Group’s internal audit function on the work they had undertaken 
in reviewing and auditing the Group, in order to assess the 
quality and effectiveness of the internal control system. 
The Committee considered reports on the output from the 
Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate  
risks and reviewed the annual report on the Group’s systems of 
internal control and their effectiveness, and reported the results 
of the review to the Board. Further information on the Group’s 
risk management and internal control procedures can be found 
on page 42. 
As part of the Committee’s continuing programme to increase  
its awareness of the Group’s operations and to understand the 
implementation of Operating Company control processes, the 
Committee met with and received presentations from the senior 
management of the operating companies in the UK, France, 
Spain, Russia and Turkey. In addition, the Committee continued 
to monitor the progress on the standardisation and improvement 
of the Group’s internal control processes, in a number of  
key areas. 
The Group operates a whistleblowing helpline which allows 
employees within the Group to make disclosures about 
suspected financial and operational improprieties. The 
“SpeakUp” service was relaunched in 2012 and expanded 
during the year to be available to the Group’s suppliers. The 
Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s overall whistleblowing 
arrangements to ensure they remained effective, at its meeting 
in January 2013. The Committee reviewed the output from the 
service and considered the number and type of incidents 
reported, and was satisfied that the Group continued to 
maintain adequate mechanisms for recording disclosures.  
Financial reporting 
The Committee reviewed the annual and interim financial 
statements during the year. As part of this review, the 
Committee considered significant accounting policies, financial 
reporting issues and judgements (including those disclosed in 
note 3 to the financial statements), together with the reports 
received from the external auditor on their findings, including 
any control observations relevant to their audit work. The impact 
on the Group’s financial statements of significant corporate 
governance and accounting standards applicable during the 
year, were considered and reviewed by the Committee. 
Group Internal Audit 
The Committee considered and reviewed updates from the 
internal audit programme at each of its meetings during the 
year. Reports from the internal audit function to the Committee 
included updates on the Group’s risk management systems, 
findings from reviews, and reviews of the remit, organisation, 
annual plan and resources of the internal audit function. During 
the year, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function. The review was conducted using an 
internal questionnaire with input from the function’s key 
stakeholders within the Group, in addition to the Committee.  
No significant issues were highlighted by the review. 
External Audit 
Deloitte LLP were appointed as the external auditor to the  
Group in 2009 following a formal tender process.  
During the year, the Committee agreed the approach and scope 
of the audit work to be undertaken by the external auditor and 
undertook an assessment of their qualification, expertise and 
resources, independence and the effectiveness of the external 
audit process. The Committee also reviewed and agreed the 
terms of engagement, the fees, and areas of responsibility and 
the work to be undertaken by the external auditor, and agreed 
the fees payable in respect of the 2012/13 audit work. Details  
of the amounts paid to the external auditor for their audit 
services are given in note 7 to the accounts on page 75. 
Each of the Group’s businesses is consulted on the 
effectiveness and independence of the external auditor 
annually. In addition, the external auditor provides the Committee 
with a schedule of each matter on which there was an initial 
difference between them and management in relation to the 
accounting treatment, and with the final decisions on these 
issues. The Committee has reviewed and is satisfied with the 
effectiveness and independence of the external auditor. 
In addition to their statutory duties, the services of Deloitte LLP 
are also engaged where, as a result of their position as external 
auditor, they either must, or are best placed to, perform  
the work in question. This is primarily work in relation to  
matters such as shareholder circulars, Group borrowings,  
tax advice, regulatory filings and certain business acquisitions 
and disposals. Other work is awarded on the basis of 
competitive tendering. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the scope of non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor to ensure that there 
was no impairment of independence and objectivity, and 
subsequently monitored the non-audit work performed to 
ensure it was within policy guidelines.  
The Group has a policy on the use of its external auditor for  
non-audit work and this is regularly reviewed. The external 
auditor is precluded from engaging in non-audit services that 
would compromise their independence or violate any laws or 
regulations affecting their appointment as external auditor.  
The approval of the Chairman of the Committee is required  
prior to awarding contracts for non-audit services to the  
external auditor, where in excess of specified amounts.  
The external auditor reports to the Committee annually on  
their independence from the Company. Periodic rotation  
of key audit partners is also required.

GOVERNANCE 
Corporate governance continued 
The Group’s policy on the use of the external auditor for  
non-audit work can be found on the Company’s website. 
The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
LLP be proposed for re-appointment by shareholders as the 
Company’s external auditor at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. As a result of its work during the year, the Committee 
has concluded that it acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity  
of the external auditor. 
During the year, Deloitte LLP charged the Group £1.6m 
(2011/12: £1.4m) for audit and audit-related services and a 
further £0.4m (2011/12: £0.5m) for non-audit services during 
the year.  
Accountability, Risk Management and Internal Control 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and ensure the reliability of the financial information for 
both internal use and external publication, and to comply with 
the Turnbull guidance and the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of  
the internal control system, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management in accordance  
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, for the period from 
29 January 2012 to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
If significant losses were to be incurred during the year as a 
result of a failure of controls, a detailed report would be provided 
to the Audit Committee and the Board. The Board confirms that 
no significant weaknesses were identified in relation to the 
review carried out during the year and therefore no remedial 
action was required. 
The Board has approved a set of policies, procedures and 
frameworks for effective internal control. The Group has 
procedures for the delegation of authorities for significant 
matters to ensure approval is sought at the appropriate level. 
These procedures are subject to regular review and provide an 
on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring the 
system and the maintenance of effective control is delegated  
to the management of each Operating Company. The Group’s 
enterprise-wide risk management and reporting process helps 
Group management to identify, assess, prioritise and mitigate 
risk. Management at each Operating Company has 
responsibility for the identification and evaluation of the 
significant risks applicable to their business and any mitigating 
actions to be taken. The Group Executive Committee reviews, 
identifies and evaluates the risks that are significant at a Group 
level, as well as the mitigating actions against those risks. These 
are then considered by the Board. The types of risks identified 
included both strategic and material operational risks and are 
detailed on pages 25 to 27 of the report. 
Management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the 
risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives, in determining 
the risks that are considered acceptable to bear, in assessing 
the likelihood of those risks materialising, in identifying the 
Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and impact on the 
business of risks that do materialise, and in ensuring the  
costs of operating particular controls are proportionate to  
the benefit provided. 
Monitoring 
There are clear processes for controlling and monitoring the 
system of internal control and reporting any significant control 
failings or weaknesses together with details of corrective action. 
These include: 
 an annual planning process and regular financial reporting, 
comparing results with plan and the previous year on a 
monthly and cumulative basis; 
 written reports from the Group Chief Executive and  
Group Finance Director submitted at each Board meeting; 
 Operating Company management report formally to the Audit 
Committee on a regular basis on the control environment in 
their business and actions taken to maintain or improve the 
environment as appropriate; and 
 reports and presentations to the Board on certain areas  
of specialist risk. These include treasury, insurance, tax  
and pensions. 
A formal quarterly certification is provided by the CEO and 
finance director of each Operating Company stating that 
appropriate internal controls were in operation and confirming 
compliance with Group policies and procedures. Any 
weaknesses are highlighted and the results are reviewed by 
Operating Company management, the Group Audit and Risk 
Management Director, the Group Finance and Planning 
Director, the Audit Committee and the Board. The internal  
audit function monitors and selectively checks the results of  
this exercise, ensuring that representations made are consistent 
with the results of its work during the year. 
The internal audit function follows a planned programme of 
reviews that are aligned to the Group’s risks. The function: 
 works with the Operating Companies to develop, improve and 
embed risk management tools and processes into their 
business operations; 
 reports directly to the Audit Committee and has the authority 
to review any relevant part of the Group; 
 oversees the operation of the individual operating businesses’ 
audit committees; and 
 provides the Audit Committee and the Board with objective 
assurance on the control environment across the Group.  
Risk appetite 
During the year, the Board also considered the nature and level 
of risk that it was prepared to accept in order to deliver business 
strategies, and has reviewed and approved the Group’s internal 
statement of risk appetite. This describes both the current  
and desired levels of acceptable risk, supported by high level 
qualitative risk statements, ensuring that risks are proactively 
managed to the level desired by the Board.

Directors did not attend meetings where their reappointment was considered. 
Duties 
The primary purpose of the Nomination Committee is to lead, on 
behalf of the Board, the process for Board appointments and to 
make recommendations for maintaining an appropriate balance 
of diversity and skills on the Board. In accordance with its terms 
of reference, the Nomination Committee is required to: 
 review the structure, size and composition of the Board  
and make recommendations to the Board, as appropriate; 
 identify the balance of skills, knowledge, diversity and 
experience on the Board and nominate candidates to fill 
Board vacancies; 
 review the time commitment required from the  
non-executive directors; 
 consider succession planning, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the  
future skills and expertise needed on the Board; and 
 review the leadership needs of the organisation, both 
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the organisation to compete effectively  
in the marketplace. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed  
regularly, approved by the Board, and are available on  
the Company’s website. 
Activities during the year 
During the year, the Committee conducted a rigorous search 
and selection process, carried out with the assistance of an 
independent executive search company, Blackwood, to identify 
suitable candidates for the role of Group Finance Director. 
Candidates with a background in retail or fast moving consumer 
goods were considered preferable, and the Nomination 
Committee considered a shortlist of internal and external 
candidates before proposing the appointment of Karen Witts  
as Group Finance Director. In making its appointment 
recommendations to the Board, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed the overall balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity on the Board against current and future 
requirements of the Company. Having satisfied itself that both 
Euan Sutherland and Philippe Tible possessed the necessary 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience to support the 
relevant roles and responsibilities of a director of a UK listed 
company, the Committee recommended and supported their 
appointment to the Kingfisher plc Board as executive directors.  
At its meeting in June 2012, the Committee considered the 
reappointment of Daniel Bernard for a further three-year period 
following the expiry of his second three-year term as a director. 
The Committee agreed that he continued to provide strong and 
effective leadership to the Board and recommended he be 
reappointed for a further three-year term. 
The reappointment of Andrew Bonfield, Anders Dahlvig and 
Janis Kong, following the expiry of their three-year terms of 
appointment as directors, was also considered by the 
Committee at its meeting in November 2012. The Committee 
concluded that all directors continued to provide the necessary 
balance of skills and experience to the Board including 
considerable financial and retail experience, and in-depth 
knowledge of the workings of the Group. The Committee 
therefore recommended to the Board that each be reappointed 
as a director of the Company for an additional three-year term.  
The Committee received and reviewed a talent and HR  
update from the Group HR Director, which outlined succession 
planning and talent pipeline considerations in support of  
the Group’s Creating the Leader strategy. 
Following the changes to the composition of the Board  
during the year, the Committee firmly believes that the current 
composition represents a strong, well balanced and diverse 
Board. The Board membership is made up of specialists in 
retail, technology, finance and human resources, and possesses 
considerable knowledge, experience and skills to meet the 
current and future requirements of the Group. The Chairman 
will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any 
questions about the work of the Committee.

Relationship with shareholders 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company is committed to communicating its strategy  
and activities clearly to its shareholders and, to that end, 
maintains an active dialogue with investors through a planned 
programme of investor relations activities. The investor relations 
programme includes: 
 formal presentations of full-year and interim results; 
 conference calls to discuss quarterly trading statements; 
 regular meetings between institutional investors and senior 
management to ensure that the investor community receives 
a balanced and complete view of the Group’s performance 
and the issues faced by the Group; 
 hosting investors’ and analysts’ sessions at which  
senior management from relevant Operating Companies  
deliver presentations which provide an overview of their  
individual businesses; 
 responding to enquiries from shareholders through the 
Company’s investor relations team; 
 regular meetings with institutional investors and analysts  
by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director  
to discuss business performance; and 
 a section dedicated to shareholders on the Company’s website.  
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the 
chairmen of the Board’s Committees are available to meet  
major investors on request. The Senior Independent Director 
has a specific responsibility to be available to shareholders  
who have concerns, and for whom contact with the Chairman, 
Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director has  
either failed to resolve their concerns, or for whom such  
contact is inappropriate. 
As part of his formal induction as Senior Independent Director, 
Mark Seligman met a number of the Group’s significant 
shareholders to obtain a better understanding of their views. 
Annual General Meeting 
The principal means of communication with private investors is 
by electronic communications and through the Annual General 
Meeting, which is attended by all the Company’s directors,  
and allows all shareholders present the opportunity to question 
the Chairman and the directors, as well as the chairmen of  
the Board’s Committees. After the Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders have the opportunity to meet informally  
with directors.  
A summary business presentation is given at the Annual 
General Meeting before the Chairman deals with the formal 
business of the meeting. At the Annual General Meeting in  
June 2013, the Chairman will use his discretion to call for  
a poll on all resolutions. The results of the poll in relation to  
all resolutions will be disclosed to those in attendance at the 
meeting, published on the Company’s website and announced 
to the London Stock Exchange shortly after the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dear Shareholder 
This is my first full year as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, and I am very pleased to present the Company’s 
2012/13 Directors’ Remuneration Report on behalf of the Board. 
Better Homes, Better Lives 
Kingfisher’s purpose is to make it easier for customers to  
have better, more sustainable homes. Our short hand for this is 
“Better Homes, Better Lives”. Success in achieving this means 
delivering value to our shareholders, behaving responsibly in the 
communities in which the Group operates, making sustainable 
choices, and creating fulfilling and secure roles for our 
employees. The Remuneration Committee is committed to 
structuring remuneration for executives that supports and  
drives this purpose. 
Ensuring value is a theme which is central to the working of the 
Remuneration Committee, and although this report focuses on 
the executive directors, we also look more broadly to ensure 
alignment and fairness between contribution and reward. This 
means that, by improving the business, all can benefit. This is 
also true for employees and, at Kingfisher, performance-linked 
incentives and share-based plans are cascaded throughout the 
organisation from the leadership team to store-based employees.  
During 2012/13 our reported results were affected by adverse 
currency movements, the particularly poor summer weather in 
Northern Europe, which dampened customer demand during our 
peak season, and the economic uncertainty our customers are 
facing across Europe. It was therefore no surprise that 2012 was 
difficult for retailers in general. As a consequence, annual bonus 
payments made to the executive directors for the year will be 
between 58% and 80% of salary and in the region of 29% and 
40% of the maximum opportunity. Performance in the last four 
years has been extremely strong and reward reflects this. The 
Sharesave awards, which vested in 2012/13, are a good example 
of this with over 2,000 employees benefiting from a total 
estimated gain of around £34 million, giving an average profit per 
person of around £1,600. The three-year performance period of 
awards granted in 2010 under the Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’) ended on 5 May 2013. In respect of the awards granted  
to executive directors, vesting levels were between 50% and 
100% and were linked to performance over the past three years.  
The Committee set stretching long-term targets for awards 
granted under the Performance Share Plan (the ‘PSP’) in 2011  
as part of the Creating the Leader phase of Kingfisher’s strategy. 
This one-off award has created a strong focus on a single 
performance period, which aligns to the next phase of the Group’s 
strategy. Further details about how this strategy is being reflected 
in our remuneration structure are provided later in this report.  
2013 Remuneration review 
During the year under review, there have been no major  
changes to the Group’s remuneration policy. In order to ensure a 
continued strong alignment between executive directors’ and 
shareholders’ interests, the Committee will conduct a full review of 
the Company’s executive remuneration arrangements during 
2013. The key focus of this review will be to determine what form 
of long-term incentive arrangements should replace the current 
Performance Share Plan when the next awards are due to be 
made in 2014. The Committee will ensure that it has due regard 
to developments in market and best practice, and to appropriately 
link such awards to the Group’s strategic objectives. It is also 
committed to consulting with its major shareholders and key 
representative bodies as part of this process. No significant 
changes to remuneration policy are planned for 2013/14. 
Remuneration reporting 
During the year under review, the Department for Business, 
Innovation & Skills (‘BIS’) has continued to develop its proposals 
to improve the transparency of remuneration reporting, and to 
give shareholders greater influence over future remuneration 
policy. The Company believes that linking pay to Group 
performance, and dialogue with shareholders are fundamental 
to the remit of the Remuneration Committee. Whilst the  
final regulations on remuneration reporting have yet to be 
determined, we believe that the Company already addresses 
many of the proposals, and where new disclosure would be 
required, have decided to incorporate many of these within  
this year’s report ahead of the requirement to do so.  
I will be available at the AGM in June to answer any questions 
about the work of the Committee.  
At our 2012 AGM, 98% of shareholders voted in favour of our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, and I very much hope you will 
support the 2012/13 Directors’ Remuneration Report at our 
forthcoming meeting.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT LINKING PAY TO GROUP

GOVERNANCE 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 
 
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), and has been 
prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (the ‘Regulations’) issued under the Companies Act  
2006 (the ‘Act’), and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles relating to directors’ remuneration set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, and complied with the Financial 
Services Authority Listing Rules. Although not yet mandatory, 
the report also seeks to adopt the key aspects of the reporting 
obligations proposed by BIS, whilst recognising that the final 
requirements may not be exactly as we have assumed based on 
the latest information available to us. Included in this year’s 
report are, based on our understanding of the likely final 
position, a single figure table detailing the total remuneration  
for the executive directors and a scenario chart detailing future 
potential remuneration of executive directors at below threshold, 
target, and maximum levels of performance. We have also 
provided a version of the remuneration policy table as 
prescribed by BIS. The Remuneration Report for 2013/14  
will be fully compliant with the final BIS regulations, which will 
likely require the report to be split into separate policy and 
implementation reports. 
The Remuneration Committee 
Role and responsibilities 
The Committee’s primary purpose is to make recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s framework or broad policy  
for executive remuneration and its costs. The Board has 
delegated responsibility to the Committee for determining the 
remuneration, benefits and contractual arrangements of the 
Chairman, executive directors, certain senior executives, and 
the Company Secretary, and for overseeing the Group’s share-
based incentive schemes and bonus schemes. The 
remuneration of non-executive directors is determined  
by the Chairman and executive members of the Board. 
The Committee recommends and monitors the structure and 
levels of remuneration of senior managers throughout the 
Group. It also ensures that contractual terms on termination, 
and any payments made are fair to the individual and the 
Group, ensuring that failure is not rewarded, and that the 
departing manager’s duty to mitigate is fully recognised. 
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability 
and transparency, and to ensuring remuneration arrangements 
demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance. 
Remuneration is structured to promote sustainable growth and 
to avoid excessive and inappropriate risks. Operating under 
delegated authority from, and reporting to the Board, its 
activities are governed by terms of reference which can be 
found on the Company’s website. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they 
remain fit for purpose, and continue to be in line with market 
best practice. 
Membership 
The Committee comprised the following independent non-
executive directors during the financial year to 2 February 2013.

Meetings 
The Committee is required by its terms of reference to meet at 
least twice a year, and maintains a rolling standing schedule of 
agenda items for the year. An overview of key standing agenda 
items for the Committee’s annual meetings is set out below. 
During the year, the Committee met four times. Committee 
meetings were attended by the Group Chief Executive, who 
provided advice that materially assisted the Committee. In 
addition, the Group Human Resources Director and the Head  
of Group Reward attended Committee meetings, and provided 
material assistance and advice on remuneration policy. The 
Group Finance Director attended by invitation on matters 
relating to performance measures. The Company Secretary 
acted as Secretary to the Committee. No member of the 
Committee had a personal financial interest (other than as a 
shareholder), conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships, 
or day-to-day involvement in running the business, and no 
person took part in any discussion about his or her own 
remuneration. Details of individual attendance at Committee 
meetings are provided within the Corporate Governance  
Report on page 44. 
Following a robust evaluation of the Committee during the  
year, it was agreed that the Committee continued to operate 
effectively. Full details of the evaluation process are set out 
within the Corporate Governance Report on page 37.

Activities 
During 2012/13 the Committee:  
 agreed the performance targets for the annual bonus in the 
financial year and monitored progress against those targets; 
 agreed the operation of the long-term incentive plans and 
policy for executive share scheme awards to new recruits, 
and promotions, including the level of individual awards, 
performance conditions, and measurement and validation  
of the out-turn of prior year awards; 
 agreed the award of annual incentives based on the prior 
year’s performance; 
 recommended the 2011/12 Directors’ Remuneration  
Report for endorsement by the Board and subsequent

 approved the Directors’ Shareholding Policy; 
 agreed amendment to the pension policy for employees

 approved amendments to the rules of the Store Management

Objectives for 2013:  
In addition to its annual agenda for 2013, the Committee has 
scheduled an additional meeting to: 
 review the executive remuneration arrangements; and 
 to consider and agree a new long-term incentive plan for  
the Company. 
Advisors 
The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external 
independent remuneration consultants, and is solely 
responsible for their appointment, retention and termination.  
In February 2013, following a robust tender process, the 
Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its 
principal advisor. During the financial year to 2 February  
2013, the following external advisors provided services to the 
Committee. Unless otherwise stated, the advisors have no other 
connection with the Group, and the Committee firmly believes 
that the advice received was, and continues to be, objective  
and independent: 
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (‘FIT’) 
FIT provided advice on the ongoing operation of employee and 
executive share plans, and executive remuneration generally. 
FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the 
professional body for executive remuneration consultants) and 
adheres to its Code of Conduct. FIT provided no other services 
to the Group during the year.  
 
Allen & Overy LLP (‘A&O’) 
A&O provided legal advice to the Committee on service  
and employment contracts, and for other employment and 
remuneration issues. A&O also provides advice to the Group  
on other legal matters.  
Towers Watson 
Towers Watson provided benchmarking on the market 
competitiveness for executives in the UK and overseas. Towers 
Watson also provided advice to the Group on pensions and 
related matters.  
Remuneration Policy 
The Group’s remuneration strategy is to attract, retain and 
motivate executives of the highest quality, incentivising them to 
deliver exceptional performance aligned with the interests of 
shareholders, and to deliver the Group’s business plan. The 
remuneration strategy continues to ensure that a significant 
element of executives’ remuneration remains ‘at risk’.  
The key principles of the Group’s remuneration policy are to: 
 provide executives with a remuneration package that 
recognises the experience of the individual concerned and 
the role fulfilled; 
 ensure performance-related remuneration constitutes  
a substantial proportion of the remuneration package; 
 encourage a high-performance culture by offering  
substantial reward only for exceptional performance; 
 ensure executive directors’ interests are aligned with 
shareholders’ by delivering rewards in shares with  
compulsory deferral and share ownership guidelines;  
 be competitive in the market in which the Group competes; 
 be fair and transparent; and  
 ensure remuneration arrangements apply consistently 
throughout the Group. 
The Committee intends to continue this policy and is  
satisfied that there is an appropriate balance between the  
fixed and variable elements of remuneration, as described 
within this report.

Remuneration Policy Table 
Remuneration for executive directors for the financial year commencing 3 February 2013 consists of the following elements: 
Element and Purpose Policy and Opportunity Operation and Performance Metrics 
1 Base salary 
This is the core element of pay 
that reflects the individual’s 
role, experience and 
contribution to the Group. 
Salaries are reviewed in January each year and are 
benchmarked against a range of suitable comparator 
groups, which currently include both the FTSE100 as a 
whole and FTSE100 retailers as a relevant sub-set. The 
Committee is also informed of pay levels in other large 
European retailers. 
The Committee does not apply a strict mathematical 
approach to the data, which it considers to be only one 
relevant input. Instead, the Committee has regard to its 
overall assessment of what appropriate levels of salary  
are, having regard to market and economic conditions, 
affordability, the level of increases awarded to employees 
generally and the individual’s contribution. 
Base salaries are paid monthly in cash. 
The base salaries of executive directors effective 
from 31 January 2013 are as follows:  
Ian Cheshire – £832,320 
Kevin O’Byrne – £627,000 
Philippe Tible – £486,840 
Karen Witts – £484,500 
2 Pension and benefits 
To provide competitive 
retirement benefits. 
To aid retention and  
remain competitive within  
the marketplace.  
Executive directors’ pension provision is by way of 
contributions to defined contribution arrangements 
equivalent to 30% of base salary for the Group CEO  
and 20% for all other UK-based executive directors. 
Prior to 1 July 2012, the Group CEO also participated in a 
Defined Benefit (‘DB’) arrangement up to the scheme 
earning cap of £136,200. The Defined Contribution  
(‘DC’) arrangement then applied to the excess of his 
salary. Following the closure of the DB scheme to future 
accrual the pension arrangement moved solely to the  
DC arrangement of 30% of the total salary. 
Philippe Tible participates in a DB arrangement. 
Entitlement to a pension is conditional on him remaining 
with the Company until retirement (minimum age of 62). 
The Company provides the following benefits: car  
or car allowance, allowance for financial planning, 
medical insurance and life assurance cover equal 
to four times base salary. 
The cost of benefit elements provided to executive 
directors is disclosed in the table on page 52. 
3 Annual bonus 
To incentivise executives  
to achieve/exceed annual 
financial, strategic and 
personal objectives set by 
the Committee at the start  
of each financial year. 
Annual bonus is delivered under the Kingfisher Incentive 
Share Scheme (KIS). 
The KIS comprises the ‘KIS Cash Scheme’ and the ‘KIS 
Share Scheme’. 
Senior executives may receive a performance-related  
cash bonus under the KIS Cash Scheme, and a  
contingent share award under the KIS Share Scheme,  
in the proportion of 67% payable in cash and 33% in  
deferred shares. 
The on-target and maximum bonus payable are 100% 
and 200% of base salary respectively. 
The maximum level of bonus payable has remained 
unchanged since 2006. 
For the 2013/14 financial year, the performance 
KPIs for the annual bonus are split as follows: 
 PROFIT 30% (year-on-year). 
 RELATIVE LIKE-FOR-LIKE SALES 30% (with 
reference to movements in market size to  
ensure real improvements in market share  
are being rewarded). 
 DIRECT SOURCING & PRODUCTIVITY 20%. 
 PERSONAL OBJECTIVES 20% (Assessed 
with reference to demonstrating the One  
Team behaviours).

Policy Table continued 
Element and Purpose Policy and Opportunity Operation and Performance Metrics 
3 Annual bonus continued The deferred shares have a three-year vesting period and 
can be subject to forfeiture should the executive leave the 
Group during the vesting period. Claw-back can apply 
should the Committee decide the grant of deferred shares 
was not justified. 
On vesting, dividend ‘roll-up’ shares are available on  
the same basis as described below for the Performance 
Share Plan. 
The profit and sales measures for Kevin O’Byrne 
and Philippe Tible will be based on the results from 
their respective divisions. 
 
4 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
To incentivise executives  
to achieve superior returns  
for shareholders. 
Performance conditions are 
aligned with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s 
strategic objectives. 
Retention of executives over 
the performance period of  
the awards. 
The general policy is for awards to be granted on an 
annual basis, subject to a three-year vesting period  
and stretching performance conditions. 
The maximum annual award is 200% of base salary,  
or 500% of base salary in exceptional circumstances. 
Consistent with the Creating the Leader strategy, a one-off 
award of 500% of salary was made in June 2011. This 
single award replaced the 200% annual awards which 
would have taken place in 2011, 2012 and 2013. This 
creates focus on a single three-year period which matches 
the Creating the Leader phase and is smaller than the 
three annual awards would have been. The award vests  
in two equal tranches in June 2014 and June 2015. 
Shares delivered on the exercise of an award receive 
additional dividend ‘roll-up’ shares calculated on the  
basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant ex-
dividend date using that day’s closing mid-market price. 
Vesting of the awards made in June 2011 is based 
50% on EPS and 50% on KEP (a version of 
economic profit as explained on page 56). 
The EPS performance condition for the 2011 
awards requires EPS at the end of the three-year 
vesting period to be at least 25.8p for 15% of that 
part of the award to vest and 31.2p for 100% of 
that part of the award to vest. 
The KEP performance condition requires the 
Group’s aggregate KEP over the three-year 
performance period to be at least £229 million for 
15% of that part of the award to vest and £386 
million for 100% of that part to vest.  
Any exchange rate upsides/downsides are removed 
from the results, since they are deemed to be 
outside the executive directors’ control. 
5 Shareholding requirements 
To ensure alignment of 
interests of executives and 
shareholders over the  
long term. 
Executive directors are required to build a significant 
shareholding in the Company before the fifth anniversary 
of the date of their appointment. This is a minimum of 
200% of base salary by January 2013 for Ian Cheshire, 
100% of base salary by October 2013 for Kevin O’Byrne 
and Philippe Tible; and 100% of base salary by 1 October 
2017 for Karen Witts. For Philippe Tible this is an increase 
from his position of 50% of salary to be met by April 2009, 
prior to his appointment to the Board. 
 
Performance metrics are not applicable. 
The net value of vested but unexercised awards 
held under the PSP count towards this requirement 
as well as shares held under the KIS Share Scheme 
which have no additional performance conditions. 
Ian Cheshire and Kevin O’ Byrne have satisfied 
their shareholding requirements as at the date of 
this report. 
6 Recruitment policy 
To attract the services of the 
most appropriate candidate  
for the job whilst following the 
principles of the Company’s 
remuneration policy to the 
extent possible. 
It is difficult to be overly prescriptive regarding the 
appropriate package for an unknown potential recruit.  
The following is the Committee’s agreed policy but it may 
need to be adapted in the event of recruitment in order to 
obtain the services of the most appropriate candidate.  
In principle, the pay of any new recruit would be  
assessed following the same principles as for the  
current executive directors. 
The Committee would be mindful of best practice 
guidelines in considering whether any enhanced PSP or 
other award was necessary on recruitment (e.g. to buyout 
awards forgone from the incoming executive’s previous 
employer) and the appropriateness of performance 
conditions in order to avoid paying more than it considers 
necessary to secure the preferred candidate. However, 
each case will need to be considered on its own facts at 
the particular time. 
As necessary to secure the appropriate candidate.  
In the case of Karen Witts, who was recruited 
during 2012/13, she was granted a PSP award 
linked to our Creating the Leader strategy on a  
time pro-rated basis according to the remaining 
proportion of the vesting period. The awards she 
forfeited on leaving her previous employer were  
not bought out.  
7 Chairman and non-executive 
director fees 
To attract and retain a 
Chairman and non-executive 
directors of the highest calibre. 
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, while the fees of the non-
executive directors are determined by the Board with 
affected persons absenting themselves as appropriate. 
The Chairman’s fees are determined by reference to his 
time commitment and relevant benchmark market data. 
The Board determines non-executive directors’ fees under 
a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, 
responsibility and technical skills required to make a 
valuable contribution to an effective Board. 
The Board will review fees paid to non-executive directors 
in similar companies and will review fees for non-executive 
directors in February each year. 
Details of the Chairman’s fees and the fees of non-
executive directors’ are disclosed on page 58. 
Fees are paid monthly. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in  
any of the Company’s performance related pay 
programmes. Non-executive directors are not 
entitled to any compensation for loss of office. 
The basic fee for non-executive directors effective  
1 February 2013 is £61,200. Additional fees are 
paid as follows: 
Senior Independent Director – £17,425 
Chairman of the Audit Committee – £20,000 
Chairman of the Remuneration  
Committee – £15,000

Kevin O’Byrne: On a phased basis at a monthly rate of 12% of annual salary
(1)
. For a maximum of 12 months from the 
termination date. 
Philippe Tible: Termination terms are determined by the convention collective which applies to all French employees. A 
termination payment would be made up of two parts: (i) the dismissal indemnity which is 3% of annual remuneration per 
year of service and (ii) a payment for any unpaid notice which would be a maximum of three months’ remuneration. The 
combination cost based on years of service to date is in the region of one times salary. Remuneration consists of base pay, 
car benefit and cash bonus award. 
Karen Witts: On a phased basis at a monthly rate of 8.3% of annual salary. For a maximum of 12 months from the 
termination date. 
Mitigation  For UK-based executive directors, lower amounts are payable if the director commences lower-paid employment during the 
12-month period following cessation of employment, and payments cease immediately when employment providing the 
same or higher value remuneration is started. 
Remuneration As described in this report. 
Other benefits Car or car allowance and allowance for financial planning. 
Non-cash benefits  The Company provides a range of additional benefits, including medical insurance, life assurance cover equal to four times 
base salary, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card and 30 working days’ holiday per year. 
Expenses  Reimbursement of reasonably incurred costs in accordance with their duties. 
Non-compete During employment and for 12 months after leaving. In respect of Philippe Tible, an amount equal to 50% of annual salary 
and car benefit must be paid to him on a monthly basis following his termination of employment by the Company. This 
amount is standard under French law in order to ensure that the non-compete provision is enforceable. 
(1) The terms of the phased payments clauses appearing in the service contracts of Ian Cheshire and Kevin O’Byrne were in keeping with the governance 
guidelines at the time the employee contracts were made. The Committee will keep its policy under review when appointing new directors and will carefully 
consider the prevailing governance guidelines and legal requirements when structuring contracts for new directors.

(6) Philippe Tible’s remuneration is paid in Euros and is converted to Sterling for the purpose of the table at the average exchange rate over the course of the 
relevant year.  
(7) The 2010 PSP vested post year-end on 5 May 2013 and was based on 50% EPS and 50% on relative TSR performance for Ian Cheshire and Kevin 
O’Byrne, and divisional Retail Operating Profit for Philippe Tible. The out-turn of the EPS and Divisional Retail Operating Profit elements of the award was 
100% of maximum based on strong Group performance over the three-year performance period. The TSR performance out-turn fell just below the median 
of the FTSE 100 comparator group and so failed to meet the threshold of median +1%. Accordingly, the vesting levels for the 2010 PSP award were 50% of 
award for Ian Cheshire and Kevin O’Byrne, and 100% for Philippe Tible. The award granted to Euan Sutherland will lapse in full following his departure 
from the Group on 31 March 2013.   53

Further details of the awards under the KIS Cash Scheme and KIS Share Scheme reflecting these outcomes for 2012/13 are set out 
on page 55. 
Directors’ pension benefits 
Up until 30 June 2012, Ian Cheshire had an entitlement to part of his pension benefits through the Kingfisher defined benefit 
pension scheme, which closed to future accrual of benefits on 30 June 2012 (subject to the scheme cap of £136,200 (2011/12: 
£129,600)) and part through a defined contribution scheme, for which the Company contribution is 30% of base salary. From 1 
July 2012 onwards his pension benefit was delivered solely through the Defined Contribution arrangement.  
Kevin O’Byrne, Euan Sutherland and Karen Witts have an entitlement to a defined contribution pension, with a Company 
contribution of 20% of base salary.  
The Company operates a policy to limit pension contributions during the tax year up to the Annual Allowance, with the excess being 
directed into a taxable monthly cash payment. Following pension and tax legislation changes effective 6 April 2012 on the reduction 
of lifetime allowance from £1.8m to £1.5m, the Company has offered a fully taxable cash alternative, at no additional cost to the 
Company, to directors wishing to exit the Defined Contribution scheme completely. 
Kevin O’Byrne chose to leave the pension scheme on 5 April 2012 and opted to receive the Company pension contribution as a 
taxable monthly cash supplement in full. 
Philippe Tible is a member of a separate Group defined benefit pension scheme, for which eligibility requires him to retire with the 
Kingfisher Group. There is therefore no concept of a deferred pension and if Philippe Tible left the Company for reasons other than 
retirement, none of the pension rights built up would actually crystallise. The figures in the table below are based on a crystallised 
pension and have not been discounted in any way for the risk of forfeiture. 
The following table shows details required under both Schedule 8 to the Regulations under the Act and the Listing Rules as  
they apply to Kingfisher for the year ended 2 February 2013. In respect of the Act, the details shown represent for the defined 
benefit section:  
 accrued pension benefits at the relevant dates; 
 the increase in the amount of accrued pension during this year; 
 the transfer value amounts as at 28 January 2012 and 2 February 2013; and 
 the increase in transfer value between those dates, net of member contributions paid.

the executive directors at no additional cost to the Company. 
(2) The payment to Mr Cheshire includes a goodwill payment received following the closure of the Kingfisher defined benefit scheme and his transfer to the 
Kingfisher defined contribution scheme. This payment was offered to all employees on the same terms.

Long-Term Incentive Plans 
KIS Share Scheme 
Awards of contingent shares, in respect of the financial year ended 2 February 2013, were made post year-end in April 2013  
(to vest in April 2016), to Ian Cheshire, Kevin O’Byrne, Philippe Tible and Karen Witts under the KIS Share Scheme to the value  
of £167,552, £115,200, £115,603 and £32,511, respectively. As the awards will be made after publication of the accounts for  
the financial year ended 2 February 2013, the detail will be disclosed in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Once the contingent share awards are made in respect of the bonus earned, the only qualifying condition for the award normally  
to vest is to be in the employment of the Company at the vesting date.

Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’) 
Included as an element of the KIS Share awards, the executive directors were granted options under the CSOP, an HMRC approved 
plan. The CSOP is underpinned, in part, by a matching fixed value element of the KIS Share awards granted on the same date in 
2011. On exercise, the proceeds of part of the KIS Share award are used to fund the exercise price of the CSOP award, providing 
tax and NIC advantages for participants and potential NIC savings for Kingfisher at no additional cost to the Group. The total value  
of the KIS Share award is not changed.

Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
The PSP remains the primary long-term share incentive plan for senior executives, which allows a maximum annual award not 
exceeding 200% of base salary or 500% of base salary in exceptional circumstances.  
Shares delivered on the vesting of an award receive additional dividend ‘roll-up’ shares calculated on the basis of a notional 
purchase of shares on each relevant ex-dividend date using that day’s closing mid-market price. Shares used to satisfy awards 
under the PSP are normally purchased in the market by the Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust.

(2) The market value of Kingfisher shares on the date of exercise (2 July 2012) was 288.4p per share. 
(3) Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the award, 97.6% of the award became exercisable.  
(4) Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the award, 100% of the award became exercisable.  
(5) Vesting of the awards is based 50% on EPS and 50% on TSR conditions. The EPS condition required EPS at the end of the three-year performance period 
to be at least 20p for 15.625% of that part to vest and 23p for vesting in full of that part of the award. The TSR condition requires the Group’s TSR to be  
at least median plus 1% for 15.625% to vest and upper quintile plus 1% for it all to vest. In both cases, intermediate performance vests on a sliding scale 
basis. Philippe Tible’s award was based on the retail operating profit for his division the targets for which are aligned with the Group EPS targets. The  
results which were confirmed after the year-end are shown in the Executive Directors’ Remuneration table. 
(6) Vesting of the awards is based 50% on EPS and 50% on Kingfisher Economic Profit (‘KEP’). The EPS condition requires EPS at the end of the three-year 
performance period to be at least 25.8p for 15% of that part to vest and 31.2p for vesting in full of that part of the award. The KEP condition required the 
aggregate KEP over the three-year performance period to be at least £229 million for 15% of that part to vest and £386 million for vesting in full of that part 
of the award. KEP is defined as the (Group post-tax retail profit less central costs, excluding exceptional items and property lease costs) – (two point average 
of Group capital employed, including capitalised property leases and adjusted for pensions, multiplied by the Group’s lease adjusted WACC). 50% of the 
vested shares will be released to participants in 2014 with the remaining 50% of the shares released in 2015. Philippe Tible’s award is based on these  
50% Group measures and 50% on divisional retail operating profit and KEP measures which are aligned to the Group targets. 
(7) The market value of Kingfisher shares on the date of exercise (1 June 2012) was 273.4p per share. 
(8) Euan Sutherland exercised the award in two tranches. The market value of Kingfisher shares on the dates of exercise (24 July 2012 and 8 January 2013) 
were 253.9p and 286.9p per share respectively. 
(9) The additional award was made to Philippe Tible in recognition of the expansion of his role to bring him into line with other members of the Group executive 
who received an award of 500% of salary compared to the original award Philippe received of 375% of salary. Vesting of the award will be dependent on 
the same performance criteria as the award made on 17 June 2011.  
( 1 0) The awards held by Euan Sutherland will lapse following his departure from the Company on 31 March 2013. 
( 1 1 ) Karen Witts received an award under the PSP 2011 based on 285% of base salary. This was a time pro-rated award equivalent to the 500% award the 
other executive directors received based on her joining date of 1 October 2012, partway through the vesting period.

Award of Matching Shares to Ian Cheshire 
As part of the terms of his appointment as Group Chief Executive in 2008, a one-off award was made to Ian Cheshire pursuant to 
Listing Rule 9.4.2. Ian Cheshire purchased 266,667 shares in the Company and in turn received a Matching Award of 200% of 
base salary (broadly a 4:1 match). The vesting of the Matching Award was subject to performance conditions relating to growth  
in EPS over the vesting period. The Matching Award vested in full shortly after the 2011/12 financial year end as EPS over the 
performance period exceeded the target for the maximum vesting of 19.6p.

GOVERNANCE 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 
 
Dilution limits 
Kingfisher’s share plans contain limits that set out the quantum of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy awards granted 
under those plans. These limits are in line with the current Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’) guidance on headroom limits  
which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued 
share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on executive plans. The Company has always operated within 
these limits. 
Outside appointments for Executive Directors 
Subject to the rules governing conflicts of interest, the Company encourages its executive directors to hold non-executive roles 
outside the Group as it recognises that such roles can broaden their experience and knowledge, which can be of benefit to the 
Group. Subject to the Committee’s agreement, any fees may be retained by the individual. Kevin O’Byrne is a non-executive 
director, Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Land Securities Group plc, and is paid £60,000, 
£10,000 and £17,500 respectively for fulfilling these roles and retains these fees.  
Ian Cheshire is a non-executive director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of Whitbread plc, and is paid £55,000 and 
£15,000 respectively for fulfilling these roles and retains these fees. In January 2011, Ian Cheshire was invited to act as the lead 
non-executive member of the Department for Work and Pensions Board. He waives his fee for this role.  
Euan Sutherland is a non-executive director of the Co-operative Food board and became a director of SuperGroup plc on  
1 December 2012. He is paid £51,950 and £50,000 per annum respectively for fulfilling these roles and retains these fees. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ Terms and Fees 
Chairman 
Daniel Bernard was appointed Chairman on 3 June 2009, for an initial fixed three-year term, which was extended for an  
additional three-year term on 14 June 2012 and will continue until June 2015, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association, or by either party giving the other not less than six months’ prior written notice. His appointment 
is documented in a letter of appointment and he is required to devote no fewer than two to three days a week to his duties as 
Chairman. His appointment as Chairman will automatically terminate if he ceases to be a director of the Company. His fee, 
determined by reference to his time commitment and relevant benchmark data, was set at €485,000 per annum with effect from 
February 2012 and increased in line with salary increases to employees generally to €494,700 with effect from February 2013.  
The Chairman’s fee is paid to a service company, Provestis, which also receives a monthly contribution of €5,150 towards the  
cost of running the Chairman’s office in Paris. The Chairman’s remuneration is reviewed by the Remuneration Committee on

Non-executive directors’ letters of engagement 
Non-executive directors are appointed under letters of engagement. Appointments have historically been for an initial period of 
three years and invitations to act for subsequent three-year terms are subject to a review of performance, and taking into account 
the need to progressively refresh the Board. 
The appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other not less than three months’ prior written notice, unless 
terminated earlier in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and the Company has no obligation to pay 
compensation when their appointment terminates. 
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors under a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, 
responsibility and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective Board. The Board will also review 
information on fees paid to non-executive directors in similar companies. Non-executive director’s fees were reviewed by the  
Board in January 2013 and the basic fee for a non-executive director was increased by 2% to £61,200 with effect from  
February 2013. Future annual reviews of fees for non-executive directors will be conducted in January each year. 
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company’s performance-related pay programmes.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
1 General information 
Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’), its subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates (together ‘the Group’) supply home improvement 
products and services through a network of retail stores and 
other channels, located mainly in the United Kingdom, 
continental Europe and China.  
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The 
nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 2 to 27. 
The address of its registered office is 3 Sheldon Square, 
Paddington, London W2 6PX. 
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for 
issue by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2013. 
2 Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated. 
a. Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to the 
nearest Saturday to 31 January each year, except as disclosed 
in note 17 and in note 4 of the Company’s separate financial 
statements. The current financial year is the 53 weeks ended  
2 February 2013 (‘the year’ or ‘2012/13’). The comparative 
financial year is the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2012 (‘the 
prior year’ or ‘2011/12’). 
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended 2 February 2013. Refer to the Directors’ statement 
of responsibility on page 33. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS and therefore the consolidated financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation. 
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations, 
which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
ended 2 February 2013, that are relevant and material for  
the Group. 
The following amendments and interpretations, which are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended  
2 February 2013, are either not currently relevant or not 
material for the Group: 
• IFRS 1 (amendment), ‘Severe hyperinflation and  
removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters’; 
• IFRS 7 (amendment), ‘Disclosures – Transfers of  
financial assets’; and 
• IAS 12 (amended), ‘Deferred tax: Recovery of  
underlying assets’. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following new standards, amendments and interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were 
in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet 
been adopted by the EU): 
• IAS 1 (amended), ‘Presentation of items of other 
comprehensive income’ (effective from 1 July 2012); 
• IAS 19 (revised), ‘Employee benefits’ (effective from  
1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 1 (amended), ‘First time adoption’ on government  
loans (effective from 1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets 
and financial liabilities’ (effective from 1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective from  
1 January 2013); 
• Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011 (effective from 
1 January 2013); 
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective  
from 1 January 2014); 
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ (effective from  
1 January 2014); 
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’  
(effective from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 27 (revised), ‘Separate financial statements’ (effective 
from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 28 (revised), ‘Investments in associates and joint 
ventures’ (effective from 1 January 2014); 
• IAS 32 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’  
on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities  
(effective from 1 January 2014); and 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ (effective from  
1 January 2015). 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards 
listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows: 
• IAS 19 (revised) will principally impact the measurement and 
presentation of defined benefit pension expense/income and 
the disclosures for benefit plans. The most significant change 
is expected to be the replacement of interest cost and 
expected return on scheme assets with a single net finance 
cost or return determined by applying the same discount  
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligations to the  
net defined benefit liability or asset. In addition, the revised 
standard will reclassify the administrative costs of running  
the UK scheme from net finance costs to operating costs.  
The Group’s reported profit before taxation and net assets are 
not expected to be materially impacted for 2012/13 (restated) 
and 2013/14, however in future years they may be impacted 
by the change in the finance cost/return calculation 
depending on market interest rates, rates of return  
and the mix of scheme assets; 
• IAS 1 (amended) will principally require items presented in 
‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) to be grouped together 
based on whether items can be reclassified to profit or loss 
subsequently. The amendments do not address which items 
are presented in OCI;   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
• IFRS 13 clarifies the measurement of fair value for certain 
assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures; and 
• IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures  
of financial instruments. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide  
a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the use  
of valuations for certain financial instruments, share-based 
payments and post employment benefits. A summary of the 
Group’s principal accounting policies is set out below.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates and 
assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving critical accounting estimates and 
judgements, which are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements, are disclosed in note 3. 
Use of non-GAAP measures 
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain 
measures that are not required under IFRS, the generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) under which the Group 
reports. Kingfisher believes that retail profit, adjusted pre-tax 
profit, effective tax rate, adjusted post-tax profit and adjusted 
earnings per share provide additional useful information on 
underlying trends to shareholders. These and other non-GAAP 
measures such as net debt/cash are used by Kingfisher for 
internal performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. The terms ‘retail profit’, 
‘exceptional items’, ‘adjusted’, ‘effective tax rate’ and ‘net 
debt/cash’ are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore 
not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by 
other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, 
or superior to, GAAP measures. 
Retail profit is defined as continuing operating profit before 
central costs (principally the costs of the Group’s head office), 
exceptional items, amortisation of acquisition intangibles  
and the Group’s share of interest and tax of joint ventures  
and associates. 
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items, 
which are presented as exceptional within their relevant income 
statement category, helps provide an indication of the Group’s 
underlying business performance. The principal items which  
are included as exceptional items are: 
• non-trading items included in operating profit such as  
profits and losses on the disposal, closure or impairment  
of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and investments 
which do not form part of the Group’s trading activities; 
• profits and losses on the disposal of properties; and 
• the costs of significant restructuring and incremental 
acquisition integration costs. 
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being 
reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, 
financing fair value remeasurements, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, related tax items and prior year tax items. Financing 
fair value remeasurements represent changes in the fair value of 
financing derivatives, excluding interest accruals, offset by fair 
value adjustments to the carrying amount of borrowings and 
other hedged items under fair value hedge relationships. 
Financing derivatives are those that relate to underlying items  
of a financing nature. 
The effective tax rate represents the effective income tax 
expense as a percentage of continuing profit before taxation 
excluding exceptional items. Effective income tax expense is  
the continuing income tax expense excluding tax on exceptional 
items and tax adjustments in respect of prior years and the 
impact of changes in tax rates on deferred tax. 
Net debt/cash comprises borrowings and financing derivatives 
(excluding accrued interest), less cash and cash equivalents 
and current other investments. 
b. Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures  
and associates. 
(i) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of 
the voting rights. Subsidiary undertakings acquired are recorded 
under the acquisition method of accounting and their results 
included from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries 
which have been disposed are included up to the effective date 
of disposal. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary  
is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred 
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired  
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,  
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the  
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is 
the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having 
a deficit balance. Prior to 31 January 2010, losses exceeding  
the non-controlling interest in the equity of a subsidiary were 
required to be attributed to the parent; the resulting deficit 
balances were not restated following amendment to IAS 27, 
‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’. 
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of  
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-
date fair value of any previous equity interests in the acquiree 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of  
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of  
a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly  
in the income statement. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries have been  
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.  67

(ii) Joint ventures and associates 
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint 
control, with a third party, to govern the financial and operating 
activities of that entity. The equity method is used to account for 
the Group’s investments in joint ventures. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has the ability  
to exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50%  
of the voting rights. The equity method is used to account  
for the Group’s investments in associates. 
Under the equity method investments are initially recognised at 
cost. The Group’s investments in joint ventures and associates 
include goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment losses) 
identified on acquisition. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses is 
recognised in the income statement within operating profit,  
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is 
recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of  
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses equals or  
exceeds its interest, including any other long term receivables, 
the Group does not recognise any further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint 
venture or associate. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its 
joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and associates 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group. 
c. Foreign currencies 
(i) Presentation and functional currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in  
Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Items 
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates  
(i.e. its functional currency). 
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are  
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the date of the transaction or, for practical  
reasons, at average monthly rates where exchange rates  
do not fluctuate significantly.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange  
at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary 
items are taken to the income statement. Exceptions to this are 
where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a 
foreign operation or are designated and effective net investment 
or cash flow hedges. Such exchange differences are initially 
deferred in equity. 
(iii) Group companies 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings  
are expressed in Sterling at the rates of exchange at the  
balance sheet date. Profits and losses of overseas subsidiary 
undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange 
rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of foreign operations are recognised in a separate 
component of equity. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in 
the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date.

d. Revenue recognition 
Sales represent the supply of home improvement products and 
services. Sales exclude transactions made between companies 
within the Group, Value Added Tax, other sales-related taxes 
and are net of returns, trade and staff discounts. 
Sales of in-store products are generally recognised at the point 
of cash receipt. Where award credits such as vouchers or loyalty 
points are provided as part of the sales transaction, the amount 
allocated to the credits is deferred and recognised when the 
credits are redeemed and the Group fulfils its obligations to 
supply the awards. 
For delivered products and services, sales are recognised either 
when the product has been delivered or, for installation income, 
when the service has been performed. Sales from delivered 
products and services represent only a small component of  
the Group’s sales as the majority relates to in-store purchases  
of products. 
Other income is generally composed primarily of external rental 
income and profits and losses on disposal of assets. Rental 
income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
e. Rebates 
Rebates received from suppliers mainly comprise volume 
related rebates on the purchase of inventories.  
Volume related rebates are recognised based on actual 
purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases 
forecast over the rebate period where it is probable the rebates 
will be received and the amounts can be estimated reliably.  
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the 
balance sheet date are deducted from the carrying value so  
that the cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates. 
Such rebates are credited to the income statement when the 
goods are sold.  
f. Dividends 
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the 
Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised  
when they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

g. Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising  
from assets acquired in a business combination that are  
not individually identified and separately recognised.  
Such benefits include future synergies expected from the  
combination and intangible assets not meeting the criteria  
for separate recognition. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment 
by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating 
unit or groups of cash generating units to which the goodwill 
relates. The recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the 
net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows (‘value-
in-use’) or fair value less costs to sell if higher. The discount  
rate applied is based upon the Group’s weighted average cost  
of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated 
with the relevant cash generating unit or groups of cash 
generating units. When the recoverable amount of the  
goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement which cannot 
subsequently be reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of 
an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold. 
(ii) Computer software 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the 
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software. These costs are amortised over their  
estimated useful lives of two to ten years. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits 
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Direct costs include software development, employee 
and consultancy costs and an appropriate portion of relevant 
overheads. These costs are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives of two to ten years. Costs associated with identifying, 
sourcing, evaluating or maintaining computer software are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. 
h. Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Cost  
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the business  
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provisions for impairment.  
(ii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line reduction  
from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful 
life of the asset as follows: 
Freehold land – not depreciated 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings – over remaining useful life  
Short leasehold land and buildings – over remaining period  
of the lease 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and 20 years 
Computers and electronic equipment – between 3 and 5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years 
Commercial vehicles – between 3 and 10 years 
Long leaseholds are defined as those having remaining lease 
terms of more than 50 years. Asset lives and residual values are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
 
(iii) Impairment 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows 
(‘value-in-use’) of the relevant cash generating unit or fair value 
less costs to sell if higher. The discount rate applied is based 
upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with 
appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the 
relevant cash generating unit. Any impairment in value is 
charged to the income statement in the period in which  
it occurs.  
(iv) Disposal 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds  
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement. Sales of land and buildings are accounted 
for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.  
(v) Subsequent costs 
Subsequent costs are included in the related asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they  
are incurred. 
i. Leased assets 
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements which give 
rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if 
they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is 
the lower of the fair value or the present value of the minimum 
lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the 
lease. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term or their useful life. Obligations relating to finance leases, 
net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included, 
as appropriate, under borrowings due within or after one year. 
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to finance 
costs in the income statement over the lease term.  
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments 
are generally charged to the income statement in the period  
to which the payments relate, except for those leases which 
incorporate fixed minimum rental uplift clauses. Leases which 
contain fixed minimum rental uplifts are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Where a lease is taken out for land and buildings combined,  
the buildings element of the lease may be capitalised as a 
finance lease if it meets the criteria for a finance lease, but the 
land element will in most cases be classified as an operating 
lease. If the contracted lease payments are not split between 
land and buildings in the lease contract, the split is made based 
on the market values of the land and buildings at the inception 
of the lease.  
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the lease term.  69

j. Investment property 
Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental 
income or for capital appreciation. The Group’s investment 
properties are carried at cost less depreciation and provision for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided on a consistent basis with 
that applied to property, plant and equipment. 
k. Capitalisation of borrowing costs 
Interest on borrowings to finance the construction of properties 
held as non-current assets is capitalised from the date work 
starts on the property to the date when substantially all the 
activities which are necessary to get the property ready for  
use are complete. Where construction is completed in parts,  
each part is considered separately when capitalising interest.  
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief. 
l. Inventories 
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, on a weighted average cost basis. 
Trade discounts and rebates received are deducted in 
determining the cost of purchase of inventories. Cost includes 
appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure 
incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods  
to their present location and condition. Costs of inventories 
include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on 
qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases.  
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale. Write downs to net realisable value are made 
for slow moving, damaged or obsolete items and other events  
or conditions resulting in expected selling prices being lower 
than cost. The carrying value of inventories reflects known and 
expected losses of product in the ordinary course of business.  
m. Employee benefits 
(i) Post employment benefits 
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension schemes for its employees, some of which 
are required by local legislation. A defined benefit scheme is a 
pension scheme which defines an amount of pension benefit 
which an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Group usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.  
In all cases other than some of the legally required schemes,  
a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing 
liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either held 
under trusts or managed by insurance companies and are 
entirely separate from the Group’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect 
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past 
service costs not yet recognised. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income as they arise.  
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income 
statement, unless the changes to the pension scheme are 
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the 
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over  
the vesting period. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions 
to privately administered pension schemes on a contractual 
basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised 
as an employee benefit expense when they are due. 
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes. The fair value of the employee  
services received in exchange for the grant of options or 
deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount  
to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options or deferred shares 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options vesting due to  
non-market vesting conditions.  
n. Taxation 
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax  
currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable  
is based on taxable profit for the year.  
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported  
in the income statement because it excludes items of income  
or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years or 
which are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable  
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to  
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax 
losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition  
of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred tax assets  
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting  
profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able  
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at  
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is  
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates which 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

2 Principal accounting policies continued  
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income 
statement, except when they relate to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is 
also recognised directly in equity. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against 
each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
o. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.  
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate which reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. 
p. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows  
from the financial asset expire or the Group has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires. 
(i) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits  
held on call with banks and other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
(ii) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and 
effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made  
to their carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the  
income statement using the effective interest method. 
(iii) Other investments 
Other investments include bank deposits, government bonds 
and other short term investments with original maturities of 
more than three months. 
(iv) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision  
for bad and doubtful debts.  
(v) Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(vi) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to 
which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives 
are recognised in the income statement as they arise. Changes 
in the fair value of derivatives transacted as hedges of operating 
items and financing items are recognised in operating profit  
and net finance costs respectively.  
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently carried 
at fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives and other 
financial instruments classified as hedges depends on their 
designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge relationship. 
The Group designates certain financial instruments as: 
• a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability or 
unrecognised firm commitment (‘fair value hedge’); 
• a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or firm 
commitment (‘cash flow hedge’); or 
• a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net 
investment hedge’). 
Fair value hedges  
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, 
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry being 
recorded in the income statement. Gains or losses from 
remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are 
recognised in the same line of the income statement. 
Cash flow hedges  
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity, with any ineffective portion  
being recognised immediately in the income statement  
where relevant. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated 
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that result in the 
recognition of a financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recognised in the income statement in the same 
period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.  
Net investment hedges 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations 
through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings are recognised directly in equity. 
If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument, the 
effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any 
ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are  
recycled through the income statement on disposal of the 
foreign operation.  
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents 
in advance the relationship between the item being hedged  
and the hedging instrument. The Group also documents and 
demonstrates an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the 
hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to 
ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the  
net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the income statement.  71

2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those  
of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at  
fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the  
income statement.  
3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under 
IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year  
are discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and other assets 
As required, the Group applies procedures to ensure that its 
assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount. 
The procedures, by their nature, require estimates and 
assumptions to be made. The most significant are set  
out below. 
The Group is required, on at least an annual basis, to test 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. As part of this 
testing the recoverable amounts of cash generating units have 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The  
use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash 
generating unit and the choice of suitable discount and long 
term growth rates in order to calculate the present value of the 
forecast cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary significantly 
from these estimates. Further information on the impairment 
tests undertaken, including the key assumptions, is given  
in note 12. 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash 
generating unit is determined as the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates. 
At each reporting date the Group is required to assess whether 
there is objective evidence that its investments in associates and 
joint ventures may be impaired. This requires estimates of the 
investments’ recoverable amounts, including present values  
of the Group’s share of future cash flows. 
Inventories 
As inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods to customers in the future. A high degree of judgement  
is applied when estimating the impact on the carrying value of 
inventories of factors such as slow moving items, shrinkage, 
damage and obsolescence. The quantity, age and condition  
of inventories are regularly measured and assessed as part  
of range reviews and inventory counts undertaken through 
out the year and across the Group. Refer to note 18 for  
further information. 
Income taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of 
business. Significant judgement may therefore be required in 
determining the provision for income taxes in each territory. The 
Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made. These adjustments in respect of 
prior years are recorded in the income statement or directly  
in equity as appropriate. Refer to notes 9 and 25 for  
further information. 
Restructuring provisions 
The Group carries a number of provisions in relation to historical 
and ongoing restructuring programmes. The most significant 
part of the provisions is the cost to exit stores and property 
contracts. The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows are 
dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the  
closed stores and subletting surplus space. Refer to note  
26 for further information. 
Post employment benefits 
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised  
on the balance sheet is dependent on a number of assumptions 
including interest rates of high quality corporate bonds,  
inflation and mortality rates. The net interest charge or return  
is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets. 
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time  
and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant 
movements in the estimated obligations. To help the reader 
understand the impact of changes in the key assumptions,  
a sensitivity analysis is provided in note 27.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

The operating segments disclosed above are based on the information reported internally to the Board of Directors and  
Group Executive. This information is predominantly based on the geographical areas in which the Group operates and  
which are managed separately. The Group only has one business segment being the supply of home improvement products  
and services. 
The ‘Other International’ segment consists of Poland, China, Spain, Russia, the joint venture Koçta s ¸  in Turkey and the  
associate Hornbach which has operations in Germany and other European countries. Poland has been shown separately  
due to its significance. 
Central costs principally comprise the costs of the Group’s head office. Central liabilities comprise unallocated head office  
and other central items including pensions, interest and tax.

Following a sustained decline in trading, the Group undertook a detailed review in the year of its Irish operations and as a result 
entered into an Examinership process in January 2013. The £21m restructuring charge represents provisions recorded for the 
impairment of properties and estimated costs of exiting leases and other closure activities. 
The UK restructuring net charge of £16m principally reflects the streamlining of B&Q UK & Ireland’s store support office and 
kitchen, bathroom and bedroom business as well as IT services. It also includes a £4m release (2011/12: £2m) of an onerous 
property contract provision for idle stores either sublet or exited in the period, which had previously been included as part of the 
B&Q UK store closure and downsizing programme in 2005/06. 
In the prior year the Group acquired 29 Focus stores in the UK and incurred £11m of costs integrating these into the B&Q  
store network. 
The net pension gain of £11m includes a £27m curtailment gain arising due to the closure of the UK final salary scheme to  
future benefit accrual. Offsetting the gain is a charge of £16m for transitional payments to scheme members.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

Income tax expense 127 158
The effective rate of tax on profit before exceptional items and excluding prior year tax adjustments and the impact of changes  
in tax rates on deferred tax is 27% (2011/12: 28%). Tax on exceptional items for the year is a credit of £1m. In 2011/12 tax on 
exceptional items was a credit of £7m, £5m of which related to prior year items. The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the 
Financial Review on page 20. 
The overall tax rate for the year is 18% (2011/12: 20%) reflecting the impact on deferred tax of the 2% fall in the UK rate, release  
of prior year provisions either reassessed or time expired and a claim for the use of prior year losses of £33 million. 
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of £14m has been charged directly to equity (2011/12: £9m 
charge), of which a £6m credit (2011/12: £33m credit) is included in current tax and a £20m charge (2011/12: £42m charge) is 
included in deferred tax. 
Kingfisher paid €138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa 
Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge. Kingfisher appealed successfully against this tax liability and  
as a result received €169m from the French tax authorities in September 2009, representing a refund of the €138m and €31m of 
repayment supplement. The French tax authorities appealed this decision and the hearing took place in May 2011 with the Court  
of Appeal finding in Kingfisher’s favour. The French tax authorities have appealed this decision to the final level of court although  
a date for this hearing has not yet been set. Therefore no income has yet been recognised relating to this receipt.  77

Impact of changes in tax rates 
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and will fall to 23% from 1 April 2013. A further reduction  
to 21% was announced in 2012, which is expected to take effect from 1 April 2014, and a subsequent reduction to 20% was 
announced in 2013, which is expected to take effect from 1 April 2015. Since these further reductions have not yet been 
substantively enacted, their impact is not included in these financial statements. The combined effect would be to reduce  
the net deferred tax liability as reported at 2 February 2013 by £9m.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share 522 2,373 22.0 584 2,375 24.6
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
(‘ESOP’) which for the purpose of this calculation are treated as cancelled. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where both the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s shares during the year and any related performance conditions have been met.

Impairment ––– (124)(124)
Net carrying amount 1,798 518 81 – 2,397
The recoverable amounts of these groups of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The groups of CGUs 
for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed significant are the UK, France and Poland. 
The Board have reviewed a sensitivity analysis, including the use of prior year discount and growth rates, and do not consider that  
a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would cause the carrying amounts of the 
CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below. 
Assumptions 
• The cash flow projections are based on approved financial budgets and strategic plans covering a four year period. These are 
based on both past performance and expectations for future market development. 
• Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales, margin and operating profit percentage. LFL sales are based on the Group’s 
market expectations and the CGUs’ market shares. 
• Cash flows beyond this four year period are calculated using a growth rate which does not exceed the long term average growth 
rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs. 
• The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash flows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt, 
leases and equity, weighted according to an estimate of the CGU’s capital gearing. A risk adjustment is also made for the country 
in which the CGU operates.  79

France 
• The risk-adjusted discount rate of 9.6% (2011/12: 13.3%) is pre-tax and reflects the specific risks inherent in the French market.

Properties that were held at 1 February 2004 are carried at deemed cost, being the fair value of land and buildings as at the 
transition date to IFRS. Fair value is taken to be the open market value at the date of valuation. All property acquired after  
1 February 2004 is carried at cost. 
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land that is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being 
amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The net carrying amount of leasehold land included  
in land and buildings at 2 February 2013 is £240m (2011/12: £237m).  
The Group does not revalue properties within its financial statements. A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes 
annually in November by independent external valuers covering over one third of the property portfolio with the remaining portfolio 
valued internally. Based on this exercise the value of property is £3.5 billion (2011/12: £3.4bn). The key assumption used in 
calculating this is the estimated yields.

Bank overdrafts and loans 
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and current bank loans mature within the next 12 months. Bank overdrafts are arranged 
at floating rates of interest. Current bank loans include Chinese Renminbi loans drawn under committed facilities expiring in 2013. 
These loans bear interest based on the People’s Bank of China reference rate and are fixed for periods of up to six months. At the 
year end the effective borrowing rate on the drawn amounts was 6.2% (2011/12: 6.2%). Other current bank loans are arranged at 
floating rates of interest. 
Non-current bank loans have an average maturity of three years (2011/12: three years) and are arranged at fixed rates of interest 
with an effective interest rate of 3.8% (2011/12: 3.6%).  85

(3) Swapped to floating rate Euro based on 3 month EURIBOR plus a margin using a cross-currency interest rate swap.  
The Group values its MTNs and USPP on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for fair value gains and losses (based on observable 
market inputs) attributable to the risk being hedged in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships.  
The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exchange rate movements and fair value adjustments 
for interest rate risk. At 2 February 2013, the cumulative effect of interest rate fair value adjustments is to increase the Group’s 
MTNs and USPP carrying amounts by £38m (2011/12: £49m increase).  
The USPP contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of 
operating profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month 
period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 2 February 2013.  
Finance leases 
The Group leases certain of its buildings and fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term maturity for 
buildings is seven years (2011/12: seven years) and for fixtures and equipment is two years (2011/12: two years). Certain building 
leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.

Fair value of borrowings  
The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts. 
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of non-current borrowings. Where market values are 
not available or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and foreign 
exchange rates. The carrying amounts and fair values of non-current borrowings are as follows:

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows arising from the instruments and adjusting for credit risk. These fair 
value measurements are all made using observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk and are therefore 
classified as ‘level 2’ in the IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, fair value hierarchy. At 2 February 2013 net derivative 
assets included in net debt amount to £71m (2011/12: £67m net derivative assets).  
Fair value hedges 
Fair value hedges comprise interest rate swap contracts that convert fixed rate debt issued under the Group’s Medium Term Note 
programme and the US Private Placement to floating rate liabilities, along with certain cross-currency swaps. At 2 February 2013 
the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £261m (2011/12: £516m). During the year, interest rate swaps have expired to 
coincide with the final repayment of underlying debt. The Sterling equivalent amount of those expired swaps (at year end exchange 
rates) was £174m. 
Cash flow hedges 
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 2 February 2013 the Sterling 
equivalent amount of such contracts is £441m (2011/12: £376m). The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to 
inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months. Gains of £8m (2011/12: £8m losses) have been transferred to 
inventories for contracts which matured during the year. 
Net investment hedges 
Cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments. At 2 February 2013 the Sterling equivalent 
amount of such contracts is £90m (2011/12: £nil).  
Non-designated hedges 
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against fluctuations in the income statement arising from balance 
sheet positions. At 2 February 2013 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £1,062m (2011/12: £715m). These have 
not been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation 
of the balance sheet positions. These include short term foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded 
derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.  87

24  Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed. The 
Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required  
to manage these risks. Kingfisher’s treasury function is not run as a profit centre and does not enter into any transactions for 
speculative purposes. 
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives. The main types of financial 
instruments used are Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest  
rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. 
Interest rate risk 
Borrowings arranged at floating rates of interest expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at fixed 
rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain 
interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Group’s underlying debt instruments, principally  
the Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt. 
Currency risk 
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi. The Euro, Polish Zloty 
and Chinese Renminbi exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland, 
Poland and China. In particular, the Group generates a substantial part of its profit from the Eurozone, and as such is exposed  
to the economic uncertainty of its member states. The Group continues to monitor potential exposures and risks, and develop 
effective risk management solutions. 
Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is currently hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Group’s debt in Euro, whilst  
Chinese Renminbi balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China. It is the Group’s policy not to  
hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling. In addition, the Group has significant transactional exposure arising on  
the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts. Under Group 
policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory 
purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Kingfisher’s policy is to manage the interest rate and currency profile of its issued debt using derivative contracts. The effect of these 
contracts on the Group’s net debt/cash is as follows:

Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the significant market risks impacting Kingfisher, 
are borrowings, deposits and derivatives. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of net finance costs (reflecting the impact 
on profit) and derivative cash flow hedges (reflecting the impact on other comprehensive income) to changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates.

The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge forecast US Dollar purchases of inventories. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until  
the purchases occur. See note 23 for further details. The retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as 
hedges of net investments in foreign operations is reported in equity and offset by the retranslation of the hedged net investments. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that the 
Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts 
remain constant, reflecting the positions at 2 February 2013 and 28 January 2012 respectively. As a consequence, the analysis 
relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. In preparing the sensitivity 
analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective. 
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.  89

Liquidity risk 
The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent cash 
flow forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments 
of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected outflows.  
The following table analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. It excludes trade and other 
payables due to the low associated liquidity risk. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows 
(including interest) and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

At 2 February 2013 the Group has an undrawn revolving facility of £200m which matures in August 2016. The £200m facility 
contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each annual and semi-annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating 
profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period. The 
Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 2 February 2013. 
Credit risk 
The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with the strongest short term credit ratings and with money market funds 
which have AAA credit ratings and offer same day liquidity. A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the 
full value of deposits and a proportion of the fair value of derivative contracts. The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the 
investments and derivative contracts across several counterparties. At 2 February 2013, the highest cash deposit with a single 
counterparty was £32m (2011/12: £63m). 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short term deposits and the fair 
value of derivative assets. 
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low 
concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables. Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances with 
short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers. 
At 2 February 2013, trade and other receivables that are past due but not provided against amount to £41m (2011/12: £62m),  
of which £3m (2011/12: £3m) are over 120 days past due.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £243m (2011/12: £246m) available for offset against future profits.  
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £24m (2011/12: £23m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remaining £219m (2011/12: £223m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in 
unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of £187m (2011/12: £210m) which can be carried forward only in the next 
one to five years. Other unrecognised losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £2,980m (2011/12: £114m) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. This is because the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and therefore no tax 
is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. The total temporary difference has increased significantly in the period 
largely as a result of changes introduced by the French government to apply a surtax on gross dividend distributions paid by French 
entities. Previously only 5% of dividend income received in France was potentially subject to tax at the prevailing corporate income 
tax rate. Hence as a result of the surtax the total earnings on which the tax would be chargeable, should they be remitted from or 
through France, has increased considerably.

Within the onerous property contracts provisions, Kingfisher has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a 
shortfall and long term idle properties, except those related to restructuring programmes which are included in the restructuring 
provisions. The provisions are based on the present value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges. 
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK, Ireland and China restructuring programmes. The provisions have 
been discounted to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the specific liabilities. 
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease 
contracts and subletting surplus space.  91

27  Post employment benefits 
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit 
schemes and funded defined contribution schemes. The most significant are the funded, final salary defined benefit and defined 
contribution schemes for the Group’s UK employees. Various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are operated in 
France and Poland, where they are principally retirement indemnity in nature, and in China. The overseas schemes are not material 
in relation to the Group as a whole. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes, at rates specified in the individual schemes’ rules, are as follows: 
£ millions  2012/13 2011/12
Charge to operating profit 17 8
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered to all UK employees. Eligible UK employees will be 
automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme from 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme is in the UK. The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Group 
in trustee-administered funds. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the scheme’s beneficiaries. 
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the scheme Trustee and the 
last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2010. The Company monitors the scheme funding level on a regular basis and will 
review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place. 
During the year, and following consultation with the active members, the UK final salary pension scheme was closed to future 
benefit accrual with effect from 30 June 2012. The scheme had been closed to new entrants in 2004. The closure to future accrual 
resulted in an exceptional non-cash curtailment gain of £27m, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities as benefits 
are no longer linked to future salary increases other than in line with inflation. 
UK scheme interest in property partnership 
In 2010/11, the Group established a partnership, Kingfisher Scottish Limited Partnership (‘Kingfisher SLP’), as part of an 
arrangement with the UK scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit and provide greater security to the Trustee. 
The partnership interests are held by the Group and by the scheme, the latter resulting from investments of £78m and £106m 
made by the Trustee in January and June 2011 respectively. These investments followed Group contributions of the same amounts 
into the scheme. Under IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, the investments held by the scheme in Kingfisher SLP do not represent plan 
assets for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the reported pension position does not reflect 
these investments. The Group has control over the partnership and therefore it is consolidated in these Group financial statements. 
Accordingly, advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 
2008 from the requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of the partnership’s accounts. 
UK property assets with market values of £83m and £119m were transferred, in January 2011 and June 2011 respectively, into  
the partnership and leased back to B&Q plc. The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute 
alternative properties. The Trustee has a first charge over the properties in the event that Kingfisher plc becomes insolvent. The 
scheme’s partnership interest entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the 20 year period of the arrangement. 
The payments to the scheme by Kingfisher SLP over this term are reflected as Group pension contributions on a cash basis. At the 
end of this term, Kingfisher plc has the option to acquire the Trustee’s partnership interest in Kingfisher SLP.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are set by the 
Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at  
the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the 
sensitivity analysis. 
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for 
the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market 
expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the schemes.

For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics 
and experience of the membership of the scheme from 2007 to 2010. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by 
adjusting standard mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for  
males and with the standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life 
expectancy. For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 
1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a 
minimum of 1% pa. These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general 
population trends.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows: 
Years 2012/13 2011/12
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male 86.4 86.4
– Female  87.1 87.1
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time)  
– Male 87.1 87.1

The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on obligations resulting from changes to key 
actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.

(1) The charge to the income statement for the years ended 2 February 2013 and 28 January 2012 in respect of share-based payments includes the first 
year’s charge of the 2013 and 2012 Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) grants respectively, based on the bonus for the year. Since grants under 
the KISS are made following the year end to which the first year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the  
year end.  
(2) The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the year represents a blend of nil price KISS, Performance Share Plan and Store 
Management Incentive Share Scheme options and discounted Sharesave options (see below). 
Information on the share schemes is given in note 13 of the Company’s separate financial statements. 
Options have been exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. On that basis, the weighted average share price during the 
year, rather than at the date of exercise, is £2.81 (2011/12: £2.55). The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise 
prices ranging from £nil to £2.38 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.1 years (2011/12: 3.6 years). 
The Group recognised a total expense of £9m in the year ended 2 February 2013 (2011/12: £32m) relating to equity-settled  
share-based payment transactions. 
Under IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’, the Group recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002. Option 
numbers and other disclosures above are for those options granted after this date. A full list of outstanding options is given in note

Expiry of overseas KISS schemes and CSOP is 6 months from the date of vesting. Expiry of overseas PSP schemes is 1 year from the date of vesting. 
(3) Expected volatility was determined for each individual award, by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price (plus reinvested dividends) 
immediately prior to the grant of the award, over the same period as the vesting period of each award, adjusted by expectations of future volatility.  
(4) The fair values of UK and International Sharesave awards granted on or before 1 January 2009 have been restated to reflect the 17 January 2008

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities

Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or  
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-

inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 2 February 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to

Notes to the Company financial statements  
 
1 Principal accounting policies 
The financial statements of Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’)  
are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year. 
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the 
Company to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to  
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 2 February 2013. Refer to  
the Directors’ statement of responsibility on page 33. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, as modified by the use of valuations 
for certain financial instruments, share-based payments and 
pensions, and are prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the 
consolidated financial statements of Kingfisher plc. As  
permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit 
and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and 
losses are not presented. The Company has taken advantage  
of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under 
the terms of FRS 1, ‘Cash flow statements’. The Company is  
exempt under the terms of FRS 8, ‘Related party disclosures’, 
from disclosing related party transactions with wholly  
owned subsidiaries of Kingfisher plc. The Company has  
taken advantage of the exemption to provide financial 
instrument disclosures under the terms of FRS 29,  
‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation  
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated. 
a. Foreign currencies 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange  
at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary 
items are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Principal rate of exchange against Sterling: 
Euro  2012/13 2011/12
Year end rate 1.15 1.19
b. Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are carried in the balance sheet at  
cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line 
reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the 
estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and 20 years 
Computers and electronic equipment – between 3 and 5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years 
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is 
conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference  
to the higher of value-in-use and net realisable value. Any 
impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account  
in the period in which it occurs. 
c. Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are included in the 
balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment. 
d. Operating leases 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit  
and loss account in the period to which the payments relate. 
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis 
over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on  
which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing 
market rate. 
e. Employee benefits 
(i) Pensions 
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme  
is a pension scheme that defines an amount of pension  
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Company usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
In all cases a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the 
accruing liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either 
held under trusts or managed by insurance companies and  
are held entirely separate from the Company’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect 
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past 
service costs not yet recognised. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
recoverable either through reduced future contributions or 
through agreed refunds from the scheme. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited 
directly to the profit and loss reserve as they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit  
and loss account, unless the changes to the pension scheme 
are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the 
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over  
the vesting period. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Company pays 
contributions to privately administered pension schemes on  
a contractual basis. The Company has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense 
when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an 
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future 
payments is available. 
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes for the employees of the Company  
and its subsidiaries using the Company’s equity instruments.  
The fair value of the Company’s employees’ services received  
in exchange for the grant of options or deferred shares is    Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13
102
ACCOUNTS 
Notes to the Company financial statements continued 
1 Principal accounting policies continued 
recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-
Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference  
to the fair value of the options or deferred shares granted, 
excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The 
value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual 
levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the compensation given to subsidiaries in 
respect of share-based compensation schemes is recognised  
as a capital contribution over the vesting period. The capital 
contribution is reduced by any payments received from 
subsidiaries in respect of these schemes. 
(iii) Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) 
The ESOP is a separately administered discretionary trust. 
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the 
assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.  
Own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from equity 
shareholders’ funds and the shares are held at historical cost 
until they are sold. The assets, liabilities, income and costs  
of the ESOP are included in both the Company’s and the 
consolidated financial statements. 
f. Deferred tax 
Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental 
provision approach and is measured on an undiscounted  
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods  
in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and  
laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences  
that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet  
date subject to the following: 
 deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-
monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale 
agreement exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover 
relief is available on an asset, deferred tax is not recognised;  
 deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries and associates only where dividends are accrued 
as receivable or there is an intention to remit these in the 
foreseeable future; 
 deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are 
regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable 
when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted; and 
 deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences. 
g. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it  
is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be  
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.  
h. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire or the Company has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires. 
(i) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and 
effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made  
to their carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the  
profit and loss account using the effective interest method. 
(ii) Trade creditors 
Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(iii) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to 
which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives 
are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently carried at 
fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as 
hedges depends on their designation, which occurs at the start 
of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain 
derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability 
(‘fair value hedge’). 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, 
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry being 
recorded in the profit and loss account. Gains or losses from 
remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are also 
recognised in the profit and loss account. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company 
documents in advance the relationship between the item  
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Company  
also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, which shows that the hedge has been and will be 
highly effective on an ongoing basis. The effectiveness testing  
is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge 
remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of  
host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair 
value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the profit  
and loss account.

9 Net pension asset 
The Company participates in both a funded defined benefit scheme and a funded defined contribution scheme. 
Defined contribution scheme 
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme, at rates specified in the scheme’s rules, are as follows: 
£ millions  2012/13 2011/12
Charge to operating profit 2 1
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered to all Company employees. Eligible Company 
employees will be automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme from 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit scheme 
Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the 
Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities. The valuation of the scheme has been based on the  
most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 and has been updated to 2 February 2013. 
During the year, and following consultation with the active members, the UK final salary pension scheme was closed to future 
benefit accrual with effect from 30 June 2012. The scheme had been closed to new entrants in 2004. The closure to future accrual 
resulted in an exceptional non-cash curtailment gain of £1m, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities as benefits 
are no longer linked to future salary increases other than in line with inflation. Furthermore, it resulted in a full provision against  
the net surplus being recognised at the curtailment date. This exceptional non-cash asset restriction loss of £6m reflects the 
requirements under UK accounting standards, which restrict the amount of surplus that can be recognised following the closure  
to future accrual of benefits. 
In the prior year the Company entered into the second phase of an arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of 
the scheme deficit. Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements. As part of this 
arrangement, the Company made a contribution of £106m to the scheme and subsequently recharged the other participating 
Group entities based on their share of pensionable payroll, resulting in a net cash contribution of £3m.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligation of the defined benefit pension scheme are set by the Directors after 
consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and 
changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligation. 
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference 
in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market expectations at 
the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.   Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of 
the membership of the scheme from 2007 to 2010. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard 
mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the 
standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy. For males, 
the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, 
the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a minimum of 1% pa. 
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends. 
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: 
Years  2012/13 2011/12
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male 86.4 86.4
– Female  87.1 87.1

The Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) and Performance Share Plan are described as part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 45 to 59.  
Restricted Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS. They are nil cost options,  
as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised. Vesting dates may vary according to individual grants. 
Certain employees, excluding directors, have been granted contingent share awards under the Kingfisher Retention Share Scheme. 
The Store Management Incentive Share Scheme provided provisional awards to store managers in 2009 with vesting dates of  
April 2011 and April 2012. There are performance conditions based on store standards and an award will lapse if these are not 
maintained throughout the performance period. These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period. 
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a 
period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract. The option price is the average 
market price over three days prior to an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%. Options are exercisable within a six month period 
from the conclusion of a three or five year period. The International Sharesave scheme, which operates along similar lines to the  
UK Sharesave scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations.  
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes was made in April 2003. 
Under these schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group. These options are 
normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant (up to the tenth anniversary), except where the performance 
condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly. The performance conditions for all options have now 
been met. On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number  
of shares in the Company.  
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances. 
Under FRS 20, ‘Share-based payment’, the Company recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002.  
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 30 of the Kingfisher plc 
consolidated financial statements.    Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13

The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) 
The ESOP is funded by an interest free loan from the Company of £95m (2011/12: £148m) to enable it to acquire shares in 
Kingfisher plc. The shares are used to satisfy options awarded under the KISS, Performance Share Plan, Kingfisher Retention  
Share Scheme, Store Management Incentive Share Scheme, Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share  
Option Schemes. 
The ESOP’s shareholding at 2 February 2013 is 21 million shares (2011/12: 46 million shares) with a nominal value of £3m 
(2011/12: £7m) and a market value of £57m (2011/12: £119m). Dividends on these shares were waived for the interim and  
final dividends. 
14 Contingent liabilities 
The Company has arranged for certain guarantees to be provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Of these 
guarantees, £nil (2011/12: £4m) would crystallise due to possible events not wholly within the Company’s control. 
15 Related party transactions

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Kingfisher plc 
We have audited the Company financial statements of 
Kingfisher plc for the year ended 2 February 2013 which 
comprise the Company balance sheet and the related notes  
1 to 15. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for  
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our  
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Company financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Company financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 2 February 2013; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report  
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Kingfisher plc for the year ended 2 February 2013 and on  
the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited.

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams) 
Kingfisher plc is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently some shareholders 
may receive unsolicited mail, including correspondence from 
unauthorised investment companies. We have become aware 
that some shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls  
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These  
are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell what often turn out to be worthless 
or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised 
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares  
at a discount or offers of free company reports. Details of any 
share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be 
included in Company mailings.

instructions at www.investorcentre.co.uk or should complete 
a dividend mandate form and return it to the Registrars;

offers shareholders a DRIP, whereby shareholders can use 
their cash dividend to buy further shares in the Company. 
Shareholders can apply online at www.investorcentre.co.uk or 
complete a mandate form and return it to the address shown 
above; and

Forward-looking statements 
Certain statements included in this Annual Report and 
Accounts are forward-looking and should be considered, 
amongst other statutory provisions, in light of the safe harbour 
provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than historical facts 
may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are 
therefore subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that 
could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied because they relate to future events. 
These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited 
to, statements relating to the Company’s expectations around 
the Company’s programme known as ‘Creating the Leader’  
and its associated eight steps. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of 
relevant terminology including the words: “believes”, 
“estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, 
“goal”, “target”, “aim”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “could” or 
“should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or 
comparable terminology and include all matters that are not 
historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout 
this Annual Report and Accounts and include statements 
regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations and 
those of our officers, directors and employees concerning, 
amongst other things, our results of operations, financial 
condition, changes in tax rates, liquidity, prospects, growth, 
strategies and the businesses we operate. 
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those estimated by the forward-looking statements include, 
but are not limited to, global economic business conditions, 
monetary and interest rate policies, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity and property prices, the impact of competition, 
inflation and deflation, changes to regulations, taxes and 
legislation, changes to consumer saving and spending  
habits; and our success in managing these factors. 
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, 
performance and results could differ materially from the  
plans, goals and expectations set out in our forward-looking 
statements. Reliance should not be placed on any forward-
looking statement. The forward-looking statements contained 
herein speak only as of the date of this Annual Report and the 
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any

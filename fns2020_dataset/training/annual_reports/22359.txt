Novel formulations
Our novel formulations for COPD are based 
on approved drugs. These formulations target 
underserved segments of the specialist 
moderate-to-severe COPD market, and we 
have completed initial technical assessments 
for both.
Duaklir

Duaklir

respiratory medicines in development 
for asthma and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 04 $24 billion
The respiratory market represents a $24 billion  
opportunity. It is predicted to undergo 
s ignifican t 	 change , 	 with 	 c ur r en t 	 pr oduc t s	
facing generic competition and new entrants 
taking an increasing market share, and the 
overall value growing modestly. We have the 
opportunity to exploit these dynamics with our 
direct substitutes in the near-term and novel 
formulations in the longer-term.
3rd
Approximately 15.7 million adults in the  
United States have been diagnosed 
with COPD and several million more are 
estimated to be undiagnosed. The disease is 
responsible for over 120,000 deaths per year 
in the US making it the country’s third leading 
cause of mortality.
GOLD
The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines 
now include long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist containing products (LAMAs), such 
as our Duaklir
®
 and Tudorza
®
, as preferred 
initial treatments for every group of COPD 
patient. This is a marked move from previous 
recommendations, supporting a shift to 
LAMA-based products.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 10 Phase II Approved Phase III / Substitute Marketed
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 11 Chairman’s statement
The past year, and in particular the last ten months, has 
been a period of great change with Circassia experiencing 
significant 	 challenges 	 as 	 w ell 	 as 	 major 	 oppor t unities. 	 While 	
disappointing phase III allergy results tested the Company’s 
resilience, I am pleased to report that swift action helped 
conserve shareholders’ funds, broaden the development 
portfolio and establish a transformational commercial 
collabor ation 	 with 	 Astr a Zeneca . 	 With 	 results 	 from 	 the	
Company’s house dust mite allergy study mirroring the earlier 
cat 	 allergy 	 phase 	 III 	 data , 	 the 	 Boar d 	 has 	 tak en 	 the 	 difficult 	
decision 	 to 	 cease 	 fur ther 	 in v estment 	 in 	 the 	 field 	 and 	 to 	 f ocus 	
Circassia ’ s 	 resources 	 on 	 its 	 respir ator y 	 por t f olio . 	 With 	 much	
progress made in a short period of time, the Company is now 
building 	 positiv e 	 moment um 	 across 	 its 	 wider 	 business.	
Robust strategy 
Since its establishment, Circassia’s strategy has focused on building  
a world-class specialty pharmaceutical business, directly 
commercialising its products in key markets and developing a broad 
and balanced portfolio. During 2015, the Company accelerated this 
strategy, acquiring a direct specialty sales capability in the US and 
Germany and broadening its pipeline to include a number of respiratory 
products. Following the allergy results in 2016, the Board revisited 
this strategy to ensure the Company continues to focus on building 
shareholder value. 
This strategic review considered multiple approaches, and ultimately 
c onc l ud ed 	 t h a t 	 C i r ca s s i a ’ s 	 s t r a t egy 	 c on t i n ued 	 t o 	 o ff er 	 t he 	 be s t 	 o p por t un it y	
to exploit the Company’s commercial infrastructure and pipeline assets. 
The Board considered options to accelerate self-sustainability and 
determined that expansion of the Company’s commercial capabilities 
w o u ld 	 o ff er 	 bo t h 	 r e v en ue 	 gr o w t h 	 o p por t un it i e s 	 and 	 a 	 s t r a t eg i c 	 p l a t f orm	
with which to attract third-party products. In parallel, out-licensing  
o ut - o f - f oc u s 	 p i pe l i ne 	 a s s e t s , 	 f oc u s i n g 	 R &D 	 e ff or t s 	 and 	 d rivi n g

Rapid action
Following the review, management acted quickly to implement this 
strategy, expanding the Company’s commercial presence, driving 
e ffic ienc ies 	 a cr o ss 	 the 	 or gani sa t ion , 	 c ur tai l ing 	 al ler gy 	 in v es tmen t 	 
and halting the development of out-of-focus products. The Company 
also added three novel formulations to its respiratory pipeline, initiated 
negotiations for the return of EU rights to its lead asthma treatment 
and established a transformational commercial collaboration with 
AstraZeneca. 
Following the setbacks of 2016, Circassia is 
looking forward with optimism as it builds its 
revenues and advances its pipeline of promising 
respiratory treatments 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 12 As 	 a 	 r es ult 	 o f 	 thi s 	 r apid 	 a c t ion , 	 C ir ca ss ia ’ s 	 s ignifican t ly 	 enhanced	
commercial capability was an important factor in attracting 
AstraZeneca as a valued partner. During 2016, the Company doubled 
its sales force in its largest market, the United States, and as part of its 
new commercial collaboration will double this team again by the end  
of July 2017 . In 2016, Circassia also launched a direct sales team in  
the UK and strengthened its commercial teams in Germany and China. 
In parallel, the Company’s market-leading NIOX
®
 asthma management 
products enjoyed robust sales growth and its pipeline now features 
additional chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments. 
Thes e 	 adv ances 	 w er e 	 complemen t ed 	 by 	 s ignifican t 	 e ffic ienc y 	 savings , 	
with the Company’s facilities costs set to decrease by approximately 
40% next year and headcount reduced outside the commercial team.
Leveraging infrastructure
With 	 it s 	 commer c ial 	 in fr a s tr uc tur e 	 no w 	 fi r mly 	 es tabl i shed , 	 C ir ca ss ia	
is well positioned to commercialise its in-house portfolio as well as 
third-party specialty products. The Company’s respiratory pipeline 
targets a large and growing market, and is well positioned to leverage 
Circassia’s commercial platform with specialist treatments exploiting 
its direct sales capabilities and substitute therapies that do not require 
s ignifican t 	 pr omo t ion 	 us ing 	 it s 	 d i s tri but ion , 	 s upply 	 chain 	 and 	 mar k e t	
access expertise. 
This commercial strategy was recently validated by the Company’s 
collaboration with AstraZeneca, in which Circassia will undertake 
the US promotion of COPD treatments Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
, once 
approved. With this transaction transforming Circassia into a world-
class specialty respiratory business, the Company is well positioned 
t o 	 a t tr a ct 	 fur ther 	 pr oduc t s 	 tha t 	 can 	 bene fit 	 fr om 	 it s 	 highly 	 f oc us ed	
commercial capabilities. 
Board changes
As well as the changes to the Company, Circassia’s Board has  
also evolved. During 2016, Paul Edick and Cathrin Petty retired  
as Non-Executive Directors, and as announced alongside the 
preliminary results Tim Corn and Charles Swingland have informed 
the Company that after serving for over 10 years they will retire at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Each of these Directors 
has provided invaluable counsel and strategic advice based on 
long-standing industry experience, and we thank them all for their 
contribution to the progress made by Circassia. Following the addition 
of two new independent Directors during 2015, the Board remains 
s tr ong , 	 with 	 fiv e 	 Non - E x ec ut iv e 	 and 	 thr ee 	 E x ec ut iv e 	 members .	 
The Board will continue to review its mix of skills and experience to 
ensure an optimal composition, both overall and of its Committees.
Positive outlook
Following the disappointment of the phase III allergy results in June 2016, 
Circassia has worked to refocus and broaden its business. After a period 
of consolidation and rebuilding, the Company is positioned for strong 
growth as it builds momentum in both its commercial and development 
portfolios. During the coming year, Circassia anticipates further progress 
with the Company capitalising on its asthma management products’ 
market-leading position, focused promotion of its partnered COPD 
treatment Tudorza
®
 and pursuit of opportunities to commercialise 
additional products through its specialty infrastructure. In addition, the 
Company plans to conclude discussions on the EU rights to its lead 
asthma treatment, expand its NIOX
®
 registrations in the US and Europe 
and prepare two new novel COPD formulations to enter the clinic. 
Following the setbacks of 2016, Circassia is looking forward with 
optimism as it builds its revenues and advances its pipeline of 
promising respiratory treatments. As a result, I believe the Company  
is increasingly well positioned to achieve its ambition of becoming  
a world-class, self-sustaining specialty pharmaceutical company.

The 	 pa s t 	 y ear 	 ha s 	 been 	 a 	 period 	 o f 	 s ignifican t 	 change , 	 with 	 the	
Company resolutely pursuing opportunities to extend its commercial 
reach, portfolio of marketed products and development pipeline 
following the disappointment of our allergy phase III results in the 
middle of 2016. The whole team responded highly professionally

on our respiratory portfolio and recently completing a transformational 
commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca. 
S ign ifica n t 	 co mmer cia l 	 p r o gr es s
Since the beginning of 2016 we have made good commercial 
progress, expanding our presence in key markets and growing  
sales of our NIOX
®
 products. Building a strong platform in the  
United States was crucial to attracting AstraZeneca as a commercial 
partner, and with the transaction now complete we are becoming 
increasingly positioned as a partner-of-choice for products requiring 
focused specialty commercial expertise. As part of our AstraZeneca 
collaboration we will further grow our US infrastructure, doubling our 
existing sale force to 200, supported by a strong team of marketing, 
operations, key accounts and managed market specialists.  
This infrastructure is a strategic asset that is rare outside  
‘big pharma’, and provides us with a platform for further growth. 
With the challenges of 2016 now behind us, 
we are focused on building a world-leading 
specialty pharmaceutical business, and are 
making progress towards this goal 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 16 Pipeline development
Despite the disappointment of our allergy results we have worked  
hard to build and broaden our pipeline. During the year we added 
three new COPD products to our portfolio, including a novel  
tiotropium formulation targeting direct substitution of the market 
leading long-acting muscarinic antagonist, Spiriva Handihaler
®
.  
We recently complemented these products as part of our  
transaction with AstraZeneca, which brought us the US  
commercial rights to the phase III COPD treatment Duaklir
®
. 
O pe r a t i ona l 	 e ffic i e n c y
In parallel with our commercial and pipeline expansion, we have 
taken robust measures to contain costs and conserve our resources. 
Following the receipt of our allergy phase III results we curtailed major 
e xpend itur e 	 in 	 the 	 field , 	 immed ia t ely 	 halt ing 	 our 	 gr a ss 	 and 	 r a gw eed	
allergy development programmes. We have now gone further, 
stopping our investment in allergy as we focus on our respiratory 
portfolio. In parallel, we closed our Solna and Chicago sites as well  
as one of our Oxford facilities, and rationalised our R&D and back 
o ffice 	 t eam s . 	 As 	 a 	 r es ult , 	 w e 	 r e tain 	 a 	 s tr ong 	 balance 	 shee t , 	 with 	 
a cash position of £1 17 .4 million, and remain fully funded to deliver  
on our strategy. 
Optimistic outlook
With the challenges of 2016 now behind us, we are focused  
on building a world-leading specialty pharmaceutical business,  
and are making progress towards this goal. We are working hard  
to rapidly expand our US sales force as we take over the promotion 
of Tudorza
®
 in this major market, and at the same time we look 
forward to completing preparations to move several of our respiratory 
pr oduc t s 	 in t o 	 the 	 c l inic . 	 In 	 the 	 coming 	 mon th s , 	 w e 	 hope 	 t o 	 fi nal i s e	
the commercial approach in Europe for our lead asthma treatment, 
Fliveo
®
, which is already approved in the UK, while also pursuing 
opportunities to out-license non-strategic products as we focus 
our development resources on our direct substitute and specialty 
respiratory products. With much progress made in a short period  
of time we are regaining ground, and consequently we face the  
future with optimism as we emerge from the challenges of 2016.

Marketing specialty products 
During 2016, we greatly strengthened our commercial presence 
to increase promotion of our NIOX

 products and build a strong 
infrastructure to act as a strategic growth platform. In the second 
half of the year, we doubled our US sales team, launched our direct 
sales force in the UK and strengthened our capabilities in Germany 
and China. This investment is now delivering results, with our NIOX

Experience programme performing well
Our NIOX VERO

 experience programme continues to make 
good progress. During 2016, our US team continued to roll out the 
initiative placing approximately 900 devices in specialist clinics, over 
three times the 2015 level, providing physicians the opportunity to 
experience NIOX

 in practise. Of the programme participants, the 
majority subsequently acquired a new NIOX

New US pricing model
Circassia’s US commercial team recently completed an economic 
analysis of potential NIOX

 pricing models, and in 2017 rolled out 
a new approach designed to encourage greater use. To measure 
patients’ FeNO, clinicians require both a NIOX

 device and pre-
pr ogr ammed 	 r epla ceable 	 t es t 	 s en s or , 	 which 	 ar e 	 av ai lable 	 f or 	 a 	 fix ed

 by separating 
the cost of the device and the sensors, compared with a bundled 
price previously. As a result, the new pricing aims to increase  
the commercial returns for customers while boosting margins  
for the Company. 
Distributor improvement plan
In addition to our direct sales capabilities, we sell our NIOX
®
 products 
through a network of distributors in approximately 35 further countries 
around the world. During the second half of 2016, we recruited an 
experienced Distributor Management Director to manage and improve 
these partnerships, and conducted a detailed performance review  
of our distribution network. We are currently further strengthening  
our distribution management team, and are working with distributors  
in the EU and other key territories to ensure transparency on local sales 
and marketing activities and to provide regular performance updates. 
During 2016 we terminated our distribution agreements in France 
and Italy due to poor performance. We have now assessed a range 
o f 	 oppor tunit ies 	 t o 	 boo s t 	 our 	 pr es ence 	 in 	 thes e 	 po t en t ial ly 	 s ignifican t

the current number within two years. Under the initial collaboration, we 
plan to immediately double our US sales team to promote the COPD 
product Tudorza

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 24 Robust commercialisation plan
The US COPD market represents a major opportunity, with 2016  
sales estimated at more than $5 billion. The disease’s prevalence  
is expected to grow, and approximately 15.7 million Americans 
currently have diagnosed COPD, with several million more 
undiagnosed. As a result, COPD is responsible for over 120,000 
deaths per year, making it the third leading cause of death in the 
United States.
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), 
which comprises a number of leading agencies, including the US 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and National Institutes  
of Health, has recently released its 2017 treatment guidelines.  
These support a move away from ICS / LABA products for 
many COPD patients and LAMA-containing products are now 
recommended as preferred initial treatments for every patient group.

Commercial growth platform
Prior to establishing our AstraZeneca collaboration we greatly 
strengthened our commercial capabilities to boost NIOX
®
 revenues 
and build an attractive platform for third-party products. In the 
third quarter of 2016, we doubled the size of our US sales force to 
approximately 100, targeting over 7 ,000 key specialist and primary  
care physicians. We also built a US managed markets team to focus 
on major healthcare systems and extend NIOX
®
 reimbursement 
coverage. Recent successes have increased coverage to an additional 
2 . 8 	 mi l l ion 	 American s 	 in 	 the 	 fi rs t 	 q uar t er 	 o f 	 2 0 1 7 	 and 	 w e 	 an t ic i pa t e	
further advances in the coming months. Additionally, our US key 
accounts team is targeting over 160 large customers with a particular 
focus on healthcare systems, integrated delivery networks, multi-site 
practises and federal organisations where penetration is currently low. 
This investment is now beginning to deliver, and in Q1 2017 US clinical 
sales grew over 50% compared with the same period in 2016,  
with March representing the team’s best monthly performance. 
Alongside this growth in the US, we established a direct presence  
in the UK, launching our new sales force at the end of 2016. The team 
is actively targeting both healthcare commissioners and specialist 
ph y s ic ian s , 	 and 	 in 	 the 	 fi rs t 	 q uar t er 	 o f 	 2 0 1 7 	 sales 	 incr ea s ed 	 by	
approximately 15% compared with our revenues in the same period 
the prior year. In China, we also strengthened our commercial team 
during 2016 with the addition of medical and market access expertise 
to support the promotional activities of our distribution partners, and 
during the year revenues grew by approximately 70% in this important 
NIOX

 market. 
In addition to our sales team expansion, we are strengthening our 
commer c ial 	 oper a t ion s 	 t o 	 s uppor t 	 field - ba s ed 	 a c t ivit ies . 	 W e 	 hav e	
recently recruited an experienced head of global marketing and

Allergy portfolio
Allergy investment curtailed
During 2016, Circassia received unexpected and highly disappointing 
phase III results from its lead allergy product. Subsequent analysis  
and expert review concluded that the study’s design and conduct  
were robust and there were no major confounding factors. As a result, 
the Company minimised expenditure on its broader allergy portfolio, 
halting development activities for its grass and ragweed allergy products. 
As ongoing house dust mite and birch allergy studies were well 
advanced, and required only limited further investment, these continued. 
During the summer, the Company received results from the birch allergy 
study, which were encouraging, although this was an early-stage,  
smal l - s cale 	 ( n=64 ) 	 tri al 	 with 	 l i m it ed 	 e ffi ca c y 	 end poi n t s .

 — The Company completed a review of its facilities and consolidated 
operations onto single sites in the United States and Sweden 
where previously we operated out of two locations. We have now 
closed our Chicago and Solna sites and transferred operations to 
our facilities in Morrisville, North Carolina and Uppsala respectively. 
In addition, we have downsized our activities in Oxford, vacating 
one of our previous premises. As a result, we anticipate cutting 
future facilities costs by approximately 40%.

device team to drive the development of our inhaled products and 
next generation NIOX

 device, our R&D headcount remains 20% 
lower than at the end of H1 2016, and following the decision to halt 
investment in our allergy portfolio we intend to conduct a further 
review of future requirements. 
Summary and outlook
The past year has been a period of challenges and major 
opportunities for Circassia. Our market-leading asthma management 
products continue to grow strongly and our respiratory portfolio 
is advancing. We also established a transformational commercial 
collaboration with AstraZeneca that leverages and expands our US 
infrastructure and brings new products to the Company. However, 
this progress was tempered by disappointing allergy data. Following 
these results we moved quickly to conserve resources, expand our 
commercial footprint and broaden our respiratory pipeline with the 
addition of several new products. 
During the coming months we intend to build on this progress.  
We plan to rapidly expand our US sales force to promote Tudorza
®
 
and increase sales of our NIOX
®
 products. With a growing specialty 
commercial presence in key markets, we are becoming increasingly 
well placed to attract further products, and we hope to exploit this 
opportunity in the coming year. 
We also anticipate extending our NIOX VERO

 usage in the US and 
E ur ope 	 ba s ed 	 on 	 our 	 s uccess ful 	 c l inical 	 s tud ies 	 and 	 r ecen t 	 fi l ing 	 in

£13.8 million was incurred in H1 2016 and £5.3 million in H2 2016. 
Of the total costs of £7 .7 million (2015: £14.2 million) in respect of the 
house dust mite allergy programme, £2.2 million was incurred in H2 
2016 on TH005. The total spend on the cat allergy programme was 
£5.5 million (2015: £9.8 million), of which £2.0 million was incurred 
in H2 mainly in respect of drug product and stability programmes, 
committed costs of the cat phase III study (CP007) and the two year 
follow-up study (CP007A). In H1 2016, the grass allergy programme

in the year, however the majority of activities were stopped after the  
cat allergy results.
Investment in the respiratory portfolio mainly relates to the Seretide

 / 
Advair

 pMDI substitute development programme and the tiotropium 
bromide product targeting direct substitution of Spiriva

 DPI.
In addition, a charge of £3.9 million has been recorded as non-
underlying research and development expenditure. Of this, £2.4 million 
relates to a contract provision for the manufacture of trial batches  
for allergy programmes, £1.2 million in redundancy costs and closure 
of the site in Solna and an impairment of £0.3 million for allergy licences 
and patents following the cat allergy results.

Included in this is bank interest income of £0.9 million (2015: £1.7 million) 
and a net gain on foreign exchange of £5.2 million (2015: £1.8 million). 
The foreign exchange gain arose as a result of sterling weakening 
during the year against the US dollar and Swedish krona.
R&D tax credits on qualifying expenditure
Taxation for the year was £7 .5 million credit (2015: £12.8 million credit). 
Included within this is a tax credit of £8.6 million (2015: 10.3 million) 
recoverable under current legislation relating to R&D expenditure.

to the owners of Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc. Basic loss per share 
attributable to the owners of Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc was  
48p (2015: 20p). This includes impairment charges and other  
non-underlying items of £80.0 million. Excluding these costs,  
the loss per share for the underlying operations was 20p (2015: 20p). 
Stat ement 	 o f 	 financial 	 position 	
The Group’s net assets were £280.7 million at 31 December 2016 
(2015: £409.7 million). The decrease includes impairment charges 
of £74.5 million and £0.3 million to goodwill and intangible assets 
respectively as well as reduction in cash. Further detail on the 
impairment charges can be found in notes 14 and 15. Other factors 
are commented on below.
The weakening of pound sterling against the US dollar and  
Swedish krona resulted in a credit of £9.8 million to Other 
Comprehensive Income and Expense due to retranslation  
of the Group’s overseas operations.
Current liabilities were £21.5 million (2015: £48.3 million). The 
decrease is mainly due to the payment in January 2016 of contingent 
consideration of £30.0 million for the purchase of Prosonix. This

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 35 Risks and risk management
The management of risks is a key responsibility of the Board 
o f 	 Director s 	 o f 	 the 	 Compan y . 	 The 	 Boar d 	 ensures 	 that 	 the 	 risk s	
taken by the Group are understood, and are appropriate  
in 	 the 	 light 	 o f 	 its 	 str at egy 	 and 	 objectiv es, 	 and 	 that 	 int er nal	
controls 	 are 	 in 	 place 	 to 	 eff ectiv ely 	 identif y , 	 assess, 	 and	
manage 	 impor tant 	 risk s.
The risk management strategy adopted by the Company has a 
number of facets. A risk register has been created and is updated  
on an annual basis by those individuals in the business who manage 
ri sk s 	 on 	 a 	 da y 	 t o 	 da y 	 ba s i s . 	 Thi s 	 iden t ifies 	 ea ch 	 ri sk , 	 a ss ess es 	 the	
likelihood of its occurrence and the level of impact on the business. 
Thi s 	 pr ocess 	 i s 	 coor d ina t ed 	 by 	 the 	 Chie f 	 Financ ial 	 Officer . 	 The 	 r egi s t er 	
is reviewed by the Senior Management Team and subsequently 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and reported to the Board. 
There is a particular emphasis on ensuring that the risk appetite  
of the Board is fully understood by the Senior Management Team. 
The register also sets out activities and controls which are designed 
t o 	 mit iga t e 	 the 	 iden t ified 	 ri sk s , 	 and 	 a gain 	 the 	 Boar d 	 and 	 the 	 Senior	
Management Team analyse these mitigation strategies and ensure 
that the approach taken is consistent with the nature and degree 
of risks which are considered acceptable by the Board. Aside 
from the review, risk owners across the business are responsible 
f or 	 r epor t ing 	 an y 	 s ignifican t 	 i ss ues 	 on 	 an 	 ongoing 	 ba s i s 	 up 	 t o 	 the	
Senior Management Team and for ensuring that other members of 
their teams are aware of the risk management process. The Senior 
Management Team, which meets weekly, receives summary weekly 
updates and more detailed monthly reports from all areas of the 
business, and updates the Board on a timely basis where important 
developments occur. Within the R&D function, project team meetings 
take place once a month at which the progress and risks of each 
individual project are discussed and detailed reports are circulated. 
The Quality Team, Compliance Committee, and Health and Safety 
Committee also meet regularly. These discussions are documented  
in reports which are circulated to the Senior Management Team.
The risk management system is designed to manage risks, rather 
than eliminate them at the expense of achieving corporate objectives. 
Accordingly, it can only provide a reasonable and not an absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.

that, following the acquisition of Aerocrine AB, the Group began selling 
medical device products in the US, Europe, and Asia. This led to the 
inclusion of compliance with healthcare regulations as a new category 
of principal risk in the 2015 Annual report and this focus has continued 
throughout 2016 and will become even more prominent in 2017 
following the commencement of the collaboration with AstraZeneca

With regard to its NIOX

 franchise, the Group continues to apply 
increasing resources to sales of the device. By the end of 2016  
there were approximately 100 sales representatives selling NIOX
®
  
in the United States, representing approximately a fourfold increase  
in the course of the year. A direct sales team has also been 
assembled in the UK, alongside the existing commercial teams 
in China and Germany. Distributor markets are now more closely 
managed following the appointment of an experienced Director  
of Distributor Management.

A joint steering committee oversees this project.
Compliance with healthcare regulations
The Group must comply with complex regulations in relation  
to the marketing of its device products (and in the future will need  
to comply with such regulations in relation to its drug products).  
These regulations are strictly enforced. Failure by the Group  
(or its commercial partners) to comply with the US False Claims Act, 
Anti- Kickback Statute and the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act 
and regulations relating to data privacy (amongst others) and similar 
legislation in countries outside the US may result in criminal and  
civil proceedings against the Group.
Mitigating activities
The Group has an internal Compliance function which is head by  
it s 	 VP , 	 Global 	 Compl iance 	 Officer . 	 T he 	 Global 	 Compl iance 	 Officer 	
reports to the General Counsel but also has a direct reporting line to  
the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. A Compliance Committee 
has been formed to oversee activities in this area and this met 
throughout 2016 on a quarterly basis. The Compliance function works 
with a network of external advisers in the relevant territories to ensure 
the local regulations are comprehended and that strategies are in  
place to support products in development as well as those already 
approved and sold. Robust processes are in place to ensure that  
sales compliance requirements are met and any failures or allegations 
of failure are swiftly investigated. This includes training of employees, 
ride-alongs with sales representatives, due diligence on distributors  
and suppliers prior to contracting with them, and audits of distributors 
and suppliers.

Regulatory approvals
The Group may not obtain regulatory approval for those of its 
products which are in development. Even where products are 
appr o v ed , 	 s ubs eq uen t 	 r egula t or y 	 d iffic ult ies 	 ma y 	 ari s e , 	 or 	 the 	
conditions relating to the approval may be more onerous or restrictive 
than the Group expects, or existing approvals might be withdrawn.
The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Regulatory authorities 
across the world enforce a range of laws and regulations which 
govern the testing, approval, manufacturing, labelling and marketing 
of pharmaceutical products. Stringent standards are imposed which 
r ela t e 	 t o 	 the 	 q ual it y , 	 sa f e t y 	 and 	 e ffica c y 	 o f 	 thes e 	 pr oduc t s . 	 Thes e 	
requirements are a major determinant of whether it is commercially 
feasible to develop a drug substance or medical device given the 
time, expertise, and expense which must be invested. Moreover, 
appr o v al 	 in 	 one 	 t er rit or y 	 o ff ers 	 no 	 guar an t ee 	 tha t 	 r egula t or y 	 appr o v al 	
will be obtained in any other territory.
In order to obtain regulatory approval for the Group’s products,  
it will be necessary to successfully complete supporting clinical 
studies. Clinical studies are typically expensive, complex and  
time-consuming, and have uncertain outcomes. Conditions in which 
c l inical 	 s tud ies 	 ar e 	 conduc t ed 	 d iff er , 	 and 	 r es ult s 	 a chie v ed 	 in 	 one 	 s e t

The Group already holds regulatory approvals for its NIOX MINO
®
  
and NIOX VERO
®
 devices in certain key countries such as the  
United States, Japan, China, and Germany but approvals are  
still pending for the VERO
®
 in a number of other countries.  
Delays or complications in any of these regulatory applications  
could 	 adv ers ely 	 a ff ec t 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s 	 bus iness .
The Group also has an exclusive licence to commercialise Duaklir
®
 in 
the United States. This product is not yet approved, and is undergoing 
two clinical trials (AMPLIFY and ACHIEVE), both managed by 
As tr a Z eneca , 	 in 	 or der 	 t o 	 s uppor t 	 a 	 fi l ing 	 f or 	 a 	 Ne w 	 Dr ug 	 Appl ica t ion	
to the FDA. The results of AMPLIFY are expected in H2 2017 and 
the results of ACHIEVE are expected in H1 2017 . If either or both of 
these studies fail to achieve their endpoints then there is a risk that the 
product might not be approved by the FDA.
Also, the product Tudorza
®
 which will be promoted by the Group  
in 2017 as part of its collaboration with AstraZeneca is currently  
the subject of a cardiovascular safety study (ASCENT), managed  
by AstraZeneca, the results of which are anticipated before the  
end of 2017 . If the ASCENT study shows that there is a safety signal 
associated with Tudorza
®
 then that would lead to discussions with the 
FDA, one possible outcome of which could be that the product would 
require a black box warning or even be withdrawn from the market.
The Group is currently carrying out clinical trials for a number  
of respiratory products. The lead respiratory programmes seek  
to develop substitutes for Seretide
®
 and Spiriva
®
. However, there  
can be no guarantee that these trials will meet their endpoints  
or that the products will ultimately be approved. 
The Group relies on third party sub-contractors and service providers 
for the execution of most aspects of its development programmes. 
Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality 
within acceptable timeframes – for example due to technical reasons 
or bankruptcy of the provider – may cause the failure or delay of these 
development programmes.
Even where approval is obtained, regulatory authorities may still impose 
s i gn ifi can t 	 r e s t ric t ion s 	 on 	 t he 	 i nd ica t ed 	 us e s 	 or 	 m ark e t i ng 	 o f 	 a 	 pr od uc t	
or impose costly, ongoing requirements for post-marketing surveillance 
or post-approval studies, or may even withdraw the approval if new 
concern s 	 o v er 	 sa f e t y 	 and 	 e ffi ca c y 	 ari s e .
Mitigating activities
The Group manages its regulatory risk by employing highly 
e xperienced 	 c l inical 	 mana gers 	 and 	 r egula t or y 	 a ff airs 	 pr o f ess ional s 	
who, where appropriate, will commission advice from external  
advisers and consult with the regulatory authorities on the design  
of the Group’s pre-clinical and clinical programmes. These in-house 
experts ensure that high quality protocols and other documentation 
are submitted during the regulatory process, and that well-reputed 
contract research organisations with global capabilities are retained 
to manage the trials. The clinical studies which are taking place with 
Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
 are being managed by AstraZeneca which  
is a global leader in the development of respiratory drugs.

AstraZeneca will administer the global safety database for Tudorza

Supply Chain
The Group relies on third parties for the supply of key materials and 
services. Problems at these contractors, such as technical issues, 
contamination, and regulatory actions may lead to delays or even loss 
of supply or inadequate supply of these materials and services either 
prior to launch or thereafter. Some materials may only be available 
from one source, as is currently the case for the NIOX MINO
®
 and 
NIOX VERO
®
 devices and the sensors contained in those devices, 
and regulatory requirements may make substitution costly and  
time-consuming.
The supply chain for Tudorza
®
 will continue to be controlled by 
AstraZeneca at least until the Group is able to exercise its option  
to acquire the full rights to the product and AstraZeneca will remain  
the sole source of supply for this product and for Duaklir
®
 if approved.
Mitigating activities
Audits of sub-contractors are routinely conducted according to 
procedures set out in the Group’s Quality system. Dual sourcing 
is being investigated where this is practicable. Manufacturing sites 
are well established FDA-approved facilities. AstraZeneca has an 
established global supply chain in place for Tudorza
®
 and at the  
point when the Group is able to acquire the full rights to the product  
an arms’-length supply agreement will be in place.

of respiratory products. This would have a material impact on the  
long-term success of the business. Failure of programmes could 
result from lack of internal resources or capabilities, or from not 
obtaining the desired pre-clinical and clinical results.
In addition, the Group is dependent upon external collaborators  
for the development of its NIOX
®
 devices. The Group relies upon its 
collaborations with Panasonic Healthcare Co., Ltd for the development 
of the devices themselves and upon IT Dr. Gambert GmbH for the 
development of the sensors contained in those devices.
Research and Development activities associated with Tudorza
®
  
and Duaklir
®
 will continue to be led by AstraZeneca, although the 
Group will have input through the steering committees which have 
been formed to govern the collaboration.
Mitigating activities
The Group has recruited highly experienced R&D executives.  
Projects are closely monitored against goals and regularly reported  
to the Senior Management Team and the Board, and external 
resources are retained where this is deemed appropriate.  
The development collaborations with Panasonic and AstraZeneca 
are managed by steering committees which include representatives 
from the Group. In addition, the Group will seek, through business 
development activity, to identify opportunities which would expand 
and diversify its portfolio.
Intellectual property, know how, and trade secrets
The Group may be subject to challenges relating to the validity  
of its patents. If these challenges are successful then the Group 
 may be exposed to generic competition. Currently there is an 
opposition pending against a patent owned by the Group namely  
a process patent in its particle engineering portfolio (the ‘SAX’ patent). 
This patent does not cover products which are currently marketed  
or which the Group expects to market in the near future.
The Group could also be sued for infringement of third party  
patent rights. If these actions are successful then it would have  
to pay substantial damages and potentially remove its products from 
the 	 mar k e t . 	 Such 	 l it iga t ion , 	 par t ic ularly 	 in 	 the 	 U S , 	 in v olv es 	 s ignifican t

It is possible that the Group will not be able to secure intellectual 
pr oper t y 	 pr o t ec t ion , 	 or 	 s uffic ien t 	 pr o t ec t ion , 	 in 	 r ela t ion 	 t o 	 pr oduc t s 	
which are acquired or in development. Similarly, a failure by the Group 
to maintain or renew key patents would lead to the loss of such 
protection. In both cases the potential of the Group to earn revenue 
fr om 	 it s 	 pr oduc t s 	 could 	 be 	 compr omi s ed 	 a s 	 it 	 w ould 	 be 	 less 	 d iffic ult 	
for third parties to copy the products.
The Group may rely upon know how and trade secrets to protect 
its products and maintain a competitive advantage. This may be 
especially important where patent protection is limited or lacking. 
Conversely, the Group may be subject to claims that its employees  
or 	 a gen t s 	 hav e 	 wr ongful ly 	 us ed 	 or 	 d i s c lo s ed 	 the 	 con fiden t ial	
information of third parties which could lead to damages  
or 	 i n j unc t ion s 	 wh ich 	 a ff ec t 	 p ar t ic u l ar 	 pr od uc t s .
The Group licenses certain intellectual property rights from third 
parties. The rights which are licensed to the Group as part of the 
collaboration with AstraZeneca relating to Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
  
fall within this category. If the Group fails to comply with its obligations 
under these licence agreements it may enable the other party  
to terminate the agreement. This could impair the Group’s freedom  
to operate and potentially lead to third parties preventing it from  
selling certain of its products.

Organisational capabilities and capacity
The Group may be unable to successfully implement its plans for 
growth if it does not attract and retain employees with the requisite 
capabilities and experience, in appropriate numbers. The Group 
depends on the skills and experience of its current management  
team and employees, and is generally subject to competition for,  
and may fail to retain, skilled personnel.
Existing employees, investigators, consultants and commercial 
partners may engage in misconduct or improper activities, including 
non-compliance with regulatory standards and laws.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 40 Brexit
At the referendum which was held on 23 June 2016, the UK voted 
to leave the EU. The Group faces a range of risks associated with 
this decision. For example, the vote to leave the EU may lead to 
changes in the regulatory system by which medical devices and 
pharmaceutical products are approved for use. The Group’s NIOX
®
 
product is currently CE marked in accordance with European 
regulations and it is possible that this registration will need to be 
changed in some way once the UK has left the EU, to permit sales 
of the device to continue across Europe. The Group will also seek 
marketing authorisations in respect of its respiratory pipeline products 
in the future, and the optimal regulatory pathway for the approval  
of these products after Brexit cannot yet be determined.
Brexit may also result in restrictions on the movement of people  
which make it harder for the Group to attract the talent it needs to 
support the business. The general economic uncertainty created 
by the process may also make it harder to enter into strategic 
partnerships with European companies.

The Group continues to monitor developments relating to Brexit and 
receives updates from its legal and regulatory advisers on a frequent 
basis. The Group does already have an established subsidiary in 
Sweden (Circassia AB) and Germany (Circassia AG) and so will  
still have a corporate presence in the EU even after Brexit comes

the actions described above under the Financial Operations risk.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three 
year period to 31 December 2019, taking account of the Group’s 
c ur r en t 	 po s it ion 	 and 	 the 	 po t en t ial 	 impa c t 	 o f 	 the 	 princ i pal 	 ri sk s 	 iden t ified	
above. Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to  
31 December 2019.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered the 
robustness of the Group, taking account of its current position, 
potential future developments, the principal risks facing it, and the 
e ff ec t iv eness 	 o f 	 m it iga t ion 	 plan s 	 and 	 con tr ol s . 	 Their 	 a ss essmen t 	 ha s 	
encompa ss ed 	 the 	 po t en t ial 	 impa c t 	 o f 	 s ignifican t 	 cr ed i ble 	 s cenario s	 
on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity 
over the period to 31 December 2019.
The Directors have determined that a three year period  
is the appropriate length of time over which to provide its viability 
s ta t emen t . 	 The 	 Boar d 	 fi rs t 	 con s iders 	 annual ly , 	 and 	 on 	 a 	 r ol l ing 	 ba s i s ,	 
a detailed annual budget and 10 year plan for the Group and then 
uses the output from that review to inform its viability statement. For 
the purposes of the viability statement, the Board’s review is limited  
to three years given the nature of the business and uncertainty.  
This is built from the bottom up and is stress tested for the following 
key scenarios:
 — Reasonable delays in key product launches 
 — Reasonable reductions in sales growth targets in combination  
with the above
In each case, the mitigating actions were robust enough  
to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the Group through  
to at least 31 December 2019.
The Group’s annual budget and 10 year plan was approved  
by the Board at its December 2016 meeting.
In addition, after the year end, the Board considered a 10 year plan  
for the Group which included the collaboration with AstraZeneca.  
This was built from the bottom up and stress tested for each of the 
above scenarios. In each case, the mitigating actions were robust 
enough to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the Group through  
to at least 31 December 2019 which is the period to which the 
Board’s review is limited for the purpose of the viability statement.
The collaboration agreement includes terms for the payment  
of deferred consideration of $100 million which will fall due by  
30 June 2019 at the latest. In the event that the Group is unable  
t o 	 r ai s e 	 s uffic ien t 	 fund ing 	 t o 	 mee t 	 thi s 	 obl iga t ion , 	 a 	 v endor 	 loan

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 43 Corporate governance 
Dear Shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s Corporate 
governance report for the year ended 31 December 2016. It 
describes how the Board and its Committees apply the principles of 
good corporate governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”).
High standards of corporate governance are fundamental to our 
business and are implemented and supported through appropriate 
internal policies and procedures. The responsibility for ensuring this 
framework is effective lies with the Board, and we are constantly 
striving to improve standards while building a successful company.
One area on which the Board has focused in particular since Listing 
relates to its composition. As we explained at the time of Listing, 
the Board believes that at this critical point in its development the 
Group benefits from the knowledge and experience of the full range 
of its Non-Executive Directors but has been looking to increase 
the proportion of Independent Non-Executive Directors who sit 
on the Board. Accordingly, in the course of 2015 the Board was 
strengthened by the appointment of Ms Lota Zoth and Mr Marvin 
Samson who are both Independent Non-Executive Directors.
There were two additional changes to the Board during 2016.  
Mr Paul Edick, who served as a Non-Executive Director since  
3 April 2013 did not seek re-election at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 18 May 2016 and, following her appointment  
as Head of European Healthcare at CVC Capital Partners, Ms Cathrin 
Petty also stepped down from the Board on 16 December 2016. We 
are very grateful to Paul and Cathrin for their significant contributions.
Since the end of the year, two of our other long-serving Non-Executive 
Directors, Mr Charles Swingland and Dr Tim Corn have announced 
that they do not intend to stand for re-election at the Company’s  
2017 Annual General Meeting.
Maintaining good communication with our Shareholders is extremely 
important to us. During the year, Steven Harris, our CEO has held 
a number of meetings with investors and current shareholders, and 
presented at several conferences which were attended by existing 
and potential Shareholders. Communications with Shareholders are 
coordinated by the Head of Corporate Communications, who reports 
directly to the CEO.
Dr Francesco Granata
Chairman
Corporate governance report
Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) sets out the 
principles of good practice in relation to corporate governance which 
should be followed by companies with a listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”) and the most recent edition (September 2014) can be found 
on their website (www.frc.org.uk).
The principles of the Code are divided into five sections. Each section 
sets out the main principles relating to Leadership; Effectiveness; 
Accountability; Remuneration; and Relations with Shareholders.
This report explains how Circassia has applied these principles.
Until September 2016, Circassia was included in the FTSE 350, 
however, following the fall in its share price after the disappointing  
cat allergy results in June 2016, this was no longer the case. The 
Code requires that at least half the Board of FTSE 350 companies 
should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. A smaller 
company, which is defined in the Code as one that is below the FTSE 
350 throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting year, should 
have at least two independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Directors support high standards of corporate governance. 
However, as is explained below, the Company has not complied with 
the recommendations of the Code that at least half the Board should 
comprise independent Non-Executive Directors.
At the beginning of 2016, the Board consisted of twelve members, 
the Chairman (who was independent on appointment), three 
Executive Directors, and eight Non-Executive Directors. Of the eight 
Non-Executive Directors, three were considered by the Board to 
be independent, namely Lota Zoth, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud and 
Marvin Samson. The independence ratio of the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) was therefore 27% at the beginning of the year, but by the 
end of the year, following the departures of Paul Edick and Cathrin 
Petty, it had risen to 33%.
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud had participated in the Company’s 
unapproved share option scheme before the Initial Public Offering  
of the Company in 2014. However, this scheme is unrelated to 
performance, such participation was historic, and no further share 
options will be granted to him. For this reason, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud 
is considered to be independent. In addition, Dr Garaud will exercise his 
options following announcement of the Preliminary Results. 
Charles Swingland and Dr Tim Corn who are not considered to be 
independent, will not seek re-election to the Board at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting. 
Immediately following the 2017 Annual General Meeting, the Board  
will therefore consist of eight members. These are the Chairman  
(who was independent on appointment), three Executive Directors, 
and four Non-Executive Directors. Of the four Non-Executive 
Directors, three are considered by the Board to be independent, 
namely Lota Zoth, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud and Marvin Samson. 
The independence ratio of the Board (excluding the Chairman) will 
therefore increase to 43% and the Board will meet the requirement 
that a FTSE Small Cap company should have at least two 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board believes that at this point in the Group’s development  
it is important that it has access to the expertise and knowledge  
of its remaining non-independent Non-Executive Director. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 44 The composition of the three Board Committees throughout the year 
and the extent to which their composition complied with the provisions 
of the Code, was as follows:
 — Nomination Committee
  The Code requires that a majority of the members of the 
Committee should be Independent Non-Executive Directors  
and the Committee should be chaired by the Chairman  
or an Independent Non-Executive Director. Throughout  
the year, the Committee was composed of the following members:
  Dr Francesco Granata (Chairman and Chair of the Committee); 
Dr Tim Corn, and Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud. As Dr Jean Jacques 
Garaud was the only Independent Non-Executive Director, one 
third of the Committee was therefore made up of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, although the Chairman was independent 
upon appointment. The composition of the Nomination Committee 
therefore did not comply fully with the recommendations of the Code.
  As Dr Tim Corn will not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting, his membership of the Nomination Committee will be 
replaced by an existing Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Therefore the Nomination Committee is expected to become fully 
compliant with the recommendations of the Code during 2017 . 
 — Remuneration Committee
  The Code requires that the Committee should comprise  
a minimum of three Directors, all of whom should be independent. 
For the period from 1 January 2016 until 9 February 2016,  
the Committee members were: Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud  
(Chair of the Committee); Dr Tim Corn and Ms Lota Zoth.  
On 9 February 2016 Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud stepped down  
as Chair of the Committee and was replaced by Mr Marvin 
Samson. Lota Zoth, Dr Jean Jacques Garaud and Marvin Samson 
were considered to be independent, however Dr Tim Corn was not 
considered independent. Therefore, from 1 January 2016 until the 
end of the year and up to the date of this report, the Committee 
did not comply with the membership requirements of the Code 
insofar as they relate to independence.
  As Dr Tim Corn will not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting, his membership of the Remuneration Committee 
will be replaced by an existing Independent Non-Executive 
Director. Therefore the Remuneration Committee is expected 
to become fully compliant with the recommendations of the 
Code, as they apply to FTSE 350 companies, during 2017 . The 
Remuneration Committee does currently comply with the smaller 
company requirement that it consist of at least two independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
 — Audit and Risk Committee
  The Code requires that the Committee should comprise  
a minimum of three Directors, all of whom should be independent. 
For the period from 1 January 2016 up to the date of this report, 
the Committee was made up of three members: Ms Lota Zoth 
(Chair of the Committee); Dr Tim Corn; and Dr Jean-Jacques 
Garaud. Lota Zoth and Dr Jean Jacques Garaud are considered 
independent, however Dr Tim Corn was not considered 
independent Therefore, from 1 January 2016 until the end of the 
year and up to the date of this report, the membership of the 
Audit and Risk Committee did not comply with the membership 
requirements of the Code insofar as they relate to independence.
  As Dr Tim Corn will not seek re-election at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting, his membership of the Audit and Risk Committee will be 
replaced by an Independent Non-Executive Director. Therefore the 
Audit and Risk Committee is expected to become fully compliant 
with the recommendations of the Code, as they apply to FTSE 
350 companies, during 2017 . The Audit and Risk Committee does 
currently comply with the smaller company requirement that it 
consist of at least two independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board confirms that in all other respects, the Group has fully 
complied with the principles of the Code throughout the year to  
31 December 2016 and up to the date of this report. Details of 
Directors’ remuneration, as required by the Code and Part 4 to 
Schedule 8 of the Large- and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, are set out  
in the Remuneration Committee report.
The Group’s Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , is required to 
review whether this Corporate governance statement properly reflects 
the Group’s compliance with certain provisions of the Code and to 
report any non-compliance. The Group confirms that no report of 
non-compliance has been made other than in respect of the matters 
identified above in relation to Board composition.
Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the leadership and long-term success 
of the business. It has a schedule of matters which are reserved for 
its review. These include the review and approval of strategic plans, 
financial statements and budgets, financing, acquisitions  
and disposals, major capital expenditure, dividend policy, making  
key risk decisions, monitoring risks and compliance, monitoring health, 
safety and environmental performance, and Executive remuneration 
and appointments.
At each meeting, the Board assesses the progress of the Group when 
measured against its objectives, particularly those which relate to its 
clinical trials programmes, and reviews financial performance against 
the budget.
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is currently composed of the Chairman, three Executive 
Directors, and six Non-Executive Directors. The biographies of the current 
members of the Board are set out on pages 42 to 43 of this report.
The Executive Directors have direct responsibility for the business 
operations of the Company. The Non-Executive Directors, by virtue  
of their wide range of industry experience and skills, bring an informed 
view to the decision making process.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
delineated. This division of responsibilities has been set out in writing 
and approved by the Board.
Chairman
Dr Francesco Granata, Chairman, is responsible for the leadership  
of the Board and its effectiveness by ensuring that:
 — the agenda for meetings is appropriate, and the Board is provided 
with the information it needs for high quality decision making  
in a timely fashion;
 — the Board plays a full and constructive role in shaping the strategy 
of the Group;
 — the Board environment is productive and utilises the skills and 
experience of all members;
 — the Board complies with the appropriate standards of corporate 
governance;
 — the Committees are properly structured and resourced;
 — the performance of the Board, its Committees, and individual 
Directors are evaluated each year; and
 — there is effective communication with Shareholders.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met in the absence 
of the Executive Directors at the end of each Board meeting which 
occurred in 2016.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 45 Corporate governance continued
Chief Executive Officer
Steven Harris, Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the day to 
day management of the Group and for implementing the strategy 
which has been reviewed and approved by the Board. He is also 
responsible for ensuring effective communication with Shareholders, 
brokers, and analysts.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud has been Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director since 21 February 2014. He works closely with 
the Chairman to resolve any significant issues which may arise and is 
responsible for the annual evaluation of the Chairman’s performance, 
for leading the other Non-Executive Directors in their oversight of the 
Chairman, and for ensuring there is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. He is available 
to communicate directly with Shareholders if they have concerns 
which cannot be resolved through the normal channels of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, or Chief Financial Officer.
Non-Executive Directors
The role of the Non-Executive Directors, and of the Committees 
of which they are members, is to scrutinise the performance of 
management, satisfy themselves that the financial and risk control 
mechanisms are robust, and determine appropriate levels of Executive 
pay. They have wide ranging experience of industry and bring their 
judgement to bear in the decision making process of the Board.
Their seniority and range of skills ensure that no one individual can 
dominate this process.
Board Committees
The Board has three Committees: the Audit and Risk Committee; the 
Nomination Committee; and the Remuneration Committee, to which 
it delegates specific responsibilities. The reports of these Committees 
and details of their composition form part of the Corporate governance 
report.
Each Committee has full terms of reference which have been approved 
by the Board and also appear on the website at www.circassia.com. 
These terms of reference are reviewed annually. The Board provides 
the Committees with sufficient resources, including access to external 
advisers, as may be required in order to fulfil their roles.
Board meetings
The Board aims to meet at least five times during the year. Additional 
meetings may be arranged where urgent matters arise. These 
additional meetings may be held by telephone.
The table below sets out the attendance of the Directors, while they 
were Board members, at scheduled meetings which occurred during 
the year to 31 December 2016.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 46 Appointments to the Board
The procedure for appointment of new Directors to the Board is 
formal, rigorous and transparent. The process is led by the Nomination 
Committee which comprises the Chairman and Independent  
Non-Executive Directors. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed  
by members of the Committee before a recommendation is made  
to the Board.
Diversity
The Board recognises the value of diversity at all levels of the Group. 
The Group has an Equal Treatment, Equal Opportunities and Diversity 
policy which extends to the Board. 
Induction and training
Upon appointment, each Director receives a comprehensive 
induction package which includes written materials relevant to their 
responsibilities. In addition, meetings are organised with other Board 
members and with members of the Company’s management team.
All Directors have direct access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary. Whenever it is considered necessary, the Company 
Secretary can arrange the appointment of professional advisers  
at the Group’s expense to assist Board members in their roles.
Directors receive frequent updates on commercial developments 
affecting the business as well as regulatory and legislative changes. 
Directors are invited, during the annual evaluation procedure,  
to identify any training which they feel might benefit them.
Information
In advance of each Board Meeting, Directors receive a full agenda  
and a comprehensive set of papers which include commercial  
and functional reports. A procedure is in place to ensure that  
these materials are delivered to the Board in a timely fashion. Senior 
employees of the business regularly attend meetings in order to 
enhance the Non-Executive Directors’ understanding of current  
issues and give them the opportunity to ask detailed questions.
Commitment
The Board is satisfied that the other commitments of the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors – which are set out in their biographies – leave 
them with sufficient time to diligently perform their role for the Group.
Performance evaluation
Formal Board evaluations are carried out once a year, and informal 
evaluations are carried out on a continuing basis throughout the year. 
The formal evaluation commences with the circulation of a written 
questionnaire which is prepared by the Company Secretary. This 
invites Directors to rate and comment on the performance of the Board 
in a number of areas, including the conduct of Board meetings;  
the standard and timeliness of information; the balance of skills  
of the members of the Board; the roles and responsibilities of individual 
Directors; and compliance with good corporate governance practices. 
A detailed, anonymised analysis of these responses is then prepared 
by the Company Secretary and reviewed and discussed by the Board.
The Board subjects itself to an external review every third year.  
No external review occurred in 2014 or 2015. Accordingly an external 
review was performed in 2016. The review was carried out by a firm 
named Independent Audit who specialise in the review of Boards  
and their committees. The Board was required to complete four 
tailored questionnaires for the Board as a whole and for each  
of its committees. The results were analysed by Independent Audit 
and presented as a report to the Board. The findings of the report 
were debated by the Board and a list of actions agreed.
Board activity
The Board’s main activities during the course of the year included:
 — Advance planning for the results of the cat allergy treatment phase 
III clinical trials (both positive and negative scenarios) and detailed 
consideration of strategy following receipt of the negative results;
 — Review of the expansion of the Group’s commercial infrastructure 
and sales of NIOX;
 — Reviews of the progress of the Group’s other clinical trial 
programmes for respiratory and allergy products;
 — Reviews of the progress of business and corporate development 
activity and opportunities;
 — Compliance training and updates;
 — Review of the 10 year financial model for the business;
 — Assessment of the financial performance against the budget for 
FY 2016;
 — Approval of the budget for FY 2017;
 — Completion of an externally organised Board evaluation exercise.
Effectiveness
Independence
The Board reviews the independence of its Non-Executive Directors 
each year. For the period 1 January 2016 to 18 May 2016, excluding 
the Chairman, three of the eleven Board members were Non-Executive 
Directors who were considered by the Board to be independent.
For the period from 18 May 2016 to 8 December 2016, excluding  
the Chairman, three out of ten Board members were considered  
to be Independent Non-Executive Directors and from 8 December 2016  
to 31 December 2016, excluding the Chairman, three out of nine Board 
members were considered to be Independent Non-Executive Directors.
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud had participated in the Company’s 
unapproved share option scheme before the Initial Public Offering  
of the Company in 2014. However, this scheme is unrelated  
to performance, such participation was historic, and no further  
share options will be granted. The Board has therefore determined 
that it regards Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud as an Independent  
Non-Executive Director within the meaning of “independent” as defined 
in the Code for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016.
The Board also carefully reviews any actual or potential conflicts  
of interest that may arise due to the commercial interests of  
Non-Executive Directors and they are required to make a declaration 
in respect of any such situations. The Board can confirm that no new 
conflicts of interest arose in the year. Cathrin Petty was an employee 
of JP Morgan, an adviser to the Company, during the term of her 
directorship and accordingly was not considered independent.  
Russ Cummings is an employee of Touchstone Innovations plc which  
is a shareholder and is therefore not considered independent. Paul 
Edick was also considered not to be independent after his wife was 
appointed as the Group’s Chief Commercial Officer on 15 September 
2014. Charles Swingland is not considered independent as he 
previously served as an Executive Director, General Counsel, and 
Company Secretary of the Company. 
Dr Tim Corn is not considered to be independent as he has now  
served as a Director of the Company for more than nine years.
It is confirmed that none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors 
have served for a period of more than nine years.
The Board further confirms that Dr Francesco Granata  
was independent upon his appointment.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 47 Corporate governance continued
Re-election
All Directors have service contracts which are capable of termination 
on giving a fixed period of notice. In the case of the Executive 
Directors this notice period is six months and in the case of the  
Non-Executive Directors and Chairman it is three months. All Directors 
are subject to re-election by Shareholders on an annual basis.
Accountability
The Board acknowledges its duty to present a fair, balanced  
and understandable view of the Group’s position and prospects. 
A description of the Group’s business model is contained in the 
Strategic report. The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities sets  
out information regarding the Directors’ responsibility to prepare 
financial statements. The Independent Auditors’ report includes  
a statement by the Auditor on its reporting responsibilities.
The role of the Audit and Risk Committee is set out in detail  
in the Audit and Risk Committee report.
The Board is responsible for determining the significant risks which  
the Group is prepared to take in order to attain its strategic objectives, 
and keeps the risk management procedures and internal controls 
of the business under regular review. The Board confirms that it is 
satisfied that the current procedures and controls are sufficient to 
ensure compliance with the Code.
After taking advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board  
is able to confirm that the Annual report and accounts, taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced, and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for Shareholders to judge the Group’s  
strategy, business model, position and performance.
Viability statement
The Company prepares a 10 year plan which was reviewed  
and approved by the Board at its meeting on 8 December 2016.
The plan also contains a sensitivity analysis which allows the Board 
to assess the potential financial impact of certain significant potential 
scenarios which might arise. This process informs the Viability 
Statement which the Board gives on page 41 of this report.
Risk management system
A description of the risk management system is set out in the Strategic 
report. The system is designed to manage risks, not to eliminate them 
completely, and can only provide a reasonable degree of assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. Inherent in the concept of 
reasonable assurance is the recognition that the cost of a control 
procedure should not exceed its anticipated benefits. The principal 
risks facing the Group are set out in the Strategic report.
The Board confirms that it has conducted a review of the Group’s 
risk management and internal controls systems, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and has found them to be effective.
Internal controls
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews the Group’s financial controls 
on an annual basis and makes recommendations to the Board where 
improvements are required. The efficacy of control systems  
are reviewed by the full Board as required by the FRC Guidance  
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial  
and Business Reporting.
The Group’s primary risk control systems are as follows:
 Management structure
 — There is a management structure with clear lines of responsibility 
and accountability. Employees are recruited when they have the 
appropriate skills and experience to perform their intended roles.
 — The Board sets the overall strategy and reviews the performance 
of the Group.
 — The Group’s Senior Management Team, chaired by the  
Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for day to day operations.
 — Other team members comprise the Chief Financial Officer, Senior 
Vice President R&D, Chief Business Officer, Vice President Human 
Resources, and General Counsel. This team meets weekly.
 Written policies and procedures
 — There are documented quality procedures which ensure regulatory 
compliance. Regular reviews take place to ensure standards are 
maintained and the Company is fully prepared for a regulatory 
inspection. The Vice President, Quality Assurance and her team 
monitor internal and external (Contract Research Organisation 
and Contract Manufacturing Organisation) compliance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice, Good Clinical Practice, and Good 
Laboratory Practice and organise training for employees.
 — The Vice President, Global Compliance Officer and her team 
maintain policies and deliver training which relate to healthcare 
compliance, including but not limited to the Group’s Whistleblowing 
policy (which enables employees to communicate concerns 
regarding improper activity to a trusted individual who is not their 
line manager or a member of the senior management team), the 
Group’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policy, and the Group’s 
privacy and data protection policies.
 — There are controls in place which determine how financial 
information is validated, consolidated and reviewed.
 — There are specific controls on expenditure. Material investments 
or capital expenditure must be approved by the Board. Normal 
expenditure is controlled by setting limits which are determined by the 
CEO and CFO within a general framework approved by the Board.
 — Detailed management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis 
and provided to the Board. Accompanying reports will explain any 
variances between these results and the budget.
 — The R&D Committee meets on a weekly basis to review 
performance of the various clinical trials and implement action 
plans to prevent delays.
 — The Patents Committee meets regularly to assess the scope of 
protection provided by pending and granted patents, organise 
the defence of granted patents, and plan new filings where 
appropriate. This group also manages registered trade marks.
 — There are physical and electronic procedures in place to ensure 
the security and integrity of data and confidential information.
 — An established policy exists for share dealing by employees or 
connected persons. A revised Circassia Group Dealing Policy 
and Circassia Group Dealing Code was circulated in June 2016 
to reflect the coming into force of the Market Abuse Regime in the 
UK. The format and keeping of insider lists has also been reviewed 
in the light of the new regulations.
 — The Health and Safety Policy is maintained and reviewed by the 
Health and Safety Committee.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 48 Audit and Risk Committee report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Circassia’s Audit  
and Risk Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The Audit and Risk Committee is the key independent oversight 
Committee at Circassia. It monitors and reviews the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management framework and internal controls.
This report sets out how the Committee has discharged its 
responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the “Code”). It also contains a summary of the activities  
of the Committee throughout the year.
Lota S Zoth
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
25 April 2017
Responsibilities
The Committee has responsibility for monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements of the Group, and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control systems and risk management systems, 
including reviewing its risk profile.
Accordingly, the Committee performs a detailed review of the interim 
and annual financial statements, considering whether the accounting 
policies have been applied properly and consistently and whether the 
disclosures made in the Annual report and accounts are compliant 
with financial reporting standards, and with corporate governance  
and regulatory requirements.
The Committee also manages the relationship with the external 
Auditors on behalf of the Board. It monitors the independence of 
the Auditor and reviews the effectiveness of the audit procedure. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding 
the appointment of the external Auditors and reviews their terms 
of engagement. The Committee has access to the services of the 
external Auditors and, if necessary, may appoint external accounting 
and legal advisers to assist it with its work.
The Committee also has ultimate responsibility for matters related 
to healthcare compliance. Following the acquisition of the NIOX 
franchise, the Group markets approved medical devices to healthcare 
professionals in a number of markets around the world and from 
May 2017 , following the commencement of the collaboration with 
AstraZeneca to market Tudorza
®
, the Group will promote an approved 
drug in the United States. Compliance with healthcare laws and 
regulations has therefore become and will continue to be a key risk 
area for the business. The VP , Global Compliance Officer has a direct 
reporting line to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee  
and provides updates in this area to her.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website. They cover issues such as membership and the frequency 
of meetings, together with requirements for a quorum and the right 
to attend meetings. The duties of the Committee as set out in the 
terms of reference include financial and regulatory reporting; internal 
controls; internal audit; external audit; risk management; and reporting 
responsibilities.
 — There is a Disclosure Committee, as required by the Market 
Abuse Directive, comprising the Chief Financial Officer, General 
Counsel, and the Head of Corporate Communications. The Chief 
Business Officer under the direction of this Committee maintains 
an Insider List recording employees and external parties who may 
have access to inside information. Individuals are notified of their 
addition to and removal from the list and are appraised of their 
responsibilities.
No failure of controls or breach of internal policies was recorded during 
the year to 31 December 2016 and up to the date of this report.
Remuneration
The Board has adopted a remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM which it believes is sufficient to attract, 
retain, and motivate Directors of the quality required to run the Group 
successfully, but which does not result in payment of more than 
is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of Executive 
Directors’ pay is linked to corporate and individual performance. Full 
details of the policy are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
Relations with Shareholders
Dialogue with Shareholders
The Board maintains regular communication with Shareholders. 
Meetings between material Shareholders and the Executive 
Directors take place throughout the year. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and other Directors are available 
to meet with major Shareholders on request.
All meetings with Shareholders are held in a manner which ensures 
price sensitive information which has not been made available  
to Shareholders generally is protected from disclosure.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer give annual 
and six-monthly presentations to institutional investors, analysts, and 
the media. These presentations are available on the website. Annual 
and Interim reports and all press releases are also published on the 
website as are the terms of reference of the three Board committees. 
Paper copies of the report and accounts are mailed to those 
Shareholders who have elected to receive them in hard copy.
The Directors receive a report from the Corporate Communications 
department at each Board Meeting giving information on material 
changes in shareholdings and collating feedback from the Company’s 
brokers and investors.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM provides an opportunity for all Shareholders to meet Board 
members and have the opportunity to ask about the proposed 
resolutions and the business in general.
Notice of the AGM is posted to Shareholders not less than 21 clear 
days prior to the date of the AGM and is also available to Shareholders 
on the website at www.circassia.com. The letter accompanying 
the Notice will include details of the proposed resolutions and an 
explanation of their content.
At the AGM the number of proxy votes cast for, against, or abstaining 
from each resolution will be disclosed. Results of voting are 
announced to the market and posted on the website as soon  
as possible after the AGM.
The Group does not currently consider it appropriate to introduce 
mandatory poll voting on all resolutions put to the Shareholders  
but will keep this position under review.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 50  — Reasonable reductions in sales growth targets in combination  
with the above
In each case, the mitigating actions were robust enough to ensure  
the solvency and liquidity of the Group through to at least  
31 December 2019.
The Group’s annual budget and 10 year plan was approved  
by the Board at its December 2016 meeting.
In addition, after the year end, the Board considered a 10 year plan  
for the Group which included the collaboration with AstraZeneca.  
This was built from the bottom up and stress tested for each of the 
above scenarios. In each case, the mitigating actions were robust 
enough to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the Group through  
to at least 31 December 2019 which is the period to which the 
Board’s review is limited for the purpose of the viability statement.
The collaboration agreement includes terms for the payment  
of deferred consideration of $100 million which will fall due by  
30 June 2019 at the latest. In the event that the Group is unable  
raise sufficient funding to meet this obligation, a vendor loan has  
been agreed with AstraZeneca to borrow up to $180 million.
The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the Basis  
of Preparation paragraph in note 1 to the accounts.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the review of the Group’s risk 
management framework and the level of risk which is acceptable  
in order to achieve its strategic objectives. The Committee,  
on behalf of the Board, undertakes the detailed monitoring  
of the risk management framework and system of internal controls  
and reports to the Board on their suitability and efficacy annually.
In order to discharge its duties in this respect, the Committee receives 
and reviews reports from the Group’s management team.
The Committee continues to assess what is an acceptable level of risk 
in key areas, and the best strategy for mitigating those risks given the 
cost and time constraints which exist.
During the year, as is required by the 2014 edition of the Code,  
the Committee performed a detailed assessment of the principal 
risks faced by the Group and how these are managed and mitigated. 
An annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s monitoring and 
review systems was carried out at the December Committee meeting. 
In addition, the Board asked the management team to carry out a 
review of the operations of the Group’s representative office in China. 
The report, prepared with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ 
Beijing office was provided to the Board for review. 
Whistleblowing
A confidential whistleblowing procedure exists to enable employees  
to raise concerns regarding possible improprieties in relation to financial 
or other matters. This procedure has been communicated to all staff. 
Reports can be made through an online tool or a telephone helpline 
operated by a third party provider. The Committee has reviewed these 
arrangements and is satisfied that the current procedure allows  
for proportionate and independent investigation of such disclosures,  
and for appropriate follow up actions to be taken. In accordance  
with the current policy, concerned employees may raise matters  
directly with the Vice President, Global Compliance Officer.
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
The Group has an anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy which has 
been communicated to all staff. This policy ensures full compliance 
with the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corruption Practices  
Act and other major anti-corruption legislation. The policy extends  
to carrying out due diligence on new key business partners who are 
judged to be acting on behalf of the Group in high risk areas.
Following the negative results of the cat allergy trial, the 
following assessments resulting in changes were carried out:
 — Goodwill and intangibles impairment assessment (which is 
described further under a separate heading)
 — Review of onerous R&D and other contracts: an accrual for 
expected termination fees was made where required
 — Restructuring: a reorganisation was initiated including closure 
of facilities in Chicago and Solna and associated redundancies 
together with redundancies within R&D
 — Review of the fair value of awards under share options schemes: 
the fair value of all historic share awards that have cat allergy  
phase III trial success as part of the non-market conditions have 
been reduced resulting in a reduction in the expense charged to 
the income statement
Goodwill and intangibles impairment assessment
In line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the carrying value of each 
cash generating unit (CGU) including the allocated goodwill tested  
for impairment.
Cash generating units are the smallest group of assets that 
independently generate cash flows and whose cash flow is largely 
independent of the cash flows generated by other assets. These 
have been defined as the pre-existing Circassia business (i.e. allergy 
business) prior to the acquisition of Aerocrine and Prosonix; Aerocrine 
(NIOX
®
 business) and Prosonix (respiratory business).
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Aerocrine was allocated to 
both the pre-existing allergy cash generating unit and the NIOX
®
 
cash generating unit. This is because both cash generating units 
would benefit from the same sales force selling to largely the same 
customers. The assumptions used in allocation of the goodwill are 
set out in note 14 to the accounts. This estimate is subject to a high 
degree of judgement.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Prosonix was allocated entirely  
to respiratory. Goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit  
is disclosed in note 14 of the financial statements.
Goodwill of £74.5 million which had been allocated to the allergy  
CGU was fully impaired and intangible assets of £0.3 million which 
had been allocated to the allergy CGU were also impaired.
Going concern and cash flow
Following review of Group cash flows over a three year period to  
31 December 2019, taking account of the Group’s current position  
and the potential impact of the principal risks identified earlier in this 
report the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group  
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the period to 31 December 2019.
In making this statement, the Directors have considered the 
robustness of the Group, taking account of its current position, 
potential future developments, the principal risks facing it, and the 
effectiveness of mitigation plans and controls. Their assessment has 
encompassed the potential impact of significant credible scenarios  
on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity 
over the period to 31 December 2019.
The Directors have determined that a three year period is the 
appropriate length of time over which to provide its viability statement. 
The Board first considers annually, and on a rolling basis, a detailed 
annual budget and 10 year plan for the Group and the output from 
this exercise informs the preparation of the viability statement. For the 
purposes of the viability statement, the Board’s review is limited to three 
years given the nature of the business and uncertainty. This is built from 
the bottom up and is stress tested for the following key scenarios:
 — Reasonable delays in key product launches
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 51 Corporate governance continued
Internal audit
This year the Committee considered again whether there is a need 
for an internal audit function and concluded that, given the scale 
of operations at this time, it is not currently necessary. The Board 
accepted this recommendation. This decision will be kept under review.
External audit
The Group’s external Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC),  
is engaged to express its opinion on the Group’s financial statements.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is reviewed annually 
by the Committee. This review encompasses an examination of the 
independence, qualifications, capabilities, and remuneration of the 
Auditor. If issues are identified which may affect the effectiveness  
of the process then actions will be agreed. No such issues were 
identified in the year to 31 December 2016 or up to the date  
of this report.
As PwC has been Auditor for 10 years, the Board conducted  
a process inviting a number of firms to tender for the 2017 year  
end audit. At the end of the process, the Audit and Risk Committee 
recommended to the Board that PwC be proposed for  
re-appointment as Auditors.
In addition, at the end of the audit for the year ended 31 December 
2016 the Committee formally evaluated the performance of PwC.  
To conduct this evaluation the Committee completed a questionnaire 
to assess robustness of the audit process, quality of its delivery, 
quality of reporting, and quality of the individuals and service. 
Moreover, the Committee takes into account the quality of its 
interactions with the Auditor in forming a view on their effectiveness.
Independence
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the independence  
and objectivity of the external Auditor. Each year the external  
Auditor confirms its policies for ensuring its independence  
and provides the Committee with written confirmation that  
they continue to be independent.
The Committee pays careful regard to whether non-audit work  
is carried out by the Auditor so as to ensure that the provision of such 
additional services does not impair its independence or objectivity.
A formal process exists for approving the use of the Auditor for  
non- audit work. The Auditor should not be appointed to provide  
non-audit services which might put the Auditor in the position  
of auditing its own work or create a mutual interest between  
the Group and the Auditor or result in the Auditor acting  
as an advocate, manager, or employee of the Group.
PwC undertook non-audit services for the Group in the course of the 
year to 31 December 2016 which are summarised in the table below. 
These services were provided in compliance with the policy outlined 
above and no conflicts of interest were considered to have arisen.

statements. Services were provided during the year in connection  
with corporate advisory services. The Committee believes that the  
use of PwC for this work was appropriate in the circumstances and 
that independence was preserved as the nature of the non-audit 
services was such that the external Auditor was best placed to 
perform this work due to their skills and experience, and the fees  
paid were insignificant in the context of the overall revenues earned 
 by PwC.
Other assurance services related mainly to the fees for the review  
of the operations of the Group’s representative office in China.
In summary, the Committee confirms that the Group has received  
an independent audit service in the year to 31 December 2016  
and up to the date of this report.
Audit partner rotation
PwC adheres to a rotation policy which complies with the ethical 
standards of the Audit Practices Board (the “APB”) and the audit partner 
is rotated every five years. Simon Ormiston, the current audit partner 
was appointed for the year ended 31 December 2014 and is not due 
for rotation until completion of the year ending 31 December 2018.
Tendering
PwC has been the Company’s Auditor since the year ended  
31 December 2007 . The Committee is actively monitoring 
developments arising from the EU audit reform framework and the 
Competition and Markets Authority . In view of those developments, 
the Committee conducted an audit tender process during the course 
of 2016 and recommended PwC for re-appointment by shareholders 
at the 2017 Annual General Meeting
The Company has complied during the financial year under review 
and up to the date of this report with the provisions of the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Committee evaluation
An external review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried 
out in 2016 as part of the process of evaluating Board effectiveness. 
The review was carried out by a firm named Independent Audit who 
specialise in the review of Boards and their committees. The Board 
was required to complete four tailored questionnaires for the Board as 
a whole and for each of its committees. The results were analysed by 
Independent Audit and presented as a report to the Board. The findings 
of the report were debated by the Board and a list of actions agreed.
Results of Audit Quality Review
The external audit in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 
was subject to review by the Audit Quality Review (AQR) team of the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) during the year. The Committee 
received a copy of the report from the FRC and has discussed the 
matters identified in this report with the audit partner. There were no 
significant findings identified and the Committee are satisfied that the 
matters discussed have been appropriately considered as part of the 
audit of the year ended 31 December 2016.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 52 Nomination Committee report 
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s 
Nomination Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
The key objective of the Committee is to ensure the Board is made up 
of a range of individuals who together have the appropriate mixture  
of skills and experience to lead the Group.
In the course of the year, Mr Paul Edick and Ms Cathrin Petty both 
departed from the Board. Their contributions have been greatly 
appreciated. However, the Committee did not feel it necessary  
to replace them at this stage given the breadth of expertise provided 
by the remaining Board members.
A summary of the activities of the Committee is set out below.
Dr Francesco Granata
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
25 April 2017
Responsibilities
The Committee must review the size, structure, and composition 
of the Board and the Committees evaluating the balance of skills, 
experience, independence, and diversity of the Board as a whole.  
On the basis of this evaluation it will then make recommendations 
to the Board on any appointments. As part of this process, the 
Committee will prepare a description of the skills, experience and 
other characteristics required, and identify through a transparent 
procedure, individuals who are capable of filling those roles.
The Committee also plans for the orderly succession of Directors  
to the Board and recommends to the Board the membership  
and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found  
on the website.
Membership and meetings
Throughout the year the Committee comprised Dr Tim Corn,  
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud, and Dr Francesco Granata, the Chairman. 
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud was considered by the Board to be 
Independent. However, Dr Tim Corn was not considered to be 
Independent. As Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud was the only Independent 
Non-Executive Director, one third of the Committee was therefore 
made up of Independent Non-Executive Directors, although the 
Chairman was independent upon appointment. The composition  
of the Nomination Committee therefore did not comply fully  
with the recommendations of the Code.
As Dr Tim Corn will not stand for re-election at the Annual  
General Meeting, he will be replaced by an existing independent  
Non-Executive Director. The Committee is therefore expected  
to comply with the Code in respect of its composition of independent 
Non-Executive Directors during 2017 .
The Committee met twice during the year ended 31 December 2016 
and all members, except for Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud were present  
at each meeting. A summary of the composition and attendance  
of the Committee is as follows:
 
Member
 
Date of appointment
Meetings  
attended (held)
Dr Francesco Granata 21 February 2014 2 (2)
Dr Tim Corn 21 February 2014 2 (2)
Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud 21 February 2014 1 (2)
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.  
The Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee is empowered to obtain external professional advice 
to assist in the performance of its duties. However, during the year 
the Committee did not require any external services except for the 
external evaluation of Board effectiveness. 
Activities
The principal activities during the year were:
 — Review of the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(including skills, experience, independence, knowledge  
and diversity); and
 — Annual performance evaluation of the Board, its members  
and its Committees.
Appointment procedure
There is a formal and transparent procedure by which new Directors 
are appointed to the Board. Suitable candidates are proposed  
either by existing Board members or by an external search firm.  
The Committee will then assess whether the candidate has the 
requisite skills and experience for the role, sufficient time to perform  
it, and that their appointment will preserve or improve the balance  
of skills, experience and knowledge of the Board.
No Board appointments were made in the course of the year  
or up to the date of this report.
Diversity
The Company has an Equal Treatment, Equal Opportunities  
and Diversity policy which extends to the Board. Any appointments 
are carried out in full compliance with this policy.
Succession Planning
The Board is satisfied that appropriate planning has taken place  
for the orderly succession of Directors and senior management.
Chairman’s commitments
In accordance with provision B.3.1 of the Code, it is confirmed  
that the Chairman’s other significant commitments are as disclosed  
in the biography which appears in the Corporate governance report.
Committee evaluation
An external review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried 
out in December 2016 as part of the process of evaluating Board 
effectiveness. This was performed by Independent Audit who specialise 
in the review of Boards and their committees. The Board was required 
to complete four tailored questionnaires for the Board and for each  
of its committees. The results were analysed by Independent Audit and 
presented as a report to the Board. The findings of the report  
were debated by the Board and a list of actions agreed.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 53 Corporate governance continued
 Annual statement
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Circassia’s 
Remuneration Committee report for the year ended 31 December 
2016. This report will be presented for the consideration and approval 
of Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 26 May 2017 .
This report complies with the regime set out in Part 4 to Schedule 8 
of the Large- and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (the Regulations), the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) and the Listing Rules. 
Accordingly it consists of three parts: (i) an Annual statement which 
summarises the key issues and explains the business context in which 
the Committee’s main decisions were taken; (ii) an unaudited Directors’ 
remuneration policy report which describes the current and future 
executive remuneration policy, and which was approved by 99.57%  
of Shareholders at the AGM on 20 May 2015; and (iii) the Annual 
report on remuneration which sets out details of and rationale for the 
remuneration provided to the Group’s Directors during the 2016 financial 
year. This latter report is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy which was approved by the Shareholders  
at the 2015 AGM, promotes the long-term sustainable success  
of the Group. It aims to reward Executive Directors for performance, 
and for delivery of Shareholder value judged against transparent  
and demanding criteria. As part of this policy a significant proportion  
of potential remuneration is linked to the achievement of corporate  
and individual performance indicators. 
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors and management  
at Senior Vice President level includes an element being deferred  
into shares for three years and subject to forfeiture.
Share incentive arrangements have been in effect since 2014  
and are intended to closely align the interests of the Executive 
Directors with those of Shareholders. The earliest date of vesting 
under these schemes falls three years after grant subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions. Details of the awards  
made under these schemes to the Executive Directors are set  
out in the Annual report on remuneration. In addition, the Company 
operates shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and Senior 
Vice Presidents to further increase alignment with Shareholders.
The Committee believes that the emphasis on performance-related 
pay, the use of bonus deferral, annual long-term incentive awards and 
mandatory share ownership guidelines, creates a clear focus  
on sustainable performance, avoids paying more than is necessary 
and maintains an ongoing alignment between Executive Directors  
and Shareholders.
Performance and reward
The bonus arrangements for 2016 provided for an award of up to 
100% of salary linked to the achievement of annual developmental 
and operational goals. As described in the Strategic report, although 
the Group made significant progress in developing its NIOX business, 
building its commercial infrastructure, and progressing its respiratory 
pipeline it suffered a significant setback when the phase III results  
for its cat allergy treatment proved negative. As a result, even though 
a number of the corporate objectives set by the Board were in fact 
achieved, given the material decline in the share price suffered by 
Shareholders, the Executive Directors and the Board felt it appropriate 
not to award any bonus to the Executive Directors or Senior Vice 
Presidents for the year ended 2016.
No long-term incentives were due to vest in relation to performance 
ending in 2016.
Application of policy for 2017
The Remuneration policy set out in this report was approved  
by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2015  
and will be applied without changes in 2017 .
The salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect  
from 1 January 2017 and increased in line with increases  
to the general workforce of 3%.
The annual fee for the Chairman, Dr Francesco Granata, will increase 
from £134,400 to £138,400.
We welcome Shareholder feedback on these matters and hope  
that you will be able to support our policy and its application  
at the forthcoming AGM.
Marvin S Samson
Remuneration Committee Chairman
25 April 2017
 Directors’ remuneration policy report (DRP)
The present policy was approved by a binding Shareholder vote  
at the AGM on 20 May 2015 and is therefore expected to remain  
in force until the AGM in 2018. There is no requirement to vote again 
on the policy this year as no changes are being proposed at this time, 
but the full policy has been included again this year for information 
only. The bar charts on page 61 have, however, been updated  
to reflect possible scenarios for remuneration in 2017 .
Remuneration philosophy
The potential levels of remuneration have been set so that they  
are competitive against those comparator companies with which  
the Group will compete for talented individuals.
The Committee’s goal is to design and implement a remuneration 
policy which will support and reward Executive Directors for delivering 
the Group’s strategic objectives and ultimately creating value for 
Shareholders, whilst adhering to good corporate governance and 
reflecting best practice. To achieve this, the balance of remuneration 
is focused on variable performance-related pay. In particular, to reflect 
the long-term nature of the Group’s development pipeline, variable pay 
is more heavily weighted towards long-term sustainable value creation 
through the use of share incentive plans. When combined with share 
ownership guidelines, this creates an alignment between Executive 
Directors and Shareholders with a longer-term view.
The Committee annually reviews the operation of the variable incentive 
plans to ensure they are operating within an acceptable risk profile  
and that they do not inadvertently encourage any economic, social  
or governance issues.
Remuneration policy
The total remuneration for each Executive Director is made up  
of the following elements:
 — Salary;
 — Benefits;
 — Annual bonus;
 — Long-term incentive awards; and
 — Pension.
Recovery and withholding provisions will apply to the bonus and long- 
term incentive arrangements in specific circumstances as determined 
appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 54 Remuneration committee report
Salary Benefits Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy
Provides fixed remuneration in line with 
market rates that reflects the responsibilities 
of the role undertaken and the experience  
of the individual.
Purpose and link to strategy
Provides market competitive, yet  
cost-effective employment benefits.
Purpose and link to strategy
To incentivise and recognise execution of the 
business strategy and personal objectives on 
an annual basis.
Operation
Set at an approximately mid-market level 
and reviewed annually taking into account 
individual responsibilities, performance, 
inflation, and market rates. The Committee 
will also consider the pay and employment 
conditions in the wider workforce when 
determining Executive Directors’ salaries. 
Salary increases are normally effective from  
1 January each year.
Salaries are periodically benchmarked 
against a relevant peer group of UK listed 
companies with similar market capitalisation 
and operations.
Operation
For Executive Directors this includes private 
medical insurance and life insurance.
Other employment benefits may be provided 
from time to time on similar terms as those  
of other employees.
If the Company introduces an all-employee 
share plan, Executive Directors will be eligible 
to participate on the same terms as other 
employees.
If an Executive Director is based outside  
the UK additional benefits and assistance 
with relocation may be provided which  
reflect local market norms or legislation.
Operation
Annual bonus performance targets are set 
at the start of the year by the Board and 
performance against objectives is assessed 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Bonuses will be paid as a mix of cash and 
deferred shares. Until the share ownership 
guidelines are reached, the bonus will be 
payable as 50% cash and 50% shares.
Thereafter, the bonus will be payable  
as 75% cash and 25% shares.
Bonus shares are deferred for three years 
from the date of the award and are subject  
to forfeiture.
Recovery and withholding provisions will 
apply in the event of misstatement of results, 
error in performance calculation or gross 
misconduct.
A dividend equivalent, if payable, will be 
payable in cash when the shares vest.
Maximum potential value
The current base salaries are set out  
in the implementation of policy section  
of the Annual report on remuneration.
There is no formal maximum limit, but 
increases are generally in line with those  
of the wider workforce.
Larger increases may be permitted to reflect 
a change in responsibilities or a significant 
increase in the scale or complexity of the role.
Maximum potential value
There is no formal maximum limit as the value 
of insured benefits will vary from year to year 
based on the cost from third-party providers.
Maximum potential value
The maximum payable for all Executive 
Directors is 100% of salary.
Performance metrics
The overall performance of the individual 
and Company is a key determinant for salary 
increases.
Performance metrics
None.
Performance metrics
Research and development, business 
development, financial and operational 
targets are set at the start of the year by the 
Board. The weighting for each performance 
measure is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and may vary for each Executive 
Director according to their role and reflecting 
their objectives for the year.
Details of the performance measures for the 
current year are provided in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 55 Remuneration committee report continued

and to enhance retention of staff.
To incentivise and recognise achievement of longer-term business 
objectives and sustained superior Shareholder value creation.
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide a competitive and cost-effective level of retirement 
provision.
Operation
Conditional awards or options from the Performance Share Plan  
are granted annually. The awards vest provided certain performance 
conditions, which have been approved by the Board, are achieved 
over a period of at least three years.
Performance targets are set at the start of each performance  
period. Recovery and withholding provisions apply for reasons  
of misstatement of results, error in performance calculation  
or gross misconduct.
Operation
Executive Directors are eligible to join a defined contribution  
pension scheme.
Alternatively a cash supplement (or a combination of contribution  
and cash) can be made.
Maximum potential value
Annual awards of up to the following percentage each  
year are granted to Executive Directors:
 — Chief Executive Officer, 150% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors, 125% of salary
In special circumstances (such as a recruitment) an award  
of up to 300% of salary is permitted.
Dividend equivalents may be payable on vested awards.
Maximum potential value
The maximum contribution, cash supplement (or combination 
thereof) payable by the Company is 15% of salary.
Performance metrics
Awards are currently subject to a combination of relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and clinical progression timelines  
for Executive Directors.
No more than 25% of the maximum award will vest for achieving  
the threshold performance level.
The weighting of these performance measures, the choice of 
comparators for relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and / or 
the inclusion of additional performance measures will be reviewed 
annually by the Committee, reflecting the strategic objectives and 
priorities of the following three year performance period.
If the Committee determines a material change to the performance 
measures used for future awards is required to reflect a change  
in strategy, this would only be made following appropriate dialogue  
with the Company’s major Shareholders. 
Performance metrics
None.
 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 56 Share ownership guidelines
Purpose and link to strategy
To align Executives with Shareholders and provide an ongoing incentive for continued performance.
Operation
Only shares which are fully owned with no outstanding vesting criteria count towards the shareholding guideline.
Executive Directors will be required to retain half of any post-tax awards which vest under long-term incentive plans, until the share  
ownership guideline has been satisfied.
Maximum potential value
Executive Directors are required to build and maintain the following minimum level of shareholding:
 — Chief Executive Officer, 150% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors, 100% of salary
Performance metrics
None.
The Committee operates the annual bonus and Performance  
Share Plan (PSP), in accordance with their rules, and where relevant, 
the Listing Rules. To maintain an efficient administrative process, the 
Committee retains the following discretions relating to remuneration:
a. the eligibility to participate in the plans;
b. the timing of grant of awards and any payments;
c.  the size of awards and payments (subject to the maximum limits  
set out in the policy table above and the respective plan rules);
d.  the determination of whether the performance conditions have 
been met;
e. determining a good or bad leaver under the terms of the plan;
f. dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
g.  adjustments required in certain capital events such as rights  
issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends; and
h.  the annual review of performance conditions for the annual bonus 
plan and PSP .
In certain exceptional circumstances, such as a material 
acquisition / divestment of a Group business, which mean the original 
performance conditions are no longer appropriate, the Committee 
may adjust the targets, alter weightings or set different measures  
as necessary, to ensure the conditions achieve their original purpose 
and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Historical awards
Awards which were granted prior to the Company’s IPO are set  
out in the Annual report on remuneration (ARR).
These awards remain eligible to vest, based on their original terms  
and will be disclosed in the relevant ARR as required.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 57 Remuneration committee report continued
Performance measures
The rationale behind each performance measure currently used in the Performance Share Plan and how it is calculated is as follows:
Performance measure Rationale
Relative TSR performance Recognises outperformance and delivery of relative value to Shareholders
Relative total Shareholder return is currently measured against the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment trusts (the 
‘Index’)). This was chosen as a comparator group because it represents similar sized companies, is subject to 
less volatility than a smaller peer comparator group and is transparent for both Shareholders and participants. 
The Committee will review on an annual basis the continued appropriateness of the comparator group.
Key strategic business 
objectives
Recognises the importance of both revenue growth and clinical progress
The growth of the Company and therefore delivery of value to investors is dependent on achievement of certain 
key commercial and clinical objectives.
The annual bonus is designed to drive the achievement of the Company’s strategic business targets. These targets are agreed by the Board 
and selected because of their importance in value creation for Shareholders. Objectives are weighted for Executives in proportion to the 
degree of responsibility for control and achievement of that objective. The weightings are agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration on recruitment
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package of new Executive Directors. Each element of an Executive Director’s 
remuneration is set out below:
Salary Base salary will be determined based on the role, experience of the individual and the current market rate.
It may be considered necessary to appoint a new Executive Director on a below market salary (e.g. to reflect 
limited plc board experience). In such circumstances phased increases above those of the wider workforce 
may be required over an appropriate time period, to bring the salary to the desired market level, subject to the 
continued development in the role.
Benefits Benefits provided would be in line with those of current Executive Directors.
Where required to meet business needs, reasonable relocation support will be provided.
In addition if it becomes necessary to appoint a new Executive Director from outside the UK, additional benefits 
may be provided to reflect local market norms or legislation.
Annual bonus The ongoing annual bonus maximum will be in line with that outlined in the policy table for existing Executive 
Directors, pro-rated to reflect the period of service.
Depending on the timing or nature of an appointment it may be necessary to set different initial performance 
measures and targets for the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentive 
awards
PSP awards are granted in line with the policy outlined for existing Executives. Any ongoing annual award is 
limited to that of the current Chief Executive Officer.
An award may be made shortly following an appointment (provided the Company is not in a prohibited period). 
For internal appointments, existing awards will continue on their original terms.
Pension A company contribution or cash supplement up to the maximum as outlined for current Executive Directors.
Buy-out awards To enable the recruitment of exceptional talent, the Committee may determine that the buy-out of remuneration 
forfeit from a prior employer is necessary. Where possible, any replacement remuneration will be offered on a 
like-for-like basis with the forfeited awards and may be in the form of cash or shares and depending whether the 
award forgone has similar performance conditions, may or may not be subject to performance conditions. The 
value of any buy-out will be limited to the value of remuneration forfeit. Where appropriate, such awards will be 
granted under existing share plans, however, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion to make use of 
the flexibility to make awards under exemptions in the Listing Rules.
Fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will be set at a level that is consistent with those of existing Non-Executive Directors.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 58 Exit payment policy
The Group does not have a policy of fixed term employment contracts, however, all Directors put themselves forward for re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting. Notice periods for Executive Directors’ employment contracts are six months and three months for the Chairman’s 
and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment from either party.
The following policies and payments apply in the event that an Executive Director’s employment is terminated.
Remuneration element Exit payment policy
Current service contracts Termination by notice: six months.
Redundancy: six months annual salary payable (reduced accordingly if part of the notice period is worked). 
Retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: no termination payment.
Future service contracts Termination by notice: up to 12 months’ notice, with a provision to make a payment in lieu of notice for base 
salary and benefits only. Any payment will be phased on a monthly basis and would be subject to mitigation, 
whereby the payment made can be reduced (including to zero) if appropriate alternative employment is found.
Redundancy: annual salary payable for the relevant notice period (reduced accordingly if part of the notice 
period is worked).
Retirement, death and ill-health, injury or disability: no termination payment.
Long-term incentives and 
deferred bonuses
PSP awards are governed by the Plan Rules as approved by Shareholders. Likewise, the deferred bonus 
awards are subject to the same leaver provisions. These are summarised below.
Termination by notice: unvested awards lapse on cessation.
Redundancy, retirement, ill health, injury or disability, transfer of employment outside of the Group or change of 
control, or any other reason the Committee determines: unvested awards will vest either on the normal vesting 
date or if the Board decides, immediately on the participant ceasing to be in employment. Awards will vest 
subject to the extent the performance condition has been met, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards will be pro-rated for time, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Death: unvested awards will vest on the date of death. Awards will be pro-rated, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise.
Change of control: unvested awards will vest on the date of the takeover. Awards will vest subject to the extent 
the performance condition has been met, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. Awards will be pro-
rated, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Annual bonus Termination by notice by individual: if an individual serves notice and the termination date falls before 31 
December, the bonus is forfeited. If notice is served between 1 January following the year in which the bonus 
was earned and the payment date, the employee may (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) receive 
the entire bonus payable in cash, subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Redundancy, retirement, death and ill-health, or any other reason the Committee determines: 
if the termination date falls during the financial year, pro-rated for service rendered and subject to performance;  
if it falls after the end of the financial year the bonus is payable in cash based on actual results on the normal 
bonus payment date.
Termination by notice: not normally paid, however, at the Committee’s discretion, if the termination date falls 
during the financial year, a bonus may be paid pro-rata for service rendered and subject to performance over 
the full financial year and normally paid on the normal payment date: if it falls after the end of the financial year a 
bonus is payable based on actual results on the normal bonus payment date.
Benefits These will normally continue to apply until the termination date.
Pension Contributions by the Company will normally continue to apply until the termination date.
Additional payments The Committee will make payment of any statutory entitlements as necessary. In addition the Committee 
will retain the discretion to make settlement or to compromise a claim in connection with a termination of any 
Executive Directors as necessary.
Reasonable legal and outplacement costs will be met if deemed necessary.

Statement of consideration of employees’ pay and 
remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company does not formally consult with employees on the 
matters of Executive Director remuneration. However, the Committee 
is made aware of employment conditions in the wider Group.
The same broad principles apply to the remuneration policy for both 
Executive Directors and the wider employee population. However,  
the remuneration for Executive Directors has a stronger emphasis  
on performance-related pay than for other employees. In particular  
the following approach is used:
 — Salaries, benefits and pensions are compared to appropriate 
market rates and set at approximately mid-market level with 
allowance for role, responsibilities and experience.
 — When setting salary levels for the Executive Directors,  
the Committee considers the salary increases provided  
to other employees and in particular those based in the UK.
 — An annual bonus plan is available to all employees and is based  
on business and individual performance.
Scenarios
The charts set out for illustrative purposes only, what annual 
remuneration the Company expects the Directors to obtain  
if performance levels are below threshold, meet expectations  
or exceed the maximum targets.
The assumptions used in the calculations are set out below:
 — Fixed pay: this includes salary, pension and benefits.
 — Base salary effective 1 January 2017 and expected pension 
contribution has been used.
 — The actual monetary value of benefits received in 2016 have 
been used.
 — Expected: this includes salary, pension, benefits, annual bonus 
and PSP . This assumes that 70% of the annual bonus maximum 
will be payable for each of the Directors and 50% of PSP awards 
will vest.
 — Maximum: It is assumed that the maximum annual bonus would 
be payable and that the awards under the PSP vest in full.
 — No share price growth has been assumed.

Statement of consideration of Shareholders’ views
The Remuneration Committee will consider any Shareholder feedback received at the AGM and at meetings throughout the year, when reviewing 
the overall remuneration policy each year. The guidance from shareholder representative bodies is also considered on an ongoing basis.
More specifically the Committee will consult with major Shareholders when proposing any significant changes to the policy in the future.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 62  Annual report on remuneration
This section of the Remuneration Committee report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Regulations as amended,  
and 9.8.6R of the Listing Rules. The Annual report on remuneration will be put to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM on 26 May 2017 .
Composition
From 1 January 2016 to 9 February 2016, the Committee was made up of Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud (Chairman), Dr Tim Corn, and Ms Lota 
Zoth. Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud and Lota Zoth are both considered independent by the Board. Tim Corn is considered not to be independent. 
The Committee therefore did not comply with the requirement of the Code that all members of the Remuneration Committee be Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. On 9 February 2016 Dr Garaud was succeeded by Mr Marvin Samson as Chairman of the Committee. Mr Samson 
is also considered to be an Independent Non-Executive Director. There have been no further changes to the Committee up to the date  
of this report. The terms of reference of the Committee appear on the Company’s website. The Committee met twice during the year ended  
31 December 2016. Each meeting was fully attended.
Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
 — setting a remuneration strategy which is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company;
 — ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior employees reflects performance and delivery of Shareholder value;
 — agreeing the design and targets of share incentive plans which require Shareholder approval and monitoring the achievement of those 
targets;
 — deciding on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior employees, including any specific recruitment or retention terms;
 — making a recommendation to the Board in relation to the Chairman’s fees;
 — appointing external advisers where necessary.
Activities
A summary of the matters considered by the Committee in the course of the year ended 31 December 2016 is as follows:
Meeting Agenda items
February Review of the salary levels and annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors. Review of remuneration for the 
Chairman.
Review of performance targets for annual PSP awards.
May Review of PSP plan vesting criteria. Approval of option awards for new employees.
December The review and approval of annual bonus targets for 2017 for Executive Directors and Senior Vice Presidents 
which is usually considered at the December meeting was postponed until February 2017
Advisers
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street (NBS) (part of Aon plc) to advise it on aspects of the Group’s remuneration policy. NBS is a 
signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct which sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and 
free from undue influence. The fees to NBS in 2016 were £39,150 (2015: £18,216), which were mainly charged on the basis of hourly rates. 
The Committee reviews the performance and independence of its advisers on an annual basis.

4 This is the amount earned as salary or fees in the financial year
5 This is the taxable value of benefits paid in respect of the financial year. The majority of these benefits consist of medical insurance and life assurance
6  This is the value of the total bonus earned during the financial year and comprises the annual bonus paid in respect of performance against goals for 2015. Where the 
requisite shareholding requirement has not been met by an Executive Director then 50% of the annual bonus will be paid in shares. Where the requirement has been 
met then 25% will be paid in shares.
7 The amount shown relates to the gain, being the market value on date of exercise less exercise price, on EMI share option awards that vested during the year
8  UK tax legislation imposes penalty taxes on annual pension contributions where prescribed maximum limits are exceeded. The Committee has previously 
determined that Executive Directors affected by this legislation would receive pension benefits limited by the prescribed maximum amounts and an additional taxable 
supplementary cash payment equal to the cost to the Company of the benefit foregone. The amount of this supplementary allowance is set so that there is no 
additional cost to the Company as a result of the implementation of this arrangement. In 2016 Steven Harris received £59,625 of this pension amount as supplementary 
cash (2015: £40,114). In 2016 Rod Hafner received £30,417 of this pension amount as supplementary cash (2015: £nil). 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 64 Annual bonus for the year to 31 December 2016
For the year ended 31 December 2016, bonuses up to a maximum of 100% of base salary for Executive Directors and Senior Vice Presidents 
could be earned for performance against annual operational and development goals.
Performance objectives are agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year and the Remuneration Committee determines the proportion 
of bonus payable to each Director and Senior Vice President in the event that the objective is achieved. The Remuneration Committee 
determines at the beginning of the year following the bonus year, the extent to which the objective has been achieved and the proportion  
of the bonus earned. The bonus is calculated on base salary.
Notwithstanding the achievement of certain objectives in the course of 2016, the Committee agreed to the proposal put forward  
by the Executive Directors, that in view of the negative phase III allergy clinical trial results received in June 2016, and the consequent  
impact on the share price, not to award any bonus to the Executive Directors for 2016.
For completeness, the annual performance objectives previously agreed for 2016 are set out below together with the % achievement

Deferred share bonus awards are structured as conditional awards over shares which vest after three years. The level of deferral is linked  
to the achievement of the Company’s shareholding guidelines as set out in the policy report. Where the guidelines have been met in full,  
75% of bonuses are paid in cash and 25% in shares. Both Steven Harris and Rod Hafner have met their shareholding guidelines and therefore 
75% of their 2015 bonus was paid in cash. Julien Cotta has not yet met the shareholding guidelines and so 50% of his 2015 bonus was paid  
in cash and 50% in shares. As no bonuses were awarded for 2016, no deferred share bonus awards have been made in respect of 2016.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 71 Remuneration committee report continued
With regard to the PSP , the number of shares released to Directors at the end of the three year performance period is dependent upon 
satisfying the criteria relating to TSR and clinical and strategic milestones which are set out in the section of this report relating to the PSP .
DSBP awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the Executive Director remains an officer or employee of the Group.
Executive Directors hold options under the Circassia Holdings Limited EMI Share Option Scheme 2007 (the “EMI Scheme”); the Circassia 
Holdings Limited Unapproved Share Option Scheme 2007 (the “2007 Unapproved Scheme”); and the Circassia Holdings Limited Unapproved 
Share Option Scheme 2013 (the “2013 Unapproved Scheme”). Historically, no performance conditions have been attached to the options 
granted under these schemes. The exercise price is equal to the market value of the Company’s shares at the time the options are granted.
It was explained in the Corporate governance section of this report that the Group granted certain Non-Executive Directors share options in the 
past, when it was a private company. No further options have been granted since the IPO in 2014 and no awards will be made in the future.
Mr Paul Edick holds options under the 2007 Unapproved Scheme. Mr Edick retired from the Board on 18 May 2016. Mr Edick has been 
granted by the Board a 12 month period following retirement in which to exercise his options. This period ends on 18 May 2017 . 
Gain on exercise of share options
No Directors exercised share options in the financial year ended 31 December 2016.
Directors’ interests in shares (including shares held as Restricted shares)
As was noted earlier in this report, the Company has implemented guidelines which require the Executive Directors and key senior employees 
to build up and maintain an interest in the Ordinary shares of the Company which is equal in value to their annual base salary. For the purpose of 
assessing compliance with these guidelines, the value of the shareholding is calculated using the higher of the share price on 31 December 2016 
(94p) and the acquisition price of the shares. The value as a percentage of salary has been calculated using base salary as at 31 December 2016.
The following table shows the number of Ordinary shares beneficially owned by the Directors who served during the financial year which are 
not subject to any restrictions on transfer or to forfeiture.

No further restricted shares were awarded in the year.
Restricted shares have been subscribed for or purchased at a price of 10p per Ordinary share and, under the terms of their acquisition,  
are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and forfeiture. The restrictions lift on the earlier of a sale of the Company and the expiry  
of a vesting period of between two and three years (depending on the date of award of the Restricted shares). The Ordinary shares may  
be forfeited if the participant ceases to be employed or be an officer of the Company prior to the vesting of the shares other than by reason  
of: death; resignation; permanent incapacity; redundancy; retirement; non-renewal of a fixed term contract or consultancy.
Directors are not permitted to hold their shares in hedging arrangements or as collateral for loans without the express permission  
of the Board. None of the Directors currently holds or has held their shares in such an arrangement.

8 February 2017 and a 3% increase was applied effective 1 January 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively. This increase is in line with the

Board each year for review and approval. The Directors have reviewed 
the current and projected financial position of the Company, taking  
into account existing cash balances and available financial facilities.  
On the basis of this review, the Directors have not identified any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to adopt  
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least  
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

Auditor
Following a tender process which was conducted in Q4 2016  
for 2017 onwards, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been appointed 
as auditor and a resolution to appoint PwC will be put to the members 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware, and each 
Director has taken all the steps a Director ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of relevant audit information and to establish  
that the Auditor is aware of that information.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 77 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Annual report and accounts and financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2016
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that  
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable  
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent 
financial statements the Directors are required to:
 — properly select and consistently apply accounting policies;
 — make prudent and reasonable accounting estimates and 
judgements;
 — state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and
 — make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure  
that the financial statements and Directors Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking 
reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 — the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties which they face; and
 — the Annual report and the financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Our audit approach
Overview
 — Overall group materiality: £3.25 million which represents  
5% of loss before tax and exceptional items
 — Impact of CatSPIRE results on the carrying value of assets  
and recording costs
 — Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing  
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how  
we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  Independent Auditors’ report to the members  
of Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc continued
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 80
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impact of CatSPIRE results on the carrying value of assets 
and recording costs
We have focused on this area, as the results of the cat allergy clinical 
trials have resulted in changes to the Group’s strategy, with potential 
implications for the carrying value of certain assets (particularly 
goodwill and intangible assets) and the recording of certain costs 
(including, potentially, costs in relation to onerous R&D contracts, 
onerous leases, redundancies and share-based payments).
Goodwill and intangible assets in the Allergy cash generating unit 
(totalling £74.5m and £0.3m respectively) have been fully impaired.
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 90 (Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements), and page 99 in the notes.
We considered the impact of the clinical trial results and 
management’s future plans for the Group’s allergy programmes  
on the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets in the 
Allergy cash generating unit. We concurred that management’s 
decision to fully impair these balances was appropriate.
We reviewed management’s assessment of contractual R&D 
obligations relating to the allergy programme. We reviewed 
management’s calculations of commitments and agreed these 
back to supporting contracts or invoices.
We obtained management’s calculations in relation to onerous leases 
at two premises which are not now expected to be utilised following 
the Group’s change in strategy. We tested the mathematical accuracy 
of the provisions recorded and considered the reasonableness of the 
judgements made, e.g. in relation to assumed sub-let income.
We reviewed the Group’s redundancy plans and assessed whether 
the related costs were recorded in the same period as the relevant 
communications to employees.
For those share schemes with conditions relating to the Cat-SPIRE 
programme, we considered whether the number of shares expected 
to vest (and therefore the share-based payment charge) had been 
appropriately adjusted to reflect the outcome of the clinical trial.
No material exceptions arose from our testing.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
IAS 36 requires at least annual impairment assessments in relation to 
goodwill, indefinite- lived intangible assets and intangible assets that 
are not yet ready for use, with more regular assessment should an 
impairment trigger be identified. The results of the Cat-SPIRE clinical 
trial were considered an impairment trigger in relation to the Allergy 
cash-generating unit (CGU), resulting in full impairment of goodwill 
and intangible assets relating to this CGU (see above).
Goodwill of £84.2m and intangible assets of £167 . 1m in relation 
to the NIOX and Respiratory CGU’s are significant balances, and 
judgement is required in the impairment assessment, specifically in 
forecasting the future results of both marketed and in-development 
products. Judgement is also required in determining the discount 
rates to be applied to future cash flows. Management have utilised 
a model based on fair value less costs of disposal in relation to the 
NIOX CGU and a value-in-use model for the Respiratory CGU.
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 90 (Critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), and pages 101–103 in the notes.
We obtained management’s impairment analyses and gained an 
understanding of the key assumptions and judgements underlying  
the assessment. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology 
applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the models.
We assessed the key assumptions, including:
Future revenue streams: We compared forecast revenues to the 
Group’s business plan, obtained an understanding of the stage  
of product development and management’s expected timelines  
for product launches, including updates on the achievement of 
expected milestones. We specifically considered the reasonableness of:
 (i)  revenue growth rates in respect of NIOX (taking into account latest 
forecasts and historical growth rates); and 
 (ii)  forecasts for sales of new products, including assessing 
projected peak sales of in-development Respiratory products.
Expenses and overheads: We reviewed historical forecasting 
accuracy and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, 
including in relation to the future sales force utilisation.
Discount rate: We used experts to recalculate management’s discount 
rates and benchmark the rates against companies of a similar nature.
We found the assumptions utilised to be supportable.
We also obtained management’s sensitivity analysis and performed 
our own sensitivities (reflecting what we believed to be a range  
of reasonably possible alternative outcomes) over the forecasted 
cash flows and discount rates, the results of which did not indicate 
an impairment to goodwill. Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 81
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as  
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group,  
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which  
the group operates. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of 
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality  
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £3.25 million (2015: £0.7m).
How we determined it
Rationale for benchmark applied
5% of loss before tax and exceptional items.
Profit/loss before tax is often used as a benchmark for calculating  
the materiality of a profit-orientated business, and, since the Group  
is now generating revenue, we consider that the profit/loss before tax 
benchmark is now appropriate for Circassia. For the prior year audit, 
we used a benchmark of 1% of total expenses, as we considered 
that users were previously focused on expenditure as a key metric,  
in the absence of recurring revenues.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality 
that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality 
allocated across components was For each component in our audit 
scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components 
was between £0.74m and £3.0m. Certain components were audited 
to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall 
Group materiality. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group 
materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report  
to them misstatements identified during our audit above £162,000  
(2015: £36,000) as well as misstatements below that amount  
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 77 , in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we 
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that 
the group and parent company have adequate resources to remain 
in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least 
one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part 
of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee 
as to the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Independent Auditors’ report to the members  
of Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc continued

Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 — the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have 
nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the group and parent company acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
the statement given by the directors on page 76, in accordance 
with provision C. 1. 1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for members to assess the group’s and parent company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and parent company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
the section of the Annual Report on page 45, as required by 
provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
the directors’ confirmation on page 48 of the Annual Report, in 
accordance with provision C.2. 1 of the Code, that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
the directors’ explanation on on page 41 of the Annual Report, in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 83
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you  
if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report - Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions  
of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 78, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the directors; and
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With 
respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 89 Notes to the financial statements
The main change is that in cases where the fair value option is taken 
for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s 
own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than 
the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. 
The Group is yet to assess the impact of IFRS 9 on its financial 
information. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining 
phases of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contract with customers’ (effective 1 January 
2018) supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and specifies how and when entities recognise 
revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial 
statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard 
provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to 
all contracts with customers. The impact on the Group’s financial 
statements is currently being assessed.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019) removes the current 
distinction between an operating and finance lease, introducing consistent 
requirements for all leases similar to the current finance lease accounting. 
The impact on the Group’s financial statements is currently being 
assessed and it is anticipated that the standard will be adopted in the 
Group’s financial statements in line with the effective date stated above.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective 
that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgements 
are continually made and are based on historic experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable in the circumstances. 
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Where the Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future, the resulting accounting estimates will seldom exactly match 
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
Fair value of acquired assets
Intangibles – Technology 
In estimating the fair value of Technology, a variation of the Income 
Approach called the Relief from Royalty Method is used. This 
methodology is considered the standard and preferred technique to 
value assets such as trademark, core technology and patents. 
Intangibles – Customer Relationships and IPR&D
The Customer Relationships and IPR&D have been valued based 
on the Excess Earnings Method. This valuation method is based on 
discounting the cash flows that can be attributed to the intangible 
asset, after taking into account the contribution of other assets. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in relation to tax losses 
carried forward in Aerocrine and Prosonix, but only to the extent of 
deferred tax liabilities arising in the same jurisdictions as the brought 
forward losses. Management have concluded that it is not yet 
probable that taxable profits will be available in the relevant jurisdictions 
to utilise brought forward losses in excess of deferred tax liabilities. 
Judgement is required in making this determination. Management 
anticipate that taxable profits will be considered probable for the 
purposes of recognising deferred tax assets under IAS 12 only when 
there is a stable history of profitability in those tax jurisdictions.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
General information
The Group is a specialty pharmaceutical group focused on the 
development and commercialisation of a range of asthma and 
respiratory products. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc is a public limited company which is 
listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales. The Company is resident in England and the 
registered office is The Magdalen Centre, Robert Robinson Avenue, 
Oxford Science Park, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, OX4 4GA.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this 
financial information are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’), IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) 
interpretations endorsed by the European Union and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared using the historical 
cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain items, as stated 
in the accounting policies, and on a going concern basis.
Going concern
Though the Group continues to make losses, the Directors have 
reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group, 
taking into account existing cash balances. On the basis of this review, 
the Directors have not identified any material uncertainties  
to the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date  
of approval of the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
a)  The following new standards and amendments to standards  
were mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning  
1 January 2016 but had no significant impact on the Group: 
 — Annual improvements to IFRS 2012–2014 cycle;
 — Accounting for acquisition of interests in joint operations – 
amendments to IFRS 1 1;
 — Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and 
amortisation – amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38;
 — Equity method in separate financial statements – amendments  
to IAS 27;
 — Disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 1; and
 — Investment entities: applying the consolidation exception – 
amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28.
b)  Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
that are not yet effective (and in some cases, had not yet been 
adopted by the EU) and have not been early adopted by the Group:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, on ‘Classification and measurement’ 
(effective 1 January 2018). This is the first part of a new standard on 
classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace  
IAS 39. IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost  
and fair value. All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding 
it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent 
principal and interest. Otherwise it is at fair value through profit or loss. 
Amortised cost accounting will also be applicable for most financial 
liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 90 Share issue costs
In June 2015 the Group completed an offer and placement of new 
shares to finance the acquisitions of Aerocrine and Prosonix. Under 
IFRS incremental costs that are directly attributable to an equity 
transaction that otherwise would have been avoided had the equity 
instruments not been issued are accounted for through equity. 
Any acquisition related costs (for example due diligence) must be 
expensed in the income statement. There is a level of judgement in 
determining which costs meet the criteria of an equity transaction.
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews are undertaken 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. Judgements and estimates are made 
in respect of the carrying value of the cash generating units (CGU) 
containing the goodwill taking into account key assumptions  
(see note 14) about the product candidates. If the Group is unable to 
obtain regulatory approval or to commercialise its product candidates, 
or experiences significant delays in doing so, this could result in an 
impairment of the related goodwill and intellectual property rights.
Share based payments
Options were valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model  
or the Monte Carlo Simulation depending on the type of option issued. 
For each relevant option grant, individual valuation assumptions were 
assessed based upon conditions at the date of grant. The range  
of assumptions in the calculation of share based payments is given  
in note 25.
Non-underlying items
The Group presents certain items of income and expense as  
non-underlying in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The determination that an item should be presented as 
non-underlying is a judgement of the management. The management 
considers whether providing separate disclosure is helpful  
in understanding the underlying performance of the business,  
based on the nature and size of the items and infrequency  
of the events giving rise to them.
Business combinations
The Group accounts for all business combinations under the 
acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed  
are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Judgements 
are made in determining the basis on which goodwill arising on 
business combinations is allocated to CGUs. Estimates are made  
in relation to the cash flow forecasts, probability factors and discount 
rates used for this purpose.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which 
the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are 
consistent with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 1 1 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 1 1 
investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations 
or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations  
of each investor. Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc has assessed the 
nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint 
ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures  
are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise  
the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and 
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share 
of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint 
ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, 
form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the 
Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint 
ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting 
policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary  
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Segmental reporting
The Group had three business segments during 2016, Allergy, 
Respiratory and NIOX
®
. This is consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance, has been identified as the Executive Directors, 
who make strategic decisions.
Clinical study expenses
Where payments to clinical study sites are made in advance for the 
purchase of stocks of materials for use in clinical studies, the relevant costs 
are included in receivables as prepaid clinical study expenses. Expenses 
are charged to the income statement as clinical study services are carried 
out by third party suppliers, or clinical study materials are received. 
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, short-term bank deposits, receivables and payables 
arising directly from operations. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term 
deposits which have an original maturity of three months or less and 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Such assets 
are classified as current, where management intend to dispose of 
the asset within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. Bank 
deposits with maturity of more than 12 months after the end of the 
reporting period are classified as non-current assets.
Where derivatives exist in the financial year, they are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date, 
with any resulting gain or loss recognised through profit or loss. 
The Group does not have any committed borrowing facilities, as its 
cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits are sufficient  
to finance its current operations. Cash balances are mainly held  
on short- and medium-term deposits with quality financial institutions, 
in line with the Group’s policy to minimise the risk of loss.  
The main risks associated with the Group’s financial instruments  
relate to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk (note 2). 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 91 Notes to the financial statements continued
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards  
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives 
received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement  
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Goodwill and Intangible assets
Intangible fixed assets, relating to goodwill, customer relationships, 
technology and intellectual property rights acquired through licensing 
or assigning patents and know-how are carried at historic cost,  
less accumulated amortisation, where the useful economic life  
of the asset is finite and the asset will probably generate  
economic benefits exceeding costs.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the 
cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful lives
IPR&D 5 – 10 years
Customer Relationships 18 years
Technology 15 – 20 years
Software 5 years
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the 
excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value 
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated 
represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored 
at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to 
the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Where an acquired intangible asset is not yet available for use in 
the manner intended by management, the asset is tested annually 
for impairment by allocating the assets to the CGUs to which they 
relate. Amortisation would commence when product candidates 
underpinned by the intellectual property rights become available for 
commercial use. Amortisation would be calculated on a straight line 
basis over the shorter of the remaining useful life of the intellectual 
property or the estimated sales life of the product candidates. 
Expenditure on product development is capitalised as an intangible 
asset and amortised over the expected useful economic life of the 
product candidate concerned. Capitalisation commences from the 
point at which technical feasibility and commercial viability of the 
product candidate can be demonstrated and the Group is satisfied 
that it is probable that future economic benefits will result from the 
product candidate once completed. Capitalisation ceases when the 
product candidate receives regulatory approval for launch. No such 
costs have been capitalised to date.
Expenditure on research and development activities that do not meet 
the above criteria, including ongoing costs associated with acquired 
intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights generated 
internally by the Group, is charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Intellectual property and in-process research and development from 
acquisitions are recognised as intangible assets at fair value. Any 
residual excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets  
in an acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Computer Software
Expenditure on software costs are capitalised as an intangible asset 
and amortised over the expected useful economic life of the software. 
Until such an asset is fully developed, the costs are capitalised and 
classified within intangibles assets as ‘Software in development’. 
These costs are not amortised until the software has been fully 
developed and operational, at which point the total cost of the 
software development is amortised over its estimated useful life.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are recognised and carried  
at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting 
period. Investments are impaired where there is objective evidence that 
the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of the acquisition cost and the net 
realisable value. The FIFO (first in, first out) principle is used to calculate 
the value of inventories. Inventories mainly comprise products for sale 
and stocks of components for the service activities in Sweden and the 
US. The acquisition value comprises all expenses for purchases. The 
net realisable value is the expected sale price less expected costs for 
preparation and selling.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill  
or intangible assets not ready for use, are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject  
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial 
assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Charges 
or credits for impairment are passed through the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of replaced parts 
is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate  
the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Property, plant and equipment Depreciation rate
Leasehold improvements
Over the life of the unbreakable 
portion of the lease
Plant and equipment 10% – 33% 
Fixtures and fittings 20%
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 92 Individually significant tangible assets that are intended to be held by 
the Group for use in the production or supply of goods and services 
or for administrative purposes and that are expected to provide 
economic benefit for more than one year are capitalised. All other 
assets of insignificant value are charged to the income statement  
in the year of acquisition.
Costs incurred relating to an asset that is not yet complete are 
capitalised and held as Assets under construction until they are 
brought into use. The asset is then transferred to the appropriate  
asset class and depreciated in line with the policy above.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less any 
provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions are made where there 
is evidence of a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, 
previous experience and general economic conditions. When  
a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written  
off, firstly against any provision available and then to the income 
statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided  
for are credited to the income statement. Other receivables  
are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision  
for impairment. A provision for impairment of other receivables  
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group  
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have 
been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. They 
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised 
cost. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is 
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current 
liabilities.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If 
the amounts involved are significant, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate which 
reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money 
and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the 
Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which would cause 
this to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable 
amount of the interest in the property is expected to be insufficient to 
cover the future obligations relating to the lease.
A charge for restructuring costs is taken to the income statement 
when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring 
plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or the Group has 
a constructive obligation, for example having made an announcement 
publicly to the employee or the Group as a whole.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities  
of three months or less from the date of original investment. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Employee benefit costs
The Group makes contributions to defined contribution personal 
pension schemes for its Directors and employees. The pension  
cost charge recognised in the year represents amounts payable  
by the Group to the funds. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions 
are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services  
from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) 
of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. 
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the  
fair value of the options granted:
 — including the effect of any market performance conditions  
(for example, an entity’s share price);
 — excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets 
and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time 
period); and
 — including the impact of any non-vesting conditions  
(for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.  
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which  
is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions  
are to be satisfied.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, 
measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity 
financial statements.
The Group’s employees participate in various share option schemes 
as disclosed in note 25. Equity settled share based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period of the award. At the end of each 
reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the number of options 
that are expected to become exercisable. The financial consequences 
of revisions to the original estimates, if any, are recognised in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The fair value of share options is measured using either the Black 
Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation. This 
is dependent on the conditions attached to each of the issued 
options. Where conditions are non-market based the Black Scholes 
option pricing model is used. Where market based conditions are 
attached to options, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo 
Simulation. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 93 Notes to the financial statements continued
Other employee benefits
The expected cost of compensated short-term absence (e.g. holidays) 
is recognised when employees render services that increase their 
entitlement. An accrual is made for holidays earned but not taken, and 
prepayments recognised for holidays taken in excess of days earned. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable 
for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s 
activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax and trade discounts 
and after elimination of intra-Group sales. Income is reported as follows: 
Sale of goods 
The Group sells medical technology equipment that enables 
inflammation of the airways to be measured as well as consumable 
items and spare parts. Sales are reported as income when the 
significant risks and benefits have transferred to the buyer and the 
seller no longer has any significant control over the goods. The Group 
provides 12 month guarantees for certain products and includes  
a provision for estimated future claims. 
Licence income 
Technology and product licensing revenue represents amounts 
earned for licences granted under licensing agreements, including 
up-front payments, milestone payments and technology access fees. 
Revenues are recognised when this income becomes non-refundable 
under the terms of the licence and where the Group’s obligations 
related to the revenues have been completed. Refundable licensing 
revenue is treated as deferred until such time that it is no longer 
refundable. In general, up-front payments are deferred and amortised 
in line with the period of development. Milestone payments relating to 
defined project achievements are recognised as income when  
the milestone is accomplished.
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accrued basis and represents 
income earned as a percentage of product sales in accordance with 
the relevant agreement net of any amounts contractually payable to 
others under the terms of the relevant royalty agreement.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated  
into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial 
year. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling  
at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign 
exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the year  
in which they arise and presented within ‘Finance costs or income’.
Foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations 
into the Group presentational currency, are recognised as a separate 
element of other comprehensive income. Cumulative exchange 
differences are presented in a separate component of equity entitled 
Translation reserve.
Taxation including deferred tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year, 
adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of each reporting period. 
The Group is entitled to claim tax credits in the United Kingdom for 
certain research and development expenditure. The amount included 
in the financial statements at the year end represents the credit 
receivable by the Group for the year and adjustments to prior years. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect  
of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.  
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised  
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the average tax rates that are expected  
to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive 
income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly  
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2. Financial and capital risk management
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
ability to continue as a going concern and ensure that sufficient capital 
is in place to fund the Group’s activities. The Group’s principal method 
of adjusting the capital available has been through issuing new shares. 
During 2015, the Company issued 95,469,537 Ordinary shares which 
funded the acquisitions of Aerocrine and Prosonix. The shares were 
offered at 288.05p each, raising gross proceeds of £275.0 million. 
The Group’s capital is comprised of share capital and share premium, 
which are disclosed in notes 24 and 26 respectively. The Group 
monitors the availability of capital with regard to its forecast future 
expenditure on an ongoing basis.
Transaction and translation risk
Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the Group’s results 
and financial condition. The Group prepares its financial statements 
in pounds sterling, but a significant proportion of its expenditure and 
subsidiary results are in various currencies including US dollars, 
Swedish krona and Euros. The Group does not currently hedge 
against translation risk. 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s simple structure and the lack of external debt financing 
reduces the range of financial risks to which it is exposed. Monitoring 
of financial risk is part of the Board’s ongoing risk management, the 
effectiveness of which is reviewed annually. The Group’s agreed 
policies are implemented by the Chief Executive Officer, who submits 
periodic reports to the Board. 
Foreign exchange risk
The majority of operating costs are denominated in Sterling, United 
States dollars, Euro or Swedish krona. Foreign exchange risk arises 
from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and 
liabilities. The nature or level of risk that the Group is exposed to has 
changed during 2016 as a result of the UK referendum decision to 
leave the European Union. It is considered that it is too early to quantify 
the exact impact for the Group and the Directors will keep the situation 
under review and act to mitigate any increased risks accordingly.
In relation to foreign currency risk, the Group’s policy is to hold 
the majority of its funds in Sterling, and to use short-medium-term 
currency purchase options (including spot purchases and forward 
contracts) and interest-bearing foreign currency deposits to manage 
short-medium-term fluctuations in exchange rates. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 94 The change in foreign exchange rates that is assessed to be 
reasonably likely for each currency in 2016 is 15% (2015: 5%). 
At 31 December 2016, if the Euro had weakened / strengthened  
by 15% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, the post 
tax loss for the year would have been £1.6 million (2015: £0.5 million) 
lower /higher, as a result of net foreign exchange gains/losses on 
translation of Euro-denominated payables, receivables and foreign 
exchange losses /gains on translation of Euro-denominated bank 
balances.
The impact on post tax loss at 31 December 2016 of a 15% 
weakening / strengthening of the US dollar against Sterling with all 
other variables held constant would have been a decrease/increase  
of £0.6 million (2015: £1.3 million). 
The impact on post tax loss at 31 December 2016 of a 15% 
weakening / strengthening of the Swedish krona against Sterling 
with all other variables held constant would have been a decrease /
increase of £0.3 million (2015: £1. 1 million).
The Group is also exposed to currency translation risk in respect of 
the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its overseas 
subsidiaries. At present, the Group does not consider this to be 
a significant risk since the Group does not intend to move assets 
between Group companies.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy in relation to interest rate risk is to monitor short- 
and medium-term interest rates and to place cash on deposit for 
periods that optimise the amount of interest earned while maintaining 
access to sufficient funds to meet day to day cash requirements. 
The Group does not have any committed external borrowing facilities, 
as its cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposit balances are 
sufficient to finance its current operations. Consequently, there is no 
material exposure to interest rate risk in respect of interest payable. 
If interest rates had been 10 basis points higher / lower the impact on 
net loss in 2016 would have been an increase / decrease of £0. 1 million 
(2015: £0.2 million) due to changes in the amount of interest receivable. 
Credit risk
The Group’s policy following Admission to the London Stock 
Exchange is to place funds with financial institutions which have 
a minimum credit rating with Fitch IBCA of A- long-term / F1 short-
term. During 2016 the Group placed funds on deposit with 7 banks 
(2015: 10 banks). The Group does not allocate a quota to individual 
institutions but seeks to diversify its investments, where this is 
consistent with achieving competitive rates of return. It is the Group’s 
policy to place not more than £35 million (or the equivalent in other 
currencies) with any one counterparty.
The value of financial instruments held represents the maximum 
exposure that the Group has to them. There is no collateral held for 
this type of credit risk.
No credit limits were exceeded during any of the periods reported, 
and management does not expect any material losses from non-
performance by these counterparties.
Cash flow and liquidity risk
Funds are generally placed on deposit with the maturity profile of 
investments being structured to ensure that sufficient liquid funds 
are available to meet operating requirements. The Directors do not 
consider that there is presently a material cash flow or liquidity risk.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant 
maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance 
sheet date to the contractual maturity date. There were no financial 
liabilities outstanding for periods greater than one year. The amounts 
disclosed in the table are the contracted undiscounted cash flows:

3. Operating segments
The chief operating decision-maker (the Executive Directors) is 
responsible for making key operating decisions in the Group. 
Assessment of performance and decisions regarding the allocation 
of resources are made by operating segment. The 2016 operating 
segments are identified within the Group by product portfolios:
 — Allergy: relates to a range of immunotherapy development 
products. 
 — NIOX
®
 relates to the portfolio of products used to improve asthma 
diagnosis and management by measuring fractional exhaled nitric 
oxide (FeNO) and 
 — Respiratory relates to the portfolio of asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease product candidates.
The table below presents information regarding the Group’s operating 
segments for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015. During 
2016 the Aerocrine and Prosonix businesses acquired in June 2015 
have been further integrated into the Group resulting in consolidation 
of some operations (mainly support functions). Hence some costs are 
now shared between the segments and are not allocated to individual 
segments for decision making purposes.

expenditure of £8.7 million (2015: £1 1.8 million).
A reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been substantively enacted. UK deferred

During 2015, Circassia completed the acquisition of two businesses, resulting in the recognition of £77 .2 million of goodwill. The majority of this 
goodwill related to the acquisition of Aerocrine AB (NIOX
®
 business). This goodwill was allocated to the NIOX
®
 and Allergy (existing Circassia 
business) cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing purposes as the benefits of the Aerocrine acquisition were split between these 
CGUs. The goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Prosonix Limited (Respiratory business) has been allocated to the Respiratory CGU, 
being the CGU for impairment testing purposes.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 101 Notes to the financial statements continued
The goodwill arising on the Aerocrine acquisition was attributable to the benefit of having an established sales force with future customer 
relationships. A large element of the advantages of having an established sales force was expected to accrue to the Allergy business as its 
products could have been cross sold to the same customers by this sales force. The acquisition of Aerocrine was based on a strategic benefit 
to the Allergy CGU in leveraging the existing sales force within the business to generate future sales within Circassia. Goodwill was allocated 
based on the proportion of discounted cash flows attributable to each CGU. For this reason, 94% of the goodwill acquired on acquisition  
of Aerocrine was allocated to the Allergy CGU. 
Following the cat allergy immunotherapy phase III study results, the Allergy portfolio value has been fully discounted resulting in the impairment 
charge during 2016 for the Allergy CGU of £74.5 million.
The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year end exchange rates, is allocated to the following CGUs:

The recoverable amount of the Respiratory CGU is assessed using a value in use model. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of 
the projected risk-adjusted pre-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. 
The value in use for the Respiratory CGU was calculated over a ten year period using a discount factor of 13% (being a weighted average  
cost of capital rate for the CGU used by some analysts covering the Group). The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections. In light  
of the stage of development of the product candidates these cover a ten year period. Cash flows beyond the ten year period were extrapolated 
using the estimated terminal growth rate stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business. 
The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects specific risks relating to the Group and uncertainties surrounding the cash flow projections, 
particularly in relation to the assumed successful launch of the Group’s products in the expected timeframe and the resulting sales.
As a result of recent strategic developments, management deemed it appropriate to change the valuation basis for the NIOX
®
 CGU. The 
recoverable amount of the NIOX
®
 CGU is assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model (2015: value in use model). Fair value less 
costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a pre-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted  
pre-tax cash flows and terminal value of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which 
are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value less costs of disposal for the NIOX
®
 CGU was calculated over a ten year period using a discount factor of 10% (being a weighted 
average cost of capital rate for the CGU used by some analysts covering the Group). The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections.  
Cash flows beyond the ten year period were extrapolated using the estimated terminal growth rate stated below. The growth rate does not 
exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects specific risks relating to the Group 
and uncertainties surrounding the cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used for the valuations of the Respiratory and NIOX
®
 CGUs are as follows:
 Respiratory CGU NIOX
®
 CGU
Valuation basis Value in use Fair value less cost of disposal
Anticipated launch dates Group product candidate portfolio 2017 – 2026 n / a – commercialised product
Research and development costs

as related expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialisation
Sales value, volume and growth rates
Estimates of sales value, volume and growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal 
and external market information and market research commissioned by the Company
Advertising and promotion investment Based on management forecasts of advertising and promotion required in the key territories

In each case the valuations of Respiratory and NIOX

 indicate sufficient headroom such that a change to key assumptions that are reasonably 
possible is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill. 
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 102 Impact of possible changes in key assumptions

in the Respiratory CGU is delayed by two years.

An impairment test is performed annually based on the value in use of the intangible assets. 
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment and tests more frequently when events  
or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. Due to the negative result of the investigational cat allergy 
immunotherapy phase III study and the subsequent impact on a wider Allergy product portfolio, related licences and patents have been  
fully impaired in 2016. Key assumptions and sensitivities used in the impairment review are disclosed in note 14.
In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D)
IPR&D comprise a portfolio of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease product candidates still in development.
The IPR&D has been initially valued using the Excess Earnings Method. This valuation method is based on discounting the cash flows  
that are attributable to the intangible asset, after taking into account the contribution of other assets. IPR&D assets are tested for impairment  
on the same basis. 
Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the existing customers, as at the date of acquisition that are expected to continue to support the business.  
A remaining useful life of 18 years was determined at acquisition. Amortisation has been calculated on a straight line basis over this period  
from the date of acquisition.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2016 103 Notes to the financial statements continued
Technology
Prosonix achieves a sophisticated level of control over the physicochemical properties of drug particles via an integrated platform of unique 
and proprietary particle engineering technologies and formulation processes. The Relief from Royalty Method was used to determine the 
fair value of the acquired Technology. In the Relief from Royalty Method, estimates of the value of these types of intangible assets are made 
by capitalising the royalties saved because the company owns the intangible asset. A remaining useful life of 20 years was determined at 
acquisition and amortisation will commence when the products underpinned by this technology become available for commercial use.  
A value in use model is used in testing for impairment.
Aerocrine has been developing its technology to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (“FeNO”) since the mid-1990s. The Company was  
the first to develop an instrument for the measurement of FeNO and is continuously developing the measurement FeNO as a valuable tool  
in the management of airway inflammation. The valuation of the Technology was based on pre-determined hypothetical royalty rate attributable 
to the use of the Technology. The estimated remaining useful life of the Technology is 15 years. Amortisation has been calculated on a straight 
line basis over this period from the date of acquisition.

Exercisable at 31 December 1,014 0.36 708 0.0008
The exercise prices of the share options outstanding at the end of the year were £nil, £0.0008 and £2.42 (2015: £nil, £0.0008 and £2.42).  
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the period was 7 .9 years (2015: 8.2 years).
There were no options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2016 or 2015. 
Valuation models
The fair value of PSP share options granted during the period was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model  
and Black Scholes model dependent on the performance vesting conditions. 
There have been no EMI Scheme or Unapproved Scheme options granted during the year (2015: nil), all options granted  
in previous years were valued using the Black Scholes model.
Black Scholes
There were no options granted during the year (2015: nil) that were valued solely using the Black Scholes model. 
Monte Carlo Simulation
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo Simulation model in calculating the fair values  
of the options granted during the year:
 2016 2015
Exercise price £0.0008 £0.0008
Expected volatility 35% 32%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Expected dividends 0% 0%
Risk free interest rate 0.4% 1%
The Monte Carlo Simulation model has been used to value the portion of the awards which have a market performance vesting condition  
(Total Shareholder Return (TSR)). The model incorporates a discount factor reflecting this performance condition into the fair value of this portion 
of the award.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model at the grant date was 
£1.75 per option (2015: £2.04).
For the options valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation, expected volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural 
logarithm of share price movements of comparable companies. This is a standard approach to calculating volatility. The risk free rate of return  
is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities as at the date of grant (i.e. Gilts in the UK) over the expected term (i.e. three years).
Restricted shares
The Company previously made awards of Ordinary shares to employees and Non-Executive Directors by entering into a form of restricted 
share agreement with each participant, under which the participant subscribed for or purchased Ordinary shares in the Company at 10p  
per ordinary share (converted into 0.08p shares post capital reorganisation). These shares are subject to certain restrictions on transfer  
and forfeiture, as set out in the restricted share agreement. The restrictions lift on the earlier of a sale of the Company and the expiry  
of a vesting period of between two and three years (depending on the date of award of the restricted shares).
There were 0. 1 million Ordinary shares of 0.08p (2015: 0.6 million Ordinary shares of 0.08p) in issue at 31 December 2016.
Deferred shares
During the year the Group awarded 156,035 (2015: 1 10,845) deferred shares to Executive Directors as part of a deferred bonus for 2015. 
The shares are held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust until the third anniversary of the grant date when they will transfer to the Executive 
Directors so long as they are still an officer or employee of the Group.

Phase II 
In phase II trials a new product 
candidate is studied in a relatively 
homogenous population of 
subjects who have the relevant 
disease/disorder. These studies 
are undertaken to further 
characterise possible adverse 
effects and safety risks, and to 
explore the preliminary or potential 
efficacy of the product candidate, 
as well as dosage tolerance and 
the optimal effective dose
Phase IIb
Phase II studies are sometimes 
further divided into two phases: 
phase IIa trials are designed 
to assess dosage (how much 
product candidate subjects 
should be given); and phase IIb 
trials are specifically designed 
to study efficacy (how well the 
product candidate works at a 
prescribed dose). Often phase II 
trials are designed as randomised 
clinical studies, where some 
subjects receive the product 
candidate and others receive 
a placebo/standard treatment. 
Randomised phase II trials 
typically have fewer subjects  
than randomised phase III trials
Phase III
When phase II trials demonstrate 
that a specific dosage range 
of the product candidate is 
likely to be effective and has 
an acceptable safety profile, 
confirmatory phase III trials are 
undertaken. These studies are 
intended to provide an adequate 
basis for establishing the benefit/
risk ratio for a subsequent 
application for marketing approval. 
Therefore, a sufficiently high 
number of subjects must be 
enrolled and exposed to the 
product candidate for a duration 
which will provide adequate 
efficacy and safety data for the 
envisaged clinical use. The 
studies must be controlled, i.e. 
compare the product candidate  
to placebo and/or to active 
treatment depending on  
the medical condition and 
the product candidate under 
investigation. Confirmatory 
phase III trials on specific 
immunotherapy for the treatment 
of allergic diseases should be 
performed using a randomised 
placebo-controlled double-blind 
design
Placebo

treatment or procedure
Placebo controlled

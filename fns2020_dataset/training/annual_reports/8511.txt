GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
27228_Text.indd   6 30/10/08   14:47:56 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I stated in the Annual Report for 2006, that 
we intended to capitalise on our leading 
position in the London office fit out market by 
pursuing an acquisition strategy which would 
diversify the business by activity, sector and 
by region. These results demonstrate the 
benefits of this strategy. Over this period, 
the contribution from our businesses outside 
London has risen from 11% to 57% of group 
trading operating profit.
To achieve this, the group has moved in 
three strategic directions: firstly to provide 
to our global office fit out customers a wider 
geographic service through Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia, secondly to establish a 
national retail and leisure fit out business and 
thirdly to widen and deepen our new build 
and refurbishment construction services to 
our UK customers outside of London. 
 
During the year we continued to consolidate 
further our position in a number of key 
markets. In the UK we acquired the Pearce 
Group in November 2007, which brought us 
a South West based regional construction 
business and a highly regarded national food 
retail fit out and refurbishment business.  
Overseas in September 2007, our European 
associate, Interior Alpha SA (IASA), became 
a wholly owned subsidiary. Both have made 
a substantial contribution to the group results 
in the period of ownership. With these and 
earlier acquisitions performing at or above 
our expectations, the delivery of our strategy 
has cushioned our performance from an over 
reliance on the London office fit out market.
We continue to seek acquisition and 
partnering opportunities overseas. Prior to  
the year end we announced the signing of 
Heads of Terms to form a 50:50 joint venture 
with the Al Habtoor Leighton Group, to 
provide fit out services across the Middle 
East region. Based in Dubai, they are one 
of the largest Middle East construction 
services groups. To support the group in the 
development of its international operations 
I was pleased to welcome Greg Aldridge 
to the Board in January 2008 as Corporate 
Development Director. Greg has worked 
in the City for many years, has extensive 
corporate finance experience and a long 
association with the group.
We are a service business and our success 
depends upon the dedication of our people 
and their willingness to subscribe to our 
culture of excellence, customer satisfaction, 
quality and safety. These results reflect their 
hard work and commitment at all levels in the 
group and I thank them.
THE GROUP’S DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY OVER RECENT YEARS HAS HELPED DELIVER 
ANOTHER YEAR OF RECORD PROFITS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND AMORTISATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR  
THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008 INCREASED TO £14.1M FROM £10.6M LAST YEAR. 
ADJUSTED BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
1
 ROSE BY 21% FROM 29.9P TO 36.2P . THE BOARD 
IS PROPOSING A FINAL DIVIDEND OF 9.2P PER SHARE RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE 
TOTAL DIVIDEND OF NEARLY 15% TO 13.2P PER SHARE FROM 11.5P PER SHARE. We have ended the year with a number  
of major project wins, including the 
Velodrome for the 2012 Olympics and the 
fit out of KPMG’s new 400,000 sq ft UK 
headquarters building in Canary Wharf, so 
that our total order book at 30 June 2008 
has risen from £843m at the last year end to 
£1,051m, 70% of which is due for completion 
in the current year. Whilst prepared for further 
turbulence in the world economy, this gives 
us confidence that next year’s results  
should show further progress.

Financial Highlights
For the year ended 30 June 2008,  
adjusted profit before tax
1
 increased by 
33% to £14.1m (2007 - £10.6m). Adjusted 
basic earnings per share
2
 grew by 21% 
to 36.22p (2007 - 29.91p). As anticipated, 
volumes increased by 33% to £1,110m 
(2007 - £833m), with fee income in the 
year increasing by 43% to £150.3m (2007 - 
£104.8m).
The strong improvement in performance,  
with adjusted group operating profit
1
 
increasing by 56% to £15.1m (2007 - £9.7m), 
has been driven by a combination of organic 
and acquisition growth. Our overseas 
businesses generated operating profits of 
£4.9m (2007 - £1.5m) and now represent 
26% of group trading operating profit, with  
a full year contribution from ISG Asia of £1.8m 
(2007 - £0.8m) and a nine month contribution 
from IASA from its activities in Europe of 
£3.0m (2007 - £0.7m). Our National Retail 
and Leisure businesses generated operating 
profits of £3.9m (2007 - £2.0m) which now 
represents 21% of group trading operating 
profit. Included in this result was a full year 
contribution from ISG Cathedral and a  
seven and a half month contribution from 
Pearce Retail.
Our London operations increased operating 
profit by 22% to £7.9m (2007 - £6.5m), 
representing 43% of group trading operating 
profit. The operating profit of our Regional 
Construction businesses increased to £1.8m 
(2007 - £1.5m) and included a seven and a 
half month contribution from Pearce  
Regional Construction.  
Throughout the year operating cash flow has 
remained strong with net cash inflow from 
operating activities increasing in the year 
to £20.4m (2007 - £11.5m). Along with the 
increase in bank borrowings during the year 
to fund one of our recent acquisitions, this 
resulted in net cash as at 30 June 2008 of 
£35.3m (2007 - £22.3m).
Dividend
An interim dividend of 4.00p was paid in April 
2008. A final dividend of 9.20p is proposed 
bringing the total to 13.20p (2007 - 11.50p), 
an increase of 15%. Subject to its approval 
at the AGM on 8 December 2008, the final 
dividend will be payable on 10 December 
2008 to shareholders on the register on 14 
November 2008. The ex-dividend date will 
be 12 November 2008. The closing date for 
elections for the Dividend Re-Investment  
Plan is 14 November 2008.

27228_Text.indd   11 30/10/08   14:56:34 Strategic Developments
Over the past three years the group’s key 
strategic priority has been to reduce its 
dependency on the London office sector 
via organic and acquisitive growth outside 
London, whilst retaining our leading market 
position in the sector. The result of our efforts 
over this period has been to increase the 
group trading operating profit outside London 
from 11% to 57% of the group, and we are 
targeting this to increase further in the  
current year.  
Growth in our overseas operations
During the last twelve months we have 
extended our geographic capabilities for our 
clients by fully integrating into the group 
our existing European associate and, more 
recently, agreeing terms to create a joint 
venture in the Middle East.
We completed in September 2007 
the acquisition of the remaining 80% 
shareholding in IASA. The business offers 
office, hotel, leisure and retail fit out services 
across mainland Europe, from offices in Paris, 
Milan and Frankfurt. During the nine months 
of trading since acquisition, the company has 
generated an operating profit of £3.0m on 
£30.1m of work delivered. 
The European market place provides 
considerable opportunity and we will seek 
to continue to build our presence and brand 
across the region. We anticipate opening  
an office in Switzerland in the current year 
and we have just won our first contract 
in Poland. We are seeking joint venture 
opportunities in both Eastern and Western 
European countries.
In Asia, we have continued to expand 
organically our activities in China and  
Hong Kong.
 
Whilst we have a growing project 
management presence in North Asia,  
we presently have limited exposure in South 
East Asia where we are now pursuing 
acquisition opportunities to build a wider  
regional presence.  
In April, we announced entering into Heads 
of Terms with the Al Habtoor Leighton Group, 
one of the largest construction services 
groups across the Middle East region, to 
establish a 50:50 joint venture based in Dubai, 
to provide fit out services across the Middle 
East region. We are targeting completion by 
the end of October 2008 once the relevant 
government approvals are in place.
We have supported these expansion plans 
from London by strengthening both our 
acquisition capability and our group resources 
for servicing our international clients.
Growth in our National Retail and 
Leisure operations
 
The acquisition of Pearce Retail as part of 
the Pearce Group in November 2007 has 
strengthened substantially our retail offering 
with the addition of a leading national retail fit 
out business that works on a framework basis 
with major food and clothing retailers such 
as Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Morrisons and 
Marks & Spencer. For the seven and a half 
months of activity the business generated an 
operating profit of £1.3m on revenue  
of £49.2m.
From 1 July 2008, the businesses of ISG 
Dean and Bowes and ISG Cathedral have 
been combined and re-branded as ISG Retail 
and Leisure, operating from three locations 
in Whitstable, Huntingdon and Chorley.  
The integration of the two businesses will 
provide an enhanced level of service to our 
key national banking and high street retail 
customers. Recently we have secured 
a five year retail roll out programme for 
Lloyds TSB extending our decade long 
relationship, together with a five year 
framework appointment with RBS, an annual 
extension to the HSBC framework and a new 
appointment to a framework with the HBOS 
group. In addition, we have commenced 
working with Barclays and have now 
completed several projects. In the financial 
year ended 30 June 2008, the business 
delivered projects with revenue totalling 
£28m under these appointments and we are 
targeting a 50% increase in the current year. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT [continued]
Increasing our UK Regional 
Construction activities
The acquisition of Pearce Construction as 
part of the Pearce Group in November 2007 
has expanded our coverage into the South 
West of England and South Wales, delivering 
build solutions for both public and private 
sector clients. The business has over four 
social housing frameworks and a number of 
other public sector frameworks. In line with 
our expectations, the business generated 
an operating profit for the seven and a half 
month period of £0.2m on revenue  
of £50.4m.
Our regional construction businesses have 
been targeting the education sector where 
the government is currently spending around 
£7 billion per year. We were pleased to 
announce recently our appointment as the 
preferred contractor on a £50m education 
project for Suffolk County Council to build the 
South West Ipswich and South Suffolk Sixth 
Form Centre, currently subject to planning 
permission. Our appointment came on the 
back of four significant UK education projects 
that have been secured by our regional 
construction businesses in the last six months 
with a combined contract value of almost 
£80m; Gateway College in Leicestershire 
(£20m), St John’s School in Marlborough 
(£18m), St Brendan’s College in Bristol  
(£13m) and Sir John Deane’s College in 
Cheshire (£26m).
Rebalancing of our London activities
Over the last two years we have been 
reducing the London business exposure to 
the office market by targeting opportunities 
in the Olympics, student accommodation, 
data centres, transport, government and local 
authority sectors.
 
Current major projects outside the office 
market include the St Pancras Eurostar 
terminal, the Velodrome for the 2012 
Olympics and Nido Spitalfields student 
accommodation.

 Project of the Year
1 Trading
The following is a summary of the fee income and gross value of work 
performed (“volumes”) and a summary of the forward order book.
The strong improvement in trading has continued throughout the year.  
Fee income, volumes and forward order book increased year on year  
by 43%, 33% and 25% respectively. Adjusted group operating margin
1
 
on fee income increased to 10.0% (2007 - 9.3%). 
In respect of the order book of £1,051m at the end of June 2008, only 
33% of the activity relates to the UK corporate office sector (2007 
- 60%), with 35% relating to the education, affordable housing and 
government sectors (2007 - 15%) and 25% to the retail and leisure 
sector (2007 - 18%).
The group continues to focus on being a leader in health and safety 
excellence having won 15 Gold Awards and one Gold Medal in May 
2008 from The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The 
group’s Accident Incident Rate during the year was a ratio of 5.38, 
compared to the industry average of 8.65. We are currently reviewing 
our practices to continue to improve performance in this key area.

London Fit out
London Fit out maintained a strong 
performance. Volumes remained constant 
at £309m (2007 - £310m), with fee income 
rising 7% to £36.4m (2007 - £34.0m). Notable 
project delivery successes were the fit out 
of the common areas of the new St Pancras 
Eurostar Terminal, the new London offices 
for the Financial Services Authority and for 
Eversheds, the second phase of the refit of 
Shell House on the South Bank, three projects 
for RBS in the City and the new London head 
office for Standard Chartered Bank.
In line with the previously reported reduction 
in opportunities for major projects (>£25m) 
resulting from the current lack of large scale 
new office space in the City, the June 2008 
forward order book has declined to £174m 
(2007 - £208m), with the June 2008 in 
year order book declining to £103m (2007 - 
£190m) including the completion of current 
projects for Transport for London, Mayer 
Brown International and Unilever. However 
since the year end, five contracts have been 
won with an aggregate contract value of 
£107m (of which £80m is to be delivered by 
June 2009), including a £75m data centre fit 
out construction management contract in the 
North East of England and a £15m office fit 
out for the legal firm Reed Smith. With the 
planned start on site of the circa £50m fit out 
of KPMG’s new UK headquarters building in 
Canary Wharf in May 2009 and a number of 
large potential projects in the pipeline, we 
remain confident of being able to maintain 
the current activity levels for 2009/10 with an 
existing order book of circa £100m.
London Build
London Build division’s volume increased 
by 38% to £279m (2007 - £202m) and 
fee income increased by 27% to £28.2m 
(2007 - £22.2m). The increased volume has 
been driven by our success working for 
repeat relationships, where in the year we 
worked on ten new build projects and 15 
refurbishment projects. Operationally, notable 
successes in the period were the delivery of 
the Aviatior Hotel in Farnborough, the base 
build for the Audi show rooms in Brentford, 
Horseferry House for Derwent London, 
Howick Place for Fabbriche Ceramiche 
Investments, One Finsbury Circus for Hermes 
and 14 Cornhill for IVG Asticus. In addition, 
we are making good progress on the Nido 
Spitalfields 32 storey student accommodation 
tower for Blackstone, the Stratton Street 
scheme for Grafton Advisors, the Savannah 
House scheme for Standard Life and 
Fleetway House for Tishman Speyer.
As at June 2008, London Build starts the 
current year with an increased forward order 
book of £357m (2007 - £318m), of which 
the June 2008 in year order book is £215m 
(2007 - £237m). Included in the order book is 
the Velodrome for the London 2012 Olympic 
Games but with a start on site envisaged in 
early 2009, there will only be modest activity 
in the financial year ended 30 June 2009. 
OUR LONDON OPERATIONS HAD ANOTHER STRONG YEAR. VOLUMES GREW BY 15% 
TO £588M (2007 - £512M) AND FEE INCOME GREW BY 15% TO £64.6M (2007 - £56.2M).  
OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED BY 21% TO £7.9M (2007 - £6.5M), RESULTING IN AN 
OPERATING MARGIN ON FEE INCOME OF 12.3% (2007 - 11.6%). WITH THE WELL 
PUBLICISED SLOW DOWN IN THE OFFICE MARKET, WE HAVE REDUCED THE VOLUME 
TARGET FOR LONDON IN THE CURRENT YEAR BY 23% TO £450M. AS AT JUNE 2008,  
THE BUSINESS HAS AN IN YEAR ORDER BOOK COVERAGE OF 70% (2007 - 73%). 1. Client: AXA Investment Managers

3 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT REGIONAL CONSTRUCTION & 
NATIONAL RETAIL ANd LEISURE
Regional Construction
The Regional Construction businesses 
had a strong year with volumes increasing 
44% to £302m (2007 - £210m) and fee 
income increasing 33% to £39.7m (2007 - 
£29.9m). Excluding the acquisition of Pearce 
Construction, organic growth was 22% in 
volume and 10% in fee income. Operating 
profit increased by 20% to £1.8m (2007 
- £1.5m). The result has been impacted 
by a £0.5m provision against an insurance 
recovery that is currently under dispute 
and a £0.5m provision against the carrying 
value of one of the two remaining properties 
held for development. As anticipated at 
acquisition, Pearce Construction contributed 
an operating profit of £0.2m as the business 
was completing a number of challenging 
projects with low inherent margins. With the 
recruitment of a new divisional director now 
in place, we are anticipating a substantial 
improvement in the current year. 
Operationally, notable successes in the period 
were the delivery of the fit out of new offices 
for the lawyers Halliwells in Manchester, a 
hotel for Holiday Inn in Burnley, the fit out 
of new offices for Cadbury Trebor Basset in 
Edgbaston, two Village Hotels in Ashton Moss 
and Leeds, an industrial building in Royston, 
an affordable housing scheme for Sanctuary 
in Barnet and an Extra Care housing scheme 
for Moorland. In addition we are making good 
progress on the Nelson and Colne College 
in Lancashire, the fit out of retail areas at 
Manchester Airport, the redevelopment of the 
Civic Building in Barnsley, the refurbishment 
of Her Majesty’s Prison Hindley and Lancaster 
Castle and offices in Rotherham.
Across our Regional Construction businesses 
we now have the benefit of 18 public sector 
frameworks covering affordable housing, local 
authorities and prisons. We anticipate that 
these will contribute £63m of revenue in the 
next financial year (2008 - £31m), of which 
£41m is already secured.
 
Our Regional Construction businesses start 
the year with an increased order book, 
up 30% at £305m (2007 - £234m) and an 
increase of 17% excluding the impact of 
acquisitions. 51% of the June 2008 order 
book relates to public sector spend and with 
further wins anticipated in the education and 
social housing sectors, we would expect the 
proportion of public sector work to continue 
to increase.
National Retail and Leisure
Overall our National Retail and Leisure 
operations performed well during the year, 
with volumes increasing by 145% to £137m 
(2007 - £56m) and fee income increasing by 
154% to £24.9m (2007 - £9.8m). The results 
include full year contributions from ISG 
Cathedral (2007 - eleven weeks) and an  
seven and a half month contribution from 
Pearce Retail.  
Operating profit increased by 99% to 
£3.9m (2007 - £2.0m), resulting in an 
operating margin on fee income of 15.8% 
(2007 - 20.2%). The results benefited from 
the inclusion of ISG Cathedral and Pearce 
Retail but the operating margins have been 
impacted by an underperformance in ISG 
Dean and Bowes in the second half of the 
year due to the well publicised lower high 
street fashion retail spend and a challenging 
project for one of our retail clients.  
27228_Text.indd   17 30/10/08   14:52:05 With the addition of Pearce Retail, the 
businesses are now operating across four key 
sectors; financial, food, high street fashion 
and leisure. In the financial and food sectors, 
both operate largely under framework 
arrangements. Work is generally allocated six 
months in advance and we are pleased with 
the current allocations for 2008/09 which we 
believe should result in activity levels above 
those of the prior year. In the high street 
fashion and leisure sectors, work is allocated 
more on a relationship driven, contract 
by contract basis. Whilst we have seen a 
slowdown in the high street fashion sector, 
we have compensated for this by moving 
some of our resources into a number of hotel 
refurbishment projects.
As a result of the above, our order book of 
secured and allocated projects as at June 
2008 is £173m (2007 - £51m), up 37% 
excluding the impact of acquisitions.

3 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT ASIA & EUROPE
Asia
ISG Asia has had a record year contributing 
an operating profit of £1.8m (2007 - £0.8m).  
ISG Asia volumes increased by 4% to £52m 
(2007 - £50m), whilst fee income increased 
by 94% to £14.9m (2007 - £7.7m) due to a 
full year contribution from ISG Asia (2007 
- eight months) and from Commtech (2007 - 
one month), our commissioning and testing 
business, and an increase in the proportion 
of project management activity in North Asia. 
As a result operating margin on fee income 
has increased to 11.9% (2007 - 10.2%). The 
business continues to benefit from significant 
projects for our international banking clients, 
including projects undertaken in the year for 
Standard Chartered Bank, Morgan Stanley, JP 
Morgan, Merrill Lynch and UBS.  
In China, from our three offices in Beijing, 
Tianjin and Shanghai, activity levels increased 
by 79% to £5.3m, with projects undertaken 
for Apple, Nokia, Armani and Bohai Bank. In 
Hong Kong, activity levels increased 12% to 
£13.3m with the level of project management 
fee work increasing 76% to £8.5m. As at 30 
June 2008, the forward order book is £34m 
(2007 - £32m), with 24% being fee based 
project management work (2007 - 14%).  
Whilst the Asian economies are not immune 
to global economic trends, the most recent 
IMF and Data Monitor forecasts continue to 
project high single figure percentage GDP 
growth in our key markets of China, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and the Middle East. 
 
Our existing Dubai operations made a small 
contribution of £0.1m in the year to June 
2008. With the imminent completion of our fit 
out joint venture with the Al Habtoor Leighton 
Group, we would anticipate this to grow 
substantially in the next 18 months.
Europe 
With our acquisition of the remaining 80% 
of IASA in September 2007, the contribution 
from our European activities increased 
substantially, with volumes increasing to 
£31m (2007 - £5m) and fee income to £6.2m 
(2007 - £1.2m). On a like for like basis the 
business showed a growth in volumes in 
the year of 43%. The business contributed 
an operating profit of £3.1m (2007 - £0.7m) 
resulting in an operating margin on fee 
income of 49.8% (2007 - 56.2%).  
The business delivered projects for 
ExxonMobil, Iron Mountain, RBS and 
Signature in Paris, Vodafone and Fidelity  
in Luxembourg, Cardinal Health in Geneva 
and several projects for Google, Adobe and 
Right Management across a number of 
European cities, with an average contract 
value of £0.9m.
 
As at June 2008, the business has an order 
book of £8m, a level consistent with June 
2007, which is a typical level given the desire 
of European clients to complete projects 
before the summer period and initiate new 
projects after the summer period. The 
pipeline is strong and since year end  
secured work has increased to £17m. 1. Client: Google

Prospects
At the year end, our total order book was 
£1,051m (2007 - £843m), with our in year 
order book at a record level of £739m (2007 - 
£696m). The recent large project wins of the 
Velodrome for the 2012 London Olympics, 
the new UK headquarters for KPMG, the large 
data centre in the North East of England and 
the five education projects totalling £130m 
have increased our confidence levels for the 
current and subsequent financial years.
  
We expect that continued growth in Asia, our 
new joint venture in the Middle East and our 
expanding European operations will all enable 
the group to lessen its dependence on the  
UK market.
In the UK the greatest impact so far from the 
deteriorating economic climate has been in 
the private residential market where we have 
little exposure. In anticipation of tightening 
commercial demand, we have reduced our 
dependence in London on the office market 
whilst increasing our regional involvement 
in education and affordable housing.  
Our banking and food retail framework 
relationships are also expected to deliver 
more activity in the current year. 
 
Our strategy is to continue to spread our 
risk by identifying joint venture opportunities 
or bolt-on acquisitions overseas in growing 
markets across different geographies. Whilst 
we are not immune to macro economic 
pressures, our expansion over the last three 
years into the regions, retail and overseas has 
made us more robust and resilient, particularly 
to the downturn in the office market in the 
City of London.

2 3 FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue and Operating Profit
Group revenue increased by 42% to £1,090m 
(2007 - £767m). The increase is due to a 21% 
increase in revenue of our London operations 
to £570m (2007 - £469m); a 50% increase 
in revenue in Regional Construction to 
£302m (2007 - £200m) due to a combination 
of organic growth and the acquisition of 
Pearce Construction during the year with 
the inclusion of seven and a half months of 
activity (£50m); a 143% increase in turnover 
in National Retail and Leisure to £137m 
(2007 - £56m) as a result of the acquisition 
of Pearce Retail during the year with the 
inclusion of seven and a half months of its 
activity (£49m) and the inclusion of only 
eleven weeks of activity of ISG Cathedral in 
the prior year; a 26% increase in turnover 
in ISG Asia to £52m (2007 - £41m) with 
the inclusion of eight months of its activity 
in the prior year; and the acquisition of the 
remaining 80% shareholding in IASA in 
September 2007 with the inclusion of nine 
months of its activity (£30m).
Adjusted group operating profit
1
 increased 
by 56% to £15.1m (2007 - £9.7m). The 
improvement in group operating profit
1
 is 
due to a 21% increase from our London 
operations to £7.9m (2007 - £6.5m) largely 
as a result of the 26% growth in fee income 
in London Build and an increase in operating 
margins in London Fit out as a result of 
a change in mix of work; a 20% increase 
in Regional Construction to £1.8m (2007 
- £1.5m) as a result of the acquisition of 
Pearce Construction during the year with 
the inclusion of seven and a half months 
of activity (£0.2m), the impact of a £0.5m 
provision in ISG Jackson against an insurance 
recovery that is currently under dispute and 
the impact of a £0.5m provision against the 
carrying value of one of the two properties 
held for development; a 99% increase in 
National Retail and Leisure to £3.9m (2007 
- £2.0m) largely as a result of the acquisition 
of Pearce Retail during the year with the 
inclusion of seven and a half months of its 
activity (£1.3m) and the inclusion of only 
eleven weeks of activity of ISG Cathedral 
in the prior year; a 125% increase in ISG 
Asia to £1.8m (2007 - £0.8m) due to the 
inclusion of only eight months of its activity 
in the prior year, a full year contribution from 
ISG Commtech acquired in May 2007 and 
an increase in the proportion of fee based 
project management work in North Asia; and 
the acquisition of IASA during the year with 
the inclusion of nine months of its activity 
contributing £3.1m (2007 - £0.7m).  
The costs from group activities increased by 
91% to £3.4m (2007 - £1.8m) largely due to 
additional resources employed in Head Office 
linked to the group’s organic and acquisition 
growth and international development, and an 
increase in central provisions which had been 
released in the prior year.
THESE ARE THE GROUP’S FIRST ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS. THE GROUP’S IFRS ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 
THE YEAR TO 30 JUNE 2008, THE COMPARATIVE INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR TO 30

 of £14.1m was 
33% ahead of last year’s £10.7m. Finance 
income decreased to £1.4m (2007 - £1.8m) 
largely as a result of cash utilised to fund 
certain of the acquisitions in the current 
and prior years. Finance costs increased 
to £2.4m (2007 - £1.0m) as a result of the 
increase in bank loans to fund the acquisition 
of ISG Cathedral and IASA and the charge 
for the unwinding of discount on deferred 
consideration principally relating to the 
acquisition of IASA and the Pearce Group.   
In the prior year the group result also included 
a £0.1m profit on the disposal of the 22% 
shareholding in ISG Asia Limited linked to our 
acquisition of 100% of its trading activities.
Taxation
The group’s effective tax rate is 20.9% 
(2007 - 24.7%). The lower rate is due to 
an adjustment relating to the release of a 
previous year’s UK corporation tax provision 
of £1.1m, as well as the utilisation of tax 
losses brought forward. If the impact of the 
release of previous year’s UK corporation 
tax provision is excluded, the effective tax 
rate is 29.5%. We anticipate going forward a 
more normal effective tax rate of circa 29% 
for the group due to the higher proportion of 
overseas earnings offset by the reduction in 
the UK corporation tax rate to 28% from  
April 2008.
Earnings per Share and Dividends
Basic earnings per share has increased by 
28% from 28.46p per share in 2007 to 36.44p 
per share. The adjusted basic earnings per 
share
2
 shows an increase of 21% to 36.22p 
per share (2007 – 29.91p). The final dividend 
is proposed at 9.20p (2007 - 8.20p) giving a 
total dividend for the year of 13.20p up 14.8% 
on last year (2007 - 11.50p). At this level the 
dividend is covered 2.7 times by ongoing 
activities (2007 - 2.6 times).
 
Shareholders’ Funds
During the year, shareholders’ funds 
increased by £13.4m to £37.0m (2007 - 
£23.7m). The group generated a profit for the 
period of £10.0m (2007 - £7.5m). Dividend 
payments of £3.4m (2007 - £2.7m) were 
made during the year. Shareholders’ funds 
are stated after deducting the company’s 
investment in its own shares of £3.6m  
(2007 - £2.6m).  
The number of shares in issue at 30 June 
2008 was 29.5m (2007 - 27.7m). The increase 
of 1.8m shares (2007 - 0.3m) is largely due 
to the issue of 563,456 shares as part of the 
consideration for the acquisition of IASA and 
1,154,324 shares as part of the consideration 
for the acquisition of Pearce Group and 
created an increase in the share premium 
reserve of £5.0m (2007 - £0.4m). The 
weighted average number of ordinary shares 
after deduction of the company’s investment 
in its own shares as at 30 June 2008 is 
27,398,773 (2007 - 26,386,424).
The foreign currency reserve movement 
for the year was £2.2m (2007 - £(0.4)m) 
and represented the translation gain on the 
revaluation of the assets and liabilities of 
foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill using 
rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.

2 FINANCIAL REVIEW [continued]
Acquisitions
In September 2007, the group acquired the 
remaining shares in its associate IASA for 
a total consideration of £13.7m; satisfied 
by the payment of £9.6m cash, the issue 
of 563,456 shares at a fair value of 290.4p, 
£2.2m of deferred consideration and costs 
of acquisition of £0.3m. The deferred 
consideration is payable in September 
2009 (£1.7m) and September 2010 (£0.5m) 
subject to the achievement of certain 
performance criteria. The cash element of the 
consideration has been funded by the partial 
utilisation of a floating rate bank term loan 
acquisition facility. The business was acquired 
with £5.8m of cash. Net assets acquired 
after net provisional fair value adjustments of 
£1.2m, were £3.6m resulting in the creation 
of goodwill on consolidation of £10.1m.
In November 2007, the group acquired  
Pearce Group Limited, for a total 
consideration of £20.8m; satisfied by the 
payment of £9.0m in cash, the issue of 
1,154,324 shares at a fair value of 282.0p, 
loan notes of £0.5m, £7.3m of deferred 
consideration and costs of acquisition of 
£0.7m. The deferred consideration is payable 
in equal amounts in September 2009 and 
September 2010 subject to the achievement 
of certain performance criteria. The cash 
element of the consideration was funded 
out of the group’s own cash resources. The 
business was acquired with £14.3m of cash. 
Net assets acquired, after net provisional 
fair value adjustments of £1.7m were £3.5m 
resulting in the creation of goodwill on 
consolidation of £17.3m.
Cashflow and Treasury
At the end of the year the group had a 
net cash position of £35.3m compared to 
£22.3m last year. The group at year end had 
drawn down on bank loan facilities and hire 
purchase outstandings totalling £24.0m (2007 
- £16.0m), and loan notes totalling £1.0m 
(2007 - £1.9m); hence the group’s gross 
cash position improved during the year from 
£40.3m to £60.3m partly as a result of cash 
acquired from subsidiary undertakings and 
partly from the beneficial timing of receipts 
and payment on certain contracts. The latter 
may potentially unwind in the current year.

1 Cash generation during the period was 
strong with a net cash inflow from operating 
activities of £20.5m (2007 - £11.5m). Net cash 
inflow/(outflow) from acquisitions was £0.5m 
(2007 - £9.7m) which included the payment 
of cash consideration on acquisitions of 
£19.6m (2007 - £16.1m), net of cash acquired 
with subsidiaries of £20.1m (2007 - £6.4m).  
During the year a further 354,254 of shares 
were acquired by our Jersey Trust company 
linked to Long Term Incentive Plans for senior 
management. The total number of shares 
held by the Jersey Trust company at 30 June 
2008 is 1,466,517.
 
During the current and prior years, the group 
has entered into a number of bank loan 
facilities to fund the recent acquisitions and 
its future working capital requirements.  
In October 2005, the group entered into 
a £9.7m term loan facility to fund the 
Propencity acquisition, of which £4.3m is 
outstanding at 30 June 2008. In May 2007, 
the group entered into a £20m term loan 
facility to fund acquisitions, of which £10m 
was drawn down immediately to fund the 
ISG Cathedral acquisition. During the year 
the facility has been fully drawn, largely to 
fund the IASA acquisition with the balance 
outstanding on the facility as at 30 June 2008 
of £20.0m (2007 - £10.0m). In addition, the 
group has entered into a £10m revolving 
credit facility for working capital purposes 
which was not drawn on during the year or at 
year end. The facility expires in August 2013.
The group has bonding facilities lines with 
Euler Hermes, HCC International, Liberty 
Mutual, Norwich Union, Standard Chartered 
Bank and United Overseas Bank.

3 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2008.
Activities
The principal activity of the company and its subsidiaries is to provide construction and project management services to its 
customers in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia. The group has European operations based in France, Germany, Switzerland 
and Italy, and Asian operations based in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Australia and Dubai.
Review of business
A fair review of the group’s progress during the year, its future prospects and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the group (including the information required by section 234ZZB of the Companies Act 1985) are set 
out in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 to 17, the Financial Review on pages 18 to 23, the Directors’ Report on 
pages 25 to 29 and the Corporate Governance report on pages 33 to 35, and the key performance indicators are set out in 
Group Financial Highlights on page 3.
The Directors’ Report is prepared for the members of the group and should not be relied upon by any other party for any 
other purpose. The Directors’ Report (including the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review 
and the Corporate Governance report) contain certain forward-looking information and statements in relation to the group’s 
operations, economic performance and financial conditions. These statements are made by the directors in good faith based 
on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report and, although they believe that the expectations 
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they should be treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information. 
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in detail on page 39.
The Board paid an interim dividend of 4.00p per share (2007 - 3.30p) on 22 April 2008 to shareholders on the register on 25 
March 2008. The directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 9.20p per share (2007 - 8.20p) to shareholders on the 
register on 14 November 2008, giving a total dividend for the year of 13.20p per share (2007 - 11.50p). The ex-dividend date 
will be 12 November 2008. The closing date for elections for the Dividend Re-Investment Plan is 14 November 2008.

27228_Text.indd   26 30/10/08   14:36:10 Acquisition of the company’s own shares
At the Annual General Meeting held on 17 December 2007, the shareholders authorised the company to make one or more 
market purchases of ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the company during the year. The company did not exercise 
this right during the year. However, it did recommend to Interior Services Group Employee Trustees Limited (the “Trust”) 
(a trust established to hold shares to satisfy entitlements of employees to receive shares in the company pursuant to the 
company’s share schemes) that it purchase shares during the year. During the year the Trust purchased 554,254 ordinary 
shares of 1p each in the capital of the company. During the year the Trust transferred 238,812 shares of 1p each in the 
capital of the company to employees pursuant to the company’s share schemes. At the year end the Trust held a total of 
1,466,517 (2007 – 1,151,075) ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the company, representing 4.98% (2007 – 4.16%) 
of the company’s called-up ordinary share capital.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The key risks and uncertainties facing the group are considered as part of the group’s well established process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing risk. Impacts of significant risks and their mitigation are monitored at both group and 
subsidiary board meetings throughout the year and are subject to annual review by the Audit Committee. The key risks 
facing the business and the processes in place to manage those risks are:
•	 Attracting	and	retaining 	key 	staff
 Attracting and retaining high-calibre staff is key to achieving the group’s aims. This is achieved through a remuneration 
system that is firmly linked to performance, a continuous formal performance appraisal system to provide regular 
assessment of individual performance and the active encouragement of skill development and training through 
strongly embedded training schemes throughout the group.
•	 Project	risk	mix
 The group enters into various forms of contracts with an associated variety of contractual risk. To reduce this risk, 
early warning indicators for each risk area, including the full spectrum of risk categories, from very low to very high, 
are continually monitored from the date of the tender, throughout the life of the contract and form part of the monthly 
evaluation at group and subsidiary board meetings.
 
•	 Market	risk
 The profitability of our business is dependent on the level of demand for construction services by both the 
private and public sectors. Macro-economic indicators are maintained by the group and subsidiary boards and, as 
appropriate, changes are made to flex activity levels within our businesses on a pro-active basis.
•	 Financial	risk	management
 As detailed in Note 24, the Board considers the group’s key elements of financial risk to be interest rate risk, foreign 
currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest rate 
risk and foreign currency risk. The company does not speculate with derivative instruments. As the group has a 
positive net cash position, it reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits. The 
group publishes its financial statements in pounds Sterling and conducts most of its business in Sterling. The level 
of foreign business is approximately 26% of the group’s trading operating profit. The credit and liquidity risks are 
diminished by the creditworthiness of the group’s customers and the strength of its cash position. In addition the 
group is reliant on its supply chain in particular the financial stability of each sub-contractor which is monitored on a 
regular basis.
Payments to creditors
The group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the group’s general policy 
to pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms. 
Trade creditors include retention amounts held over defect liability periods. The creditor days for the group at 30 June 2008 
are 36 days (2007 - 31 days).
Donations
During the year the company made no political donations (2007 - nil). Charitable donations of £8,717 (2007 - £6,000) to 
various cancer organisations, £5,000 to the Starlight Children’s Foundation, £4,279 to the Wisma Harapan & Apar School, 
£1,463 to Down’s Syndrome, £1,000 to Help for Heroes and £17,794 (2007 - £7,810) of donations to other charitable 
organisations were made by the group. In 2007 there were also charitable donations made of £3,000 to The Aplastic 
Anaemia Trust and £1,000 to Great Ormond Street.  Employment policies
We support the principle of equal opportunities in employment and oppose all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination 
on the grounds of colour, race, religion or belief, age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status 
or disability. The group’s policy provides equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of an 
individual’s suitability for the work. 
As an equal opportunities employer our benefits and training are accessible to every staff member and we encourage and 
support personal and professional development. Demonstrating this philosophy we have introduced a well-being initiative 
which challenges the way that we work as individuals and teams, and the impact that this has on the balance between 
work and our home lives. Since 2005 we have conducted numerous programmes across a number of sites and continue to 
implement this successful programme across the entire business.
At ISG we pride ourselves not only on the projects that we deliver but also the development and training opportunities 
we provide to our staff. As an Investors in People (IiP) company we are continuously improving our benefits, training and 
development opportunities. Our desire for continuous improvement is underpinned by our Performance Management and 
Performance Feedback Process. During the year the average training days per employee across the group was in excess of 
three compared to an industry average of one.
The group has well-established structures to communicate with employees at every level and to encourage their 
involvement regarding the group’s performance and future activities.
Information on matters of concern to employees is given through information bulletins and reports which seek to achieve a 
common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the group’s performance.
Health & safety 
The Board continues to consider health & safety a key priority and has maintained this focus throughout the year. It is 
essential that we take all reasonable measures to conduct our business to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all 
our employees and all other persons who may be affected by our activities. This includes members of the public, clients, 
designers and the trade contractors that we employ. We support this with our certifications to OHSAS 18001:2007 
Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems and our dedicated teams of health & safety professionals achieving 
industry leading safety performance. This is demonstrated by ISG’s Accident Incident Rate (calculated on the number of 
reportable accidents per 1,000 employees) of 5.38 (industry average 8.65 for the period April 2007 to March 2008).
One of the best ways to raise standards is to recognise and reward those that lead the field and to encourage others to 
follow. That is why every year The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (“RoSPA”), one of the world’s leading health 
& safety organisations, invites companies of all sizes from the full spectrum of work activities and from all over the world to 
enter the RoSPA Awards. During May 2008 the group received 15 RoSPA Gold Awards and one Gold Medal.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued) Sustainability
With construction services as our core business, we recognise our influence is far reaching. We physically change 
landscapes, performing work throughout communities across the world. Through our supply chain we acquire, transport 
and dispose of vast quantities of materials on a daily basis. As an employer we are responsible for the wellbeing and 
development of a large workforce and we are responsible to our shareholders for financial performance. In short our work 
affects people, the planet and the prosperity of many on a daily basis.
We have subsequently developed a group-wide sustainability strategy which encompasses areas where we have direct 
influence. It also addresses our responsibilities and capabilities where we have the opportunity to influence others, for 
example the design and operation of the buildings we deliver. Our strategy also extends to communicating with our supply 
chain, offering training and encouragement for sustainable practices within their own organisations.
Our strategy covers the three pillars of sustainability: People, Planet and Prosperity.
•	 People
 We must be socially responsible. This includes maintaining high levels of health & safety and developing our staff as 
detailed above. We also have a policy of social inclusion, embracing quality and human rights, ensuring that we meet 
or exceed national and international standards.
 We work together with the people in our supply chain to encourage their sustainable development and partner in 
initiatives. Their success has been recognised in the launch last year of our first annual supply-chain sustainability award.
•	 Planet
 We aim to take all reasonable measures to conduct our business activities so that damage to the environment and 
pollution is minimised. To demonstrate this commitment, all of our UK-based operations have management systems 
which are certified to the requirements of ISO14001:2000 Environmental Management Systems.
 We are working to increasing our resource efficiency by reducing dependence upon non renewable resources and 
continue to instigate a range of initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint.
 We are committed to minimising waste and to maximise recycling in all aspects of the business, rethinking our 
working practices to achieve industry-leading performance. On our exemplar projects we have achieved recycling 
rates of up to 92%.
•	 Prosperity
 We aim to be a good corporate citizen and have again won national awards for being a considerate contractor. We 
engage with the local communities in which we work and have participated in a number of initiatives including 
working with local schools and Business in the Community organised projects.
 We have improved the group’s capability by investing in innovation and development to ensure that we remain 
efficient, effective and competitive to ensure our marketplace position.

Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the group’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
The notice of the Annual General Meeting is set out on page 86.
Approved by the Board of directors and signed on behalf of the Board.
J S P Cranney
Company Secretary
11 September 2008 This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and has been 
approved by the Board and adopted for the submission to the shareholders. This report is unaudited, except where specified.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were J L Jeremy (Chairman), M J Barnes and J R Stevenson. 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within existing terms of reference, on remuneration 
policy and determines, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
Remuneration policy
The group’s policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the high calibre required and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance 
measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the 
Remuneration Committee consisting solely of non-executive directors. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is 
determined by the full Board.
In framing remuneration policy the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to the requirements of the 
Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange. 
Components of remuneration
The components of remuneration are:
a) basic salary and benefits determined by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed annually;
b) performance related bonuses; and
c) share option incentives.
The company operates an optional salary waiver arrangement which can result in pension contributions being made.
Basic salary
An executive director’s basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year and when 
an individual changes position or responsibility.
Bonus payments
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the directors received bonuses which reflected an amount relating to the financial year 
ended 30 June 2007. The performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2007 included group profit based 
targets, completion of strategic objectives and non-financial elements such as a satisfactory health & safety record. These 
targets were achieved. The maximum bonus payable represented up to 50% of base salary. Similar but more demanding 
performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 30 June 2008, the maximum bonus payable being up to 75% of 
base salary. Again, the targets have been achieved. 
Share options
The Remuneration Committee approves the grant of options to executive directors under the group’s discretionary share 
option schemes. In respect of share options, the following audited information also applies:
a)  details of directors’ share options are included in the Directors’ Report on pages 25 to 29. 
b) all options granted to directors under the Unapproved Plan are subject to performance criteria relating to growth in 
adjusted earnings per share which is calculated from the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders after adjusting 
for amortisation of goodwill and the profit or loss on disposal of associates and subsidiaries. 
 
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the performance criteria were set as follows:
Date of grant performance period Target
9 July 2007 1 July 2007 to 30 
June 2010
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period must be 
greater than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum over the same period.
18 March 2008 1 January 2008 to 
31 December 2010
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period must be 
greater than the increase in the RPI plus 4% per annum over the same period.
In the Remuneration Committee’s opinion any share-based incentives should be linked to the interests of the shareholders 
and the principal measure of those interests is shareholder return. The Remuneration Committee believes that an 
improvement in earnings per share should be reflected in future enhanced shareholder return. 
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the Remuneration Committee applied the same performance criteria to options granted 
under the Approved Plan also.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
REPORT OF THE BOARD TO THE SHAREHOLDERS ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Performance graph
The following graph shows the company’s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the 
performance of the AIM share index also measured by total shareholder return. The AIM share index has been selected for 
this comparison as the company is a constituent of that index.
Data sourced from yahoo finance and AIM websites
The graph shows the theoretical growth in the value of an initial £100 hypothetical shareholding over the specified period, 
assuming that dividends are re-invested to purchase additional units of equity at the closing price applicable on the ex-
dividend date. Historical data is based on the constituent companies at each given date.
The company’s share price at 30 June 2008 was £1.65 and £2.05 on the day of the announcement of the prelim results on 
9 September 2008.
Directors’ contracts
None of the service contracts of executive directors includes provision for specific payment in the event of early 
termination, nor do they provide for extended notice periods in the event of a change in control. It is not the Remuneration 
Committee’s intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment is breached by the company 
in the event of termination, the company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of 
salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that the 
director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and will also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors are shown in the table below.

With the approval of the Remuneration Committee, executive directors are entitled, under their service agreements,  
to perform duties outside the group and to receive fees for those duties. Other than G V Aldridge, none of the directors

approval. Non-executive directors may be paid for professional services provided to the group, but cannot participate in the 
company’s share option schemes. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, and are not eligible to join in any 
pension scheme operated by the group. The letters of appointment for J L Jeremy, M J Barnes and J R Stevenson are for 
a one-year term and subject to prior termination on notice of three months either way, while the letter of appointment for R

REPORT OF THE BOARD TO THE SHAREHOLDERS ON DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION (continued) CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
While the group is not subject to the provisions of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance – June 2006 
(The Combined Code), the directors have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures. The directors have also 
considered the guidance set out in Guidance on Audit Committees (The Smith Guidance).
Section 1 of the Combined Code, as appended to the Listing Rules, sets out Principles of Good Corporate Governance and 
Code provisions which are applicable to listed companies incorporated in Great Britain.
A narrative statement on how the company has applied the Principles and a statement explaining the extent to which the 
provisions in the Code have been complied with appear below.
NARRATIVE STATEMENT
Section 1 of the Code establishes 14 Principles of Good Governance which are split into the four areas described below.
Directors
The company is controlled through the Board of directors which comprises four executive (three between 1 July 2007 and 
14 January 2008) and four independent non-executive directors. There is a separation of the roles and responsibilities of 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive. As the Non-Executive Chairman is mainly responsible for the running of the Board, 
he has to ensure that all directors receive sufficient relevant information on financial, business and corporate issues prior to 
meetings. The Chief Executive’s responsibilities focus on running the group’s businesses and implementing group strategy. 
All directors are able to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties if necessary.
During the year there were 13 Board meetings, four Audit Committee meetings and seven Remuneration Committee 
meetings. Attendance by the directors was as follows:

M J Barnes 12 N/A 7
R M Dantzic 11 3 N/A
J C B Houlton 12 N/A N/A

S D Lawther 13 N/A N/A
J R Stevenson 13 4 7
I S Trotter 12 N/A N/A
* Appointed on the 14 January 2008
The Chairman also regularly meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present to discuss the 
performance of the group and any other matters as they arise.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it which includes:
•	 approval	of	annual	budgets	and	corporate	business	plans
•	 approval	of	contracts	exceeding	prescribed	thresholds
•	 acquisitions	and	disposals
•	 approval	of	all	capital	expenditure	projects	not	covered	by	budget
 
It is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of significant financing matters. It monitors the exposure to key business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual budgets, their progress towards achievement 
of those budgets and their capital expenditure programmes. The Board also considers environmental and employee issues 
and key appointments. It ensures that all directors receive appropriate training on appointment and then subsequently as 
appropriate. A budget is established for this purpose. All directors, in accordance with the Code, will submit themselves for 
re-election at least once every three years.
The Board has two committees, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Audit Committee meets 
regularly with the company’s senior management and with the external auditors to review the financial statements, 
the accounting policies of the company and its internal management and financial controls. The members of the Audit 
Committee are R M Dantzic (Chairman), J L Jeremy and J R Stevenson. The minutes of the meetings of the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee are circulated to and reviewed by the Board. Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee measures the performance of the executive directors and key members of senior 
management as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the 
Board for final determination. The report of the Board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 
30 to 32. The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Relations with shareholders
The Board encourages two way communication with both its institutional and private investors and responds quickly to all 
queries received. The executive directors have met with analysts and institutional shareholders on a regular basis in the year 
ended 30 June 2008. Non-executive directors are fully briefed by the executive directors on the views of major shareholders 
about the company and are available for meetings with major shareholders. All shareholders have at least twenty working days’ 
notice of the Annual General Meeting at which all directors and Committee chairs are introduced and available for questions.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
A review of the performance and financial position of the group is included in the Financial Review. The Board uses this, 
together with the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement and the Directors’ Report, to present a balanced 
and understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects. The statement of directors’ responsibilities for 
the financial statements is described on page 36.
Internal control
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks faced by the group has been established 
and that process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the revised version of Internal Control Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code produced by the Turnbull working party. Following the latest review, the significant risks 
faced by the group now total twenty seven, of which four are considered principal risks as described on page 27. Steps 
continue to be taken to embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the business and deal 
with areas of improvement coming to management and Board attention. As part of this process, a Corporate Governance 
Manual setting out the principle business policies and procedures operating within the group has been produced and 
adopted by all businesses across the group. Furthermore, a series of risk management seminars has been held for the 
group’s senior management.
The reporting systems include formal consideration of all significant business risks at the monthly Board meetings and are 
still subject to continuous review by the Board throughout the year. The monthly management information includes some 
key risk indicators with the emphasis on early warning systems. Risk management principles are embedded within all 
significant projects.
The directors are responsible for the system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
 
The key risk management activities are described under the following headings:
•	 Strategic	control
 The Board reviews the group’s strategic plans each year. On a regular basis, the group’s significant risks are updated 
and appropriate control strategies and accountabilities are agreed.
•	 Allocation	of	responsibilities	and	control	environment
 The Board has set clear terms of reference for each of its committees and the group has an organisational structure 
with clearly defined and documented delegation of authority to executive management and reporting systems for 
financial results, risk exposure and control assessment. 
•	 Financial	control
 The group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the Board; each operating unit prepares 
monthly results with a comparison against budget. The Board reviews these for the group as a whole and 
determines appropriate action.
•	 Quality	and	integrity	of	personnel
 The group is committed to competence and integrity of management and staff at all levels, through its values 
statement, comprehensive recruitment, training and appraisal programmes.
•	 IT	systems
 The group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on computer systems and has put 
in place suitable disaster recovery arrangements.
•	 Controls	over	central	functions
 A number of the group’s key functions, including treasury and taxation, are dealt with centrally. Each function is 
required to report to the Board on a regular basis.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (continued) •	 Operating	unit	controls
 Key controls over major business risks include reviews against performance indicators and exception reporting. Each 
operating unit’s senior management is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks. 
They make regular assessments of their exposure to major business risks and the extent to which these risks are 
controlled, which are reported to the Board.
•	 Internal	audit
 While there is no dedicated internal audit function, internal audit resources are provided by the central functions, 
including a group Commercial Compliance Director, which are considered sufficient for the group. They support the 
risk management activities and help to identify key risk areas across the group. Any significant issues are reported to 
the Board via monthly reports from the central finance and commercial and systems departments. 
•	 Role	of	the	Executive	Committee
 Day-to-day management of the group’s activities is delegated by the Board to the Executive Committee. It monitors 
the effectiveness of the operating units in meeting group objectives and controlling major business risks and makes 
recommendations to the Board.
•	 Risk	management	reporting	and	Board	review
 The Board has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks facing the group. It 
regularly reviews all operating unit assessments of business risk exposure and control, including compliance assessments, 
and determines appropriate action, taking into account the recommendations of the Executive Committee.
An ongoing review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year ended 30 June 2008 has been 
maintained and has taken account of any material developments since the year end.
 
Audit Committee
A summary of the process the Board (where applicable, through its committees) has applied in reviewing the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control is set out as follows.
During the year, the Audit Committee of the Board:
a) meets regularly with the external auditors and executive directors attending by invitation;
b) receives and considers reports relating to the monitoring of the adequacy of the group’s internal controls, the 
suitability of its accounting policies and financial reporting, the integrity of the financial statements and matters 
arising from the external auditors’ work; 
c) monitors the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors; and
d) makes recommendations to the Board on these matters.
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into 
account the safeguards operating within the external auditors and that the level of audit fee is sufficient to enable them to 
fulfil their obligations in accordance with the audit Letter of Engagement.
The chairman of the Audit Committee makes a report to the Board following each Committee meeting and the Board 
receives the minutes of all Audit Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. This 
statement also forms part of the Financial Review.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Although not required to, the Board reports on compliance with the forty eight code provisions throughout the accounting 
period. Save for the exceptions outlined below, the company has complied throughout the accounting period ended 30 
June 2008 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code. The exceptions to the Code were as follows:
A.4.1 The directors have not constituted a Nomination Committee because they consider that it is preferable for elections 
to the Board to be dealt with by the Board as a whole.
A.6 The Board has not undertaken a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual 
directors in 2008. A satisfactory evaluation was undertaken in 2007. The directors believe that a formal evaluation 
every two years is sufficient. The next formal evaluation will be undertaken in 2009. The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors have elected, as 
requested by the AIM rules to prepare the group financial statements under IFRSs (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The group financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the 
company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects 
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s "Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements". In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also required to:
•	 properly	select	and	apply	accounting	policies;
•	 present	information,	including	accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	that	provides	relevant,	reliable,	comparable 	and	
understandable	information;	and	
•	 provide	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	with	the	specific	requirements	in	IFRSs	are	insufficient	to	enable	
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company 
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgments	and	estimates	that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;	and
•	 state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standards	have	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	departures 	disclosed	
and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may	differ	from	legislation	in	other	jurisdictions.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
27228_Text.indd   36 30/10/08   14:24:32 We have audited the group financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2008 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes 1 to 36. These group financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 
30 June 2008.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and whether the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement and the Financial 
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
The directors have asked us to review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited group financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

       NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | AT 30 JUNE 2008
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Interior Services Group plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 24. The nature of the group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
Corporate and Risk Information section of the Directors’ Report on pages 25 to 29.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (GBP) because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 4.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The annual consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared for the first time in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). 
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” has been applied. The group’s transition date 
for the adoption of IFRS 1 is 1 July 2006. The group is required to establish its IFRS Accounting Policies for the year ended 
30 June 2008 and apply these retrospectively to determine its IFRS balance sheet at the transition date of 1 July 2006 and 
the comparative information for the year ended 30 June 2007. Hence the financial statements have been prepared using 
accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the 
group is provided in Note 36. There has been no impact on the group cash flows.
3. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
In the current year, the group has adopted IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” which is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these 
financial statements regarding the group’s financial instruments and management of capital (see Note 24).
Two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are effective for the 
current period. These are:
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment; and
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the group’s accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised)
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (Revised) 
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
IFRIC 14 IAS 19—The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction
IFRIC 15  Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no
material impact on the financial statements of the group except for considerations affecting the segment disclosures when 
IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. 4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal 
accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries and joint 
ventures. Subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is 
transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by other members of the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external 
customers. It also includes the group’s proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year.
Revenue from contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as measured by reference to services 
performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in 
accordance with the group’s accounting policy on long term contracts.
Revenue
Revenue which is stated net of value added tax represents the sales value of work done in the year, including estimates in 
respect of amounts still to be invoiced.
Pensions
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are invested and managed 
independently of the finances of the company. Contributions to the defined contribution pension schemes are charged to 
the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Long-term contracts
Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried out, provided that the final outcome can be assessed with 
reasonable certainty. The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out 
at the year end, by recording turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses. Turnover is calculated as that 
proportion of the total contract value which has been completed to date. Revenues derived from variations on contracts 
are recognised only when instructions have been received from the client. Full provision is made for all known or expected 
losses on individual contracts immediately once such losses are foreseen. Variations in contract work and claims are 
included to the extent that it is probable they will result in revenue. 
The amount by which turnover is in excess of payments on account has been classified as amounts recoverable on 
contracts and included in trade receivables.
Business combinations
Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets 
(or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations”, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
The cost of business combinations include, where applicable, deferred consideration discounted at an appropriate rate of 
interest to its fair value at the effective date of combination. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008
4.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised.
Under UK GAAP , goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life. Under IFRS 3, goodwill 
has been assigned an indefinite life as at the date of transition and it is no longer amortised. The group has elected to 
apply the exemption related to business combination and has fixed its goodwill at its carrying value as at 1 July 2006. All 
accumulated amortisation at this point in time has been reclassified against the cost of the goodwill. 
 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events of changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the group are assigned to those units or 
groups of units. 
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated:
•	 	 represents	the	lowest	level	within	the	group	at	which	the	goodwill	is	monitored	for	internal	management	
purposes; and
•	 	 is	not	larger	than	a	segment	based	on	either	the	group’ s	primary	or	secondary	reporting	format	determined	in	
accordance with IAS 14 “Segment Reporting”.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-
generating units, to which the goodwill related. Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow analysis 
is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash-generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill. 
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk effected cost of capital for the particular cash-generating units. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset 
is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and is based on its fair values as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost and amortised over the estimated useful lives and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The categories of intangible assets (all of which were acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries) and their estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
 Customer relationships  4 – 10 years
 Customer contracts  1 – 2 years
Impairment	of	tangible	and	intangible	assets	excluding	goodwill
At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as 
an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation decrease. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of its 
assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 Short-leasehold property Life of the lease
 Motor vehicles  4 years
 IT and office equipment  3 - 5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a 
joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint 
venture require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The arrangements the group has entered into involve 
the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest. 
Investment in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity methods of accounting; initially stated at 
cost and adjusted thereafter for subsequent changes in the group’s share of net assets less any impairment in the value of 
individual investments. The group’s share of associate’ and joint ventures’ post-tax results are reported in the consolidated 
income statement and the net investments disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate and joint venture recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the 
investment. Any excess of the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Inventories
Inventories (previously classified as work in progress and stocks) comprise work in progress, stocks and property 
developments.   
Work in progress and stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for foreseeable losses.
The cost of properties in the course of development includes net outgoings and attributable interest and is included in work in 
progress. On long-term contracts an appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to the stage completed is recognised once the 
outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Otherwise profit is recognised upon unconditional exchange of contracts.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase contracts are initially recognised as assets of the group at their fair value 
at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The present value of future 
rentals is shown as a liability. The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the 
period of the lease in proportion to the balance sheet repayments outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. 
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008
4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Own shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the company’s ordinary shares acquired by 
Interior Services Group Employee Trustees Limited in connection with the group’s employee share schemes.
Share-based payments 
Charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payment have been made for all options that were 
granted after 7 November 2002 and had not yet vested at 1 January 2005 in accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based 
Payments”.
Options granted under the group’s employee share schemes are equity settled and measured at fair value at the date 
of grant. The fair value of such options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model, based upon publicly available 
market data and based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions, and is expensed over the vesting period.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Under the UK GAAP deferred tax was provided for timing differences between when an amount was taxable or allowable 
for tax purposes as against when it was recognised in the profit and loss account and was only recognised if realisable in 
the short term.
Under IAS 12 “Income Taxes”, deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary 
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability 
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the period
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items 
credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the 
initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in 
calculating goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost. Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, less any impairment. 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the group will not 
be able to collect all of the amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The carrying amount of 
the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed 
as uncollectible.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and at hand and short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily 
convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant	financial	difficulty	of	the	issuer	or	counterparty;	or
•	 default	or	delinquency	in 	interest	or	principal	payments;	or
•	 it	becoming	probable	that	the	borrower	will	enter	bankruptcy	or	financial	re-organisation.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. When a trade 
receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the provision account. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account 
are recognised in the income statement.
Derecognition of financial assets
The group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or 
have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If the group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured at the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted 
for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Finance costs 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results 
and financial position of each group company are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the 
company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different 
from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses to 
the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item taken to the statement of recognised income and 
expenses, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate. The exchange differences 
arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the “foreign currency translation 
reserve” in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and 
losses on related hedges) are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008 5.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount of income and revenue recognised in the 
period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below. 
Revenue and profit/margin recognition 
The group’s revenue recognition, turnover and long term contracts policies are set out in Note 4. Management exercises 
judgement to estimate the total expected contract costs and determine the percentage of completion in order to recognise 
the appropriate revenue and profit in the period. The assessment of profitability and recognition is assessed on an ongoing 
basis, which ensures adequate controls are in place that appropriate amounts are calculated.
Recognition and measurement of intangible assets under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on the acquisition of a business combination, 
management are required to make estimates on secured customer contracts, other contracts and customer relationships 
and goodwill. The group engaged outside independent parties to perform these calculations and determine the fair value 
and estimated useful lives of these assets.
Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely 
outcome, as set out in Notes 24 and 33.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and 
intangible assets. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. Note 4 above and Note 15 details the assumptions that have been applied for goodwill.
T ax
The group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. The group provides for future liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where additional tax may become 
payable in future periods, and such provisions are based upon management’s assessment of exposures. 
As set out in Note 4 above, deferred tax is accounted for on temporary differences using the liability method, with deferred 
tax liabilities generally being provided for in full and deferred tax assets being recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Note 12 details the unused 
tax losses for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised and the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been provided, together with the judgments which the group has made at 30 June 2008 in 
respect of these matters. These judgments may change in the future and they will be reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Regulatory investigations
Note 31 explains the risk in relation to ongoing investigations in to certain group companies by the Office of Fair Trading. 6. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
a.  Business segments 
For management purposes, the group is organised into five operating divisions - London, Regional Construction, National

the directors’ latest estimate of the likely amount payable to satisfy the group’s commitment to discretionary amounts 
based upon group performance.
Certain subsidiary undertakings of the group had operated defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the 
schemes were held separately from those of the group by an independently administered fund. 
The only other pension contributions made by the group are to employees’ personal pension schemes under a salary 
waiver arrangement.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after 
offset) for financial reporting purposes:
  2008 2007
  £’000 £’000
Deferred tax assets     782 717
Deferred tax liabilities     (2,544) (830)
      
     (1,762) (113)
      
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £4,676,000 (2007 - £6,402,000) in respect of tax losses in certain companies, 
which has not been recognised in these accounts as the timing of the recoverability of this is considered uncertain, these 
may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
recognised was £3.6m (2007 - £0.7m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these earnings because either the group 
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. Where it is probable that they will reverse no additional UK tax is expected.
13. DIVIDENDS 
  2008 2007
  £’000 £’000
2008 Interim paid - 4.00p per ordinary share (2007 - 3.30p)     1,181 874

Ordinary dividends on equity shares     3,434 2,721
      
2008 Proposed final dividend per ordinary share - 9.20p (2007 - 8.20p)    2,700 2,201
      
In accordance with IAS 10, dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are paid and approved by the shareholders. 
Accordingly the final dividend proposed in respect of the year ended 30 June 2008 has not been included as a liability as at  
30 June 2008.
14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares during the year, determined in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33 “Earnings per share”.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the 
assumption of conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The group has only one category of dilutive potential 
ordinary shares, being share options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the company’s 
ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to ordinary shareholders, pre-amortisation 
of intangible assets and before profit/loss on disposal of associates and subsidiaries, by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares during the year.

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to five groups of cash-generating units (“CGUs”), London, 
Regional Construction, National Retail and Leisure, Asia and Europe.
The additions to goodwill relate to the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of IASA and ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd. 
Further details of the additions to goodwill during the year are provided in Note 33.
The group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period. Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs, which range 
from 9-11%. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product. 
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the 
next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on estimated growth rates of between 2.25% and 
5%. The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rates used to discount the 
cash flows in both 2008 and 2007 for all CGUs have been based on the group’s weighted average cost of capital. 
At 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2007, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were impairment tested and deemed not to 
be impaired.

2005 and will continue until 28 September 2010. The loan carries a variable interest rate of 6.46% as at 30 June 2008.
(b)  a loan of £20m (2007 - £10.0m), of which £10m was drawn down on 24 May 2007, £9.1m on 24 September 2007 
and £0.9m on 19 May 2008. Repayments will commence on 24 November 2008 and will continue until 24 May 2013. 
The loan carries a variable interest rate of 6.46% as at 30 June 2008.
2 
Of the £968,000 loan notes, £950,000 (2007 - £964,000) are payable to the vendors of ISG Cathedral and may be 
redeemed semi-annually at the company’s option, up to July 2009 when the remaining balance is payable. Interest is 
payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 7%. The £18,000 loan notes are payable to certain vendors of Pearce and may be 
redeemed semi-annually at the holders’ option, up to November 2009 when the remaining balance is payable. Interest is 
payable semi-annually at a variable base rate of 5% at 30 June 2008. 
There have been no breaches of bank covenants during the year. The bank loans are guaranteed by material subsidiaries of 
the group. The group does not have any of its property and equipment pledged as security over bank loans.

 2007 Loan notes for £964,000 were also payable to the vendors of ISG Cathedral and may be redeemed semi-annually at 
the company’s option, up to July 2009 when the remaining balance is payable. 
The group had the following committed undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 June 2008:

  24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
a.  Financial risk management
All companies are exposed to capital and market risk, but the Board considers the group’s key elements of financial risk to be: 
•	 Credit	risk
•	 Foreign	Currency	risk	
•	 Liquidity	risk
•	 Interest	rate	risk
This note presents information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the group’s management of capital, 
and the group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. Please refer also to the principal 
business risks in the Directors’ Report on page 27 and also the Corporate Governance statement on pages 34 to 35. 
Capital risk management 
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure 
projects and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board manages its capital to ensure that entities in the 
group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the 
future development of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 23, cash and cash 
equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed in Notes 22, 27, and 28 respectively.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage 
and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and the 
potential impact of any significant economic changes are discussed at monthly Board meetings. 
As the group has a positive net cash position, it reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term 
deposits. By managing the risk of currencies of its borrowings the group has previously been able to achieve a level of 
natural hedge of both the balance sheet net currency assets and also the currency earnings due to the currency interest 
payable. Refer to both foreign currency risk and interest rate risk and in Note 24d and 24f respectively. 
The group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
b.  Categories of financial instruments
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of 
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, 
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008 c.  Credit risk
The group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued 
income, which represent the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the consolidated 
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the group’s management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
group. The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of 
financial loss from defaults. 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents 
the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. No credit exposure is permitted to a financial institution 
with a rating lower then A+ or equivalent. The group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously 
monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the 
group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an 
influence on credit risk.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics. The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components 
of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss 
component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The 
collective loss allowance is determined by references to past default experience and historical data of payment statistics for 
similar financial assets. 
Before accepting any new customer, the group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The 
company monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for each division. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, 
approximates their fair value. 
Ageing of trade receivables:
  Gross Impairment Gross Impairment
  2008 2008 2007 2007
  £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

   153,125 1,109 101,567 (1,040)
      
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. Included 
in the group’s trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of £4,401,000 (2007 - £1,922,000) which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the group has not made provision as there has not been a significant change in the credit 
quality and the amounts are considered recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.  24.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)

Amounts recovered during the year     (118) -
      
     1,109 1,040
      
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due 
to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision 
required in excess of the above amount.
d.  Foreign currency risk
The group has international operations and is exposed primarily to the Euro (“EUR”) and Singapore dollars (“SGD”), hence 
exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The main risk is from net investments in foreign operations, recognised 
assets and liabilities and future trading transactions. 
The current level of foreign business is approximately 26% (2007 - 13%) of the group’s trading operating profit before group 
activities. 
The group will usually seek to finance its net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those 
subsidiaries’ functional currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge against movements in those currencies to the extent 
that the associated net assets exceed the net foreign currency borrowings. 
In 2007 a hedging loan of SGD 6,000,000 was used to hedge the group’s foreign exchange exposure on the net assets 
in Singapore. The loan was repaid on 29 June 2007 and resulted in a foreign exchange gain of £57,000. The accounting 
treatment of exchange gains and losses relating to foreign activities is described in Note 4.
Foreign exchange risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Department and the Board and if considered necessary 
a strategy to minimise any potential risk will be discussed and implemented. Significant foreign exchange movements 
are also reviewed by the Board and the process of reviewing different options is undertaken on a quarterly basis. Hedging 
arrangements are being put in place for the next financial year. 
The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:
 Assets liabilities
  2008 2007 2008 2007
  £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
GBP   356,783 237,410 (330,521) (218,787)
SGD   25,086 19,883 (19,453) (16,711)
EUR   20,750 2,415 (15,603) (538)
      
   402,619 259,708 (365,577) (236,036)
      
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The group is mainly exposed to the Euro and Singapore dollars. A 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against SGD has 
a circa £177,000 impact and a 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against EUR has a circa £308,000 impact on trading 
operating profits. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008 e.  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring bank covenant compliance, forecast 
and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in Note 23 is a listing of 
additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk. 
As the group has a positive net cash position, it reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term 
deposits. A daily cash forecast for the next ten working days is prepared daily and weekly cash forcasts for the next twelve 
weeks are prepared and reviewed at company and group level. At each month end a twelve month cash flow is prepared 
by each company and submitted to group. Minimum cleared cash levels have been imposed on each company and actual 
balances are monitored against the minimum levels on a daily basis. In addition the top and bottom ten cash contracts by 
company are reviewed at company and group level on a monthly basis. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.

f.  Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The group’s only interest-bearing asset is cash, which is invested in short-
term deposits.
The group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily though borrowing funds at floating interest rates. Borrowings issued 
at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. The group manages interest rate risk on borrowings by 
ensuring access to diverse funding and through monitoring interest rate movements with weekly reports. 
Interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis and if considered necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk 
through interest rate swaps will be discussed and implemented. Currently it has been deemed unnecessary from a 
materiality point of view to enter into any hedging arrangements. 
The group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed below. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit 
for the year would increase or decrease by £226,141 (2007 - £85,212) in respect to exposure to the group’s borrowings. 
However this exposure is largely mitigated by cash balances held by the group throughout the year.
g.  Fair value of financial instruments
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in 
the financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear 
interest at rates approximate to the market.

An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 24e. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. 
The group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the group’s general policy to 
pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms. 
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing cost and they 
include retention amounts held over defect liability periods. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 36 days 
(2007 - 31 days) for the group. The group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid 
within the credit timeframe.
There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade creditors in either 2008 or 2007.
The group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe. 
Therefore, under the normal course of business, the group is not charged interest on overdue payables.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) | AT 30 JUNE 2008 As at 30 June 2008, the Interior Services Group Employee Share Trust held 1,446,517 (2007- 1,151,075) ordinary 1p shares in 
the company at a cost of £3,634,000 (2007 - £2,630,000) and a market value of £2,386,750 (2007 - £3,775,000). These shares 
have not yet been allocated to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares have been waived. The group does not 
consider the decrease in value of the shares to be permanent diminution in value and as such they have not been written down.
At 30 June 2008, the group owns 4.9% (2007 - 4.2%) of its own called up share capital.
During August 2003, ISG City Axis Limited, one of the company’s joint venture investments, was disposed of for 
consideration of a 22.2% shareholding in an enlarged company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange as ISG Asia Limited. 
This resulted in the unrealised gain of £436,000 in prior years which was realised in the previous financial year through the 
disposal of the 22.2% shareholding in ISG Asia Limited.
29. CAPITAL AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
At 30 June 2008, the group and the company had no capital commitments (2007 - nil).

27228_Text.indd   73 30/10/08   16:37:14 31. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There are group cross guarantees from the company for all monies due to certain of the group’s banks and surety lenders. 
No monies were outstanding at 30 June 2008 (2007 - nil). In the normal course of business there are contingent liabilities 
including the provision of bonds in respect of completed and uncompleted contracts.
As reported in last year’s financial statements, in March 2006 the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) visited the offices of Totty 
Construction, a subsidiary of the Propencity Group, along with many other construction companies, in relation to potential 
breaches of competition law in earlier years prior to ISG’s ownership. During the year the Propencity Group entered into 
a leniency agreement with the OFT in respect of the alleged infringements and has submitted a response to the OFT’s 
Statement of Objections. The group remains unable to estimate the size of any potential liability and as a result no provision 
has been made in these accounts.
Similarly Pearce Construction (Midlands) Limited, a subsidiary of the Pearce Group, has been issued with a Statement of 
Objections by the OFT. The business is defending its position and the group has received an indemnity from the vendors of 
the Pearce Group, which will serve to mitigate risk in this matter.
32. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note. There have been no material transactions between the group and its associates or joint 
ventures during the year.

  On 28 September 2007 the group acquired the remaining 80% of the issued share capital of Interior Alpha SA and 
its subsidiaries (IASA), in which it formerly had a 20% shareholding, for a fair value consideration before expenses of 
£13,732,000 satisfied by cash of £9,591,000, the issue of 563,456 shares and deferred consideration of £2,215,000 
(subject to the business achieving certain profit targets). The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values 
(due to commercial issues still not resolved at year end), based on the Board’s initial assessment of net realisable value, 
are detailed above. Goodwill recognised is attributable to the acquisition enabling the group to gain 100% of the profits (as 
opposed to their previous 20% shareholding) and enabling expansion into the Europe market.
  IASA contributed £30.1m revenue and £3.0m to the group’s operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition 
and the balance sheet date. If the acquisition of IASA had been completed on the first day of the financial year the group 
revenues for the period would have been £1,760.1m and group profit before tax would have been £13.2m.

 On 13 November 2007 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Pearce Group Limited, for a fair value 
consideration before expenses of £20,810,000 satisfied by cash of £8,985,000, the issue of 1,154,324 shares, loan 
notes of £514,000 (of which £497,000 were redeemed for cash on 1 May 2008) and deferred consideration of £7,293,000 
(subject to the business achieving certain profit targets). The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values 
(due to commercial issues still not resolved at year end), based on the Board’s initial assessment of net realisable value, 
are detailed above. Goodwill recognised is attributable to the acquisition enabling the group to gain exposure to the retail 
sector of the market, expansion of our client base and a wider geographical spread. 
 Pearce Group Limited contributed £99.6m revenue and £1.5m to the group’s operating profit for the period between the 
date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. If the acquisition of Pearce Group Limited had been completed on the first 
day of the financial year the group revenues for the period would have been £1,172.1m and group operating profit before 
tax would have been £12.7m. 34. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SUBSIDIARIES

35. EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE
There have been no significant events since the balance sheet date.
36. TRANSITION TO IFRS
For all periods up to and including the year to 30 June 2007 the group has prepared its financial statements in accordance 
with UK generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). For the year to 30 June 2008 the group is required to prepare 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The group’s transition date to IFRS is 1 July 2006. This has been determined in accordance with IFRS 1 “First Time 
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”, being the start of the earliest period of comparative information.
To explain the change to IFRS, a reconciliation has been provided of the equity at 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007 and the 
net income for the year to 30 June 2007 from the previously published consolidated financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with UK GAAP to the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. An 
explanation of the principal adjustments required by the group on conversion to IFRS is set out below. 
None of the IFRS adjustments relevant to the group relate to cash and therefore there is no impact on cash flows. IAS 7 
“Cash Flow Statements” changes the definition of cash used in the cash flow statement to cash and cash equivalents. 
The UK GAAP figures have been restated to take account of any presentational changes required by IFRS adoption, where 
for instance items are required to be shown on the face of the primary statements rather than in the notes and where 
existing items are now split current/non-current or shown on different lines (e.g. intangible asset).
a. Effects of IFRS transition
Goodwill
Under IFRS 3 “Business Combination”, goodwill has been assigned an indefinite life as at the date of transition and it is no 
longer amortised. The group has elected to apply the exemption related to business combination and has fixed its goodwill 
at its carrying value as at 1 July 2006. 
Under UK GAAP , goodwill recognised by the group on acquisition was capitalised and amortised over a period of 20 years. 
Therefore, all amortisation charges post 1 July 2006 have been reversed. The result of these adjustments is to decrease 
the amortisation charge in the income statement by £2,357,000 for the year ending 30 June 2007 and increase the carrying 
value of the goodwill by the same amount respectively. 36. TRANSITION TO IFRS (continued)
Intangible assets
Application of IFRS 3 and IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” resulted in identification of intangible assets, including customer 
relationships and customer contracts. Under IFRS these have been recognised separately in the balance sheet at their fair 
value at the date of the combination.
Under UK GAAP these intangible assets were subsumed within goodwill. Therefore, all identifiable intangible assets have 
been reclassified on acquisition of ISG Asia Limited and Cathedral Contracts Limited. As at 30 June 2007, following the 
acquisition of ISG Asia Limited, the result of this adjustment is to decrease goodwill by £851,000 and increase the carrying 
value of intangible assets by the same amounts at the date of the combination. Subsequent to the recognition of the 
intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities increased by £238,000 and the carrying value of goodwill increased by the same 
amount at the date of the combination, therefore creating a net impact on goodwill of £613,000.
As at 30 June 2007, following the acquisition of Cathedral Contracts Limited, the result of this adjustment is to further 
decrease goodwill by £2,812,000 and increase the carrying value of intangible assets by the same amounts at the date of 
the combination. Subsequent to the recognition of the intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities increased by £788,000 and 
the carrying value of goodwill increased by the same amount at the date of the combination, therefore creating a net impact 
on goodwill of £2,024,000.
Amortisation of intangibles 
Under IAS 38, intangible assets have been assigned finite useful lives at date of the combination and have been amortised 
over the assigned useful lives. The result of this adjustment is to increase intangible assets charge in the income statement 
for the year ended 30 June 2007 by £699,000 and decrease the carrying value of the intangible assets by the same amount 
respectively. Subsequent to the recognition of the intangible asset charges, deferred tax liabilities decreased in the balance 
sheet and the tax charge in the income statement decreased by £196,000 for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Employee benefits
Under IAS 19 “Employee benefits”, the group is required to recognise a provision in respect of holiday pay. The result of this 
adjustment is to increase provisions by £186,000 in the transition balance sheet as at 1 July 2006 and by £235,000 in the 
balance sheet as 30 June 2007. Subsequent to the recognition of the provision, deferred tax liabilities decreased by £56,000 
as at 1 July 2006 and by £66,000 for the year ended 30 June 2007.

27228_Text.indd   81 30/10/08   14:17:22 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INTERIOR SERVICES GROUP PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2008 
which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes 37 to 44. These parent company financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 
2008 and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
and the Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited parent company financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
parent company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by 
the directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view ,	in	accordance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2008;
•	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	1985;	
and
•	 the	information	given	in	the	Directors’	Report	is	consistent	with	the	parent	company	financial	statements.

of Association of the Company.
The directors believe that the proposed resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of shareholders as a 
whole and recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all the resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of their own 
beneficial shareholdings in the Company.

Notes to the Notice of the Meeting:
1.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting on his behalf. A member may appoint more than one 
proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached 
to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A proxy form 
which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice.
2.  To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any authority under which it is executed (or a notarially 
certified copy of such authority) must be deposited at the office of the registrars, Capita IRG plc (Proxies), PO Box 25, 
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude ordinary shareholders from attending and voting in 
person at the meeting.
3.  Copies of all directors’ service contracts of more than one year’s duration, or where any such contract is not reduced 
to writing, a memorandum of the terms thereof, plus a redline version of the new Articles of Association will be 
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday 
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice until the date of the meeting and for 15 
minutes prior to and at the meeting.
4.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those shareholders who are 
registered on the Company’s share register at 10:30am on 6 December 2008, being not more than 48 hours prior to 
the time fixed for the meeting or, if the meeting is adjourned, such time being not more than 48 hours prior to the 
time fixed for the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting and vote in respect of 
the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the share register made after this 
time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and/or vote at the Annual General Meeting. 5.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at 
the meeting so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate 
representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate 
representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting 
directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance 
with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder 
attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate 
representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who 
attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated 
corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of 
this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as 
described in (i) above.
Explanatory	notes	on	the	resolutions
Explanation	of	Ordinary	Business
The Companies Act 2006 requires that for each financial year, the directors present the Company’s Accounts, the Directors’ 
report and the Auditors’ report before the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders of the Company. The directors are 
also seeking approval of the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration.
Article 108 of the Company’s Articles of Association requires that directors shall retire from office and shall be eligible for 
re-election. Accordingly M J Barnes and R M Dantzic are retiring and seeking re-election. J L Jeremy is retiring due to his 
length of service and is also seeking re-election. Article 113 requires any directors appointed by the Board as additional 
directors shall hold office only until the next annual general meeting unless they are re-appointed. Accordingly, G V Aldridge 
is seeking re-appointment.
The Companies Act 2006 requires that the Company shall, at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, appoint 
an auditor or auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at

LLP , as the auditors of the Company and the directors are seeking shareholder approval to fix the amount of their fees.

of service with the Company the Board agreed that he should submit himself for re-election every year from 2007 onwards.
M J Barnes joined the Board as a non-executive director in June 2004. He has extensive experience in the leisure and

Explanation	of	Special	Business
Authority to allot ordinary shares (Resolution 9)
At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders will again be asked to renew the directors’ authority to allot relevant securities 
under section 80 of the Act, for a period of five years from the date of passing the resolution. This authority will be limited 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £98,192, which represents approximately 33 per cent. of the current issued ordinary 
share capital. Passing this resolution will give the directors flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority except in 
connection with the employee share schemes of the Company.
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (continued) Disapplication of pre-emptive rights (Resolution 10)
Shareholders will also be asked to allow the directors, within limits, to allot equity securities and/or to sell equity securities 
held “in treasury” (if any) (see below for explanation of equity securities held “in treasury”) in the Company for cash 
without application of the pre-emptive rights provided by section 89 of the Act and for the purpose of allotting equity 
securities or selling equity securities held in treasury up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of £29,458, which 
represents approximately 10 per cent. of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The authority will expire 
on a date being five years after the passing of the resolution unless previously renewed or revoked by the Company. There 
are no current plans to allot any shares except in connection with the employee share schemes of the Company.
Since 1 December 2003, companies have been allowed to purchase their own shares and hold them “in treasury”, rather 
than having to cancel them. Treasury shares carry no right to attend or vote at meetings, or to receive dividends. Nor will the 
shares confer any right to participate pre-emptively in new issues by the Company. It is possible to hold treasury shares for 
later cash sale or for transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employees’ share scheme, or to cancel them at any time.
The Company does not at present hold any shares in treasury.
Authority to purchase own shares (Resolution 11)
Resolution 11 is to authorise the Company to purchase (in accordance with its Articles of Association and within 
recommended best practice) up to 10 per cent. of the present ordinary issued share capital. The authority prescribes the 
maximum and minimum prices to be paid, and, if passed, would expire within twelve months of this year’s Annual General 
Meeting at the latest.
The authority would only be exercised if the directors were satisfied that such purchases might be expected to result in an 
increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and were in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Shares purchased under the authority would be treated as cancelled (and the number of shares in issue reduced 
accordingly) or would be held as treasury shares, which may be re-sold, cancelled or transferred for the purposes of an 
employee share scheme.
Shareholders will once again be asked to allow the directors, within limits, to make market purchases of the Company’s 
shares. As at the date of this Notice, the Company had 29,457,699 shares in issue. Resolution 11 seeks authority to 
purchase a maximum of 2,945,770 shares, representing approximately 10 per cent. of its current issued share capital.
Adoption of new Articles of Association (Resolution 12)
Resolution 12 is to adopt new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”) in order to update the Company’s current Articles 
of Association (the “Current Articles”) primarily to take account of changes in English company law brought about by the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company is also proposing changes to its Current Articles to incorporate provisions relating to 
directors’ indemnities, enhanced scrip dividends and the power to postpone meetings of the Company. The principal changes 
introduced in the Articles are summarised below. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature and also 
some more minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the Companies Act 2006 have not been noted below. 
The New Articles showing all the changes to the Current Articles are available for inspection as noted on page 87 of this 
document.
1. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions 
 Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main to 
be removed or amended (as appropriate) in the New Articles to bring them into line with the Companies Act 2006. 
This is in line with the approach advocated by the Government that statutory provisions should not be duplicated in 
a company’s constitution. Certain examples of such provisions include provisions as to the form of resolutions, the 
variation of class rights, the requirement to keep accounting records and provisions regarding the period of notice 
required to convene general meetings. The main changes made to reflect this approach are detailed below. 
2. Form of resolution 
 The Current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is required, a special or 
extraordinary resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is required, a special resolution 
is also effective. This provision is being amended as the concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been retained 
under the Companies Act 2006.
3. Variation of class rights 
 The Current Articles contain provisions regarding the variation of class rights. The proceedings and specific quorum 
requirements for a meeting convened to vary class rights are contained in the Companies Act 2006. The relevant 
provisions have therefore been amended in the New Articles. 
4.	 Convening	extraordinary	and	annual	general	meetings	
 The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of notice 
required to convene general meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions in the Companies Act 2006. 
In particular an extraordinary general meeting to consider a special resolution can be convened on 14 days’ notice 
whereas previously 21 days’ notice was required.  5. Votes of members 
 Under the Companies Act 2006 proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the Current Articles 
proxies are only entitled to vote on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed 
to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by the shareholder. The New Articles reflect all of these new 
provisions. 
6. Age of directors on appointment 
 The Current Articles contain a provision requiring a director’s age to be disclosed if he has attained the age of 70 
years or more in the notice convening a meeting at which the director is proposed to be elected or re-elected. Such 
provision could now fall foul of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 and so has been removed from the 
New Articles. 
7. Conflicts of interest 
 The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors’ general duties which largely codify the existing law but with some 
changes. Under the Companies Act, from 1 October 2008 a director must avoid a situation where he has, or 
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company’s interests. The 
requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a 
trustee of another organisation. The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts 
and potential conflicts where appropriate, where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The 
Companies Act 2006 also allows the articles of association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ 
conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. The New Articles give the directors authority to approve such situations 
and include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position. 
 There are safeguards that will apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, 
only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, and 
secondly, in taking the decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to 
promote the company’s success. The directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if 
they think this is appropriate. 
 It is the Board’s intention to report annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers of 
authorisation of conflicts are operated effectively and that the procedures have been followed. 
8. Electronic and web communications 
 Provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which came into force in January 2007 enable companies to communicate 
with members by electronic and/or website communications. The New Articles continue to allow communications to 
members in electronic form and, in addition, they also permit the Company to take advantage of the new provisions 
relating to website communications. Before the Company can communicate with a member by means of website 
communication, the relevant member must be asked individually by the Company to agree that the Company may 
send or supply documents or information to him by means of a website, and the Company must either have received 
a positive response or have received no response within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which 
the request was sent. The Company will notify the member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) when a 
relevant document or information is placed on the website and a member can always request a hard copy version of 
the document or information.
9.	 Directors’	indemnities	and	loans	to	fund	expenditure	
 Since the Current Articles were adopted, the law has changed to allow the company greater scope to provide 
indemnities for its directors and to fund expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions against directors. In 
addition, the existing exemption allowing a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a director’s defence 
in court proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies to associated companies. The New 
Articles have therefore been amended to reflect these changes.
10. Change of name
 Under the Companies Act 2006 a company name may now also be changed by whatever means are provided in 
the company’s articles, therefore subject to any applicable legislation and any directions given by the Company in 
a general meeting by special resolution, the articles have been amended to give power to the Board to change the 
name of the Company as is considered advantageous, expedient or otherwise desirable.
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING ((continued) 11. General 
 Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language into the New Articles, update areas in which 
corporate practice has altered and in some areas to conform the language of the New Articles. In particular the New 
Articles now include:
 (a)  the power of the Board to retract or to postpone a meeting of the Company in circumstances where the Board 
consider it impractical or undesirable for the meeting to proceed. Under the common law or the Companies 
Act 2006 (as the 2006 Act is silent on postponement) the meeting would have to be opened at the time and in 
the place specified in the notice and then adjourned immediately. This amendment improves on the position, 
allowing the holding of an impractical meeting to be avoided; 
 (b) clarification of the provisions concerning directors’ fees; and
 (c)  the power of the Board to declare “enhanced scrip dividends”. The Board has the power to declare a scrip 
dividend under the Current Articles (in which holders of ordinary shares receiving a cash dividend have the 
right to receive ordinary shares instead of the cash dividend). The New Articles now include the power of the 
Board to declare enhanced scrip dividends, in which the value of the ordinary shares offered exceeds the cash 
amount that such holders of ordinary shares would otherwise have received by way of dividend. NOTES BY SERVICE AND

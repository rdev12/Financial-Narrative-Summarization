Results and dividend
I am pleased to report that UMECO has
continued to perform creditably over the past
year achieving underlying growth in turnover
and consistent profitability. This encouraging
operating performance should be measured
against a further reduction in the global civil
aviation market, particularly the fall in the build
of new aircraft of some 14 per cent in 2003.
Turnover was £184.5 million, an increase of
£3.4 million; at constant exchange rates the
increase would have been £5.9 million. 
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation 
and exceptional items was £9.6 million 
(2003: £10.2 million) and is in line with the
forecast made on 19 March 2004 in respect of
the rights issue and acquisition of the Advanced
Composites Group. The reported result has
been adversely impacted by £0.9 million of
exchange rate effects compared to 2003. 
Earnings per share, before goodwill 
amortisation and exceptional items, were 25.4p
(2003: 27.7p). The Directors are proposing an
unchanged final dividend of 8.5p, making a
total for the year of 12.5p per ordinary share
(2003: 12.5p). The final dividend is payable on
13 August 2004 to shareholders on the register
on 16 July 2004 and will be payable on the
shares taken up in respect of the rights issue.
Strategic developments
In line with our previously reported strategy of
becoming the leading international provider of
value-added services primarily to the aerospace
and defence markets and advanced composite
materials, the Group has effected a number of
key initiatives during the year:
n In September a new contract to supply
aerospace chemicals to Lufthansa Technik 
AG was announced; this programme was
operational from November and made a
positive contribution to Group sales in the
second half of the year.
n January saw the announcement of a very
major contract to supply Bombardier
Aerospace with a wide range of small
components under a new long term
contract. Implementation of this contract is
already underway and, post implementation,
the annual value of materials to be supplied
to Bombardier is estimated at US$80 million. 
n In February UMECO acquired 80 per cent of
Tailored Logistics Corporation for an initial
consideration of US$8.2 million. The
company is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
and is a specialist supplier of kits of
components primarily to the US Department
of Defense.
n In May the £44.25 million acquisition of 
the Advanced Composites Group was
completed, part-funded by the £21.0 million
rights issue that was 96.7 per cent taken up
by investors. The company is a leading
international supplier of high performance
advanced composite materials to OEMs in
the motorsport & automotive, aerospace &
defence and other industries, with
operations in both the UK and US.

Management and employees
On behalf of the Board I wish to express our
appreciation to all of our employees for their
continuing efforts in what has remained a 
very challenging market place. Our on-going
success in winning new business is a reflection
of the very high level of service we deliver to
our customers. 
Prospects
There are continuing signs of recovery in the
civil aerospace market and the US defence
market remains strong. These factors, together
with the expected contribution from the new
contracts we have secured and the acquisitions
we have made, give me considerable confidence
that our immediate and long term prospects will
be much enhanced from what has been
achieved in the past two years.
UMECO now has market leading positions in a
number of key segments and has plans in place
to develop further its international presence and
infrastructure to ensure we capitalise on the
expected growth in the global aerospace
market, and in demand for advanced composite
materials in the aerospace and other industries. 
In conclusion I look forward to seeing the
continued development of UMECO as a major
player in our chosen market places – we have
the vision and resources to deliver on this goal.

Operations
Turnover for the year was £184.5 million 
(2003: £181.1 million) and includes a full year
contribution from Pattonair SAS (formerly
Titanox Aerospace) compared to three months
in the prior year, and a two month contribution
from Tailored Logistics Corporation. These two
transactions accounted for additional turnover 
of £2.8 million. Against this, adverse foreign
exchange rate movements, principally the
weakening US dollar against sterling, had the
effect of reducing reported turnover; at constant
exchange rates turnover would have been 
£2.5 million higher.
On a like for like basis turnover increased in the
year by 2 per cent; this was a considerable
achievement when seen in the context of the
continued fall in the civil aerospace market of
some 14 per cent. Underlying growth has been
achieved in a number of businesses and the
Group benefited from further additional volume
under our long term contract with Rolls-Royce
plc. However, the decision by BAE SYSTEMS to
suspend production on the Nimrod upgrade
programme had the effect of reducing sales in
the year by £2.1 million.
Operating profits, before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, at £10.5 million (2003:
£11.3 million) were adversely impacted by
foreign exchange rate movements amounting to 
£0.9 million. Tailored Logistics Corporation made
a positive contribution to operating profits
during the first two months of our ownership.
Operating profits referred to in this Review are
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items which provides a more consistent measure
of operating performance.
UMECO Components
Sales of £110.9 million (2003: £107.6 million);
Operating profits of £4.0 million (2003: 
£4.7 million).
UMECO Components is a leading international
provider of value-added distribution and supply
chain outsourcing services primarily to OEM
customers in the aerospace and defence
markets. Through its specialisation in the supply
of small components and its sophisticated
systems, significant cost and working capital
benefits can be facilitated for its expanding
customer base.
Like for like sales, based on constant exchange
rates, grew in the year by 3 per cent reflecting
the further growth from the contract with Rolls-
Royce plc which enjoyed considerable expansion
in its aftermarket business. Overall growth was
held back by BAE SYSTEMS’ suspension of the
Nimrod programme. The sales impact of the
new contract with Bombardier Aerospace was
immaterial in the period as implementation is 
not scheduled to commence until the new
financial year.
Clive Snowdon
Chief Executive
“Operating profits, before
goodwill amortisation

(2003: £11.3 million) 
were adversely impacted 
by foreign exchange rate
movements amounting 
to £0.9 million.”
  5
UMECO
annual report 2004
Operating profits fell in the period primarily due
to on-going losses at Pattonair SAS in France
and a weaker performance by Pattonair in the
UK. Steps have been taken to restructure the
two businesses and to reduce their cost base.
This will entail the French business focusing on
sales and customer service activities with the UK
providing logistical support. In addition in the
UK a redundancy programme has been
implemented as a consequence of the suspension
of the Nimrod programme and the decision to
move responsibility for supporting Rolls-Royce in
Germany to Ulogistics. These actions, coupled
with some newly secured contracts, should lead
to a marked improvement in performance in the
new financial year. 
The award by Bombardier Aerospace in January
2004 of a major new outsourcing contract was
the outcome of over two years of extensive
negotiations and represents an important
breakthrough into the North American service
provision market. The contract covers the
customer’s facilities in Montreal, Toronto,
Wichita and Belfast and because of its size and
complexity will take up to 36 months to fully
implement. A fixed management fee will be
earned during the implementation period
followed by a variable fee based on the annual
value of the materials supplied. Implementation
is proceeding to plan at the current time and is
expected to have a positive impact on results
during the second half of the new financial year.
The contract is for an indefinite period subject
to commercial reviews every four years.
The acquisition of Tailored Logistics Corporation
in February 2004 considerably enhances
UMECO Components’ access to the growing US
defence market. The company will work closely
with Abscoa, UMECO Components’ other 
US based subsidiary, to ensure all opportunities
are successfully exploited. Tailored Logistics
Corporation made a positive contribution to
operating profits in our first two months of
ownership and is expected to make a significant
contribution in the new financial year.
Ulogistics continues to extend its activities with
Rolls-Royce plc and, from June 2004, will be
taking over the contract held by Pattonair to
supply components to Rolls-Royce’s operations
in Germany. The provision of further additional
services is being actively considered by both
parties at the current time.
Abscoa continues to trade successfully and has
recently secured a major extension to its
contracts with Lockheed Martin lasting until
2010. With the lease on its Fort Worth 
facility ending in 2004, Abscoa purchased an
adjacent freehold site during the year and has
contracted to build a new purpose built facility
that should be available for occupation in the
autumn of 2004.
Compstock, the UK based distributor of
electronic components, enjoyed a better year
and appointed a new managing director from
within the industry in late February 2004.
During the year under review UMECO
Components has prepared a detailed strategic
plan, the implementation of which is expected
to drive significant sales and profit growth over
the next three years as customer demand for
our outsourcing services increases and the civil
aerospace market recovers.

UMECO Composites
Sales of £57.6 million (2003: £59.2 million);
Operating profits of £4.6 million (2003: 
£5.0 million).
To reflect the fact that over 75 per cent of sales
will be composite-based following the acquisition
of Advanced Composites Group, the division has
been renamed ‘UMECO Composites’.
A broad range of specialist chemical products
and composite materials is distributed, principally
to the international aerospace market. Other
markets served include motor sport, wind
energy and the plastic structures industry. 
A full range of outsourcing services is provided
to major customers.
Sales levels have remained broadly stable at
constant exchange rates. Operating profits are
modestly down primarily due to Richmond
Aircraft Products’ loss of the distribution rights
of one particular product line. 
Aeropia, working with a German partner,
successfully secured an important contract to
supply aerospace chemicals to Lufthansa Technik
in September 2003. A new subsidiary was
formed to manage this contract, Aeropia
Logistik GmbH, of which Aeropia owns 74.8 per
cent. The contract was successfully implemented
by November 2003 and is expected to make a
positive full year contribution in the new
financial year. Aeropia in the UK also won a
number of new supply contracts.
Aerovac in both the UK and France achieved
sales growth in the year reflecting the increased
use of composite materials in the aerospace
industry and a broadening of their product
range to include the design and manufacture of
high value moulds. During the year the facilities
of Aerovac in Toulouse were significantly
expanded to accommodate the expected further
growth of the business and the company has
recently taken delivery of a new autoclave
which will give it a unique capability to service
its growing customer base.
Richmond Aircraft Products grew its core
composites business during the year and
continues to invest in new equipment in order
to provide a broader range of services to its
customer base. The previously reported loss of
the distribution rights of the Rohacell product
range was a considerable disappointment for
the business, however plans are in place to
introduce an alternative product to the market
in the new financial year.
The acquisition of the Advanced Composites
Group in May 2004 represents an important
growth opportunity for UMECO Composites,
significantly increasing the Group’s existing
presence in the high growth, high margin
advanced composite materials market. 
Strategic plans to capitalise on the strengths of
its existing and new operations are already
being implemented.

UMECO Repair and overhaul
Sales of £16.0 million (2003: £14.3 million);
Operating profits of £1.9 million (2003: 
£1.6 million).
UMECO Repair and overhaul comprises one
company, AEM, which is a leading European
independent overhauler providing maintenance
services for over 2,000 components over a
broad range of aircraft types.
The company has again achieved excellent
results with sales up by 12 per cent and
operating profits 22 per cent. This result was
helped by some one-off orders from overseas
customers which are not expected to recur in
the new financial year. The company continues
to expand its capabilities and opened a sales
office in Singapore during the year to support
its growing customer base in the rapidly
expanding Far East market.
Summary
Our core aerospace market remained very
challenging in the year under review with the
new build of civil aircraft falling by 14 per cent
and other programmes being postponed or
delayed. Against that background the Group
has performed well with sales growth having
been achieved, underlying profitability
maintained and good operating cash flows
having been generated.
The civil aerospace market is now showing signs
of recovery with increasing passenger numbers
being reported and the fall in the number of new
aircraft being built appears to have bottomed
out, with 2004 expected to remain the same as
for 2003. The medium term outlook is more
encouraging with the A380 entering service in
2006 and the new Boeing 7E7 in 2008. The fact
that Rolls-Royce has been selected as one of two
suppliers to provide engines for the latter is
excellent news for UMECO.
The US defence market, by far the largest in the
world, continues to grow and will be enhanced
by the on-going development and production of
the Joint Strike Fighter over the next decade. In
Europe the A400M transport aircraft is now in
development and goes into production in 2007.
We are particularly excited by the opportunities
provided by the acquisition of the Advanced
Composites Group, which gives the Group an
excellent strategic balance between two growth
activities: on the one hand, value-added
distribution services to the aerospace and
defence industries and, on the other, the high
margin advanced composites industry.
The combination of this and other strategic
developments detailed in the Chairman’s
Statement, expected growth from existing
contracts and the continued recovery in our
core market provides UMECO with excellent
growth prospects for the medium term.

Operating results
Sales for the year at £184.5 million were 2 per
cent above last year’s figure of £181.1 million.
At constant exchange rates the increase would
have been 3 per cent. Operating profits before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
were £10.5 million, some £0.8 million lower
than the previous year; the fall is primarily due
to the effects of adverse exchange rate
movements and the disappointing performance
at Pattonair in France and the UK.
Interest
Whilst year end debt is marginally above last
year, lower average net debt and lower interest
rates have resulted in a reduced interest charge
of £0.9 million compared with £1.1 million in
2003. Average interest rates payable in the year
were 3.9 per cent and average net debt was
£22.3 million compared with 4.3 per cent and
£26.7 million last year. Interest was covered 12
times by profit before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items (2003: 10 times). 
Goodwill amortisation
Goodwill is written off over 20 years.
Amortisation of £2.1 million (2003: £2.2 million)
includes a full year charge for Pattonair SAS,
and a two month charge in respect of Tailored
Logistics Corporation. The charge has been
reduced by £0.1 million due to the effect of
currency translation.
Exceptional items
The Group incurred exceptional costs of 
£0.4 million relating to restructuring during the
year within UMECO Components and to
abortive acquisition costs. In the prior year there
was a net exceptional credit of £0.2 million
consisting of a gain of £0.4 million on the
disposal of surplus property offset by redundancy
and restructuring charges of £0.2 million.
Profit before tax
As a result of the lower operating profits and
interest charge, profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was 
£9.6 million, some £0.5 million less than in the
prior year. The result has been adversely
impacted by £0.9 million of exchange rate
effects compared to 2003. Including goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, profit
before tax was £7.0 million (2003: £8.1 million).
Tax
The tax charge on profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was 34.6
per cent (2003: 32.7 per cent). The higher rate
reflects the mix of profits earned in the US and
the impact of losses at Pattonair SAS in France. 
Earnings per share
Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, basic earnings per share were 25.4p, 8 per
cent lower than last year due to the reduced level
of profitability and the higher rate of tax. Including
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, basic
earnings per share were 16.7p (2003: 20.9p).
Dividends
An unchanged interim dividend of 4.0p was
paid in December 2003 and an unchanged final
dividend of 8.5p is proposed making a total
payment of 12.5p (2003: 12.5p). The final
dividend for the year will also be paid on the
new shares issued in respect of the rights issue
announced on 19 March 2004.
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow in the period of £9.7 million
(2003: £17.1 million) was marginally lower than
operating profit after a slight increase in the
working capital ratio to sales. Working capital
outflow of £2.2 million (2003: £4.2 million
inflow) reflected the small increase in overall
sales levels and a reduced stock turn at Pattonair.
As indicated in the Chief Executive’s Review,
improvements in Pattonair’s performance are
expected in the current year. Elsewhere, despite
higher activity levels, Ulogistics reduced its
working capital by £1.8 million reflecting the
increasingly successful efforts made to improve
the return on capital within the company. 
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure of £2.5 million (2003:
£1.9 million) was £0.6 million higher than
depreciation and included £0.7 million on the
extension of Aerovac’s premises in France and
the purchase of the site for Abscoa’s new
building in Fort Worth.

UMECO
annual report 2004
Free cash flow
Operating cash flow less interest, tax and capital
expenditure amounted to £5.4 million (2003:
£12.7 million). Tax paid was £0.2 million lower
than the charge in the profit and loss account
due mainly to the effect of brought forward
unrelieved interest in the US holding company.
Acquisitions
In February 2004 the Group acquired 80 per cent
of Tailored Logistics Corporation for an initial
consideration of £4.5 million (before costs of
£0.4 million). Additional consideration is payable
if the operating performance of the company in
2004 is significantly higher than in 2003. No such
consideration has been accrued since the
likelihood of the performance criteria being
reached is considered to be remote. The Group
has the right, from 2007 onwards, to acquire the
minority holding retained by the vendors with the
consideration based on a multiple of the average
operating profits in 2005 and 2006.
Net indebtedness and gearing
Net debt at the year end was £21.7 million
(2003: £20.7 million) which represents gearing
of 34 per cent (2003: 32 per cent) of
shareholders’ funds. Since the year end, the
Group’s banking facilities have been increased
and now comprise a term loan and revolving
credit totalling US$120.0 million and an
overdraft facility of £10.0 million. The increase is
partially to fund the balance of the consideration
for the acquisition of the Advanced Composites
Group and the remainder to fund the on-going
development of the Group.
Shareholders’ funds
Retained earnings of £1.0 million were offset by
net translation differences on the value of the
Group’s investments in its overseas subsidiaries
leading to a reduction in shareholders’ funds of
£1.2 million.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined
contribution pension schemes together with a
smaller defined benefit scheme that was closed
to new members in 2000. As set out in note 26
to the financial statements, the FRS 17 valuation
of the scheme at 31 March 2004 showed an
improvement to £2.9 million from £3.2 million
in the previous year in the shortfall in the
scheme’s assets to liabilities. This change was
due to a combination of an improvement in
global equity markets offset by increased
inflation assumptions. The deficit remains at
approximately 5 per cent of the Group’s net
asset value and the current contribution rates
have been calculated to fund the shortfall over
the remaining working lives of scheme members.
Currency exchange risk
The Group seeks to hedge currency exchange
risks by matching purchases and sales in its UK
businesses that are denominated in foreign
currencies. Where this is not possible, forward
currency contracts may be taken out to protect
exposures. Group policy prohibits speculation in
currency management.
The net investment in overseas investments is
largely US dollar denominated and the Group’s
net debt is also largely denominated in US dollars.
This has had a beneficial effect on interest charges
which has been partly protected by the use of
interest rate swaps that have fixed the rate on
approximately 70 per cent of the Group’s year
end debt at well below 4 per cent. The sterling
value of US dollar denominated net debt also
fell by £3.0 million in the year and this benefit
was set against the decline in the translated
value of overseas net assets with the net deficit
of £2.2 million being charged to reserves.
International Financial 
Reporting Standards 
Preparations are underway for the advent of
IFRS which will apply to the Group’s financial
statements for the year ending 31 March 2006.
Whilst this imposes a considerable workload,
the impact of the changes on the Group’s
results is not expected to be material although 
it is difficult to be precise since some of the
Standards are currently being revised.

Closing shareholders’ funds 62,889 64,090 56,703 57,377 The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to
the financial statements:
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under historical cost
accounting rules.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.  Acquisitions
are accounted for using acquisition accounting rules. The Group treats investments in undertakings that are jointly controlled as
joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, and is able to exercise significant influence. Prior to
becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Pattonair SAS was accounted for as an associated undertaking. In accordance with FRS 2, and
in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase
of shares in Pattonair SAS, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased. This represents a departure from the
statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Pattonair SAS
became a subsidiary undertaking. The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Group’s
share of Pattonair SAS’s retained reserves, during the period that it was an associated undertaking, being recharacterised as
goodwill. The effect of this departure is to decrease retained profits by £289,000 and to decrease purchased goodwill recognised
on the acquisition by £289,000.
A profit and loss account is not presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill
From 1 April 1998, the difference between the fair values of consideration given and net assets acquired is capitalised in the
consolidated financial statements as goodwill. The Directors consider each acquisition separately for the purpose of determining the
amortisation period of any goodwill that arises. Currently, all such goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated
useful life of 20 years. Fair value adjustments are considered to be provisional at the first balance sheet date after acquisition to
allow time to elapse for any adjustments to be accurately quantified.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 had been written off against reserves on acquisition. In accordance with FRS
10, this goodwill has now been eliminated against the profit and loss reserve. On any subsequent disposal or termination of a
previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal is to be calculated after charging the amount of any related goodwill
previously taken to reserves.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to customers during
the year.
Pension costs
The Group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable salaries and on contributions made by
members. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. Contributions to the schemes are charged to the
profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Group. The Group has made
the transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 in note 26 to these financial statements.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives
on a straight line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property 50 years
Short leasehold property period of lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment 3-10 years
Motor vehicles 3-4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
UMECO
annual report 2004
19
Accounting Policies Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Leases
Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the
lease is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over the
shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included
within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as
interest, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for further instalments. All other leases are operating
leases and the rental charges are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the
gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are
consolidated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation into sterling of
equity interests in overseas subsidiary undertakings are treated as movements in reserves. Foreign exchange differences arising on
borrowings considered to finance, or provide a hedge against, foreign equity investments, are taken directly to reserves.
Financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial risks associated with the Group’s business activities and the financing of
those activities. The Group does not undertake any trading in financial instruments. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge
the Group’s exposure to movements in interest rates. Amounts payable or receivable on such contracts are accrued in the same way
as interest arising on bank balances.

Notes to the Financial Statements

32 26 Pensions
As explained in the accounting policies set out on page 19, the Group operates several pension schemes, the assets of which
are held separately from those of the Group. The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24
and the disclosures given in section (a) of this note are those required by that standard. In accordance with FRS 17, the phased
transitional disclosures required in relation to the defined benefit scheme operated by the Group are set out in section (b) of
this note.
(a) UMECO Group pension schemes
The UMECO plc Group scheme has two sections. The defined benefit section, which is closed to new entrants, provides
benefits based on final pensionable pay with contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the
cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Group. The contributions are determined by a qualified independent
actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted at least every three years, using the projected unit method. The most recent
valuation was at 1 April 2002. The assumptions which have the most significant effects on the results of the valuation are
those relating to the rate of return on investments (7% per annum) and the rates of increase in salaries (4.5 – 5.75% per
annum) and pensions (3.25 – 3.5% per annum). The 2002 valuation showed that the actuarial value of the defined benefit
section’s assets was £4,372,000 which represented 85% of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members after
allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The contributions of the Group and employees are currently 14.2% and
4.5% to 6.5% of earnings respectively. Contributions amounting to £242,000 (2003: £234,000) were payable to the defined
benefit section of the scheme in the year, of which £20,000 (2003: £21,000) was outstanding at the year end. 
The UMECO plc Group scheme also has a defined contribution section. Members of this section contribute between 2% and
6% of pensionable earnings, with the Group making contributions of between 4% and 10%. Contributions amounting to
£426,000 (2003: £366,000) were payable to this section of the scheme in the year, of which £16,000 (2003: £21,000) was
outstanding at the year end. 
The trustees of the UMECO plc Group scheme are chaired by one of the Company’s non-executive Directors and an
independent expert in pension matters attends meetings of the trustees. Responsibility for investment of the scheme’s funds
has been delegated by the trustees to professional investment managers. In accordance with best practice, the Company’s
pension scheme investment managers are not permitted to invest funds in the Group’s own assets or shares.
As described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 40 to 44, the Company operates defined contribution
schemes in respect of Clive Snowdon, and similar arrangements are operated for other employees. Total contributions of
£64,000 (2003: £61,000) were payable to these schemes for the year, of which none was outstanding at the year end (2003:
£Nil).
G.R.P. Material Supplies, Med-Lab and RD Taylor operate defined contribution schemes for qualifying employees. Employer
contributions are a maximum of 10% and employees are encouraged to contribute at similar rates. Total contributions of
£88,000 (2003: £86,000) were payable in respect of the year. Aeropia and Aerovac Systems contribute amounts to the
personal pension schemes of certain employees. The total of such contributions paid in the year was £17,000 (2003: £14,000)
and there were no outstanding payments of contributions at the year end.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in respect of certain businesses in the United States and France.
Contributions to these schemes during the year totalled £198,000 (2003: £149,000).
(b) FRS 17 disclosures
The information required for these disclosures has been obtained by an updating of the actuarial valuation referred to above,
which was carried out by an independent qualified actuary.
The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities for the purposes of these disclosures are as follows: 
2004 2003 2002

identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, when FRS 17 is fully adopted, the
scheme will be accounted for by the Company as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
27 Contingent liabilities
The contingent liability of the Group for bank guarantees and liabilities for bills of exchange discounted in the normal course of
business at 31 March 2004 amounted to £489,000 (2003: £497,000). Under a Group registration, the Company is jointly and
severally liable for value added tax due by other Group companies. At 31 March 2004 this contingent liability amounted to
£1,062,000 (2003: £1,013,000).

35 28 Financial instruments
The Directors review and agree the broad policies for all significant areas of financial management. As the Group’s operations
are centred on the aerospace industry, which is primarily US dollar based, a natural hedge is in place for most foreign currency
transactions. The Group puts in place forward foreign exchange contracts and other hedging instruments where it is thought
necessary to use such instruments to manage the exposure to foreign exchange movements. At 31 March 2004, the Group
held an interest rate swap contract and a forward currency contract. At 31 March 2004, the fair value of the Group’s financial
instruments was not materially different to the book value of the instruments.

Corporate Governance
STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTORS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMBINED CODE
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles of Good Governance and Code
of Best Practice as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code issued by the UK Listing Authority. The Company considers that it
has been in full compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year, subject to the matters
described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the following comments relating to particular provisions of that Code: 
A 2.1 The Board has considered the proposal that a senior independent director be identified in the Annual Report and concluded
that this would be inappropriate given that the Chairman of the Company, and the Chairmen of the audit and
remuneration committees are already identified in the Report.
A 5.1 The Board’s view is that no nomination committee need be established, given the size of the Board at present.
Appointments to the Board are considered by all of the Directors.
With effect from 1 April 2004 a new Combined Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council became applicable to the Group.
The Board is considering the additional requirements of the new Code and wherever practicable will seek to comply with these
requirements.
INTERNAL CONTROL
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied with the Combined Code provisions on internal control having
established the procedures necessary to implement the guidance contained in the ICAEW publication ‘Internal control: Guidance for
directors on the Combined Code’, and by reporting in accordance with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role of
management is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been in
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls during the year, including strategic, operational,
legal and compliance, risk management and financial controls. The processes used by the Board for their review included the
following:
• The Board receives regular reports from management which highlight any material control weaknesses, and discusses actions
taken on weaknesses identified by management;
• The audit committee, based on reports provided by the external auditors, reviews the effectiveness of the internal financial
control system, and any significant matters are referred to the Board for consideration;
• The Chairman of the audit committee reports the outcome of the audit committee meetings to the Board;
• The Board considers all significant financing and investment opportunities relating to the Group, including the granting of
guarantees, and monitors policy in respect of managing treasury and exchange risks;
• The Board reviews the role of insurance in managing risks across the Group.
The Group’s management operates a risk management process which identifies the key risks facing each of the Group’s businesses
and reports to the Board on how those risks are being addressed. This is based on each business producing a report on risk
assessment and business development policy, which identifies the key risks facing the business, the probability of those risks
occurring and the actions being taken to mitigate those risks to the desired level. These reports are combined to provide the Board
with a report of the significant risks faced by the Group as a whole, together with details of the controls in place over those risks.
The Group does not have an internal audit function, however the central finance department does conduct detailed reviews of the
financial records of Group companies. The Board periodically reviews the need for an internal audit function and has done so
during the year. In the light of the reviews conducted by the central finance department, the current conclusion of the Board is that
an internal audit function is not necessary. THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Board
The Board meets regularly and has reserved certain matters for its approval. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary,
and the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. To enable the Board to discharge
its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and there is a procedure for all Directors, in
furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the expense of the Company.
In the opinion of the Board, all of the non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, are considered to be independent.
The following committees, the composition of which is shown on pages 10 and 11, deal with specific aspects of the Group’s
affairs:
Audit committee
The committee meets at least twice annually and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings are also
attended, by invitation, by executive Directors, however the committee meets at least annually with the auditors without executive
Directors being present. The committee advises the board on the appointment of auditors, the independence and objectivity of the
auditors and on their remuneration, and discusses the nature and scope of the audit work undertaken by the auditors.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the
Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its cost. The committee determines the remuneration and other benefits for
each of the executive Directors, including performance related bonus schemes and pension entitlements.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s balance sheet and on the facilities currently available to
the Group, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.  As in prior years the Directors therefore believe that it is appropriate that the
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration committee consists of John Harper as chairman, Brian McGowan and Osman Abdullah, and also has access to
external advice. The committee is responsible for all aspects of the remuneration packages of executive Directors and for the
operation of the Company’s executive share option plans. The members of the committee are non-executive Directors who have no
personal financial interest in the Company, other than as shareholders. They have no day to day involvement in the management of
the Group nor any potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration policy is set by the Board as a whole with the remuneration committee then working within the policy to set
individuals levels of remuneration. The aim of the policy is for the Group to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by
rewarding them with competitive salary, benefit and incentive packages which are linked to performance and which are designed
to enhance the business and the creation of shareholder value. The elements of the remuneration package are as follows:
Basic salaries and benefits in kind
Basic salaries are determined by the remuneration committee, taking into account the performance of each individual and salary
levels prevailing in the market for executives of comparable status and skills. The salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1
April or when a change of responsibilities occurs. Benefits in kind provided are primarily a company car and fuel and private medical
insurance. Executives may choose to forego the company car and fuel benefit in return for an additional payment of salary, such
payment being calculated so as to leave the Company no worse off from the change.
Performance related bonus
Clive Snowdon and John Beaumont participate in a cash bonus scheme under which entitlement to any bonus is dependent upon
the increase in the Group’s earnings per share. Bonuses paid are non-pensionable and are capped at 100% of basic salary.
Share options
Executive options
Each executive Director is eligible to participate in the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan under which, at the discretion of the
remuneration committee, options may be granted to employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options are
granted under the Plan at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, and are not normally exercisable before the expiry of
three years from the date of grant and not after ten years from the date of grant. 
All options granted under the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan are subject to performance targets, the achievement of which is a
condition precedent to the exercise of the options. The performance target attaching to the options granted to executive Directors
is based on the Company’s growth in earnings per share over a three year period as shown below. This measure has been chosen
because it reflects real improvement in earnings and is considered an appropriate measure for executive share options.
Average real annual growth Percentage of
over the three year period option vesting
Below 5% 0%
Over 5% 25%
Over 7.5% 50%
Over 10% 75%
Over 12.5% 100%
No options may be exercised if the average real annual growth in earnings per share is below 5%. For performance between any
two levels over 5%, the options will be exercisable on a straight line basis. Real growth in earnings per share is defined as the
amount by which the Company’s growth in earnings per share exceeds the rate of inflation over the same period.
In granting options under the Plan, the remuneration committee takes into account the salary level of the individuals concerned.
Details of the options under the UMECO 2001 Share Option Plan granted to executive Directors of the Company are set out on
page 43.
Save as you earn scheme
The Group’s save as you earn (SAYE) share option scheme is open to Directors spending at least 25 hours per week on Group
business. Options under the scheme are exercisable three years from the date of grant. UMECO
annual report 2004

Directors’ pension entitlement
Clive Snowdon
Clive Snowdon is entitled to employer’s pension contributions equivalent to 39% of basic salary. At the executive’s discretion, a
proportion of the pension contribution may be converted into salary. The Company has established the UMECO plc Executive
Retirement Benefits Scheme, an individual defined contribution scheme in respect of Clive Snowdon. In addition the Company is
the principal employer under a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme (FURBS) in respect of Clive Snowdon. Both schemes
are non-contributory by the employee. 
John Beaumont
John Beaumont is a member of the UMECO plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is Inland Revenue approved. Until
normal retirement date members currently contribute 6.5% of salary and the Group currently contributes 14.2%. The scheme
provides members with a pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary on retirement. It also provides a lump sum death in
service benefit and pensions for dependents of members on their death in service or following retirement.
There are no pension arrangements in place for other directors.
Remuneration of non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Chairman’s remuneration committee, which comprises all members of the
Board apart from the Chairman. The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board following
recommendations made by the Chairman.
Service contracts
The Company has agreed service contracts with the executive Directors which are considered consistent with normal practice in
smaller quoted companies wishing to attract and retain suitably qualified executives, and has agreed letters of appointment with
the non-executive Directors. The dates of these contracts and letters are set out below.
BD McGowan 21 April 1997
CJ Snowdon 21 April 1997
RJK Beaumont 20 September 1993
O Abdullah 25 March 1994
JM Harper 5 June 2002
JS Harper 6 July 1995
DR Porter 21 December 2000
Clive Snowdon has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving one year’s notice, or by Clive Snowdon giving six months’
notice. There is no obligation on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice other than basic salary and pension
contributions.
John Beaumont has a contract which is terminable by the Company giving two years’ notice, or by John Beaumont giving six
months’ notice. As part of the terms of this contract, he is entitled to terminate the contract within 12 months of his becoming
aware that, as a result of a hostile take-over, any person has acquired shares in the Company which, taken together with shares
held or acquired by persons acting in concert with that person, carry 50% or more of the voting rights for the time being of the
Company. In that event, John Beaumont would receive compensation equal to the amount to which he would have been entitled
under the relevant legislation if he had been wrongfully dismissed.
None of the letters of appointment of the non-executive Directors provides either for a fixed notice period or for the payment of
compensation. UMECO

No options were granted to or exercised by any Director in the period between 31 March 2004 and the signing date of these
financial statements. 
For those options granted under the 2001 Share Option Plan for which the earliest date of exercise is September 2004, the three
year period over which performance against the target is to be assessed ended on 31 March 2004. Whilst the remuneration
committee will formally consider performance against the target later this year, it expected that the average real annual growth in
earnings per share will be below 5% and that none of these options will therefore be capable of exercise.
The mid market price of the Company’s shares as quoted in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 31 March 2004 was
372.5p and ranged between 198.5p and 392.5p during the year.

Directors’ Remuneration Report Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will remain in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF UMECO plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 13 to 37. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report. As described on page 45,
this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on pages 38 and 39 reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the Corporate Governance statement and the unaudited
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2004
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

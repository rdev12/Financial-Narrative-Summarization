 CPP Group
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Meet the new CPP
CPP is evolving to meet the changing 
needs of today’s consumers.
We’ve taken all that’s best from over 
thirty years of helping customers and 
used it as a bedrock for far-reaching future 
ambitions. By doing so, we aim to build 
a brand that will serve people for another 
30 years and beyond.
It goes much deeper than just a new look 
and feel. At its heart is the core idea that 
drives everything we do, giving us an even 
stronger direction, purpose and identity.
It means our focus is on creating fresh 
products and services that give people 
the freedom and confidence to thrive in 
an increasingly connected world, because 
at CPP we believe positivity creates 
possibilities. By sharing that belief, 
we’re on a mission to inspire people 
to say yes to life’s opportunities.

5 Group overview Our business model and strategy
Having made key structural and personnel changes in 
2016, we continue to build the foundations for strong, 
sustainable commercial growth  Our business model, 
which has customers at its heart, targets revenue 
growth through sustainable renewal rates and new 
business development  Our business strategy has been 
simplified and condensed to focus on the fundamentals 
that will drive our ambitions for the future 
During 2016 we have continued to work through 
our trusted Business Partners  At the same time 
we have developed the capability to engage directly 
with customers which has required us to move into 
new channels, develop new propositions and utilise 
a new approach to marketing  Our performance goals 
are underpinned by three key priorities – future 
revenue growth, innovation and cost management  
It is these fundamentals which form the basis of our 
strategy for 2017 and beyond and will ultimately 
drive a continued improvement in service for 
our customers 
Growing revenue and volume
Growing revenue and volume, based on a great 
customer experience, is our number one priority  
Focus will be placed on our developing markets, 
such as China, India, Mexico and Turkey where 
there is significant growth potential and good 
momentum already being experienced  Initially 
in our established markets such as the UK, Spain, 
Germany and Italy we will concentrate on managing 
our sizeable existing customer base while new 
engaging propositions are brought to market  
Driving innovation
Driving innovation is essential for the Company’s 
future development  Not only are we committed 
to investing in the development of both our existing 
product range and new products and services, 
but also to leveraging new ideas in our sales and 
marketing channels to improve distribution and 
engagement with consumers 
Cost management
Continuing to focus on managing costs is a critical 
part of creating a sustainable, profitable organisation  
It is this cost management that will help enable 
focused investment into our developing markets 
Our people agenda
Our people agenda underpins our three strategic 
priorities, placing customers and colleagues right 
at the heart of our brand  We have continued the 
commitment to develop our people and build the 
bold and forward-facing culture needed to reach 
our goals

services are inspired by our product 
pillars  Using research to identify key

services we continue to explore new 
channels for both communication 
and distribution supported by 
multi-channel service and support

7 Strategic report Sir Richard Lapthorne
Chairman
First impressions
Dominated by its history over the 
past five years, CPP had become an 
organisation preoccupied with the 
past, which was UK-centric in its focus 
and behaviours, despite the extraordinary 
potential developing in its overseas markets  
In 2016 we have started work to redefine 
the organisation in order to refocus our 
resources towards building a successful 
international operation, using the talent 
and skills in our overseas businesses as 
well as those that we have in the UK  
These changes will not happen overnight, 
but the organisation is progressing, led 
by a Group Chief Executive who has been 
skilful in keeping morale high whilst 
introducing difficult changes  This has 
been a solid start to building a better future 
Chairman’s statement
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 8 Progress to date
At the initiative of shareholders, the Board 
was mostly changed in early May 2016 and a 
new Group Chief Executive, Jason Walsh, was 
appointed  Shortly afterwards, all the new Directors 
were approved by the FCA  This was then followed 
by the appointment of Justine Shaw as People & 
Culture Director  Michael Corcoran has advised the 
Board of his intention to stand down from the business 
and the Board with effect from 30 April 2017  
Michael has made an invaluable contribution to 
the stability of the Group and provided continuity 
during a period of potential risk to the business 
and the Board wishes him well in his future roles 
A major review of the Group’s strategy was launched 
during the year  This review has already concluded 
that resources need to be shifted towards providing 
greater support to our businesses in the rapidly 
developing markets for our products in India, 
China, Turkey and Mexico  At the same time, 
line management of the UK business has been 
separated from the Group functions in order to 
treat the UK as a self-standing market alongside 
other developed markets, such as Germany and 
our Southern European markets, as well as the 
developing high growth markets mentioned 
above  The UK’s regulated businesses have been 
ring-fenced against the background of establishing 
an open and constructive dialogue with the FCA  
New product development is being refocused to 
enable legacy products to be adapted to meet 
customer requirements in all markets whilst 
styling new innovative products to be attractive 
propositions, in either a chosen developing market, 
or in an established market prior to global roll-out  
These new products may include regulated 
(insurance) content alongside non-regulated 
(service) content  Design will be driven by 
customer requirements  Our recently announced 
acquisition of Blink Innovation Limited (Blink) 
adds further substance to our product ambitions 
During a period of change in the organisational 
structure and behaviour, senior management 
had become stretched  In January 2017, the Board 
agreed a temporary extension to Nick Cooper’s 
role in order to provide additional capacity to 
Jason Walsh and his executive team  One of the 
many benefits of Nick’s willingness to contribute 
in this way is that it avoids the immediate temptation 
to make permanent appointments too quickly to 
an organisational structure that is still evolving 
Governance
The Board is committed to maintaining high 
standards of governance, both at Board level 
and operationally throughout the business  
A number of key permanent appointments 
have been made during the year to support this 
approach and strengthen our internal controls 
Performance
The Group’s performance in 2016 had many 
positive developments  However, there remains 
a good deal of work to be done to return the Group 
to a position of strength and sustainable growth 
and the Board sees this development as a long 
term goal, which will ultimately benefit all of the 
Company’s stakeholders  The Board has approved 
this Annual Report & Accounts as being fair, 
balanced and understandable, providing the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy 
Looking ahead 
2016 saw the first steps in laying the foundations 
for a prosperous and sustainable future and I look 
forward to continuing that progress in 2017  
On behalf of the Board I would especially like to 
thank our valued colleagues for their commitment 
and hard work during the year and very much look 
forward to working with you all in the coming year

Chief Executive 
Officer’s statement
Jason Walsh
Chief Executive Officer
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 10 Since returning in May 2016, I have undertaken 
a major review of the business and have identified 
many things that are good and working well, but 
also opportunities that we are not capitalising on  
I have set focused plans in motion to address these 
missed opportunities  I have visited all of our major 
operations to understand how they are run and 
where the opportunities lie  Both the progress 
being made and the relationships being developed 
in many of our markets are highly encouraging 
Organisational improvements
For any business to be successful it is critical 
that the structure is right; it must enable flexible 
and dynamic operations  As a result, the Group 
Leadership Team has been slimmed down, allowing 
focus to be provided in the correct areas  There is 
now direct responsibility for country operations, 
product and innovation in addition to marketing and 
the support functions, which allows the Company 
to focus on the key growth drivers in the business  
As part of this streamlining certain Executive 
Directors have also accepted additional support 
function responsibilities  This action has also taken 
cost out of the business, which will allow investment 
in other strategically important areas and roles 
What is the plan?
My assessment of our operations quickly led me 
to identify a clear set of strategic priorities that 
will propel the business towards sustainable, 
profitable growth  These strategic priorities are:
• growing revenue and customer volume;
• driving innovation, through local insight 
and global new product development; and
• cost management 
These priorities will be underpinned by the 
development of colleagues and the cultural 
behaviour within the organisation, along with the 
launch of a new visual identity for the business  
The strategic priorities have been cascaded into the 
business and colleagues are focused on successfully 
realising our growth ambitions which have been 
articulated in a vision for the Group that takes us 
to 2020  These are exciting times 
Growing revenue and volume
The future looks very positive in some of our 
developing markets such as India, China, Turkey 
and Mexico and our strategic plan focuses on 
ensuring that the required investment is directed 
to these markets to maximise all available 
opportunities  The potential in these markets is 
significant  India, China and Turkey are already 
contributing increased volumes to the business, 
but there is more to come  Our established markets 
are not going to be forgotten and we expect renewed 
contribution from markets such as the UK, Spain, 
Germany and Italy  Stronger renewal rates in 
these countries are really encouraging and have 
contributed to an improvement in the Group 
renewal rate to 74 9% (2015: 72 9%) 
Driving innovation
Whilst proud of our existing products we 
recognise the need to stay relevant in a rapidly 
changing world  New product development is key  
We are creating a suite of products with global 
appeal and compatibility  These are service-based 
propositions that can be traded in any of our markets, 
including the UK  The first in this suite of products, 
OwlDetect, has been launched in the UK and 
Germany during 2016  Mexico and Spain will 
follow shortly, with other markets due to launch 
in the first half of the year

operations quickly led me

strategic priorities that 
will propel the business 
towards sustainable, 
profitable growth ”

11 Strategic report What is the plan? continued
Driving innovation continued
A further product is planned for release in 
H1 2017, with others to follow as we continue 
to invest in ideas and concept generation  
These propositions are centred on consumer 
insight and needs and will also be delivered 
digitally to match consumer preference  Product 
innovation will also draw on external sources – via 
partnerships and strategic alliances – to generate 
additional concepts to test and market  The 
acquisition of Blink represents the first step in 
this  New products may have regulated content 
if the opportunity arises  Aligned to this, and 
very much a part of the overall product strategy, 
local innovation is being encouraged and 
supported to capitalise on particular market 
and Business Partner opportunities 
Cost management
To enable additional investment in our developing 
markets, cost management remains an important 
pillar of the strategic plan  This will ensure that our 
cost base remains appropriate and can be targeted 
in the right areas  The Company has made important 
decisions in the recent past to control costs but 
more can be done  In 2016 a number of difficult 
decisions were taken to promote this: we stopped 
development of our IT platform with SSP Limited 
(SSP) in favour of developing a more cost-effective, 
flexible in-house platform, the leadership team has 
been slimmed down, and operational requirements 
and capability across the Group have been reviewed  
The changes made have not only reduced costs 
but improved the performance of the Group  Cost 
management initiatives will continue in 2017 
Colleague engagement and culture
Our colleagues are central to the success of the 
business and are at the heart of providing great 
products and services to our customers  We have 
embedded values of ‘commit, collaborate and 
perform’ within the organisation and implemented 
initiatives to promote colleague development and 
behaviours  The promotion of our People & Culture 
Director, Justine Shaw, to an Executive Director 
position further demonstrates our commitment 
to colleague development  This has created 
greater influence at Board level to drive the 
colleague engagement programme 
Customer
Our customers are hugely important to us  We pride 
ourselves on providing relevant and engaging 
propositions, along with a great ongoing customer 
experience  This will not change and our new 
product development has this understanding 
and commitment at its core  Our customer contact 
centres remain important but we recognise that 
we must also embrace digital channels, supported 
by innovative and engaging branding  
Understanding and engaging 
with our stakeholders
We have proactively engaged with our stakeholders 
through frequent, transparent dialogue and 
consultation  We believe this is critical in the 
development of the Group and sustaining valued 
relationships  We have a credible plan and a strong 
team and I am committed to ensuring our business 
operates in a responsible way, meeting the needs 
of all stakeholders

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 12 Performance
Our global operations continue to progress 
well, leading to a reduced dependency on the UK  
Asia Pacific has seen significant growth and now 
represents 23% of Group revenue, compared to 
11% in 2015  This has been a record year for India; 
customer numbers are increasing rapidly; new 
propositions introduced to the market are gaining 
momentum; and a significant contract signed 
with a leading non-banking financial company is 
expected to provide continued growth  Turkey has 
shown good revenue growth, driven by developing 
multi-partner, multi-channel routes to market 
which will provide a level of sustainability and 
further market opportunity  Other markets are 
also contributing with the annual renewal rate 
increasing to 74 9% (2015: 72 9%)  This is largely 
due to rates increasing in our established markets, 
providing a continued endorsement of the value 
customers place on our traditional products  
Symbolically, the Group’s live policy base has also 
returned to growth with 4 3 million customers at 
the year end (2015: 3 8 million), reflecting growth 
in our Indian and Chinese markets 
As expected, Group revenue from continuing 
operations has declined to £73 6 million 
(2015: £76 8 million)  However, this represents a 
much reduced rate of decline than previous years  
The growth in India has been offset by the natural 
decline in the UK renewal book where new regulated 
sales remain restricted  Underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations has increased 
to £8 4 million (2015: £6 9 million), which reflects 
the improved performance in India and continued 
focused management of the cost base  During 2017, 
we anticipate that revenues will grow  However further 
investment will be made in order to provide a 
sustainable performance in the medium to long term 
Looking ahead
We have made good progress 
in 2016 and are moving forward 
with a clear plan which will 
provide the platform for long 
term growth and profitability  
New product development is 
progressing well with further 
globally applicable propositions 
currently in development  As 
a truly global business, we are 
genuinely excited by the great 
opportunities we have to 
support customers around 
the world

Our people are the heartbeat of CPP  They are at 
the core of delivering our strategic priorities and 
ambitions  Our success depends on the energy 
and drive they create  That is why we have a 
relentless focus on our people agenda as the 
foundation of everything we do, based on co-
created values, cultural evolution and people 
development  Together they provide the 
environment, frameworks and opportunities 
that enable us to reach our goals  
Our people agenda
Justine Shaw
People & Culture Director
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 14 Doing things the right way
Significant progress was made during 2016 to establish a 
values driven culture across the Group  A key highlight was 
providing colleagues with clarity on how to align our 
positive co-created behaviours with our values of Commit, 
Collaborate and Perform  Clear direction and 
understanding was provided through global behaviours 
workshops attended by all colleagues  
A core element of our people agenda are our Great 
Performance Conversations  These are motivational, 
honest and action-orientated discussions between line 
managers and colleagues that set out ‘what’ colleagues are 
encouraged to focus on  They inspire behaviour and habits 
which support the delivery of our aspirations and a great 
customer experience, as well as providing direction on ‘how’ 
to live our values and behaviours on a daily basis  That’s the 
way we do things here at CPP  
Accelerating change through talented colleagues
We recognise we must progress at pace in our 
core areas of focus if we are to successfully realise 
our ambitions  To help achieve this, in 2016 we 
launched a significant programme that harnessed 
high performing, talented colleagues from across 
the Group  Known as Accelerants, they role model 
our values and behaviours to deliver business 
and cultural change in priority areas  We invested 
in our talent through intense coaching, which 
developed a deep understanding of those high 
performance practices and techniques designed 
to drive change and accelerate growth  Positive 
impact and tangible results have been realised 
through the Accelerant programme, with some 
participants taking up new roles with greater 
responsibilities  The Accelerant programme will 
continue throughout 2017 as we engage and 
develop more of our talented people to become 
ambassadors of change and success 
Relentless focus on people
In recognition of the significant role our people 
play, progress was made in a number of areas 
during the year  To ensure we have the right 
people in the right place, colleagues are treated 
consistently, have an opportunity to progress 
and receive appropriate reward and recognition 
for their contribution  
We have attracted new talent by creating a 
number of roles for professionals with fresh 
skills, experience and capabilities that will drive 
innovation and success across the Group  
Appointments such as Commercial and Sales 
Directors in our Asia Pacific region, along with 
Business Development and Client Directors in 
Germany and a new Spanish Country Manager 
will help drive commercial growth  Other new 
recruits are a Head of Internal Audit, a Group Head 
of Risk Management and a Group Information 
Security Manager all of which strengthen our 
governance and regulatory experience  
A job evaluation exercise took place in 2016 to 
ensure we have a consistent grading approach 
to roles across all functions and countries  This 
will underpin our new global grading framework 
that will see functional job families and unique 
functional career paths created for our people 
in 2017  This development is an essential part 
of operating as a truly global organisation 
Promotion from within remained a core part of the 
people agenda in 2016  A number of structural 
changes created career progression opportunities 
for colleagues who want to become the best they 
can be  Examples include the extra responsibilities 
undertaken by our Group Product Director, India 
Country Manager and the UK Country Manager  
A mentoring programme launched in Spain 
provides further support for development 
and internal promotion, and will be rolled 
out in other countries during 2017 
15 Strategic report CPP is committed to developing both 
direct-to-consumer propositions as well as 
those through trusted Business Partners  
In each case, the delivery of relevant and 
inspiring products, backed by excellent 
customer service across our global 
footprint, is our constant priority 
Helping people make the  
most of a connected world
Technology is opening up a world of possibilities 
for our customers as never before  Wherever they 
are in the world, they are connected via mobile 
devices and smart tools  This brings amazing new 
opportunities and new options to people; allowing 
them to explore and try new things, reach out 
and engage  
We believe that looking at the world with a positive 
state of mind creates opportunities for our 
customers, our partners and for us  We are here 
to help empower people, creating the products 
and services that allow them to explore and 
connect with confidence  By equipping them 
with the right tools we believe people enjoy 
greater freedom to embrace life’s opportunities 
and make the most of the connected future 
Better insight helps us better serve our customers
Our understanding of today’s global consumer, 
gained through research and insight, demonstrate 
three key trends shaping the market:
Life on demand
Time is more precious than ever to consumers – 
driving an expectation that products and services 
must provide immediacy and convenience  Global 
consumers often feel under time pressure in their 
daily lives and are willing to spend money to save 
time  We want to help enable customers to reduce 
friction and pain points in their lives by giving 
them greater control and immediate resolution 
when something goes wrong 
Connected consumers and digital first
Consumers still have a sense of unease when 
undertaking certain activities online  They are 
becoming more aware of the digital crumbs 
of information they leave behind and lack 
confidence with regards to the safety of their 
personal data  We want to help empower 
consumers to take advantage of technology 
in a way that enables the protection of personal 
information against misuse  
Our customers
Tracy Abraham 
Chief Marketing Officer
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 16 CPP’s ethos is one of 
positivity and boldness, 
helping us resonate with 
modern consumers 
around the globe. 
Our developing consumer-
facing brand will build 
greater equity through 
increased recognition, 
which, in turn, will drive 
greater revenue for us 
and our Business Partners.
Cruise control
Across the globe, consumers agree they want 
to be in control of their lives at all times  They 
aspire to lead an optimised life, unshackled from 
daily inefficiencies  Customers increasingly want 
to be in the driving seat and are looking for tools 
to self-serve and solve 
From these trends and insights we are developing 
a product portfolio that will give our customers 
that sense of confidence and reassurance which 
comes with feeling their lives are well protected 
and under control  We will continue to invest in 
insight to help us develop relevant services that 
evolve in an ever-changing market  
A new identity marks a 
more direct customer relationship
As we move towards a broader customer base 
including both Business Partners and direct 
consumer relationships, 2016 was the right 
time to initiate a full brand refresh 
The process began with the creation of a new 
visual identity for CPP and 2017 will see the 
project roll out with new branding at product level  
Working across all our channels, the new identity 
will herald a fresh look and feel with a tone of voice 
that articulates our personality values 
Strategic report 17 Innovation and new 
product development
As people continue to live ever more complex, 
mobile and connected lives, CPP’s goal is to 
give them the confidence to connect and 
the freedom to explore their world. Our 
focus is delivering highly relevant, simple 
to use products and services based on 
strong consumer insights and which 
fit seamlessly into users’ daily lives.
Propositions with global appeal
2016 saw the launch of ‘OwlDetect’, CPP’s first global digital 
service  OwlDetect is designed to give consumers more 
confidence and reassurance online by securely monitoring 
the internet and dark web for any leaks of their personal data  
It then helps them take appropriate action if anything is found 
where it shouldn’t be  This service is incredibly relevant in 
today’s society where consumers routinely provide a wide 
array of personal information to access online services  
The OwlDetect service helps customers in three ways:
• Detect – when a customer joins OwlDetect we run an 
immediate historical scan to see if their sensitive personal 
data has been compromised online  If anything is discovered 
they can see what it is, when it was found and what level of risk 
this poses  We then continue with 24/7 monitoring of the 
customer’s data and will send a user alert if anything is found 
• Resolve – if personal data has been compromised we provide 
a tailored action plan so the customer can take back control 
of the situation  We do this online or over the phone  
• Protect – we provide simple to understand and easy to follow 
help on how to stay safe online by taking small practical 
steps without disrupting the customer’s connected life 
Sid Mouncey 
Group Product Director
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 18 We have launched OwlDetect in the UK and 
Germany and will be launching in further countries 
throughout 2017  OwlDetect also works with a 
range of distribution models via our Business 
Partner network  We are actively talking to a 
number of multi-national organisations about 
offering OwlDetect to their customer base 
OwlDetect is also available for consumers to 
buy direct at www owldetect com  Supported 
by a range of locally optimised digital marketing 
initiatives, this represents a first for CPP in 
marketing directly to the end consumer  
We will broaden the OwlDetect proposition to 
satisfy evolving market and customer needs 
in key markets  
Propositions developed to meet 
specific market demand
2016 also saw the launch of a new product, Asset 
Care, in the Indian market, which has contributed 
to the region’s accelerated growth  Asset Care 
is an innovative product providing a package 
of relevant assistance services to consumers 
buying electrical goods in retail stores or online  
We also offer extended warranty, providing added 
assistance services and peace of mind for customers, 
as well as delivering on CPP’s Power to Fix 
core competency 
The product has been launched in-store in over 
200 cities in India  Roll-out was supported by 
our team training in channel and supporting the 
partner execution of the product  Sales figures for 
the product are very strong with over 200,000 new 
customers in the second half of 2016  These 
volumes are expected to continue to grow in 2017  
 
What is in the pipeline?
Innovation and new product development are key 
to our strategic priorities  In 2017, new products 
and services will be brought to market both 
globally and at a more bespoke local level  
We will deliver this through a combination 
of in-house product development and strategic 
partnerships with the first of these being the 
acquisition of Blink  We will focus on bringing 
new innovative products and services to market 
at pace  These products must demonstrate 
ease of understanding and simplicity in use 
The growth of technology solutions that help 
people stay connected to the things that matter 
most to them is an exciting opportunity for CPP  
New services in 2017 will utilise this technology 
to complement our proven ability to fix issues, 
further reducing stress and anxiety when things 
go wrong  This will allow our business to transition 
both new and existing products into people’s 
everyday lives, creating additional value and 
enabling greater control 
We are actively developing travel assist products 
for both home and abroad, as well as in day-to-day 
lives  Our first new product to market in this category 
will use Bluetooth technology to help consumers 
avoid losing or misplacing their wallet or handbag, 
but should the worst happen and a loss occur, they 
can cancel their cards simply through their mobile 
device  It is expected that this product will be 
available by the end of Q2 2017 
Consumer research demonstrates a clear need for 
solutions in these areas and proposition testing 
by CPP has demonstrated high customer appetite 
and interest about our new products

Financial performance 
Revenue for 2016 decreased by 33% to £28 8 million 
(2015: £43 0 million)  Underlying operating profit

Review
The UK and Ireland region accounted for 39% 
of Group full year revenue in 2016  New retail 
business performance in the UK and Ireland 
continues to be constrained by restrictions 
relating to the ongoing Voluntary Variation of 
Permissions (VVOP)  As a result the UK services 
a renewal book where renewal rates have been strong 
and encouraging  In the interests of providing 
value to our existing customers we implemented, 
through savings from commission payments, 
price reductions across our Card Protection 
and Identity Protection books during the year  
Excitingly we launched our new non-regulated 
proposition, OwlDetect, in December 2016  This is 
initially in a direct-to-consumer capacity, but we 
also intend to operate a business-to-business model 
for this proposition in the future  
Extensive work has been undertaken in 2016 to 
create a more cost-effective and growth-orientated 
operating structure, which is suitable for working 
within a global business  This focus will help promote 
good governance and improved customer treatment, 
ensuring we are operationally and commercially 
ready to apply to lift the existing trading restrictions  
In addition there have been key appointments to 
support this, including a new Country Manager 
and senior roles in support functions

38% of the Group’s full year revenue 
Turkey has shown significant development during

business model in which we are delivering multiple 
engaging products across a variety of channels 
and Business Partners  
During 2016 we have seen 
significant growth in our Asia 
Pacific region which has helped 
to reduce the dependency the 
Group previously had on the

and product development in 
our local markets to help build 
stronger, sustainable operations

Operational review
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 20 Mexico continues to develop, growing revenue in 
the year as well as building the right structure and 
experience within the business to capitalise on the 
further market opportunities that exist  
The core European markets delivered solid renewal 
performance, operational efficiencies and Business 
Partner engagement throughout 2016  Germany 
also became the second country in the Group to 
launch OwlDetect in December  Other markets 
across the region are expected to follow in 2017 
We are actively building strength and depth within 
an appropriate operating structure for the region  
The appointment of a new Country Manager in Spain, 
along with a number of marketing and sales roles 
across the region will provide the necessary skill 
sets for an effective launch of Group-led propositions

The underlying operating profit has improved

Review
The main trading operations in our Asia Pacific 
region are in India, China, Malaysia and Hong Kong  
These markets account for 23% of the Group’s full 
year revenue, which is a significant increase on 
the prior year and reflects the growth experienced 
in this region  This growth has been led by India 
which has had its most successful year, growing 
revenues by 120% on a constant currency basis 
and increasing profitability  This growth has been 
generated by strong customer volumes and 
introducing new products to market  In late 2016, 
we signed a new contract with a leading non-banking 
financial company for sales of our Asset Care 
and FoneSafe products which demonstrates the 
strength of the relationship and will provide future 
growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond  We are 
investing in operational infrastructure in India to 
provide robust support for the continued growth 
of the business 
The progress made in 
some of our developing 
markets within Asia Pacific 
and Europe and Latin America 
has been excellent  2016 
marked a new beginning 
for CPP as a thriving 
global business 
China has continued to progress, growing revenue 
and improving operating performance during 2016  
This growth is underpinned by new Business 
Partner wins and channel development activity  
It is our intention to build infrastructure and 
capability in China which will set the foundation 
for accelerated growth 
The Malaysian renewal performance continues 
in line with expectations, although having signed 
a new Business Partner contract in early 2016 
we have been disappointed by new revenue 
performance  Renewal performance in Hong Kong 
has continued to perform in line with expectations 
21 Strategic report The Group’s financial 
performance has exceeded 
expectations during the year; 
underlying operating profit 
has improved and work 
continues on initiatives designed 
to place the business in a better 
position for sustainable growth 
in the future  This has been 
underpinned by a number of key 
strategic decisions and further 
measures taken to improve the 
profitable performance of our 
underlying business

Overview
Importantly, the shape of the business is changing, 
with less reliance on our traditional core markets 
in the UK and Europe  There has been excellent 
traction in a number of our key strategic growth 
markets  The Asia Pacific region has seen revenue 
growth levels of 107% and now represents 23% 
(2015: 11%) of Group revenue  This growth in 
Asia Pacific has principally been generated in India 
through strong partnerships and sales from new 
products introduced to the market  There is great 
potential for further growth in the region, with 
continued development in India expected and 
exciting opportunities in China  We are also 
encouraged by the development of some of our 
other markets during the year, such as Turkey, 
which is attracting significant levels of new 
customers and growing revenue  
Financial review
Michael Corcoran
Chief Financial Officer
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 22 In September 2016, the Group decided to cease 
the development of an IT platform with SSP in 
favour of developing an in-house global IT platform 
which will better suit current and future requirements 
and will ultimately be a more cost-effective solution  
This decision has led to an exceptional charge to 
the income statement of £9 1 million, following a 
£6 4 million impairment to the asset in development, 
a £2 5 million cash payment to conclude the SSP 
contract and other minor payments to satisfy 
contractual commitments 
In 2015, the UK business decided that it was no 
longer appropriate to make commission payments 
on renewing policies where the Business Partners 
have no ongoing involvement in the renewal 
process and do not provide any service to the 
customer  During the year these commission 
savings provided price reductions to our 
customers and are being invested in product 
content enhancements  Our commission 
approach has been agreed with a number of 
the affected Business Partners, although the 
position with some of our Business Partners 
is not yet finalised 
Cost management remains integral to the 
Group’s strategy, the benefit of which will enable 
focused investment in the correct areas to drive 
growth  During 2016 the Group’s administrative 
costs, excluding exceptional items and MSP 
charges, were £37 5 million (2015: £37 6 million)  
Administrative costs are broadly in line with the 
prior year which reflects continued cost management 
and savings in core areas of the business, offset 
by foreign exchange movements which have 
effectively increased costs in most of our non-UK 
markets, and the cost of developing and marketing 
new products and positioning to take advantage 
of opportunities in other markets 
Looking ahead, the Group is well placed financially 
for 2017 and beyond; however, profit margins are 
expected to settle at a lower average level due to 
continued back book decline in established markets, 
costs associated with developing and launching 
new global products, and growth in developing 
markets that typically have lower profit margins  
Focus on effective cost management will continue 
to be a priority for the business 
Summary
Group revenue from continuing operations has 
declined by 4% to £73 6 million (2015: £76 8 million)  
This level of decline is much lower compared to 
previous years and mainly reflects the natural 
decline in the UK renewal book whilst new regulated 
sales remain restricted  The impact of this has been 
partly mitigated by significant growth in India and 
the effect a weaker sterling has had on reported 
revenues in our European operations  On a regional 
basis revenue has reduced by 33% in the UK and 
Ireland  Revenue in Asia Pacific has grown by 107% 
(88% on a constant currency basis) and 9% (2% 
decline on a constant currency basis) in Europe 
and Latin America 
The underlying operating profit in the year from 
continuing operations is £8 4 million, which 
is a £1 5 million improvement on 2015  This 
improvement reflects the profit impact of the 
revenue growth in a number of our international 
markets, most notably India and Turkey  The 
impact of declining revenue in the UK is mostly 
mitigated by actions taken to reduce the related 
cost base  
Exceptional items in the year total £9 2 million 
(2015: £17 8 million credit) comprising IT 
impairment and settlement costs, associated 
with the SSP-led IT platform of £9 1 million; 
restructuring costs of £1 2 million; professional 
costs associated with the shareholder requisition 
in May 2016 of £0 5 million; a credit of £1 5 million 
relating to impairment reversal on the freehold 
land and property and a smaller credit of 
£0 1 million relating to customer redress 
Share-based payment charges relating to the MSP 
were £1 0 million (2015: £1 7 million)  Due to the 
one-off nature of this plan, MSP costs are presented 
separately from underlying operating results 
The exceptional items and MSP charges contribute 
to a reported operating loss of £1 8 million 
(2015: £23 0 million profit)  The profit reported in 
the prior year benefited from an exceptional gain 
of £19 4 million following the settlement in full of the 
Commission Deferral Agreement of £20 9 million 
for a compromise payment of £1 3 million  There 
were £0 2 million costs in 2015 associated with 
the transaction 
Net interest and finance costs of £0 1 million 
(2015: £1 1 million) are significantly lower than 
2015  The prior year charge included the write off 
of unamortised issue costs on the previous debt 
facility, which was refinanced midway through a 
three year term  Since the refinancing in February 
2015 borrowing levels have remained broadly similar 
23 Strategic report Financial review continued
Summary continued
As a result, the reported loss before tax 
from continuing operations was £1 9 million 
(2015: £21 9 million profit) and the reported loss 
after tax from continuing operations was £0 5 million 
(2015: £18 5 million profit) 
Profit from discontinued operations of £0 6 million 
(2015: £2 3 million) reflects the final benefits from the 
closure of the Airport Angel business in 2015  
Basic loss per share from continuing operations is 
0 06 pence compared to earnings of 2 42 pence in 2015 
There has been a substantial weakening in 
sterling during the year against our main trading 
currencies, the euro and Indian rupee  The impact on 
the Group has been to improve reported revenue and 
profits from our international operations  Revenue in 
the year declined at 10% on a constant currency basis, 
but 4% at actual exchange rates  Underlying operating 
profit increased at 10% on a constant currency basis 
compared to 22% at actual exchange rates 
Tax
In 2016 there was a tax credit on continuing operations 
of £1 3 million (2015: £3 4 million charge)  A one-time 
net credit of £1 2 million arises from the release in full 
of the equalisation reserve following adoption of 
Solvency II reporting for our insurance entity, Homecare 
Insurance Limited (HIL)  A corresponding tax charge 
of £1 2 million on the equalisation reserve release has 
been recognised in reserves  A deferred tax asset has 
been recognised on Indian prior year losses, increasing 
the credit to the income statement, which is largely offset 
by charges on the profits made in Spain, Turkey and 
Italy  Due to the various movements noted, the effective 
tax rate for the year is not considered to be a 
representative measure  
Cash flow and net funds
Cash used in operations amounted to £6 0 million 
(2015: £0 2 million) and results primarily from settlement 
of the regulatory fine and the one-time payment to 
conclude the SSP contract  This impact has been 
mitigated in part by positive operating cash flows  
The Group’s net funds position has reduced in the year 
to £26 9 million (2015: £37 6 million)  The net funds 
figure includes cash balances of £18 7 million held in 
the UK’s regulated entities, Card Protection Plan Limited 
(CPPL) and HIL  These cash balances cannot currently 
be distributed to the wider Group without the regulator’s 
approval, as they are either held for regulatory capital 
purposes or are restricted by the terms of the VVOP  
This restricted cash is, however, available to use in the 
regulated entity in which it exists 
Dividend
The Directors have decided not to recommend the 
payment of a dividend  Furthermore, the Board continues 
to believe it is not appropriate to pay a dividend until 
cash generated by operations is more than adequate 
to cover the Group’s future investment plans 
Balance sheet and financing
At 31 December 2016 the Group had net assets 
of £10 1 million which is a marginal increase of 
£0 1 million from the 2015 net asset position of 
£10 0 million  This increase in net assets is recognised 
after the impact of ceasing development of the SSP-led 
IT platform, and results from the Group’s improved 
trading performance  The balance sheet is in a stronger 
position than the prior year  The Group has not drawn 
against its borrowing facility at the year end and has 
substantially completed its remaining redress obligations, 
including clearance of the regulatory fine 
The Group’s borrowing arrangements comprise 
a committed £5 0 million revolving credit facility 
(RCF), which is available until February 2018, and a 
commission deferral balance of £1 4 million broadly 
half of which has been repaid subsequent to the year 
end  The RCF was not drawn at the year end  
Events after the balance sheet date
As announced on 17 March 2017, the Group has 
completed the acquisition of Blink for an initial 
consideration of €1 million, which was paid on 
completion  The acquisition allows for a further 
earn-out based on future products developed by 
Blink  The maximum earn-out is based on up to 20% 
of defined profits generated by Blink up to a maximum

25 Strategic report Risk management  
and principal risks
The Group has a risk framework that enables risks 
to be identified, assessed, controlled and monitored 
consistently and objectively  We continue to progress the 
implementation of the framework throughout the Group 
and revise our risk framework as necessary to maintain its 
effectiveness  The key elements of our framework include 
leadership and culture; risk appetite; risk identification and 
assessment; management and control of risk exposures; 
business incident management process; and a robust 
policy framework 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve the Group’s objectives and provides 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss  In assessing what constitutes 
reasonable assurance, the Board considers the 
materiality of financial and non-financial risks and 
the relationship between the cost of, and benefit 
from, the system of internal control  
Solvency and capital assessments 
CPPL is authorised and regulated by the FCA, 
and HIL is authorised by the PRA and regulated 
by the FCA and the PRA  Each undertakes a 
solvency/capital adequacy assessment on a 
regular basis  Outputs from these assessments 
are subject to review and approval by the individual 
Boards of these companies and are reviewed 
by the FCA and PRA from time to time  
HIL is subject to the European Commission’s 
Solvency II Directive which came into operation 
from 1 January 2016  The Directive is aimed at 
producing a more consistent solvency standard 
for insurers across Europe, ensuring that capital 
requirements are more reflective of the risks 
being accepted  The Group has complied with 
the requirements of Solvency II during the year  
The Group operates in regulated markets worldwide  
No similar reporting requirements to the local 
regulator exist in the Group’s other markets 
CPP operates a ‘three lines of defence’ model 
across the Group  The business is responsible for 
the identification and management of risks, with 
oversight and challenge from the Group control 
functions, and review independently provided 
by Internal Audit  
The focus of our risk management framework is 
to ensure we manage our business in a sustainable 
and controlled way, making risk-based decisions 
commensurate with our appetite and resources 
Internal control and oversight 
The Group Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for monitoring 
its effectiveness  The Audit Committee and Risk 
& Compliance Committee operated throughout 
the year, each overseeing the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management framework  
Material risk or control matters, together with the 
appropriate management action, are reported to 
the Board via the Risk & Compliance Committee 
and/or the Audit Committee  The Board monitors 
the ongoing process by which critical risks to the 
business are identified, evaluated and managed  
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 26 Principal risks and uncertainties
Key risk Description Mitigation Status
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or 
any of its subsidiaries cannot meet their 
contractual or payment obligations in a 
timely manner  Should the business not 
successfully generate revenue through 
legacy products and the development 
of compelling new products, then in the 
medium term the Group’s liquidity position 
may be adversely impacted  
The overall liquidity profile is actively 
managed, ensuring that the business 
plans and strategy are effective and aligned  
A number of dynamic programmes are in 
place to develop and deploy new products 
and offerings, and to refresh existing 
legacy products 
 Reputational risk Reputational risk impacts the CPP brand, 
reliability and relationships with customers 
and shareholders  This may arise from 
poor conduct or judgements, regulatory 
non-compliance, or from negative 
financial or operational events as a result 
of weaknesses in systems and controls  
Reputational risk may also arise from 
the selection of Business Partners and 
product offerings which may have 
adverse implications for the Group 
High standards of conduct and a principled 
approach to regulatory compliance are 
integral to our culture and values  We 
consider key reputational risks when 
initiating changes in strategy, products or 
our operating model  In addition, we have 
frameworks to address other risks that could 
affect our reputation including conduct risk 
and product development 
 Shar eholder risk There is a risk that the Group could 
be destabilised by events that would 
significantly impact the delivery and time/
cost of the overall strategy  The Group 
has specific vulnerabilities, for example, 
as a result of a highly concentrated 
shareholder base 
The Board actively engages on a regular 
basis with our largest shareholders to 
mitigate this risk, discussing business 
rationale/strategy and seeking support 
of the Board and its business plans 
People and 
resources risk
In recent years the Group has lost 
(either through redundancy or attrition) 
a significant number of people from the 
business  This not only represents a risk 
in terms of knowledge and experience lost, 
but has increased the demands on our 
remaining colleagues  There is a risk that any 
significant unplanned attrition of key 
individuals could adversely impact the 
business and its transformation 
The Group has identified key skills 
and role dependencies and takes steps 
to recruit and retain these within the 
business  The Group continues to be 
successful in recruiting and attracting 
fresh talent and new skill sets to ensure 
we continue to be able to deliver our plans  
The Group has introduced incentivisation 
schemes for certain key roles  
Technology 
and information 
security risk
The Group had embarked on a significant 
and wide ranging transformation programme 
that included replacement of the core IT 
platform  A change of strategy saw the 
Group exit its relationship with the external 
partner (SSP) and embark on an in-house 
development programme  The full scope of 
this programme is being developed and 
other strategic initiatives are being 
progressed  This programme of work is an 
enabler for our future sustainability and 
growth  There are risks that the nature and 
complexity of the programme impacts the 
business adversely through operational 
issues, cost over-runs or a failure to deliver to 
quality and on time  The Group is also rolling 
out a revised information security agenda to 
strengthen the overall framework 
The Group has a robust governance 
and delivery framework which is 
applied throughout its transformation  
We regularly assess and review progress 
and deliverables to ensure these are being 
effectively managed and controlled

Key risk Description Mitigation Status
International 
business risk
Our business is broadly diversified by region 
and operates in multiple regulated markets 
worldwide  The proportion of our business 
from international markets is increasing  
Whilst this mitigates our aggregate risk 
profile it introduces additional risks in terms 
of operating cross-border and in multiple 
environments as a result of complexity, local 
laws, regulations, business customs and 
practices  The risk may be exacerbated as 
we operate a central IT platform, business 
model and product propositions derived 
from the UK offerings 
The Board has sought to mitigate this risk 
through further enhancement of its risk, 
compliance and governance approach  
Our international operations are regularly 
reviewed by Internal Audit  We aim to employ 
people with local expertise who ensure the 
business and operations conform to local 
requirements as well as Group standards  
In addition, we seek the advice of local 
advisers where appropriate 
Conduct and 
regulatory risk
The risk of customer detriment arising from 
inappropriate conduct, practice or behaviour 
and failing to meet customer needs, interests 
or expected outcomes  
The risk of fines, penalties, censure or other 
sanctions arising from failure to identify or 
meet regulatory requirements 
The risk that new regulation or changes to 
existing interpretation has a material effect 
on the Group’s operations or cost base 
We promote a strong compliance culture, 
strive to put the interests of the customer 
first and value good relationships with our 
regulators  Our compliance function supports 
management in identifying and meeting our 
regulatory obligations with relevant training 
and procedures  Compliance with relevant 
regulatory requirements is monitored in 
accordance with a risk-based programme  
Our approach to encouraging appropriate 
conduct is set out in our conduct risk framework, 
and is built on culture and values, supported 
by appropriate governance and reporting  
This includes a culture in which colleagues 
are encouraged to focus on good customer 
outcomes; a focus on products that meet 
customer needs; robust controls, governance, 
training and risk management processes  
Regulatory and legal change is monitored 
by the compliance, legal and risk teams 
Third party 
Business 
Partner risk
We have a number of key supplier 
relationships as part of our business model, 
particularly in respect of insurance 
underwriting, product distribution and 
information technology  Third party Business 
Partner risk relates to the risk that partners 
may seek to end or change existing 
relationships or may not be able to meet 
their agreed service level terms  There 
is a significant risk that without ongoing 
engagement with Business Partners our 
primary route to market could be constrained 
The Group continues to engage with 
Business Partners to ensure the smooth 
continuation of services while at the same 
time developing and monitoring plans for 
alternative arrangements and new 
distribution opportunities 
Emerging risks Emerging risks are those with uncertain 
impact, probability and time frame that could 
impact the Group  These are the hardest to 
define  We analyse each risk and, if needed, 
develop and apply mitigation and 
management plans 
The external emerging risks that are currently 
our focus of attention include how we deal 
with the UK’s exit from the European Union 
and the increase in cyber-crime

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 30 Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present our corporate governance 
report for the financial year ended 
31 December 2016.
As an AIM-listed company , the 
Group is not obliged to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 201 4 
(the Code), although the Board fully 
supports the principles of the Code and 
seeks to comply , insofar as it is practical 
to do so given the size and nature of 
the Company. 
This report sets out the extent to 
which the Company complied with the 
provisions of the Code up to the date 
of this report and highlights where 
it did not.
Sir Richard Lapthorne
Chairman
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014
The Code defines a smaller company as one 
that is below the FTSE 350 throughout the year 
immediately prior to the reporting year. Insofar as 
is required of a smaller company as so defined, the 
Directors consider that the Company has been in 
full compliance with the provisions set out in the 
Code throughout the year and up to the date of 
this report, except as described below:
• The circumstances surrounding the 
appointments of most of the current Board 
members meant that the use of either an 
external search consultant or open advertising 
was not appropriate.
• During most of the year under review the 
Board Chairman was also Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. This is an interim measure 
and the situation is expected to be resolved 
during the forthcoming year as the Board 
intends to recruit a further Independent 
Non-Executive Director to take over the 
role of Audit Committee Chairman.
• In view of recent changes to almost the entire 
Board, a formal Board effectiveness review was 
again not considered appropriate. The Board 
expects in 2017 to carry out a self-assessment 
exercise which will lead to a programme that 
will include internal and external assessments. 
• Given the Company’s size, the Board has 
not considered the appointment of a Senior 
Independent Director appropriate. This will be 
kept under review as the Company’s strategy 
and structure develops. 
• For the duration of the extension to 
Nick Cooper’s Non-Executive role referred 
to in the Chairman’s statement, the Board 
has determined that Nick cannot be considered 
independent and the composition of the Board 
and its Committees will not therefore comply 
with the Code. This situation will be resolved 
during 2017, when the temporary extension 
comes to an end. 
• Although, as an AIM-listed company, specific 
shareholder approval to new long-term incentive 
schemes is not required, major shareholders 
were consulted prior to the implementation 
of the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Board is committed to 
maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance.

How the Board operates
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it, which is available on the 
Company’s website www.cppgroupplc.com.
Key matters that the Board is specifically 
responsible for include:
• approval of the Group’s long term ambitions, 
objectives and commercial strategy;
• material changes to the Group’s corporate 
structure, including any acquisitions 
or disposals;
• ensuring maintenance of a sound system 
of internal control and risk management;
• approval of annual and half-year results 
and trading updates;
• approval of the dividend policy; and
• material capital investments.
Other powers are delegated to the various 
Board Committees and to senior management. 
Details of the roles and responsibilities of the 
Board Committees are set out on pages 35 to 40 
and copies of all terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website. 
Papers for Board and Committee meetings are 
circulated in advance of the relevant meeting. 
Any Director who is unable to attend receives a 
full copy of the papers and has the opportunity 
to comment on the matters to be discussed.
Each member of the Board has access to all 
information relating to the Group and to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary 
(who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed). All Board members 
also have access to external advice at the expense 
of the Group, should they need it. 
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 32 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer are separate, clearly defined in writing and 
have been agreed by the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all 
aspects of its role and setting its agenda. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for 
the day-to-day running of the business and is 
accountable to the Board for its operational 
and financial performance. 
Board balance, independence 
and appointments
The Board’s primary role is to provide leadership 
to the Group, to set the Group’s long term strategic 
objectives and to develop robust corporate 
governance and risk management practices.
The Board aims to ensure that the balance 
between Non-Executive Directors and Executive 
Directors reflects the changing needs of the 
business and allows the Board to exercise 
objectivity in decision making and proper control 
of the Company’s business.
On his appointment as Chairman, Sir Richard 
Lapthorne satisfied the independence criteria 
as set out in the Code, although, following his 
appointment, he is assumed, in accordance 
with the Code, not to be independent.
The Board has reviewed the independence 
of each of the other Non-Executive Directors 
and concluded that Mark Hamlin is independent. 
Nick Cooper was independent during the 
period under review, but is not considered 
to be independent at the date of this report.
The Chairman holds regular informal meetings 
with Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present.
On joining the Board, Non-Executive Directors 
receive a formal appointment letter, which identifies 
the estimated time commitment expected of them. 
A potential Director candidate is required to disclose 
all significant outside commitments prior to 
appointment and the Board requires disclosure and 
approval by the Board of all additional appointments 
for Executive or Non-Executive Directors. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors and service contracts 
of Executive Directors are available to shareholders 
for inspection at the Group’s registered office 
during normal business hours.
Information and professional development
The Board receives at its meetings detailed reports 
from senior management on the performance 
of the Group and other information as necessary. 
Regular updates are provided on relevant legal, 
corporate governance and financial reporting 
developments and Directors are encouraged to 
attend external seminars on areas of relevance 
to their role.
Appropriate training and induction is made 
available to any newly-appointed Director, having 
regard to any previous experience they may have 
as a Director of a public company or otherwise. In 
addition to any guidance that may be given from 
time to time by the Company Secretary, Directors 
are encouraged to devote an element of their time 
to self development through available training.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. The removal 
and appointment of the Company Secretary is a 
matter reserved for Board approval. The Board also 
obtains advice from professional advisers as and 
when required.
Performance evaluation
In view of the number of changes and issues 
faced by the Board during recent years, the 
Board has not considered formal evaluation 
to be appropriate. The Board expects in 2017 
to carry out a self-assessment exercise which 
will lead to a programme that will include 
internal and external assessments.
Re-election
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation 
in accordance with the Articles of Association. 
Biographies for all Directors can be found on

Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining good relationships 
with shareholders and the Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
that appropriate channels of communication are established 
between the Executive Directors and shareholders, ensuring 
that the views of shareholders are made known to the Board. 
Members of the Board maintain regular dialogue with the 
Company’s largest shareholders.
All shareholders have the opportunity to convey their views 
and make enquiries by email or telephone.
The Group maintains a corporate website (www.cppgroupplc.com) 
which complies with AIM Rule 26 and contains a range of 
information of interest to institutional and private investors, 
including the Group’s annual and half-year reports, trading 
statements and all regulatory announcements relating to 
the Group.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides the Board 
with an opportunity to meet and communicate directly with 
private investors. Details of the AGM and the resolutions to

by way of a poll.
Internal control and compliance
The Audit Committee and the Risk & Compliance Committee 
receive regular reports on compliance with Group policies 
and procedures. On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
and the Risk & Compliance Committee confirm that, through 
discharging their responsibilities under their terms of reference 
as described on pages 35 and 36, they have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
are able to confirm that necessary actions have been or are 
being taken to remedy any failings or weaknesses identified.
Full details of the Group’s system of internal control and its 
relationship to the corporate governance structure are contained 
in the risk management and principal risks section of this report 
on pages 26 to 28.
Conflicts of interest
A register of conflicts of interest is maintained by the Company 
Secretary. Directors are required to declare any specific conflicts 
that arise from each Board agenda and a Director would be 
expected to refrain from voting on any matter that represented 
an actual or potential conflict of interest.
Viability statement
In accordance with provisions C.2.2 of the 2014 Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects 
of the Company over a three-year period. The Directors 
consider this to be an appropriate period of review for the 
following reasons: 
• it reflects the typical cycle of the Group’s borrowing 
arrangements; and
• it reflects the performance period in respect of the 
Group’s long term incentive plans.
The Group has a formalised process of budgeting, reporting 
and review along with procedures to forecast its profitability 
and cash flows. The plans provide information to the Directors 
which are used to ensure the adequacy of resources available 
for the Group to meet its business objectives, both in the short 
term and in relation to its strategic priorities. The Group’s 
revenue, profit and cash flow forecasts were subject to robust 
downside stress testing over the assessment period, which 
involved modelling the impact of a combination of plausible 
adverse scenarios. This was focused on the impact of the 
Group’s key operational risks crystallising.
In addition the Group’s operations have a diverse 
geographical spread and strong renewal rates in established 
markets resulting in stable and recurring cash flows.
In making the assessment the Directors acknowledge that 
whilst the Group is operating from a stable financial platform 
the strategy and longer term viability of the Group are based 
on the successful launch of new products globally and some 
uncertainty in the medium to long term remains as this 
work is ongoing. 
Based on the results of the analysis performed, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over a period of at least three years.

35 Corporate governance Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am 
pleased to present my first report 
since being appointed as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee in May 2016. 
The Audit Committee has clearly 
defined terms of reference which set 
out its objectives and responsibilities. 
These will be kept under review to 
ensure that the Committee remains 
effective in fulfilling its duty to provide 
assurance to the Board as to the 
integrity of the financial statements 
and the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. 
Key objectives
The Committee’s main remit is to assist the Board in 
discharging its duties and responsibilities for financial 
reporting and internal financial control including: 
• monitoring the integrity of the financial reporting systems; 
• examining management’s processes for ensuring 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal 
financial controls;
• overseeing the work of the Internal Audit function; and 
• providing an interface between management and the 
external Auditor.
Meetings and membership
As at the date of this report, the Committee comprises 
Sir Richard Lapthorne (Chairman), Nick Cooper and 
Mark Hamlin. Others may attend by invitation of the 
Committee Chairman. During the year the external Auditor, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Head of Internal Audit attended most meetings to report 
to the Committee and provide clarification and explanations 
where appropriate. The Chairman of the Audit Committee also 
meets on a regular basis with the Head of Internal Audit and 
the external Auditor without executive management present. 
The Board considers that Sir Richard Lapthorne has recent 
and relevant financial experience and that all Committee 
members have appropriate experience in similar roles.
Main activities during the year
The Committee fully recognises its role of protecting the 
interests of shareholders and other stakeholders with regard 
to the integrity of published financial information and the 
effectiveness of the audit. The main activities of the Committee 
during the year were:
Financial statements
The Committee reviewed and discussed financial disclosures 
made in the annual results announcement, the Annual Report 
& Accounts and the half-yearly financial report, together with 
any related management letters, letters of representation and 
reports from the external Auditor. Key financial reporting and 
accounting issues are shown in the table on page 37.
External Auditor
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the relationship 
with the external Auditor and approves the external Auditor’s 
engagement letter, audit fee and audit and client services plan 
(including the planned levels of materiality). The external 
Auditor attends meetings as appropriate and meets at least 
annually with the Committee without executive management 
present. The Chairman of the Committee also meets privately 
with the external Auditor from time to time.
During the year, the Committee received regular detailed 
reports from the external Auditor, including a formal 
written report dealing with the audit objectives, the Auditor’s 
qualifications, expertise and resources, the effectiveness of 
the audit process, the procedures and policies for maintaining 
independence and compliance with the ethical standards 
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. The Committee is 
satisfied with the performance of the external Auditor during 
the year and the policies and procedures in place to maintain 
its objectivity and independence. Having considered the quality, 
objectivity and independence of the audit teams and the 
quality of their work completed across the Group, the Audit 
Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP be reappointed 
at the forthcoming AGM.

Nick Cooper Mark Hamlin
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 36 Auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness
Fees paid to the external Auditor are shown in note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The external Auditor may 
provide non-audit services from time to time. The Committee 
keeps under review the level of non-audit fees as a proportion 
of the total fees paid to Deloitte LLP and is satisfied that any 
non-audit work that has been carried out during the year 
is that which would normally fall to the Company’s Auditor.
The following controls are in place to ensure that Auditor 
objectivity and independence are safeguarded:
• a policy on the use of the Auditor for non-audit work has 
been agreed by the Committee. This ensures that work 
would usually only be awarded when, by virtue of the 
Auditor’s knowledge, skills or experience, the Auditor 
is clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers. 
This policy is appended to the Committee terms of 
reference which is available on the Group’s website;
• the Committee receives and reviews each year an analysis 
of all non-audit work awarded to the Auditor over the 
financial period; and
• the Committee receives each year a report from the 
external Auditor outlining any matters that the Auditor 
considers bear on its independence and which need to be 
disclosed to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee has a formal process to assess the 
effectiveness of the external Auditor, which is carried out 
on an ‘ad hoc’ basis following the completion of the audit. 
It takes the form of a detailed questionnaire completed 
by members of the Committee and senior members of 
the finance team who regularly interact with the external 
Auditor. The results of the questionnaire are reported 
to and discussed by the Committee.
Internal audit
The Committee approves the annual internal audit plan 
and methodology, monitors progress against the plan and 
receives reports after each audit. Progress against actions 
identified in these reports is monitored by the Committee 
at regular intervals.
The Committee has assessed the resources the Internal Audit 
department has to complete its remit and has approved the 
use of external consultants to supplement it if necessary, 
particularly in areas requiring specialist skills. The appointment 
and removal of the Head of Internal Audit is the responsibility 
of the Committee. There was a change in the department 
during the year with a newly appointed Head of Internal Audit 
joining the business in November 2016. The Internal Audit 
department continues to have unrestricted access to all 
Group documentation, premises, functions and employees, 
as required. The Head of Internal Audit has direct access 
to the Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and is accountable to the Audit Committee, meeting with 
the Committee Chairman from time to time, without 
executive management present. 
Committee effectiveness
From time to time the Committee carries out a self-assessment 
exercise to help it assess its own effectiveness. This exercise, 
which was last carried out in 2013, comprises a questionnaire 
completed anonymously by various participants and analysed 
by the Head of Internal Audit prior to consideration by 
the Committee.
Advice to the Board
The Board sought the advice of the Committee as to whether 
the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The Committee adopted a 
formal process to enable it to satisfy itself that this was the 
case, before advising the Board.
Regular updates are provided to the Committee on 
developments in financial reporting and related legal 
and corporate governance matters.
The Committee has access to the services of the Internal 
Audit department and the Company Secretary and is 
authorised to obtain independent professional advice 
if it considers it necessary.
Key financial reporting and accounting issues
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2016 financial statements and how these were 
addressed by management are shown below:
Area of judgement Management action
Cessation of commission 
payments to certain UK 
Business Partners
The Committee has received detailed explanations from executive management during the 
year in relation to continued correspondence with affected Business Partners and potential 
exposures. The Committee has challenged the information and has determined that it is 
comfortable with the Group’s position on the matter.
Revenue recognition The Committee receives regular updates from executive management on the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies and has concluded that revenue recognition continues to be dealt with 
appropriately. This view is supported by the Auditor’s report.
Recognition and impairment 
of capitalised costs
The Committee receive reports from executive management detailing the Group’s non-current 
assets position and the support for carrying values. The Committee has challenged the papers, 
assessing the adequacy of approach in relation to IAS 38 and IAS 36 and is comfortable that 
balances are accurately reflected.
Going concern The Committee has received detailed reports on the going concern status of the Company 
during the year. The Committee has reviewed and had the opportunity to challenge the reports 
including the underlying forecast assumptions. The Committee recognises that the Group still 
faces some risk in relation to medium term trading and strategy. The Committee believes that 
the Company remains a going concern and that it is appropriate that these financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

not exercised. The options have an exercise period of ten years from date of grant.

39 Corporate governance Current share plans
Matching Share Plan
Under the MSP, which was introduced in June 2015, the 
then Executive Directors and certain members of the senior 
management team were given the opportunity to purchase 
shares for consideration of 3 pence per share (the ‘Investment 
Shares’). The price of 3 pence per share reflected that paid 
by the external investors at the time of the share placing 
in February 2015. For each Investment Share purchased options 
over three ‘Matching Shares’ were awarded. These options, 
which have an exercise price of 1 penny, will vest over a 
three-year period – 25% vesting on the first anniversary of 
grant, 25% on the second anniversary and 50% on the third 
anniversary. The first tranche of awards made in June and 
November 2015 vested during the year. No performance 
conditions apply to these options, but participants must 
retain all of their Investment Shares for the full three-year 
period, otherwise any unexercised options will lapse. 
No further awards will be made under the MSP.
2016 Long Term Incentive Plan
This plan was introduced in January 2016, and options were 
awarded to the Executive Directors and certain members of 
the senior management team. The options will vest on the third 
anniversary of the date the award was granted, subject to the 
achievement of specified performance targets. 
Clawback and malus provisions apply to both the above plans.
Legacy share plans
2010 Long Term Incentive Plan
Awards made under this plan on 31 December 2013 had 
a normal vesting period of three years from date of grant, 
dependent upon two interdependent performance conditions 
– the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) ranked against 
the TSR of a comparator group and the absolute average share 
price over a three-year period from date of grant. The Committee 
has determined that these performance conditions were not 
achieved and the options therefore lapsed on 31 December 2016. 
2010 Restricted Stock Plan (RSP)
The RSP is a non-performance-based share plan aimed at 
incentivising the second tier of management across the 
Group and Executive Directors are not eligible to participate. 
Employment is the only performance condition attached to 
this plan. All awards made under the plan are fully vested.
UK Save as You Earn Scheme (SA YE)
The Company launched a SA YE (ShareSA VE Plan) in 
September 2010 and made an additional offer in September 
2011. All employees in the UK, including Executive Directors, 
were eligible to participate in the ShareSA VE Plan. Options 
were granted under this scheme in September 2010 at an 
option price of 198 pence and in September 2011 at an option 
price of 125 pence, in each case representing a discount of 
20% to the market value applicable at the time of grant. 
Consistent with HMRC rules, the scheme is not subject to any 
performance criteria other than employment. None of the 
current Directors hold investments under this scheme.
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company has two further legacy share plans introduced 
prior to the IPO in 2010 (the 2005 Plan and the 2008 Plan) 
wherein options were exercisable as follows: 50% on 
24 March 2010, 25% on 24 March 2011 and 25% on 
24 March 2012. There are no performance conditions 
attached to these shares other than relating to employment.
Shareholder dilution 
In line with the ABI guidelines, the rules of the above 
incentive schemes provide that commitments to issue new 
shares or reissue treasury shares, when aggregated with 
awards under all of the Company’s other schemes, must not 
exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any rolling 
ten-year period commencing on Admission of the Group’s 
shares to AIM.
Newly issued shares or shares held in the EBT are currently 
used to satisfy the exercise of all employee and Executive options.
Directors’ shareholdings (audited information)
The Directors who were in post at the end of the year under review held the following beneficial interests in the Company’s 
ordinary shares:
Ordinary shares held
at 31 December 2016
Ordinary shares held

Some agreements to which the Company or its subsidiaries 
are a party may be at risk of termination by counterparties 
in certain restricted circumstances in the event of a change 
of control of the Company. The Directors are not aware of 
any agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees that provide for compensation for loss of office 
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Under the terms of the 2016 LTIP, in the event of a sale 
of the Company before the end of the performance period, 
the whole award will be subject to the share price performance 
targets set out in that award, and the award will vest to the 
extent to which the offer price falls within the range of share 
price performance tar gets (‘Performance Condition Adjustment’). 
Michael Corcoran has received an undertaking that, if and to 
the extent that he receives an award under the LTIP for the 
three-year performance periods commencing 1 January 2017 
and 1 January 2018, such awards will include an equivalent 
Performance Condition Adjustment.

Directors’ report
41 Corporate governance Substantial shareholdings
On 31 December 2016, the Company had been notified, in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA, 
of the notifiable interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company set out in the table below. As far as the Directors are aware, 
as at 31 December 2016 no person had a beneficial interest in 3% or more of the voting share capital except for the following:
Name
Ordinary

Funds managed by Phoenix Asset Management Partners Limited 335,327 39.15%
Milton Magna Limited (a company controlled by Mr Hamish Ogston) 264,144 30.84%
Mr Hamish Ogston 96,332 11.25%
Schroder plc 85,759 10.01%
Mr Hamish Ogston holds a beneficial interest in 42.09% 
of the issued shares of the Company. Under the terms of 
a Relationship Agreement between Mr Ogston and the 
Company dated 22 December 2014 and effective from the 
Company’s admission to AIM, for so long as Mr Ogston and 
any person or corporate body connected to him (a ‘Controlling 
Shareholder’) holds, in aggregate, 30% or more of the 
ordinary shares or the voting rights attaching to the shares, 
Mr Ogston shall not and shall procure that each Controlling 
Shareholder shall not:
• vote in favour of, or propose any resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association which would be contrary to the 
principle of the independence of the Company from the 
shareholder or any of the Controlling Shareholders;
• take any action which precludes any member of the Group 
from carrying on its business independently of Mr Ogston 
or any Controlling Shareholder; or
• take any action (or omit to take any action) to prejudice 
the Company’s status as a Company admitted to AIM 
or its suitability for admission to AIM or the Company’s 
compliance with the AIM Rules, other than in the 
circumstances of a takeover or merger of the Company.
Employee Benefit Trust
The total number of ordinary 1 penny shares held by the EBT 
as at 31 December 2016 was 4,191,126 (2015: 1,763,000).
Going concern
In reaching their view on the preparation of the Group’s 
financial statements on a going concern basis, the Directors 
are required to consider whether the Group can continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has continued to trade profitably during 2016 
and residual redress activities are substantially complete. 
Whilst there continues to be some uncertainty from medium 
term trading and strategic risk, forecasts show that the Group 
has the necessary resources to trade and operate within the 
level of its borrowing facilities. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Employees
The Group is committed to employment policies that 
provide equality of opportunity to all employees based only on 
their relevant skills and capabilities and that ensure no employee 
or applicant is treated unfairly on any grounds, including 
ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
Every possible support will be offered to any employee who 
becomes disabled during the course of their employment, 
with reasonable adjustments made wherever possible.
The Group communicates with employees by means of regular 
business updates and weekly CEO blogs on the intranet. The CEO 
also holds informal ‘in-touch’ sessions with small groups of 
employees. In the UK an Employee Representative Body (ERB) 
comprising nominated representatives of each area of the 
business, meets monthly with key members of the leadership 
team to share ideas and feedback, to receive information about 
the business and, when required, to act as a joint consultative 
group. Outputs of ERB meetings are published on the intranet.
Auditor
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as Auditor. Accordingly, a resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP 
will be proposed at the AGM.

Directors’ report continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 42 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report & Accounts in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors are required to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts until 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the specific requirements in IFRS are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether the Financial Reporting Standard 
101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ has been 
followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the Company financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit/loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• Cessation of commission payments to certain Business Partners (BPs) in the UK
• Recognition and impairment of capitalised costs
• Revenue recognition
• Going concern
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £820,000 which was determined on the basis 
of 1.2% of revenue.
Scoping The Group audit scope involved performing full audits on the Group’s significant components in the 
UK and Ireland, India and Spain, with audit of specified account balances in the components of Italy 
and Turkey. In aggregate our testing covered more than 88% of the Group’s revenue, 95% of the 
Group’s profit/loss before tax and 93% of the Group’s net assets.
Significant changes  
in our approach
In the current year we included the cessation of commissions to certain UK BPs and recognition 
and impairment of capitalised costs as key risks as they involve significant judgement from 
Management as a result of the decision to cease the payment of commissions to certain BPs 
in the UK and to cease the IT development with an external partner in preference for an in-house 
development project respectively.
The prior year risk relating to regulatory provisions is not considered a key risk this year as the 
provision has been utilised through redress payments down to a level where no significant level 
of judgement is involved. 
Since the prior year we have increased the level of work performed on the component in India  
to a full scope audit as its revenue contribution to the Group has grown significantly in the year. 
We have reduced the level of work performed on the component in Italy from a full scope audit 
last year to an audit of specified account balances. 
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 44 Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the Group
We are required to state whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 26 that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 27 and 28 that describe those 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation on page 42 as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we 
are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of 
the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Cessation of commission payment to certain BPs in the UK
Risk description In 2015, the Group made the decision to cease the payment of commissions to certain BPs in the UK. 
The cessation of commission payments has been agreed with a number of the affected BPs, although 
the position with other BPs is not yet finalised.
We identified a key risk with regards to the judgements made by Management in relation to the timing 
of de-recognition of contractual liabilities, the quantification of costs relating to the settlement of 
contractual commission obligations with BPs and the disclosure of the matter under the requirements 
of accounting standard IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. 
Reference to this matter is included in the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty note on page 59, the provision note on page 76 and in the Report of the Audit Committee on 
page 36. The Group has presented a provision in respect of this matter within trade payables and accruals.
45 Financial statements Cessation of commission payment to certain BPs in the UK continued
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We understood Management’s process by undertaking a walk-through to identify the key controls 
relating to this matter. 
We assessed the design and implementation of the governance review control in respect of the key 
judgements made.
We assessed the reasonableness of Management’s judgement by reviewing the legal contracts with the 
BPs and the correspondence received since the cessation of commission payments was communicated.
We assessed the quantification of potential exposure by independently determining a range of reasonable 
possible outcomes and reviewed the application of the limited disclosures made in the Annual Report 
& Accounts for compliance with the requirements of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets for such legal matters.
Key observations We found the accounting and limited disclosure due to the risk of legal prejudice in relation to this matter 
to be in line with the requirements of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Recognition and impairment of capitalised costs 
Risk description During 2015 and 2016, development was ongoing to replace the current policy administration system 
with a customised ‘off the shelf ’ package to be delivered by a third party. In September 2016, the Group 
ceased the IT development with the third party in favour of an in-house solution resulting in an impairment 
charge and contract termination costs. 
Management has booked an impairment charge of £6.4m against the capitalised software costs, with the 
residual asset of £1.3m being regarded as a reusable alternative software platform to generate benefit to 
the Group. 
We identified a key risk with regards to the judgements taken by Management in relation to the value 
of costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation detailed in IAS 38 – Intangible Assets and have reusable 
value in the alternative software platform.
The Group’s associated accounting policies are detailed on page 57 with detail about judgements 
in applying accounting policies and critical accounting estimates on page 60 and in the Report of the 
Audit Committee on page 37. 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We understood Management’s process for assessing the re-usable element of capitalised costs by 
undertaking a walk-through to identify the key controls. 
We assessed the design and implementation of the governance review control in respect of key judgements. 
We reviewed the judgements made by Management for each work stream in respect of the costs capitalised 
against the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting standard IAS 38 – Intangible Assets by 
testing a sample of costs to underlying supporting evidence. 
We assessed if the alternative software platform was likely to be complete and the value of future benefits 
expected to be generated to the Group through review of internal meeting minutes and Group forecasts. 
We evaluated the value of costs that are capitalised in the balance sheet against the aggregate results 
of our assessment.
Key observations We consider the value of capitalised costs presented in intangible assets to be reasonable.
Independent Auditor’s report continued
To the members of CPPGroup Plc
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 46 Revenue recognition
Risk description There are significant judgements involved in applying the Group’s revenue recognition policies across 
multiple products, in particular:
• determining the revenue recognition policy for new products and where considered appropriate 
implementing the deferral of revenue where the Group has future servicing obligations to 
customers; and 
• determining revenue refund provisions for customers who cancel during the ‘cooling off ’ periods 
on buying or renewing the Group’s products, calculated on the basis of historical experience.
The renewals and cancellations of products are dependent on automated controls operating effectively. 
The Group’s associated accounting policies are detailed on page 56 and are discussed in the Report of the 
Audit Committee on page 36.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We understood Management’s process for recognising revenue by undertaking a walk-through 
to identify the key controls, and data flows. 
We assessed the design and implementation of key manual controls used to reconcile journal entries 
to underlying customer databases and cash received in the bank.
We tested the operating effectiveness of centrally managed Group-wide key automated controls in the 
core administration systems used to trigger renewal and refund transactions and to generate journal 
entries to the general ledger. 
We also assessed the design and implementation of the governance review of revenue recognition 
policies for new products launched. 
We independently re-calculated the Group’s material revenue streams from an independent 
extraction of source policyholder data and substantively tested a sample of revenue entries 
to underlying supporting evidence. 
We evaluated the appropriateness of revenue recognition policies applied by reference to the terms 
and conditions of the underlying products and tested the reconciliation of recorded revenue against 
cash collection. 
We challenged the judgements made by Management in calculating the cancellation provisions 
through analysis of post year end experience and assessment of whether there were indicators 
of additional provision required from our work on other areas of the audit.
Key observations We determined the accounting for revenue to be acceptable.
Going concern
Risk description As a result of the financial impact of the historical customer redress scheme, continuing restrictions 
on new regulated business sales in the UK, and the requirement to trade in line with expectations and 
maintain compliance with lending covenants, the going concern status of the Group has continued 
to be identified as a key risk.
There continues to be a medium term strategic risk as the Group is in the early stages of implementing 
a new strategy and launching global products. As a result, whilst this is embedded, the Group has some 
dependency on cash generated by its renewal book. The sustainability of the business beyond the going 
concern period will depend on the mitigation of the medium term strategic risk through the successful 
implementation of a viable strategy. 
Management present their considerations in relation to going concern in the Directors’ report on 
page 42 and accounting policies in note 3. Going concern is also discussed in the Report of the 
Audit Committee on page 36.
47 Financial statements Going concern continued
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We understood Management’s process for preparing the Group’s forecasts and going concern paper by 
undertaking a walk-through to identify the key controls and data flows. 
We assessed the design and implementation of the governance review control in respect of key judgements. 
We challenged the underlying forecast and budget assumptions including expected growth rates and 
key factors such as renewal rates with reference to historical information. 
We also evaluated historical forecasting accuracy, the sensitivity of the going concern status to key 
assumptions such as new product sales, anticipated cost savings and new business contributions, 
current and forecast compliance with the terms of the Group’s borrowing facilities and the impact 
of other uncertainties including the remaining residual redress risk.
We also reviewed initial correspondence with the Group’s finance provider to assess if there are any 
indications of uncertainties over the renewal of the Group’s finance facility that matures within the 
next twelve months.
We reviewed the disclosure regarding the Directors’ preparation of financial statements on a going 
concern basis in note 3 to the financial statements.
Key observations We consider the disclosure regarding the Directors’ preparation of financial statements on a going 
concern basis noted in the accounting policies in note 3 to be reasonable. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £820,000 (2015: £880,000).
Basis for determining 
materiality
Below 1.2% (2015: 1.2%) of revenue.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We used revenue to determine the materiality because profit/loss before tax has been unusually 
volatile and is not considered to be the key benchmark at the current time.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £16,400 
(2015: £17,600), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations (the United Kingdom 
and Ireland, India, Spain, Italy and Turkey). Three of these were subject to a full audit (2016: United Kingdom and Ireland, India 
and Spain; 2015: United Kingdom and Ireland, Spain and Italy), whilst the remaining two (2016: Turkey and Italy; 2015: Turkey 
and India) were subject to an audit of specified account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. 
These locations represent the principal business units and account for 93% (2015: 95%) of the Group’s net assets, 
88% (2015: 91%) of the Group’s revenue and 95% (2015: 98%) of the Group’s profit/loss before tax. 
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at the five locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £110,000 to £430,500 (2015: £153,000 to £528,000).
Independent Auditor’s report continued
To the members of CPPGroup Plc
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 48 An overview of the scope of our audit continued
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member 
of the Group audit team visits each of the locations where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every two years. 
We included a location visit to India in our planning of the audit; in 2015 we visited Italy. In years when we do not visit 
a significant component we will include the component audit partner and team in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment and review audit work performed, and findings identified, by component audit teams.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration have not been made. 
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
these matters.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between 
our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual 
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have 
been disclosed.
We confirm that we 
have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Other matters
Corporate governance statement 
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate 
governance statement detailing the extent of their compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We reviewed the part of the Corporate Governance report relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
these matters.
49 Financial statements Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 54 1. General information
CPPGroup Plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and domiciled in the 
United Kingdom. Its registered office is Holgate Park, York YO26 4GA. The Group comprises CPPGroup Plc and its subsidiaries. 
The Group’s principal activity during the year was the provision of assistance products.
The consolidated and Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in the Companies Act 2006, Section 408, not to present its own income 
statement. The Company reported a loss after tax for the year of £4,168,000 (2015: £4,545,000). There have been no dividends 
received from subsidiary undertakings in either the current or prior year.

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements on pages 51 to 86 present the performance of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared 
under the historical cost basis.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly , the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework as issued by the FRC incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016. 
The Company financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost basis.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to standards 
not yet effective, presentation of a cash flow statement, share-based payments and related party transactions.
Going concern
The Board of Directors has, at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus it 
continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further details 
of the Directors’ assessment are set out in the Directors’ report on page 42. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows, assets and liabilities of the Company and the entities 
under its control. Control is achieved when the Company has power over the investee; is exposed or has rights to variable 
return from its involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with Group policies. All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Notes to the financial statements
55 Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Exceptional items
Items which are exceptional, being material in terms of size and/or nature, are presented separately from underlying business 
performance in the consolidated income statement. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication 
of the Group’s underlying business performance.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Share-based payments
Prior to the Company’s shares being transferred to AIM, the Group issued share options to certain of its employees through 
the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP), the 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan (2010 LTIP), the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP), 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) and the ShareSA VE Plan. Costs in relation to these plans are presented within 
administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. 
Subsequent to the transfer to AIM the Group has issued options under the Matching Share Plan (MSP) and the 2016 Long Term 
Incentive Plan (2016 LTIP). Costs in relation to the MSP and 2016 LTIP are disclosed within administrative expenses; however, 
MSP costs are not included in underlying operating profit due to the one-off nature of the plan. 
Share options are treated as equity settled if the Group has the ability to determine whether to settle exercises in cash or by the 
issue of shares. Share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions each year. Non-market vesting conditions 
include a change in control of the Group and are considered by the Directors at each year end. The fair value of equity settled 
share-based payments is expensed in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, subject to adjustment for forfeited options.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.
Assistance products
Recognition of revenue
Revenue attributable to the Group’s assistance products is generally comprised of the prices paid by customers for the assistance 
products net of underwriting fees and exclusive of any sales taxes. 
Revenue is generally recorded by the Group under two categories: as intermediary in the policy sale and administration process 
and for ongoing services where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims management and policy 
administration services. Fees receivable in the Group’s role as intermediary are recognised on inception of the arrangement. 
Claims management and policy administration service fees are recognised over the period of the underlying contract. In these 
situations the amount deferred is sufficient to cover future claims handling and service costs and an appropriate profit margin. 
The assessment of future costs and expected number of incidences is validated by reference to experience of historical actual 
costs and volume. Provisions for cancellations are made at the time revenue is recorded and are deducted from revenue.
For certain other of the Group’s assistance products, there are no introduction fees. In these arrangements, revenue is comprised 
of the subscriptions received from members, net of underwriting fees and exclusive of any sales taxes. These subscriptions 
are recognised over the life of the service provided.
Wholesale revenue is generally comprised of fees billed directly to Business Partners, exclusive of any sales taxes, and is recognised 
as those fees are earned.
Non-policy revenue is comprised of fees billed directly to customers or Business Partners for services provided under separate 
non-policy based arrangements. Such revenue is recognised, exclusive of any sales taxes, as those fees are earned.
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales attributable to the Group’s assistance products represents the costs of acquiring customers and includes marketing 
costs and commissions paid to Business Partners. Commissions are recognised in line with the revenue to which they relate. 
Marketing costs include all telemarketing, direct mail and fulfilment costs. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Cost of sales attributable to the assistance elements of the Group’s wholesale products represents the costs of providing those 
services, including third party costs. This includes all mailing and fulfilment costs which are expensed as incurred. Third party 
costs relate to relationships with suppliers who provide elements of the service and are expensed as incurred.
Notes to the financial statements continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 56 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Insurance contracts
Insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk at the inception of the contract. Insurance risk 
is transferred when the Group agrees to compensate a policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (other than a change 
in a financial variable) adversely affects the policyholder. 
Recognition of revenue
Revenue attributable to the Group’s insurance contracts comprises premiums paid by customers and is exclusive of any sales taxes 
and similar duties. Premiums from insurance policies are recognised as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the policy.
Provisions for unearned premiums are made, representing the part of gross premiums written that is estimated to be earned 
in the following or subsequent financial periods, on a straight line basis for each policy. The provision for unearned premiums 
is recorded under insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales attributable to the Group’s insurance contracts consists of the costs, both direct and indirect, of acquiring insurance 
policies, commissions, reinsurance premiums payable to third parties and insurance claims incurred (net of reinsurance recoveries).
Acquisition costs are amortised over the life of the average policy. Acquisition costs which are expensed in the following or subsequent 
accounting periods are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred acquisition costs and include a proportionate allowance for 
commissions and post-sale set up costs incurred in respect of unearned premiums not amortised at the balance sheet date.
Reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related business.
Insurance claims provisions
Claims incurred comprise the Group’s claims payments and internal settlement expenses during the period together with 
the movement in the Group’s provision for outstanding claims over the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but 
not reported. Differences between the estimated cost and subsequent settlement of claims are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement in the year in which they are settled.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related claims.
Equalisation reserve
An equalisation reserve was established in accordance with the requirements of the Equalisation Reserve Rules contained 
within the Prudential Sourcebook for Insurers and the General Prudential Sourcebook. Solvency II replaced these rules with 
effect from 1 January 2016 and does not require an equalisation reserve to be held. Equalisation reserve movements are 
recognised directly through equity.
Discontinued operations
Operations are classified as discontinued when they are either disposed of, are part of a single co-ordinated disposal plan or are 
to be abandoned and represent a major line of business or geographical area of operation.
Intangible assets
Externally acquired software
Externally acquired software is measured at purchase cost and is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
of four to five years.
Internally generated software
Internally generated intangible assets arising from the Group’s software development programmes are recognised from the 
point at which the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and 
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of four to five years.
Contractual arrangements with third parties
The Group’s contractual arrangements can give rise to intangible assets. Where a contractual payment gives access to and 
control of future economic benefits, in the form of future renewal income streams, this amount is recognised as an asset and 
then amortised in line with the forecast benefits over the shorter of the contractual arrangement and the period when benefits 
are expected to arise.
57 Financial statements 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
Intangible assets arising on business combinations
Intangible assets arising from business combinations are initially stated at their fair values and amortised over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
Business Partner relationships: in line with the relevant projected revenues.
Business Partner relationships represent the present value of net revenues and costs expected to arise from contractual 
arrangements and non-contractual relationships with existing and pipeline Business Partners at the date of acquisition.
Amortisation of contractual arrangements with third parties is charged to cost of sales. Amortisation of all other intangible 
assets is charged to other administrative expenses.
Impairment
Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit may be increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown at purchase cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the costs, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Freehold property:  40 years straight line
Computer systems: 4 – 5 years straight line
Furniture and equipment: 4 years straight line
Leasehold improvements: Over the shorter of the life of the lease and the useful economic life of the asset
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits with a term from inception of three months or less, 
less bank overdrafts where there is a right to offset. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that 
there is no right to offset with cash balances in the same currency.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior 
years. Taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the tax is also included within equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all taxable and deductible temporary differences at the balance 
sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is 
realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiary undertakings 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority and the Group/Company intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Notes to the financial statements continued
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 58 3. Significant accounting policies continued
Pension costs
Pension costs represent contributions made by the Group to defined contribution pension schemes. These are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial information of the individual entities that comprise the Group, transactions in currencies other than the 
entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and are translated at the closing rate.
On disposal of foreign operations, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity 
for that foreign operation are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade receivables, loans, other receivables or cash and cash equivalents that have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for any estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. For material risks, the Group evaluates and considers 
the use of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements. 
When derivatives are used they are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of assumptions, estimates 
and judgements about future conditions. The use of available information and application of judgement are inherent in the 
formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from those reported. The key estimates and assumptions used 
in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Classification of exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence or have been 
separately disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. Consideration of what should 
be included as exceptional requires judgement to be applied. Exceptional items are considered to be ones which are material, 
non-recurring and outside of the normal operating practice of the Group.
Share-based payments
Judgement and estimation are required in determining the fair value of share options at the date of award. The fair value 
is estimated using valuation techniques which take account of the awards term, the share price volatility and risk-free rates. 
Judgement and estimation are also required to assess the number of options expected to vest. Details of the assumptions 
made are included in note 30.
Different assumptions would alter the share-based payment charge for the current and subsequent periods. Valuations 
for equity settled share-based payments are set at grant date and revised for changes in non-market conditions. 
Contractual matters
The Group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. The Group 
is satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Appropriate financial provisions are in place in respect 
of these matters and are included in trade and other payables. The Group has taken advantage of the reduced disclosures 
available within IAS 37 as it does not consider it appropriate to disclose the detail of contractual matters as it may prejudice 
any future discussions.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Contractual matters continued
The appropriate level of financial provision may vary and impact the consolidated income statement depending on the outcome 
of any future discussions with those parties affected.
Current tax
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement due to the complex 
tax regulations in the countries in which the Group operates, where filed tax positions may remain open to challenge by local tax 
authorities for several years. Corporation tax is therefore accrued on the Directors’ assessment of specific tax law and likelihood 
of settlement.
Any changes to estimates of uncertain tax positions would be reflected through the consolidated income statement.
Capitalised software costs 
The Group has capitalised internally generated intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. The recoverable amount of the 
assets has been determined using value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and judgements. Internally 
generated intangible assets are routinely reviewed for impairment.
5. Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that 
are regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Group is managed on the basis of three broad geographical regions:
• UK and Ireland;
• Europe and Latin America (Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Mexico and Portugal); and
• Asia Pacific (India, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore).
Segment revenues and performance have been as follows:

Major product streams are disclosed on the basis monitored by the Board of Directors. For the purpose of this product analysis, 
‘retail assistance policies’ are those which may be insurance backed but contain a bundle of assistance and other benefits; ‘retail 
insurance policies’ are those which protect against a single insurance risk; ‘wholesale policies’ are those which are provided by 
Business Partners to their customers in relation to an ongoing product or service which is provided for a specified period of time; 
and ‘non-policy revenue’ is that which is not in connection with providing an ongoing service to policyholders for a specified 
period of time.
Disclosures in notes 8, 19 and 23 regarding accounting for insurance contracts provide information relating to all contracts within 
the scope of IFRS 4 and therefore include both retail insurance policies and the insurance components of retail assistance and 
wholesale policies.

The following assumption has a significant impact on insurance revenues:
• Unearned premiums on prepaid insurance policies are recognised as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the policy. 
Changes to the expected life of classes of policies will therefore impact the period in which these items are recognised.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 20.00% (2015: 20.25%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The UK Finance (No 2) Act 2015 was enacted on 
18 November 2015. It provides for a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017. 
The UK Finance Act 2016 was enacted on 15 September 2016. It provides for a further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020. 
As these rates were substantively enacted prior to 31 December 2016, they have been reflected in the UK deferred tax 
balance at 31 December 2016.

Basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’. Underlying 
earnings per share have also been presented in order to give a better understanding of the performance of the business. 
In accordance with IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only considered dilutive when their conversion would decrease the 
earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders. The diluted loss per share is therefore equal 
to the basic loss per share in the current year.

abort the project with SSP; this element of the asset has subsequently been written off. The impairment loss has been recognised 
as an exceptional item through the consolidated income statement and relates to the UK and Ireland segment. The carrying 
value of intangible assets includes £1,331,000 relating to the ongoing in-house development of a core platform IT system. 
This asset is recognised across internally generated software and externally acquired software.

Included in freehold land and property is freehold land at its cost value of £759,000 (2015: £759,000), which is not depreciated.
During the current year the Group has recognised the reversal of prior year impairment in respect of the freehold land and 
property totalling £1,534,000. This reversal reflects a change in the basis of the recoverable amount from value in use to fair 
value less costs of disposal. The value of the property has been written back to £4,500,000 comprising £4,374,000 freehold land 
and property and £126,000 leasehold improvements. The impairment reversal has been recognised as an exceptional item 
through the consolidated income statement and relates to the UK and Ireland segment. The fair value basis is categorised within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Amounts due from policyholders and intermediaries and amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the total exposure 
to credit risk in respect of insurance activities.
Credit is not generally offered to retail customers on insurance premiums. Where credit is offered to wholesale insurance customers, 
the average credit period on insurance premiums is 45 days. No interest is charged on insurance receivables at any time.
Individually or collectively material insurance receivables are reviewed for recoverability when an adverse change in credit quality 
is identified or when they become overdue. Credit risk is reduced as insurance receivables are dispersed amongst a broad customer 
base and where concentration exists the Group’s main counterparties are typically large companies with established credit 
records. Credit risk is mitigated through maintaining and managing the customer base.
The Group’s insurance receivable balance does not include any debtors which are past due at the balance sheet date (2015: £nil). 
There have been no overdue but unprovided debts in either the current or prior year.

Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing.
The Group’s trade receivables relate to retail customer payments awaiting collection and wholesale counterparties. 
The Group is responsible for activating the collection process for our retail customers. The collection is received within 
a specified period of processing the transaction resulting in credit risk being considered low for these items. 
Where wholesale counterparty balances are individually or collectively material, they are reviewed for recoverability when an 
adverse change in credit quality is identified or when they become overdue. The Group has low historical levels of customer and 
counterparty credit defaults, due in part to the quality of the relationship it has with its counterparties and their credit ratings. 
Where credit is offered to customers, the average credit period offered is 21 days (2015: 31 days). No interest is charged on trade 
receivables at any time. Disclosures regarding credit risk relate only to counterparties or customers offered credit. 
Overall exposure continues to be mainly spread over a large number of customers but where concentration exists this is with 
highly rated counterparties.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £46,000 (2015: £669,000) which are 
past due at the reporting date, for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality 
and the Group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. 
The average age of overdue but unprovided debts is 40 days (2015: 166 days).

22. Cash and cash equivalents
Consolidated cash and cash equivalents of £28,250,000 (2015: £39,810,000) comprises cash held on demand by the Group 
and short term deposits.
Cash and cash equivalents includes £18,727,000 (2015: £33,879,000) cash held in the UK’s regulated entities CPPL and HIL. 
This cash is either maintained by the Group’s insurance business for solvency purposes or restricted by the terms of the VVOP. 
The VVOP restricted cash cannot be distributed to the wider Group without FCA approval. The restricted cash, whilst being 
unavailable to distribute to the wider Group, is available to the regulated entity in which it exists including for operational 
and residual redress purposes.
Concentration of credit risk is reduced, as far as practicable, by placing cash on deposit across a number of institutions with 
the best available credit ratings. The credit quality of counterparties is as follows:
 
2016
£’000
2015 
£’000
AA 3,162 1,679
A 21,510 36,064
BBB 2,027 548
BB 1,414 1,405
Rating information not available 137 114
 28,250 39,810
Ratings are measured using Fitch’s long term ratings, which are defined such that ratings “ AAA ” to “BBB” denote investment 
grade counterparties, offering low to moderate credit risk. “ AAA ” represents the highest credit quality, indicating that the 
counterparty’s ability to meet financial commitments is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events. 
Company cash and cash equivalents of £nil (2015: £4,843,000) comprises cash held on demand by the Company.

replaces these rules with effect from 1 January 2016 and does not require an equalisation reserve to be held. The reserve was 
transferred to retained earnings on 1 January 2016.

The Group’s bank debt is in the form of a £5,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF). The current RCF became effective on 
11 February 2015. The Group is entitled to roll over repayment of amounts drawn down, subject to all amounts outstanding 
falling due for repayment on expiry of the facility on 28 February 2018. At 31 December 2016, the Group has £5,000,000 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities (2015: £4,000,000).
The RCF bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 4%. It is secured by fixed and floating charges on certain 
assets of the Group. The financial covenants of the RCF are based on the interest cover and minimum total cash balance 
of the Group. The Group has been in compliance with these covenants since inception of the RCF . 
All amounts outstanding in respect of the Second Commission Deferral Agreement fall due for repayment on expiry of 
the agreement on 31 January 2017. The Second Commission Deferral Agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% and 
is secured by charges over the assets of CPPL in substantially similar form and terms to the security granted under the RCF .

The onerous lease provision reflects the future lease payments and associated costs in the expected non-utilisation period 
at a vacated office in the UK.
The customer redress and associated cost provision comprises anticipated compensation payable to customers through 
residual customer redress exercises and associated professional fees. 
The onerous lease provision and customer redress and associated costs are both expected to be settled within one year 
of the balance sheet date.
The Group has made certain commercial and contractual decisions that are not yet agreed with all affected parties. The Group 
is satisfied with its position from both a legal and regulatory perspective. Appropriate financial provisions are in place in respect 
of these matters and are included in trade and other payables.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at tax rates expected to apply on the forecast date of reversal, based on tax laws 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where the Group or the Company is entitled to and intends to settle tax 
liabilities on a net basis. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:

At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of £35,033,000 (2015: £44,170,000) available for offset against 
future profits. A deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of £1,406,000 (2015: £nil) of these losses. No deferred tax asset 
has been recognised in respect of the remainder of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the 
underlying companies and restrictions on offset of taxable profits and losses between Group companies. Included in unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are losses of £5,400,000 (2015: £5,562,000) which, if not used, will expire between one to twelve years 
(2015: one to twelve years). Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely.
There is no deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings as the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date the Company has unused tax losses of £17,202,000 (2015: £17,202,000) available for offset against 
future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit 
streams in the Company and restrictions on offset of taxable profits and losses between Group companies. The losses can be 
carried forward indefinitely.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group does not have a target level of gearing but seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity while aiming 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group’s principal debt facility during the year was 
a £5.0 million RCF with an expiry date of 28 February 2018.
The Group makes adjustments to its capital structure in light of economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure 
the Group may adjust a dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Directors 
have considered the capital requirements of the Group, including the availability of cash reserves, and have not proposed a final 
dividend in respect of the current year.
Externally imposed capital requirement
Two of the Group’s principal subsidiaries, CPPL and HIL, have capital requirements imposed by the FCA in the UK. Both 
subsidiaries have complied with their respective imposed capital requirements throughout the current and prior year.
Card Protection Plan Limited
CPPL is regulated by the FCA as an insurance intermediary and is required to hold a minimum level of capital resources relative 
to regulated business revenue.
The ratio of current and future capital resources to regulated business revenue is reported monthly to management to ensure 
compliance. There have been no instances of non-compliance in either the current or prior years.
The Group has agreed with the FCA, as part of the VVOP, to additional restrictions on the disposition of assets by CPPL.
Homecare Insurance Limited
HIL is authorised and regulated by the PRA and regulated by the FCA as an insurance underwriter and therefore maintains its 
capital resources in accordance with the PRA ’s Rulebook. HIL and its immediate parent company, Homecare (Holdings) Limited, 
calculate their Solvency Capital Requirement using the Solvency II Standard Formula and report this quarterly to the HIL Board 
and to the PRA. As at 31 December 2016, HIL ’s ratio of eligible funds to meet its Solvency Capital Requirement was 209%. 
There have been no instances of non-compliance in either the current or prior year. 
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models based on discounted cash flow 
analysis using prices from observable current market transactions; hence, all are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Financial assets and liabilities are carried at the following amounts:
Financial assets
 
2016
£’000
2015 
£’000
Loans and receivables 34,589 46,687
Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, insurance assets and taxes receivable.
There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial asset.
Financial liabilities
 
2016
£’000
2015 
£’000
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 29,944 43,869
Financial liabilities at amortised cost comprise borrowings, trade creditors, accruals, taxes payable, insurance claims and provisions.
There is no significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount of any financial liability, since liabilities are either 
short term in nature or bear interest at variable rates.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s activities expose it to the risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Board of Directors 
determines the Treasury Policy of the Group and delegates the authority for execution of the policy to the Group Treasurer. 
Any changes to the Treasury Policy are authorised by the Board of Directors. The limited use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Treasury Policy and derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that short and medium term interest rates fluctuate. The Group manages 
this risk through the use of interest rate swaps, when appropriate, in accordance with its Treasury Policy. There has been no use 
of interest rate derivatives in either the current or prior year. The interest cover (being defined as the ratio of underlying EBITDA 
to interest paid) at 31 December 2016 was 37x (2015: 9x). 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movements in LIBOR. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 2% increase 
in LIBOR rates throughout the year. 2% represents the Directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change in LIBOR rates. 
The sensitivity analysis includes the impact of changes in LIBOR on yearly average cash and bank loans.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has investments in overseas operations which have functional currencies 
other than sterling and are affected by foreign exchange movements. The carrying amounts of the Group’s principal foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities are as follows:

Eurozone sensitivity analysis
The Group operates in countries with euro denominated currencies. The UK’s decision to leave the European Union has had 
an impact in the year on the euro exchange rate. As the UK moves through the exit process this has potential to result in further 
fluctuations in the euro which would impact the translation of the Group’s results and represents a risk to the Group. The Group’s 
ongoing Eurozone operations are in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. A 20% deterioration in the sterling to euro exchange 
rate throughout the year would have decreased Group profits relating to these Eurozone entities by £459,000 (2015: £504,000). 
With the exception of foreign exchange movements, the Group does not consider operations to be significantly at risk following 
the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Current business activities are wholly serviced within the country of operation and 
are not extensively conducted under passporting arrangements. This should reduce the potential risk to the Group’s operations 
from the UK leaving the European Union.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group does not actively hedge its credit risk.
The Group’s retail trade and insurance receivables are mainly with a broad base of individual customers and are therefore not 
generally exposed to any one customer, resulting in low credit risk.
The Group’s wholesale activities can result in material balances existing with a small number of counterparties and therefore 
increased credit risk exists. The Group continues to maintain some wholesale contracts and considers that it mitigates this 
credit risk through good quality relationships with counterparties and only partnering with counterparties with established 
credit ratings. 
Counterparty credit limits are determined in accordance with the Treasury Policy for cash and cash equivalents and the Counterparty 
and Credit Risk Policy for receivables. Any balance that falls into an overdue status is monitored. Further details of the monitoring 
of and provision for overdue debts are outlined for insurance receivables in note 19 and other receivables in note 21.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a policy of repatriation and pooling of funding where possible in order to maximise the return on surplus cash 
or minimise the level of debt required. Group Treasury continually monitors the level of short term funding requirements 
and balances the need for short term funding with the long term funding needs of the Group. Additional undrawn facilities 
that the Group had at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are included in note 25. 
Compliance with financial ratios and other covenant obligations of the Group’s bank loans is monitored on a monthly basis 
by the Board of Directors.

Insurance risk
The Group applies a prudent approach to its management of potential exposure to risks arising from its insurance contracts.
The lines of policies underwritten are limited to general insurance classes underwritten by HIL, an entity within the Group, which 
is authorised and regulated by the PRA and regulated by the FCA. The lines of risk underwritten are restricted by HIL to those 
lines where either HIL has substantial experience or lines that the Group wishes to move into where it can enter such a line 
of business in a risk-controlled manner after appropriate Board consideration.
The Group’s lines of insurance business, and thus its insurance risk portfolio, are primarily focused on high volume, low transaction 
value, short term individual lines.
The Group’s policy is to establish a specific claims reserve at any point in time on each line of business, based on claims reported 
up to and including the last day of each accounting period, including an element to represent claims incurred but not yet reported. 
Details of claims reserves carried are provided in note 23.
The Directors consider the following to be the principal insurance risks and actions taken, reducing risk to an acceptable level:
Changes in rates of claims
Trends in claim rates and other market data are reviewed on a regular basis and premiums for contracts are adjusted accordingly. 
Each class of contract has a large population of homogeneous policyholders and no insurance contracts are subject to 
concentration risk.
A 10% deterioration in the loss ratio during the year would have resulted in a £37,000 increase in loss before tax and reduction 
in shareholders’ equity (2015: £78,000), 10% representing the Directors’ assessment of the reasonably possible change 
in the loss ratio.
Changes in settlement cost per claim
The quantum or nature of settlement amounts is specified in policy documentation and the Group is not exposed to significant 
open-ended commitments. Although settlement costs are not capped, they generally vary within a small range, limiting the 
Group’s exposure.
Reliance on key suppliers
The Group makes use of third party suppliers to fulfil the majority of claims. The performance and financial position of key 
suppliers are regularly monitored and alternative lines of supply are sourced as necessary.
The Group therefore considers its exposure to risk arising from its insurance contracts to be appropriately managed.

During the year, the Company issued 3,647,000 shares to option holders for total consideration of £36,470. Further details 
relating to share options are provided in note 30.
During the year the CPPGroup Plc Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) purchased 3,000,000 (2015: 1,763,000) of the Company’s 
ordinary shares for total cash consideration of £120,000 (2015: £264,000). Of the total shares purchased by the EBT 711,874 
(2015: nil) were used to settle awards under the MSP. 
The total amount paid by the EBT to acquire shares, offset by the value of shares used to satisfy the MSP award, has been 
deducted from the ESOP reserve. The reduction in the ESOP reserve in the year is £63,000 (2015: £264,000).
Of the 856,480,830 ordinary shares issued at 31 December 2016, 855,980,831 are fully paid and 499,999 are partly paid.
The ordinary shares are entitled to the profits of the Company which it may from time to time determine to distribute 
in respect of any financial year or period. 
All holders of ordinary shares shall have the right to attend and vote at all general meetings of the Company. On a return of 
assets on liquidation, the assets (if any) remaining, after the debts and liabilities of the Company and the costs of winding up 
have been paid or allowed for, shall belong to, and be distributed amongst, the holders of all the ordinary shares in proportion 
to the number of such ordinary shares held by them respectively.
Deferred shares have no voting rights, no rights to receive dividends and only very limited rights on a return of capital. 
The deferred shares have not been listed for trading in any market and are not freely transferable.
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 82 30. Share-based payment
Current share plans
Share-based payment charges comprise 2016 LTIP charges of £582,000 (2015: £nil) and MSP charges of £902,000 
(2015: £1,457,000). These costs are disclosed within administrative expenses, although the MSP share-based payment charge 
forms part of the MSP charges which is not included in underlying operating profit. MSP charges in the income statement are 
different to the share-based payment charge due to the recognition of employer’s national insurance relating to future option 
exercises. There have been 26,050,000 options granted in the current year as part of the 2016 LTIP; the plan was not in operation 
in the prior year. There have been no MSP options granted in the current year (2015: 38,010,000).

also subject to achievement of certain performance criteria including a share price measure and an underlying operating profit 
target over the vesting period.
Options granted under the MSP have an exercise price of 1 penny and vest over a three year period, with 25% vesting on the first 
anniversary of the grant date, 25% vesting on the second anniversary and 50% vesting on the third anniversary. Options lapse 
if not exercised within ten years of the grant date and will lapse if option holders cease to be employed by the Group or sell any 
of their investment shares. There have been no options granted in the current year (2015: 38,010,000) and options exercised 
in the current year total 4,359,000 (2015: n/ a).

Outstanding nil-cost options and conditional shares granted under the 2010 LTIP were subject to achievement of performance 
criteria including total shareholder return and an absolute share price measure over a three year period. The performance criteria 
were not met and as a result the options were forfeited during the year. There have been no 2010 LTIP options exercised in either 
the current or prior year and no further awards can be made under this plan.
All outstanding nil-cost options and conditional shares granted under the RSP have vested. These options will lapse if not exercised 
within ten years of grant, and will lapse if option holders cease to be employed by the Group. There have been no RSP options 
granted or exercised in either the current or prior year and no further awards can be made under this plan.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Group overview
The acquisition of Wilson Bowden 
The acquisition of Wilson Bowden, completed 
in April, has a strong underlying commercial 
logic and gives us new capabilities across 
the sector. 
The geographic coverage of our 
housebuilding activity across Great Britain 
has been further underpinned providing a 
strong base for future growth. The combined 
business also has products spanning the 
market – from ﬁrst time buyer homes to urban 
regeneration through to upmarket housing 
under the well respected David Wilson Homes 
brand. In addition, the enlarged Group is 
a major provider of social housing and 
commercial developments. 
Our land position has improved and we have 
increased access to considerable expertise 
in strategic land acquisition and delivery. 
The integration of the two businesses has 
progressed rapidly and is now ahead of our 
original plans both in terms of timing and 
savings to be realised. We now expect to 
deliver at least £30m of synergies in 2007/8 
and at least £60m in the second full year after 
completing the acquisition. 
As a result of the acquisition we gained a 
strong commercial development business 
in Wilson Bowden Developments. We are 
currently reviewing how this can create best 
value for the Group, including leveraging its 
capability on large scale mixed-use schemes.
Our performance and dividends
Our housebuilding business delivered strong 
completion growth, robust proﬁtability and a 
healthy margin over the last twelve months. 
Wilson Bowden Developments delivered 
a strong performance in line with market 
expectations. 
These were encouraging results against the 
backdrop of a year where we saw signiﬁcant 
increases in UK interest rates. To underpin 
returns in what is expected to be a more 
difﬁcult environment we will continue to drive 
revenue whilst focusing rigorously on cost 
control and sales management.
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 
24.30 pence per share (2006: 20.69 pence 
per share) for payment in November 2007. 
This will bring our full year dividend to 
35.68 pence per share and represents a 
15% year on year increase. This is in keeping 
with our progressive dividend policy of 
reducing, over time, our dividend cover to 
around 2.5 times.
The changing industry landscape
As well as changing economic conditions, this 
year has also seen signiﬁcant changes in the 
public policy outlook for housebuilders. 
The UK Government has made housing a key 
priority going forward and has set out an 
ambition to increase signiﬁcantly the supply 
of new housing both in the private and 
affordable sectors. To achieve this, further 
land will need to be made available together 
with reforms to the planning process. 
During the year the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading started 
an industry review focusing on customer 
service and the supply of new housing. 
The UK Government announced a target for 
new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. This 
will lead to very signiﬁcant changes in the way 
houses are constructed and supplied with 
energy. It is vital that the industry adjusts 
rapidly and we have already made considerable 
progress with various initiatives underway.
Safety remains a key priority for the Group. 
The tragic accident in Battersea in September 
2006 in which two people lost their lives, 
underlined the dangers of the work we 
undertake and our thoughts and deepest 
sympathies remain with the families of those 
killed in the incident. We continue to work 
closely with the Health and Safety Executive 
on the cause of the incident and are 
committed to ensuring the safety of the public 
and our employees remains paramount. 
Our people
To deliver such a strong performance against 
a background of rising interest rates and the 
completion of a signiﬁcant acquisition is a 
major achievement for the Group. It is a tribute 
to our Executive team and our employees, 
from both Barratt and Wilson Bowden, who 
have worked tirelessly with considerable skill 
to deliver these results. 
Chairman’s statement
This has been a historic year for Barratt Developments 
marked by very considerable change. Under a new 
Chief Executive, Mark Clare, we acquired Wilson 
Bowden which took us into the FTSE100. 
Whilst completing and rapidly integrating this major 
acquisition, we have delivered a robust operating 
performance against a backdrop of increasing UK 
interest rates. 05

The underlying strength of the business is also
a tribute to David Pretty CBE our former Chief
Executive who retired in December. Geoff
Hester also retired from the Board in January
and we wish them both well in retirement.
The future
In the coming year the Group is likely to face a
more challenging market place as the impact
of increasing interest rates and mortgage
costs are felt. In addition there is more
uncertainty about the macroeconomic
outlook. By harnessing the capabilities of a
strengthened management team, we will focus
relentlessly on delivering beneﬁts from the
acquisition, driving down costs and running
the business to maximise shareholder value.

 costs of £13.1m related to Wilson Bowden and 
 £13.1m related to Barratt have been incurred.
Moving forward
Integrating the businesses
The integration of Wilson Bowden has 
progressed rapidly ensuring that the 
combined business will deliver synergies 
and strategic beneﬁts as quickly as possible. 
One of the principles of integrating the 
businesses has been to take the best from 
both organisations and this has been carried 
through. Ensuring best practice is followed 
and realising synergies will remain key 
priorities for us.
We now operate under two strong national 
brands for housebuilding – Barratt Homes 
and David Wilson Homes. We have also 
retained Ward Homes based predominantly in 
Kent as a strong local brand. The KingsOak 
brand has been discontinued. All the key 
management teams have been put in place 
and are working successfully to deliver our 
plans going forward with speciﬁc focus on 
improving operational performance.
Our regional network of ofﬁces has been 
reorganised to create 35 housebuilding 
divisions, each with a strengthened 
management team. 
Nine divisional ofﬁces were closed and we are 
planning to close both the Group ofﬁce in 
Newcastle and the former Wilson Bowden 
head ofﬁce in Ibstock. In all, 370 redundancies 
have resulted from the acquisition, with an 
expectation of approximately 400 in total. 
We now expect to deliver at least £60m of 
synergy savings in the second full year after 
completion, compared with the earlier 
estimate of £45m. Savings of at least £30m 
are expected to be delivered in 2007/8. 
Our priorities
Our objective is to maximise shareholder 
value by creating great places to live and 
work that serve the long-term needs of our 
customers and their communities.
To achieve this we will need to continue our 
focus on building revenues, improving quality, 
service and design, whilst lowering the cost of 
doing business. 
Competitive land purchasing is the life blood 
of the Group and last year we invested 
£1,012.7m, signiﬁcantly improving our position. 
We now have a land bank of 5.1 years at 
current production rates of which 72.2% has 
either detailed or outline planning permission. 
With the acquisition of Wilson Bowden we 
gained important strategic land assets and 
capabilities which we intend to exploit to the 
full to underpin further growth. We will also
Financially and operationally this has been a 
successful year for the Group. We have completed 
the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, rapidly integrated 
the two businesses and are already starting to deliver 
our synergy targets. 
At the same time we have continued to focus on 
improving our operational efficiency, increasing our 
investment in land whilst enhancing the capability of 
the organisation to deliver.
Our performance
The proﬁt before tax for the combined Group 
for the year was £427.8m – an increase of 
£36.4m (9.3%) on a turnover of £3,046.1m 
(2006: £2,431.4m) up 25.3%. This included 
a proﬁt before tax contribution from Wilson 
Bowden of £63.6m*, and a turnover 
contribution of £379.6m, for the last two 
months of the year. 
During the year both businesses have 
performed well with strong growth in 
completions. Barratt saw completions 
increase by 6.3% to 15,517 (2006: 14,601). 
Wilson Bowden performed strongly 
increasing completions by 19.2% to 2,635 
in the six months to June (2006: 2,211). 
Tight control of costs has helped us to 
deliver an operating margin before 
restructuring costs* of 16.7% (2006: 17.0%).
Forward sales for the Group at 1 July 2007 
were strong and totalled £1,414m, 14.8% 
ahead of the combined Barratt and Wilson 
Bowden total at 30 June 2006 of £1,232m 
and 67.3% up on the Barratt total of £845m 
at 30 June 2006.

Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
It is not yet clear how quickly the market will
recover but we have to assume that there will
be downward pressure on volumes and price
inﬂ ation in the short-term.
However, the market fundamentals remain
strong with demand continuing to exceed
supply with the Government intent on
stimulating the sector by accelerating land
availability.
In the year ahead the market will continue to
change rapidly. Three areas of particular focus
will be:
Continued investment in the
acquisition of land
Further enhancing our urban
regeneration capabilities
Establishing leadership in the
move to zero carbon
Mark Clare
Group Chief Executive
Barratt Developments PLC

enabling us to secure more business.
As we put in place the capability to deliver
higher volumes, we will also seek to ensure
that we do so with a lower cost base. So in
addition to delivering the synergy savings from
the acquisition, we are also focusing on day-to-
day efﬁ ciency improvements. Looking forward
we have identiﬁ ed further areas of improvement
and set stretching targets for delivery.
None of these priorities can be delivered
without the considerable ability of our people
- from land buying to planning and from
construction to sales. Over the last year
we have improved the capability of the
organisation through new recruitment and
development of our management teams.
We have also introduced a new graduate
programme and we are now setting out to
improve our apprenticeship scheme, already
one of the largest in the industry.
Outlook
We have already signalled that it would be
prudent to assume that the cumulative impact
of interest rate increases would result in the
housing market tightening in 2007/8. The
recent credit squeeze has further affected
customer sentiment and pressure on lending
institutions, has led to a tightening of lending
criteria and mortgage availability.
continue to focus on the delivery of land through
the planning process as effectively as possible.
The Group now has two of the best known
national house building brands with differing
market positions. The reputation of these
brands, together with effective sales
investment, will be critical in maintaining and
growing revenues. We have now relaunched
the Barratt Homes brand backed by TV
advertising and a new sales website. The
David Wilson Homes brand is beneﬁ ting from
the additional rebranding of KingsOak sites.
In recent years substantial progress has been
made in improving customer service and last
year 89% of Barratt Homes’ buyers said they
would recommend us to a friend, up from
85% in the previous year. However, there is
still further progress that needs to be made if
we are to create a Group that truly places the
customer at the heart of its business. This will
be underpinned by the setting of clear targets
for improvements within the remuneration
package of our senior managers.
During the past year we won numerous awards
for the design and quality of the homes and
communities we build. This will continue to be
a key priority as it not only underpins sales but
also enhances the reputation of the Group

Wilson Bowden completed 1,651 properties 
since acquisition, with revenue of £334.9m. It 
operated from an average of 154 sites in the 
period, up 3% from the equivalent period last 
year. Wilson Bowden’s average selling price 
was £202,800 in the period since acquisition. 
The higher average selling price than Barratt 
Homes reﬂects the different mix of market 
segments in which the David Wilson Homes 
brand operates.
The integration of Wilson Bowden is 
progressing ahead of schedule, with both the 
new operational structure of 35 divisions and 
its supporting management structure in 
place. The Group is focused on developing 
its core brands: Barratt Homes for traditional 
housing, apartments and urban regeneration; 
and David Wilson Homes with a reputation 
for producing larger family homes, along with 
the Ward Homes brand based predominantly 
in Kent. However, we have decided to 
discontinue the use of our KingsOak brand. 
The rebranding of our sites and divisions 
is now complete. Progress is also being 
made in reducing our head ofﬁce and 
administrative costs. In our ﬁrst full year 
we estimate our synergy savings will be at 
least £30m, rising to at least £60m in the 
second full year following acquisition.
Commercial development
Wilson Bowden Developments was acquired 
as part of the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, 
and its trading performance during May and 
June was in line with our expectations. The 
main highlights were: the handover of East 
Midlands Fire Control Centre at Willow Farm, 
Castle Donington, which will be used to 
coordinate the Fire Service for ﬁve counties in 
the East Midlands; and the completion of the 
redevelopment and extension of the Jackson 
Square shopping centre at Bishop’s Stortford.
In addition we secured the letting to the Home 
Ofﬁce of a 76,000 square foot ofﬁce building 
at our Riverside Exchange site in Shefﬁeld 
and made continued progress with lettings 
at the Eagles Meadow shopping centre in 
Wrexham which is due to open in the second 
half of 2008.
Land
The Group land bank has been strengthened 
during the year and now stands at 109,700 
plots with a book value of £3,296.6m, 
representing approximately 5.1 years of land 
usage at the current rate of consumption. The 
land bank includes 23,300 plots which have 
been purchased subject to contract. Of our 
land bank at 30 June 2007 , 72.2% of plots 
have either detailed or outline planning 
permission. We have detailed planning 
permission on 99.3% of plots for 2007/08 and 
60.8% of plots for 2008/09. In addition we have 
12,200 acres (2006: 2,800 acres) of strategic 
land, which has been considerably increased 
by the acquisition of Wilson Bowden.
Expenditure on land purchases during the year 
was £1,012.7m compared with £841m for the 
previous year. 
The acquisition of Wilson Bowden, has further 
strengthened the Group’s land bank, bringing 
with it not only the additional plots acquired but 
also strengthening our expertise in strategic 
land. The additional focus we shall now be able 
to bring to bear on the delivery of strategic land 
will enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder 
value in future years.
Core strengths
During the past year the Group continued to 
build upon its core strengths of geographic 
and product diversity, quality and service, 
and people. We have inherited strong skills 
from Wilson Bowden that complemented 
those in Barratt.

projects in Feltham and Hounslow, creating
1,150 homes with commercial, retail and
community facilities. The Feltham scheme,
of over 800 homes, has been awarded £5m
in direct funding from English Partnerships to
enable 58 homes to be made available to key
workers and ﬁrst time buyers on a shared
ownership basis. We are also in partnership
with the specialist regeneration company
Artisan, developing over 1,000 homes
in Rochdale.
Quality and service
We are pleased that overall customer
satisfaction and the number of our
customers who would ‘recommend us to a
friend’ has continued to improve during the
year. In the year ended 30 June 2007, 89%
of Barratt Homes’ customers responded that
they would ‘recommend us to a friend’,
which represents an improvement over the
result of 85% in 2006 and 80% in 2005. In
addition, our customer satisfaction rating
has continued to improve from 70% in 2005
to 76% in 2006 and is now 81%.
We are continually striving to improve our
service to our customers and this is now a
feature of senior management remuneration.
During the year we also completed a training
programme for all ‘customer facing’ staff
covering our Customer Charter and
Customer Care Personal Code of Practice.
We also conducted full customer service
audits of a number of our divisions, and
based upon the audit ﬁndings, we have
implemented a range of development
programmes designed to improve our level
of customer care. During the year, the Group
also introduced a code of practice for all
Group suppliers, which emphasises the
importance that the Group places on high
standards of customer care.
Geographic and product diversity
The Group offers a wide product range from
ﬁrst time buyer homes to luxury apartments
and family homes with prices ranging from
under £90,000 to £1.35 million and an
average selling price of £172,800. We
operate throughout Great Britain and at 30
June 2007 we were selling from 590 sites
spread over 35 divisions. The diversity of
product and places has been strengthened
by our acquisition of Wilson Bowden.
The provision of affordable homes continues
to be a key component of our activities with
the Group completing 2,833 homes for
housing association partners during the year
at an average selling price of £92,800. We are
one of the leading providers in the industry of
affordable homes for rent, shared ownership
or low cost homes for sale. We believe that
our strength in this area provides opportunities
for the Group’s further growth, especially in
light of developing Government policy.
We have continued to invest in our iPad
range of homes which provides affordable
housing for ﬁrst time buyers. During the year
120 (2006: 30) homes were legally
completed, 330 were under construction,
and planning permission has been secured
for a further 634 homes. Our product offering
in this area has been further enhanced by
the addition of the David Wilson Homes’
range of iLife homes. We are pleased to have
been awarded £30.5m of funding under the
English Partnerships’ First Time Buyers
Initiative, to assist ﬁrst time buyers who
would otherwise have been unable to afford
to buy their own home. Under this initiative
the Group will build 316 homes on
developments in Brighton, Bristol, Ely,
Gravesend, Leeds, Liverpool, Romford,
Southampton and Watford.
During the last twelve months we have secured
219 sites, which will deliver 26,000 units in
future years. A number of these sites are very
signiﬁcant for our plans for future growth. In
Northampton, we have won 16 sites that will
provide 1,500 new homes and we shall also
help to fund new educational facilities in the
town. We also recently announced schemes
for more than 1,200 new homes in
Middlesbrough and Stockton. In Telford, in
consortium with two other developers, we are
creating the largest single new community in 17

Furthermore, Barratt Homes also received
Gold Awards for exterior design, landscaping

Our people and expertise
We recognise that one of our key strengths
as a Group is our people. We have appointed
a new Group Human Resources Director and
have strengthened our human resources team
during the year. We have also introduced a
number of new initiatives to beneﬁ t our staff,
including our Cornerstone induction plan,
a new twice-yearly Performance and
Development Review and the Barratt
Leadership Development Programme, all
of which will assist with the development
of the Group’s leaders of the future.
We have launched a new Graduate
Recruitment and Development Programme.
54 successful graduates joined the business
in September 2007 , selected from 752
applicants. They will undertake a two-year
multidisciplinary programme.
At any one time we have over 500 apprentices
within our business. Our intention is to ensure
that we continue to attract and retain the very
best apprentices to provide a pipeline of skills
for the future. We are currently working
with the Learning and Skills Council and the

subcontractors, by 2010. At present over 60%
of our workforce has achieved this target.
The strengths of the Group in terms of people
and expertise have been recognised again this
year with the Group winning a number of
national awards. Our construction teams won
71 National House-Building Council (NHBC)
‘Pride in the Job’ quality awards, a signiﬁcant
improvement on last year’s achievement of
53 awards. This is more than any other
housebuilder and a new record for the Group.
The Group’s innovative approach to
housebuilding was recognised at both the
2006 ‘Housebuilder Innovation’ Awards, where
Barratt Homes won ‘Housebuilding Innovator
of the Year’, and at the ‘British Home’ Awards
where the ‘Innovation Award for Building
Technology’ was presented for the Group’s
Elektron development in London Docklands.
Environment
During the year the Government announced
the requirement for all new homes to be zero
carbon by 2016. Whilst this requirement will
pose a challenge for all housebuilders, we
are seeking to become industry leaders in
this area and we will launch, later in the year,
an environmental charter that sets out how
we will reduce our own impact, improve the
environmental quality of what we build and
help our customers to reduce their impact.
Building upon the success of our seven home
EcoSmart Show Village in Chorley, Lancashire
(which included the latest energy efﬁcient
technologies) and as part of our commitment
to zero carbon housing, we are to build the
‘Green House’ a prototype home using an
award winning design developed by architects
Gaunt Francis. The zero carbon home will be
built at the Building Research Establishment’s
Innovation Park and will combine outstanding
design, high standards of energy efﬁciency
and the use of innovative microgeneration. It
also includes recycled slag foundations, lime/
hemp render walls and pitched roofs
incorporating photovoltaic panels. The central
heating will be controlled by a central
computer system with internet linked energy
efﬁciency appliances. We now have carbon
saving measures on over 35 of our sites and
have completed a review of how to improve
the environmental impact of our existing
housing designs.
We continue to build the majority of our
developments on brownﬁeld sites, with 78%
of Barratt developments in the year being built
upon brownﬁeld land, which signiﬁcantly
exceeds the Government’s target of 60%.
The Group continues to make progress in
certifying our divisions to ISO14001 standard
for Environmental Management. In last year’s
Annual Report we stated our target was that
all of our divisions would have achieved
ISO14001 status by 30 June 2007. This has
been delivered and we are now beginning the
process of certifying our newly acquired David
Wilson Homes divisions, with a view to
achieving ISO14001.
Health and Safety
As previously reported, the Group is
saddened that a fatal accident occurred on a
Barratt development on 26 September 2006.
The accident took place at our Battersea
Road development in London when a crane
collapsed resulting in the tragic death of two
people. The Group continues to cooperate
with the ongoing Health and Safety Executive
inquiry into the incident.
Notwithstanding this tragic event, we have
continued to make good progress in the ﬁeld
of Health and Safety with a reduction in the
number of reportable accidents to 643 per
100,000 persons employed in the
housebuilding business, a reduction of 4.3%
on the previous year. In addition, the average
safety standard ratings achieved by the Group
in the independent NHBC site surveys have
continued to be ahead of the other
housebuilders using this service.
The Group continues to make progress
with the process of certifying our operating
divisions under OHSAS18001 in Health
and Safety. At 30 June 2007, 19 divisions
were certiﬁed to this level and we have
plans to certify another six divisions within
the next year.
Corporate responsibility
As outlined in the sections above, the Group
has continued to make good progress on
corporate responsibility throughout the year.
The Group has embedded its corporate
responsibility strategy within Barratt
operations and is now applying this in the
newly acquired operations of the Group.

Group key risks
The Group’s ﬁ nancial and operational
performance is subject to a number of risks.
The Board seeks to ensure that appropriate
processes are put in place to manage,
monitor and mitigate these risks which are
detailed in the table on the left.
The Group recognises that the management
of risk is fundamental to the achievement
of Group targets. As such all tiers of
management are involved in this process.
Outlook
We have already signalled that it would be
prudent to assume that the cumulative
impact of interest rate increases would result
in the housing market tightening in 2007/8.
The recent credit squeeze has further
affected customer sentiment and pressure
on lending institutions, has led to a tightening
of lending criteria and mortgage availability.
It is not yet clear how quickly the market will
recover but we have to assume that there will
be downward pressure on volumes and price
inﬂ ation in the short-term.
However, the market fundamentals remain
strong with demand continuing to exceed
supply with the Government intent on
stimulating the sector by accelerating
land availability.
Principal risks of the Group include, but are not limited to:
Risk Mitigation
Residential property market
Response to changes in the macroeconomic climate
including buyer conﬁ dence and interest rates
The Executive Directors conduct a weekly
meeting which reviews key trading indicators,
including sales rates, visitor levels and levels
of incentives and cash ﬂ ow projections.
Provision of high quality product to maintain brand
quality and minimise remedial costs
The Group has a comprehensive approach
to quality enshrined in the ‘Forward through
Quality Initiative’.
Land
Securing sufﬁ cient land of appropriate size and
quality to provide proﬁ table growth
Each division produces a monthly analysis of
the amount of land currently controlled compared
to their outline three year sales projections.
These are consolidated upwards for regular
review at Board level.
In addition each operating division holds weekly
land meetings.
Every land acquisition is subject to a formal
appraisal procedure and is required to achieve
an overall hurdle rate of return.
Government regulation
Length of time taken to obtain required planning
and technical consents
The Group has considerable in-house technical
and planning expertise devoted to achieving
implementable planning consents.
Consequence of changes in tax legislation Potential and actual changes in tax legislation are
monitored by both our industry experienced in-
house ﬁ nance teams and our external tax
advisors.
The Group has adopted a low risk strategy to
tax planning.
Construction
Failure to identify and achieve key construction
milestones
The Group’s weekly reporting identiﬁ es the number
of properties at key stages of construction.
Projected construction rates are evaluated as
part of the monthly forecasting cycle.
Management reporting fails to identify cost overruns
leaving insufﬁ cient time to take remedial action
The total costs on every site in progress are
evaluated once a quarter and reviewed by the
divisional board meeting.
 Innovative design and construction techniques
are not employed
The Group ensures that it is at the forefront of
design and construction techniques by a
combination of:
• in-house technical departments
• the employment of external consultants
• an ongoing commitment to building experimental
house types
Health and Safety The Group has a dedicated Health and Safety
audit department which is independent of the
management of the operating divisions.
Consideration of the impact of construction schemes
upon the environment and social surroundings
The Group monitors a number of environmental
impact indicators. The results of this appear in
our Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
People
Ability of the Group to attract and retain the
best people
The Group has a comprehensive Human
Resources policy in place which includes:
• apprentice schemes
• an extensive Graduate Recruitment Programme
• succession planning
• training schemes tailored to each discipline
• the Group has set itself the target of having a
fully carded workforce by 2010, under the
Construction Skills Certiﬁ cation Scheme
Ensuring that the Group has a sufﬁ ciently skilled
and experienced workforce
Adequate succession planning to ensure that
experience and knowledge of key management
is retained within the business
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme to which the Group
may be required to increase contributions to fund
an increase in costs of future beneﬁ ts and/or any
future shortfall
An actuarial valuation is conducted every three
years. The Group reviews this and considers
if additional contributions are necessary to make
good any shortfall.

Acquisition of Wilson Bowden
The Group completed its acquisition of Wilson
Bowden on 26 April 2007, at a cost of
£2,049.6m, ﬁ nanced by cash and loan notes
of £930.3m and £1,119.3m of shares. The
acquisition has resulted in a fair value uplift in
the value of Wilson Bowden’s acquired
balance sheet of £98.5m arising primarily
from an increase in the value of inventory of
£34.4m, the recognition of £107.0m of
intangible assets related to the David Wilson
Homes and Wilson Bowden Developments
brands, a write off of £3.5m of goodwill, an
adjustment to trade payables of £1.8m, offset
by an additional deferred tax liability of
£41.2m. The acquisition has resulted in the
Group recognising £816.7m of goodwill.
The goodwill arising on acquisition relates to:
 the highly complementary geographical
ﬁ t, which has enabled us to deliver
synergies from the rationalisation of the
number of operating divisions and
consolidate central functions
the acquisition of the skills and
experience within the Wilson Bowden
workforce
an expanded consented land bank
enabling increased operational ﬂ exibility
increased access to commercial and
mixed-use developments
•
•
•
•
access to an expanded portfolio of
strategic land and the expertise of Wilson
Bowden strategic land teams.
The carrying value of goodwill of £816.7m is
comfortably supported by the cash ﬂ ows of
the underlying business units.
During the year to 30 June 2007, the Group
incurred £26.2m of one-off restructuring costs
relating to the reorganisation of the two former
businesses, including redundancies, ofﬁ ce
reorganisation costs and systems
harmonisation. Further restructuring costs will
be incurred in 2008, particularly on the
• systems side, and we anticipate the overall
cost will be in line with our original estimate
of £35m.
Segmental analysis
Following the acquisition of Wilson Bowden,
the Group has, for the ﬁ rst time, two segments,
being housebuilding and commercial
development. These segments reﬂ ect the
different product offerings and market risks
facing these areas of the business.

Tax
The Group corporation tax charge for the 
year was £127.4m, an effective rate of 29.8%. 
This is lower than the standard rate of 30% 
due to the impact of the announced 
reduction in the corporation tax rate to 28% 
from April 2008 upon deferred tax, and the 
tax charge beneﬁ ting from employee share 
schemes relief and from contaminated land 
relief. Offsetting these beneﬁ ts there has 
been an additional tax charge due to costs 
that are not allowable for tax purposes, 
including certain transaction related costs. 
Dividend
At the half year, the Directors approved an 
increase in the interim dividend per share of 
10% from 10.34 pence per share to 11.38 
pence per share. 
The Directors propose a ﬁ nal dividend per 
share of 24.30 pence, a 17.5% increase on the 
2006 ﬁ nal dividend per share of 20.69 pence 
per share. This reﬂ ects our progressive 
dividend policy of reducing, over time, 
dividend cover towards around 2.5 times.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the Group increased by 
£1,371.1m to £2,911.0m. The increase in net 
assets is due to retained proﬁ ts and the 
shares issued in the year. Signiﬁ cant 
movements in the balance sheet are:
 The Group’s book value of land was 
£3,296.6m, an increase of £1,299.3m over 
2006, of which £1,098.6m, at fair value, is 
due to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden. 
The remaining increase reﬂ ects our 
continued strategy to invest in sufﬁ cient 
land to drive organic growth.
 Work in progress of the Group at 30 June  
2007 was £1,368.5m, an increase of 
£764.7m on 2006, of which £602.2m was 
due to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden. 
Against this, the Group had a strong 
forward sales position of £1,414m, which 
was 14.8% up on the combined Group at 
June 2006.

acquisition of land and efﬁ ciently manage our 
balance sheet, we are targeting a funding level 
of around 2.5 times net debt/earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(EBITDA).
At the year end, the Group’s committed 
facility had an average life of 3.5 years and 
headroom of £1,162.4m. £800m of the 
facilities arranged to ﬁ nance the Wilson 
Bowden acquisition was provided on a 364-

Report of the Directors
Report of the Directors
Disclosure of information to auditors 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (that is, information needed by the Company’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report) of which the Company’s auditors are not aware.
Each of the Directors have taken all the relevant steps that he ought to have taken in accordance with his duty as a Director to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of S234ZA of the Companies Act.
Charitable and political contributions 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £22,900 (2006: £10,000). Of the donations in the current year £11,500 was to Business 
in the Community and the remainder was to local and good causes. No political contributions were made during the year. 
Risk management objectives 
The Group’s operations and debt ﬁnancing expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most signiﬁcant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed 
system for the reporting and forecasting of cash ﬂows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly 
identiﬁed and appropriate actions taken by the central treasury department. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme 
that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its ﬁnancial performance in particular by using ﬁnancial instruments, including debt 
and derivatives, to ﬁx interest rates. The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting speciﬁc, clearly deﬁned guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group. A Treasury 
Operating Committee has been established which operates within speciﬁc parameters set by the Board and consists of any two of the Group 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. In addition, the Directors approve and review all facilities and derivative 
transactions that they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee. The Group operates a central treasury department to 
implement the guidelines established by the Board, to which it reports regularly. 
i) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term ﬁxed rate 
funding and medium-term ﬂoating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate ﬂexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. In 
order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash ﬂow risks relating to interest rate movements on a 
proportion of its debt. The Group has a policy that 60% - 80% of the forecasted debt for the year end is at a ﬁxed rate, with an average 
minimum duration of ﬁve years and an average maximum duration of ﬁfteen years.
ii) Credit risk
The Group has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers. The exposure 
to credit loss on cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables is equivalent to their balance sheet carrying value.
The Group has a credit policy that is limited to ﬁnancial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies. The 
Group only contracts derivative ﬁnancial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place. These 
agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The Company was exposed to £8.4m (2006: £8.4m) of credit risk in relation to ﬁnancial guarantees and the bank borrowings of subsidiary 
undertakings at the year end. 
iii) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has 
sufﬁcient available funds for operations. At 30 June 2007, the Group had committed facilities of £2,630.0m (2006: £400.0m) and total facilities of 
£2,786.3m (2006: £471.2m).
The Group’s objective is to minimise reﬁnancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed facilities and 
private placement notes is at least 3 years. At 30 June 2007, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.5 years.

Likely future developments 
An indication of likely future developments in the Group including in the ﬁeld of research and development is given in the Business review on 
pages 14 to 21.
Creditor payments 
Each Group company is responsible for agreeing the detail of terms and conditions relating to transactions with its suppliers. It is Group policy to 
abide by the agreed terms of payment with suppliers where the goods and services have been supplied in accordance with the relevant terms 
and conditions of contract. Implementation of this policy resulted in a supplier payment period by the Company of 32 days (2006: 39 days) for its 
trade creditors at 30 June 2007.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
As at the date of this report, qualifying third party indemnity provisions under Companies legislation are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, former Directors who held ofﬁce during the year ended 30 June 2007 and the Company Secretary of the 
Company, Directors and former Directors who held ofﬁce during the year ended 30 June 2007 of any member of the Group or of an associated 
company or afﬁliate company and members of the Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association against all liability arising in respect of any act or omission in their duties.
Investor relations
The Board believes that the effective management of investor relations is critical to its relationship with its shareholders and to the market in 
which the Company’s shares are held, analysed and traded. The Group’s corporate governance framework sets the context for its continuing 
investor relations programme particularly in respect of key areas such as board membership, remuneration and public accountability statements.
During the year we continued to develop the investor communication programme in conjunction with Weber Shandwick Square Mile our 
ﬁnancial PR advisors and the Group’s joint brokers, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and UBS Investment Bank. The ‘investor relations’ 
website (www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk) provides a full Company proﬁle, regular corporate news updates, access to the Company’s share 
price and regulatory announcements. Further shareholder services have been established whereby shareholders may deal in the Company’s 
shares via its website and also access the Company’s share register to view their shareholding, with the opportunity to make changes to their 
account details, including the downloading of appropriate forms and also access the history of their shareholding.
Our annual and interim reports, together with half-yearly trading updates, will continue to be the primary means by which information about the 
Group, its Board and its business is communicated to institutional and private shareholders, investors and analysts. In addition, other major 
company publications are available to shareholders on our investor relations website. The Annual General Meeting is used to enable all 
shareholders to discuss the Group’s operations and progress directly with the Board. 
Information of a price sensitive nature is communicated as required by the Company Secretary to the Company Announcements Ofﬁce of the 
London Stock Exchange and the Group strives to ensure that all key information is effectively and clearly communicated.
In addition to the above formal communications, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director meet regularly with institutional 
investors and analysts in order to convey an understanding of the Company’s operations, the market and its management objectives and in the 
year under review in excess of 70 such meetings have been held. The aim is to meet with major institutional shareholders at least once a year. 
Press releases on the Company’s activities are made to journalists and the media through the Group Press Ofﬁce and its external ﬁnancial 
public relations consultancy service, Weber Shandwick Square Mile. The Group’s joint brokers, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and 
UBS Investment Bank, also work actively on our behalf in an effort to ensure that investors and potential investors in the business are given 
reliable information on the Group’s operations, its values and ethos in order to make informed investment decisions.
The Group Finance Director presents regular reports to the Group Board on the Company’s investor relations activities to ensure that they have 
a clear understanding of the views of major shareholders.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
The Board believes that in terms of the overall direction and control of the Company effective corporate governance will come principally from the 
values, standards and disciplines it seeks to apply in dealings with shareholders, customers, staff, suppliers, contractors and other stakeholders. 
Many of the Company’s core values and standards are set out in a range of procedures and practice guidelines communicated throughout the 
Group. However, external governance codes set the framework for our internal standards and we therefore seek to comply with established best 
practice in all areas of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance with Code provisions 
The Company is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. Throughout the year ended 30 June 2007 the Company complied 
with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (‘the Code’) except in 
the following areas:
Code provision A.3.2. requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. 
At the start and the end of the year the Company achieved a balanced and independent Board as required by the Code. Due to the order in 
which Directors were appointed to, and retired from, the Board the Company did not maintain this balance, as required by the Code, between 
2 October 2006 and 8 January 2007.
Code provision B.2.1. requires the Remuneration Committee to consist of at least three members who should all be independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Mr C Toner, as Chairman of the Board, stepped down from membership of the Committee on 18 November 2005 and was re-elected 
a member on 11 May 2007 in preparation for the implementation of the Combined Code 2006, which will apply to the reporting period beginning 
1 July 2007, and which permits the Chairman to be a member of the Committee.
The Board 
The Company is led and controlled by the Group Board. The names and descriptions of the Group Board Directors are set out on pages 26 and 
27 of this report. 
At the end of the ﬁnancial year the Board comprised nine members, including the Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors and four Executive 
Directors. The Company therefore complies with the principles of the Code in relation to the balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and the number and calibre of Non-Executive Directors on the Board, together with their diverse backgrounds and experience, ensures that this 
principle is met. 
In accordance with best corporate governance practice, the Company’s Articles of Association require one-third of the current Directors to retire 
at each Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Mr M Pescod, Mr R J Davies and Mr W Shannon will all retire by rotation and put themselves 
forward for re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Articles.
Mr M Pescod has been a Non-Executive Director since October 2001 and, as a result and in compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance, his re-appointment as a Non-Executive Director has been subject to particularly rigorous review.
Following a formal evaluation process, the Company believes that the performance of each of the retiring Directors continues to be effective and 
they demonstrate commitment to their role.
The Board believes that the Chairman and all Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no business or other relationship 
with the Group that might inﬂuence their independence or judgement. 
The division of responsibility between the Chairman of the Board, Mr C G Toner, and the Group Chief Executive, Mr M S Clare, is clearly deﬁned 
and has been approved by the Board. The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. 
He is responsible for organising the business of the Board, for setting its agenda and for ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman facilitates the 
effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors and also ensures that the Board receives timely and accurate information so as to properly 
conduct its business as well as ensuring that communications with shareholders are effective. 
The Senior Independent Director has speciﬁc responsibility for co-ordinating the evaluation by the Nominations Committee of the Chairman’s 
effectiveness as well as being a point of contact for shareholders in the event of there being any material issues or concerns which the Chairman 
and/or Group Chief Executive have failed adequately to address. The current Senior Independent Director, Mr M Pescod, took over from 
MrAEKilburn on his retirement on 28 November 2006. Corporate Governance 33

Board process 
The Board has overall authority for the conduct of the business. During the year the terms of reference for the Board, including those matters 
speciﬁcally reserved to the Board, were reviewed and updated in line with best practice. The Board’s responsibilities include:

In January 2007, the Board met for a full day to review and develop the overall business strategy of the Group. 
In the week prior to each Board Meeting each Director is issued with an agenda, brieﬁng papers and comprehensive operating and ﬁnancial 
management reports for the period under review. The Company Secretary, a solicitor, attends all Board and Committee Meetings and all 
Directors have access to his advice and, if necessary, to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
The Board met nine times during the year, including two special meetings related to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden. Attendance at Board 
Meetings is shown in the table on page 35. Any Director who did not attend a meeting presented his apologies and provided his views to the 
Chairman ahead of the meeting having reviewed the reports and management information. 
Board Committees 
The Board has established four standing Committees, the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee. During the year the terms of reference for all the Committees were reviewed and updated in line with best practice and 
approved by the Board. Terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available on our corporate website. 
Membership and attendance of each Committee is shown in the table on page 35. Any Director who did not attend a meeting presented his 
apologies and provided his views to the Chairman ahead of the meeting having reviewed the reports and management information. 
Executive Committee
The Board delegates management of the business to the Executive Committee, which is led by the Group Chief Executive. In addition to the 
Directors identiﬁed in the table on page 35 and Mr L Dent, the Group Corporate Director and Company Secretary, the Executive Committee 
has been enhanced this year with the appointment of Mr N Richardson, Managing Director Wilson Bowden Developments, Mr P Law, Group 
Director of Corporate Affairs and Mrs J Mee, Group Human Resources Director. The Executive Committee’s principal responsibilities include:
• implementing all operational policy and strategy across the Group
• the preparation and development of the Group Three Year Plan, Annual Business Plan and Budget to achieve the Group’s objectives as 
determined by the Board
• monitoring the performance of the Group with particular emphasis on performance as measured against the Strategic Plan, Annual Business

The Audit Committee
All members of the Audit Committee are wholly independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with Code provision C.3.1. The Board is 
satisﬁed that at least one member of the Committee has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. 
The Committee invites the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and other members of senior management and senior 
representatives of the external auditors to attend meetings as required.
Under its terms of reference the Audit Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s performance, and

As well as carrying out the work associated with the annual ﬁnancial reporting cycle the Audit Committee completed signiﬁcant areas of work

consequence of the new Group structure following the acquisition of Wilson Bowden. The Audit Committee is currently reviewing 
recommendations for the appointment of the external auditor for the next year.
The Company’s Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, provided non-audit related services during the year related to the acquisition of Wilson

Board achievement, performance evaluation and training 
The procedure for appointment of new Directors to the Board is overseen by the Nominations Committee. All Directors joining the Board submit 
themselves for election at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment and a third of Directors retire each year and submit themselves 
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The names of the Directors subject to re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting are set out 
on page 32. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three year term and normally serve a second three year term subject to performance 
review and re-election. Beyond this a third three year term may be served subject to rigorous review. 
During the year a formal and structured process of evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was 
undertaken by the Nominations Committee under the leadership and direction of the Chairman, based on the guidance set out in the Higgs 
Report ‘Review of the Role and Effectiveness of Non-Executive Directors’. 
Central to the evaluation process are the Board’s annual review of business strategy and the objectives and performance targets set by the Board 
each year for itself, its Committees, for the Group Chief Executive, and through him for the Executive Team, against which overall performance is 
measured. In this way the evaluation is undertaken within clear parameters linked to overall strategy, operational and ﬁnancial performance and the 
role and contribution made by the Board, its Committees and individual Directors in the attainment of agreed objectives and targets.
The Board circulated to all Directors a comprehensive performance evaluation questionnaire through which all Directors and the Company 
Secretary were given the opportunity to give their views on the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, particularly by identifying any 
shortcomings in procedures, working methods or any other areas of weakness requiring attention and improvement. In addition, the performance 
of individual Non-Executive Directors and the Group Chief Executive was appraised by the Chairman and the performance of the Executive Team 
by the Group Chief Executive. The Senior Independent Director led the appraisal of the Chairman’s performance after obtaining the views of all 
Directors in one-to-one discussions.
The results of the questionnaires, system and proposals were reviewed and evaluated by the Nominations Committee and reported to the Board. 
On the evidence provided, the Board and its Committees are satisﬁed with the overall effectiveness and balance and with the performance and 
contribution of the individual Directors. As a result of the process the number of Board meetings has been increased to eight per year, a detailed 
and comprehensive shareholder relations and communication plan has been developed and steps are being taken to increase the amount of time 
available to focus on strategy.

Employment policy and involvement
The Board recognises that employees need to understand and contribute to the broad objectives of the business and seeks to develop good 
relations with employees through regular communications and consultation. Selection for employment and promotion is based on the objective 
assessment of ability and experience and the Group is committed to ensuring that its workplaces are free from unlawful discrimination of any 
sort. The Group strives to ensure that its policies and practices provide equal opportunities for all existing or potential staff irrespective of 
gender, race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. Every effort is made to retrain and 
support employees who become disabled while working with the Group.
The Group is committed to employee training and development at all levels of the organisation and endeavours to contribute to the industry’s 
future skills base by an extensive recruitment and training programme for apprentices and graduate trainees. This year the Group further 
developed its graduate recruitment and training programme designed to identify and promote the senior management of the future. 54 
graduates were selected and began their training across all areas of the business on 1 September 2007. 
This year the Group’s human resources team, who provide our divisional management teams with advice on how to deliver best practice in 
terms of employment procedure and Group human resources policies, has been strengthened with several senior appointments including a 
new Human Resources Director, Mrs J Mee and Head of Talent, Mr G Jones. The human resources team has also helped to deliver strategic 
programmes such as our new Performance Development Review and Management Development programmes.
The Group works closely with the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) and the National House-Building Council (NHBC) in training 
provision and a training plan is prepared annually linked to identiﬁed business priorities and objectives. Having regard to the nature of our 
business, particular focus is given in the training programme to construction management, trade skills, health and safety and customer care. 
We have also committed to the Construction Skills Certiﬁcation Scheme (CSCS) for our employees and subcontractors as part of the Major 
House Builders Group Qualiﬁed Workforce Initiative.
During the year the Group created a website called ‘Getting Together’ to provide employees with information on the integration of the Wilson 
Bowden business into the Barratt business. Employees also receive an electronic newsletter every two to three weeks with integration updates 
and have received a DVD explaining the Group’s recent achievements and future marketing strategy. 
The Group newsletter, ‘Developing Times’, which is published quarterly, is being revised to reﬂect the enlarged Group following the acquisition 
of Wilson Bowden, and will be distributed to all employees; and all employees joining the Group receive a full day corporate induction.
The integration of the Wilson Bowden business following its acquisition has been managed by an integration team that includes employees drawn 
from all areas of the business.
Reporting responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for:
• keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy the ﬁnancial position of the Company and Group at any time and 
from which ﬁnancial statements, and the Directors’ Remuneration Report, can be prepared to comply with the Companies Act 1985, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
• preparing ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial period which give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union and IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business
• taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and for the detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The responsibilities of the auditors in relation to the ﬁnancial statements are set out in the Independent auditors’ report (pages 89 and 90).
The Directors conﬁrm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently and that reasonable and prudent judgements 
and estimates have been made in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007.
The Annual Report and Accounts will be published on the Group’s Investor Relations website. The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s 
website is the responsibility of the Directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Going concern 
After making due enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board conﬁrms that it has maintained a system of internal control and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls 
in accordance with Code provisions C.2. and C.2.1. and that this statement has been prepared in accordance with the ‘Turnbull Guidance’ on 
internal control appended to the Code.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to manage risks 
that may impede the achievement of the Group’s business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks entirely. The system of internal control 
therefore provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal control does, 
however, provide reasonable assurance that potential difﬁculties can be identiﬁed promptly and appropriate remedial action taken.
It is the responsibility of the Executive Directors and senior management to implement and maintain the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems in accordance with policy approved by the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework are as follows:
• a clear organisational structure with deﬁned levels of authority and responsibility for each operating division.
• extensive ﬁnancial and management reporting systems under which ﬁnancial and operating performance is consistently reviewed against 
budget and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group level on a monthly basis.
• key risk areas such as land purchase, planning permission, production, sales, quality, customer care and service standards, adverse 
publicity, the market, corporate responsibility, environmental and health and safety performance and the integration of Barratt Developments 
PLC with Wilson Bowden are embedded in the Group’s monthly management reporting system so that risk identiﬁcation and the control of 
risk are a routine aspect of management responsibility.
• internal control and risk management systems are supported by the Group internal audit team which is responsible for advising senior 
management, the Executive Directors and, through the Audit Committee, the Board on the operation and effectiveness of those systems. 
The internal audit team undertakes a planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations approved by the Audit Committee, 
including full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas such as land viability process, land acquisition control and monitoring, 
work in progress and subcontractor payment controls. Material issues identiﬁed in these audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by 
the Executive Directors and by the Board on a quarterly basis, and necessary actions are taken to remedy any failings in the internal 
control system.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control in accordance with the ‘Turnbull Guidance’ and is satisﬁed that it is in 
accordance with that guidance.
During the year internal control and risk management has been enhanced by updating and embedding the risk register, implementing a process 
of control self certiﬁcation and appointing regional ﬁnance directors.

Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
The following description summarises certain provisions of the current Articles of Association (as adopted by special resolution on 17 November 
2005 (the ‘Articles’) of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Company’) and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 1985 
and the Companies Act 2006, together the ‘Companies Acts’)). This is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the Companies Acts or 
the Articles should be consulted if further information is required. Certain amendments will be proposed to the Articles at the Annual General 
Meeting on 27 November 2007, brief details of which are set out below. Further details are set out in the notice of the Annual General Meeting 
and copies of the Company’s current Articles of Association, together with copies marked up to show the proposed amendments are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce. 
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The shares are in registered form.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to applicable statutes and other shareholders’ rights, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make speciﬁc provision) as the Board (as deﬁned in the 
Articles) may decide. Subject to the Articles, the Companies Acts and other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares are at the disposal of the 
Board. At each Annual General Meeting the Company puts in place annual shareholder authority authorising the Company’s Directors to allot 
unissued shares, in certain circumstances for cash, in accordance with the guidelines of the Investor Protection Committees.
Voting
Subject to any rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, every member present in person at a general meeting or class meeting has, 
upon a show of hands, one vote. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, 
shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the other joint holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand 
in the register in respect of the joint holding. Under the Companies Acts members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their 
rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by that member. The Articles currently only entitle proxies to vote on a poll, whereas the Companies Acts now entitle proxies to vote 
on a show of hands. It is therefore proposed to amend the Articles at the Annual General Meeting on 27 November 2007 to reﬂect this change 
in legislation. A member that is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a general meeting or class meetings as 
a corporate representative. Where more than one corporate representative has been appointed, any one of them is entitled to vote and exercise 
other powers on behalf of the member at a general meeting or class meeting, but in the event that the representatives’ votes or other powers 
conﬂict, the power is treated by the Company as not having been exercised and the member will be deemed to have abstained from exercising 
its votes or powers.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of any shares held by him if any call or other sum then 
payable by him in respect of that share remains unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to 
vote if he has been served with a restriction notice (as deﬁned in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Deadlines for voting rights
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may be 
exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. Under the Companies Acts, the deadline for 
delivering proxy forms cannot be earlier than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the meeting for which the proxy is being appointed. 
The Articles however, provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board may 
determine) before the meeting (not excluding non-working days).
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends not exceeding 
the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends, and also any ﬁxed rate dividend, whenever the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justiﬁes its payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares with 
preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment of interim or ﬁxed dividends on other shares.

Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
Report of the Directors
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a person 
with a 0.25% interest (as deﬁned in the Articles) if such person has been served with a restriction notice (as deﬁned in the Articles) after failure to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Liquidation
Under the Articles on a liquidation, the liquidator may, with the sanction of an extraordinary (or special) resolution of the Company and any other 
sanction required by the Companies Acts, divide among the members (excluding any members holding shares as treasury shares) in kind all or 
part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not). It is proposed to amend the Articles at the 
Annual General Meeting on 27 November 2007 to remove this provision as it is a reﬂection of applicable legislation and contains references to 
extraordinary resolutions, which is a concept not being retained in the Companies Acts. 
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Acts, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury 
shares), or with the sanction of an extraordinary (or special) resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. 
At every such separate general meeting (except an adjourned meeting) the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy not 
less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares). The rights 
conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed 
to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. However, because of the reference to extraordinary 
resolutions, which is a concept not being retained in the Companies Acts, and since the proceedings and speciﬁc quorum requirements for 
meetings convened to vary class rights are contained in the Companies Acts, it is proposed to amend the Articles at the Annual General 
Meeting on 27 November 2007 to remove these provisions from the Articles.
Transfer of shares
Any shares in the Company may be held in uncertiﬁcated form and, subject to the Articles, title to uncertiﬁcated shares may be transferred by 
means of a relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply to any uncertiﬁcated shares to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent 
with the holding of shares in uncertiﬁcated form or with the transfer of shares by means of a relevant system. Registration of a transfer of an 
uncertiﬁcated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations (as deﬁned in the Articles) and 
where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the uncertiﬁcated share is to be transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his certiﬁcated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any 
other form which the Board may approve. The instrument of transfer must be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a 
partly-paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into the register.
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid 
share. The Board may also decline to register a transfer of a certiﬁcated share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped or certiﬁed or 
otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share certiﬁcate and such 
other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one class of share; and (iii) if joint transferees, 
is in favour of not more than four such transferees.
The Board may decline to register a transfer of any of the Company’s certiﬁcated shares by a person with a 0.25% interest (as deﬁned in the 
Articles) if such a person has been served with a restriction notice (as deﬁned in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts, unless the transfer is shown to the Board 
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale (as deﬁned in the Articles).
Repurchase of shares
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Acts. Any 
shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of 
the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share capital. The Company currently has authority to buy back up to 
24,315,195 ordinary shares during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 
10 pence and the maximum price payable is an amount equal to the higher of: (i) 105% of the average of the closing middle market quotations 
for an ordinary share (as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ofﬁcial List) for the ﬁve immediately preceding business days; and (ii) 
the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange at the time the 
purchase is carried out.

Report of the Directors
Amendment of Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of the Company may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts by way of special 
resolution. A resolution will be put to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 27 November 2007 to amend the Articles. The proposed 
changes to the Articles derive from the Companies Act 2006 with the exception of the proposed amendment regarding retirement of Directors 
at the age of 70, which derives from the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. The Companies Act 2006 was enacted on 8 November 
2006 and is being implemented in stages. Since a number of signiﬁcant changes arising from the Companies Act 2006 will not come into force 
until October 2008, the Company has decided at this stage to make only a small number of changes to the Articles to reﬂect some of the more 
permissive provisions of the Act which will already be in force when this year’s Annual General Meeting is held. Details of the speciﬁc changes 
being proposed are set out in full in the explanatory notes to the separate notice convening the Annual General Meeting.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors shall be no less than two and no more than ﬁfteen in number. Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by 
the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds ofﬁce only until the next following Annual General Meeting and is then eligible for election by 
the shareholders but is not taken into account in determining the Directors or the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 
The Board may from time to time appoint one or more Directors to hold employment or executive ofﬁce for such period (subject to the Companies 
Acts) and on such terms as they may determine and may revoke or terminate any such appointment. Currently, under the Articles, no person is 
capable of being appointed a Director if at the time of his appointment he has attained the age of 70 years and any Director is required to vacate 
ofﬁce at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting commencing after he attains the age of 70 years. However, the age limit of 70 years is no longer 
appropriate following the enactment of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 and the repeal of section 293 Companies Act 2006, which 
took effect on 6 April 2007. Therefore the amendments to the Articles to be put to the 2007 Annual General Meeting will remove this requirement. 
At every Annual General Meeting of the Company, a minimum of one-third of the Directors shall retire by rotation. The Directors to retire by 
rotation shall be those who held ofﬁce at the time of the two preceding Annual General Meetings and who did not retire at either of them. 
If the number so retiring is less than the minimum number of Directors required to retire, additional Directors up to that number shall also retire. 
The additional Directors to retire shall be those who have been longest in ofﬁce or, in the case of those who were appointed or reappointed 
on the same date, shall be determined by lot. Any Director who has held ofﬁce for a continuous period of nine years or more shall also retire. 
The Company may by special resolution remove any Director before the expiration of his term of ofﬁce. The ofﬁce of Director shall be vacated if: 
(i) he resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is requested by all of the other Directors and all of 
the other Directors are not less than three in number; (iii) he is or has been suffering from mental ill health; (iv) he is absent without permission of 
the Board from meetings of the Board for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his ofﬁce is vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or 
compounds with his creditors generally; (vi) he is prohibited by law from being a Director; (vii) he ceases to be Director by virtue of the 
Companies Acts; or (viii) he is removed from ofﬁce pursuant to the Articles.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum of Association, the Articles, the Companies Acts and any directions given by special resolution, the 
business of the Company will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to the management 
of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage 
or charge any of its undertaking, property, assets and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities and to give security for any 
debt, liability or obligation of the Company to any third party.
Shares held in the EBT
The Trustees of the Barratt Developments Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) may vote or abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way 
they think ﬁt and in doing so may take into account both ﬁnancial and non ﬁnancial interests of the beneﬁciaries of the EBT or their dependents.
Signiﬁcant agreements
The following signiﬁcant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a 
change of control of the Company:
• under the £2,150,000,000 credit facilities agreement dated 5 February 2007 (as amended) and the £400,000,000 revolving credit facility 
agreement dated 2 February 2005 (as amended) between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds TSB Bank Plc (as the facility agent) and 
the banks and ﬁnancial institutions named therein as lenders (together, the ‘Credit Facilities’), the facility agent must, upon a change of 
control, cancel the total commitments of the lenders under such Credit Facilities and declare all outstanding credits, together with accrued

interest and any other amounts payable in respect of such Credit Facilities, to be immediately due and payable. For these purposes, a 
‘change of control’ occurs if any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the Company.
• under the privately-placed notes amounting in aggregate to $200,000,000 (the ‘Dollar Notes’) issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement 
dated 23 August 2007 by the Company to various institutions, the holders of Dollar Notes have an option to require the Company to prepay 
the entire unpaid principal amount of Dollar Notes held by each holder (at par), together with interest accrued thereon.
• under the privately-placed notes amounting in aggregate to £80,000,000 (the ‘Sterling Notes’) issued pursuant to note purchase agreements 
dated 23 August 2007 and 29 August 2007 to various institutions, the holders of Sterling Notes have an option to require the Company to 
prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of Sterling Notes held by each holder (at par), together with interest accrued thereon and a ‘make-
whole’ amount in respect of any repayment occurring during an interest period. 
Under the terms of the note purchase agreements in respect of the Dollar Notes and the Sterling Notes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if any 
person or group of persons acting in concert acquires beneﬁcial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of the Company 
carrying voting rights.

Report of the Directors
Introduction
This year’s Remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and in so doing has reafﬁrmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual 
performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for:
• executive remuneration policy
• determining the service conditions and remuneration of all Executive Directors
• the evaluation of Executive Director performance with regard to the award of share options, annual bonus and other performance based 
remuneration
• obtaining independent professional advice in relation to Executive Director remuneration
Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
Membership and attendance of the Remuneration Committee is described on page 35 of the Report of the Directors. All Committee members are 
considered to be wholly independent with no ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee’s decisions. The Group Chief 
Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered. 
The Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The Committee recognises its accountability on 
executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors. In determining future 
remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders’ vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report. 
Advice
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a solicitor and Mrs J Mee, the Group Human 
Resources Director. Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee. In addition, Hay Group were appointed by the Committee to advise on a 
range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Group’s executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other 
housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow, George Wimpey and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, 
were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy 
Each year the Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice 
and market trends. There have been a number of important changes within the Group during the year under review. These changes include the 
appointment of a new Group Chief Executive, the retirement of a number of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, a signiﬁcant acquisition and 
the inclusion of the Group in the FTSE 100 index. In light of these changes following the review a number of changes in practice have been 
adopted which are described in this Remuneration report. Although there have been some changes in the structure of executive remuneration the 
underlying principles remain the same, namely the Committee believes that executive remuneration:
• is fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders
• rewards the sustained growth and proﬁtability of the business
• conforms with market-leading best practice
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and proﬁtability of our business is determined in no short 
measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team. The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other 
service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of the highest calibre within the industry’s highly competitive 
employment market. Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles:
• the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets; currently over 50% 
of the total executive remuneration package is performance based

Report of the Directors
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
• performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets 
based on measures of shareholder return
• total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector
The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
• basic salary
• annual performance related bonus
• long-term share incentives
• pension and other beneﬁts
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding pension 
beneﬁts. The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all 
Executive Directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a ﬁxed annual sum payable monthly in cash. Salaries are set having regard to individual 
responsibilities, skills and experience and to competitive market practice. As part of the review carried out the Committee looked at the 
market rate for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies, and also, for the ﬁrst time, for companies ranked 51-100 in the 
FTSE index. It is felt that this provides a broader perspective on pay, although the primary comparator group remains the housebuilding 
companies. The changes to salary agreed by the Committee reﬂect a signiﬁcant increase in accountabilities for each position. Salary 
increases take effect from 1 July 2007 and details are shown in the table below. 
1 July 2007 1 July 2006
£ per annum £ per annum
Mr M S Clare 630,000 –
Mr S J Boyes 350,000 309,000
Mr C Fenton 350,000 309,000
Mr M A Pain 350,000 309,000
Annual proﬁt related bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding ﬁnancial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set 
annually by the Board. For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary. The maximum amount of 
bonus which can be received by any executive is 180% of basic salary, for the attainment of 125% of target. Previously there was no cap to 
the bonus payment. If actual performance falls below 80% of target then no bonus will be payable. Payment of the bonus is on a progressive 
scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target. With effect from 1 July 2007 the minimum target 
below which no bonus is payable was raised to 90% and the maximum target was reduced to 110%. 
Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral. The deferred 
amounts will be converted into shares, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received if further performance targets are 
met. These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan, as detailed on page 44.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable. 
Share option plan 
In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The grant of share options under the Plan is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options 
must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years. The 
exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration 
Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial years should exceed 
the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and 
since 1999. 44
Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance condition and for options granted after 1 July 2004 the 
three consecutive ﬁnancial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will commence with the ﬁnancial year during which 
the options are granted. If the target is not met over this ﬁxed three year period, then options will lapse. There will be no retesting of performance.
No options have been granted under the Plan during this ﬁnancial year. Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged 
and details of the terms of these outstanding awards are set out below.
Long-Term Performance Plan 
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take 
effect from 1 July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary 
with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth and 50% based on Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). For awards made in 2003 and 2004 a vesting schedule has been established so that, in terms of EPS growth, the full 
50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) plus 45% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 30% with straight 
line vesting between these two points. The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 
Construction and Building Materials Sector Index. Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in 
the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two 
points. 
Shareholders approved a change to these performance conditions at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, and for awards made in 2006 and 
thereafter the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 18% and 10% will 
vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the award will vest on a straight line basis.
For the TSR portion of the award a peer group will be formed comprising listed housebuilders. A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an 
average of the two highest and two lowest TSR ﬁgures for such companies over the performance period and creating a mid-point and an upper 
quartile from those two ﬁgures. The full 50% will vest if the Company’s TSR is within the upper quartile and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark; 
for performance in between, the award will vest on a straight line basis.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed these targets in the light of current circumstances and has agreed a change to the comparator group 
for the portion of the award based on TSR. The rationale for this is twofold: the decrease in the number of listed housebuilding companies which 
are appropriate comparators; and the Group’s inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. For awards made during 2007 and thereafter the comparator 
group will comprise those companies ranked 51-100 in the FTSE index. The Committee believes that this will more closely align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee also considered whether the comparator group used for the TSR portion of awards made in 2005 and 2006 remains a robust 
measure of the Group’s performance, given that the comparator group now comprises only eight companies. It concluded that the measure 
remains robust, but it will continue to review this decision during the life of these awards.
Pension beneﬁts 
Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are members of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants. 
The scheme entitles Mr S J Boyes to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of ﬁnal pensionable salary after 40 years membership of 
the scheme. The Executive Directors are also eligible for dependants’ pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on 
death in service. The ﬁnal pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last 
ten years of service.
The entitlement of Mr C Fenton is restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006. 
Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make changes to the existing 
pension provision. With effect from 1 July 2006 all Executive Directors will have a choice of remaining in the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme as 
described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary. This choice is at the 
discretion of the individual Executive Directors.

Report of the Directors
In lieu of membership of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme Mr M S Clare receives a cash supplement equal to 30% of base salary per annum, and 
MrMAPain receives a cash supplement equal to 25% of base salary per annum. These cash allowances are in line with competitive market practice.
Service contracts 
All Executive Directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated by twelve months notice 
given by the Company or by twelve months notice given by the Executive at any time. There are no speciﬁc provisions for compensation on 
early termination. The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership of a private health care scheme.

Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the recommendation of a Committee of Executive Directors and having 
regard to published data for the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors in listed companies. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the 
Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and having regard to published data for the remuneration of non-executive 
chairmen in listed companies.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are appointed under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts and their appointments can be terminated (by the Board) at any time without notice and without compensation for loss of ofﬁce. 
Under governance policies approved by the Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three year term and usually serve a second 
three year term subject to performance review and re-election. Beyond this a third three year term may be served subject to rigorous review. 
The Articles of Association will be amended at the next Annual General Meeting to remove the maximum upper age limit of 70 years which 
applies to all Directors.

Total Shareholder Return performance graph 
The following graph prepared in accordance with the Regulations shows the Group Total Shareholder Return ‘TSR’ performance over the last ﬁve 
years against the FTSE 250 and a comparator index of listed housebuilders. From 1 July 2007 the Comparator Group has consisted of a peer 
group of listed housebuilders comprising Barratt Developments, Bovis Homes Group, Bellway, Crest Nicholson, Berkeley Group, George Wimpey, 
McCarthy and Stone, Taylor Woodrow, Persimmon, Wilson Bowden and Redrow. The Comparator Group in the TSR graph below was the peer 
group for all ﬁve years. Prior to 1 July 2007 the Comparator Group was the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index. The Board has 
chosen these comparator indices as the Group and its major competitors are constituents of one or both of these indices.
 Executive Directors Shareholding Guidelines
The following Shareholding Guidelines apply to Executive Directors:
• within ﬁve years of ﬁrst appointment Executive Directors are expected to hold throughout their period of ofﬁce ordinary shares in the Company 
equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary, pro-rata holdings are required to be held in this ﬁrst ﬁve year period
• for the purposes of determining the requisite level of each Executive Director’s shareholding relative to basic salary, the share price shall be that 
prevailing on 30 June in each year
• provided Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares they shall be at liberty to sell shares so as to realise their Long-Term 
Performance awards or in the exercise of share options subject to the normal Listing Rule requirements for director shareholdings
• Executive Directors have until 31 January in each accounting period to increase their shareholding to the appropriate level

Mr D A Pretty left service on 31 December 2006 and started to draw his pension on 6 April 2007, and in addition to the pension shown received 
a lump sum of £196,830. The pension at 30 June 2007 reﬂects the fact that because retirement was before normal retirement age a reduction 
was applied.
Mr G K Hester’s membership of the pension scheme ended on 30 June 2006.
Directors’ own contributions have been deducted from the change in the GN11 transfer value over 2006/07.
The ﬁgures do not take account of any retained beneﬁts of the members.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the Director would receive if he retired at the end of the year. The Listing Rules require this 
to be disclosed excluding inﬂation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued beneﬁt at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values 
of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on 
transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’ pension beneﬁts. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, 
therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of available for sale ﬁnancial 
assets, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and share-based payments. 
A summary of the more signiﬁcant Group accounting policies is set 
out below.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although 
these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of 
the amounts, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ 
from those estimates. The most signiﬁcant estimates made by 
the Directors in these ﬁnancial statements are set out in ‘Critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements include the results of the holding 
company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June. 
The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated 
from the date when control passes to the Group using the purchase 
method of accounting and up to the date control ceases. All 
transactions with subsidiaries and inter-company proﬁts or losses 
are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
All of the subsidiary’s identiﬁable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded 
at their fair values. All changes to those assets and liabilities, 
and the resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has 
gained control of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition 
income statement.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds 
an interest with one or more other parties where a contractual 
arrangement has established joint control over the entity. Jointly 
controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its 
housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s 
share of proﬁts and losses from its investments in such jointly 
controlled operations are accounted for on a direct basis and are 
included in the consolidated income statement. The Group’s share 
of its investments’ assets and liabilities is accounted for on a directly 
proportional basis in the consolidated balance sheet.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total 
proceeds of building and development and an appropriate proportion 
of revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of contract activity. The sale proceeds of part 
exchange houses are not included in revenue.
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where 
the outcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of 
work performed to date. Contracts are only treated as construction 
contracts when they have been speciﬁcally negotiated for the 
construction of a development or property.
Restructuring costs
The acquisition of Wilson Bowden has led to signiﬁcant restructuring 
costs, including redundancy payments. The Group has classiﬁed 
these as a separate line in the income statement as they are material 
and it does not consider them to be a part of trading performance 
but rather an investment in the future of the business. These costs 
are recognised when the Group has a detailed plan that has been 
communicated to the affected parties. A liability is accrued for 
unsettled restructuring costs.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements at the 
time that they are paid, and ﬁnal dividends are recognised at the time 
of agreement by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Segmental reporting
Following the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, the Group consists 
of two separate segments for management reporting and control 
purposes, being housebuilding and commercial development. The 
Group manages these segments separately due to the different 
operational and commercial risks that they face. These segments 
therefore comprise the primary reporting segments within the 
ﬁnancial statements. As all of the Group’s operations are within the 
United Kingdom, which is one economic environment in the context 
of the Group’s activities, there are no geographic segments to 
be disclosed.  54

Financial statements
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the separately 
identiﬁable net assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 
businesses is capitalised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the cash-generating units of the Group at acquisition. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment at least annually. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has 
capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. 
Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash ﬂows. 
Where a brand is considered to have a ﬁnite life, it is amortised over 
its useful life on a straight line basis. Where a brand is capitalised 
with an indeﬁnite life, it is not amortised. The factors that result in 
the durability of brands capitalised is that there are no material legal, 
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that 
limit the useful life of these intangible assets. 
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indeﬁnite life 
brands by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount 
factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost 
of capital.
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less 
any provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of 
subsidiary undertakings, by the parent company, they are treated as 
a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment 
in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of 
the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over 
their estimated useful lives. Residual values and asset lives are 
reviewed annually.
| Accounting policies
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 
25 years. Plant is depreciated on a straight line basis over its 
expected useful life, which ranges from one to seven years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour cost and those 
overheads, which have been incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition.
Land held for development, including land in the course of 
development, is initially recorded at fair value. Where, through 
deferred purchase credit terms, the fair value differs from the amount 
that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is 
charged as a ﬁnance cost in the income statement over the period of 
settlement. Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group 
has to allocate site-wide development costs between units built in 
the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs 
to complete on such developments. In making these assessments 
there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed 
internal controls to assess and review carrying values and the 
appropriateness of estimates made.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties 
following the completion of constructed developments until the date 
of the sale of the development to third parties. Rental income from 
these operating leases is recognised in the income statement on 
a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to 
the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised in the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value is expensed in the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 55

Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the proﬁt for the year. Taxable 
proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in 
the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Pensions
Deﬁned contribution
The Group operates deﬁned contribution pension schemes for certain 
employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged 
against proﬁts in the year in which the contributions are made.
Deﬁned beneﬁt
The assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme are measured at 
fair value. The liabilities of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme are 
measured on an actuarial basis and discounted to present value. The 
net obligation is calculated by a qualiﬁed independent actuary and is 
recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
The Group uses a corridor approach when accounting for actuarial 
gains and losses. The corridor used is the greater of:
• 10% of the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the 
end of the previous year; or
• 10% of the fair value of plan assets at the end of the previous year.
The amount recognised in the income statement is the excess of 
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses over the corridor spread over 
the expected average working lives of members of the scheme.
The operating and ﬁnancing costs of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial 
liabilities approximate to fair value. 
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets
These ﬁnancial assets are initially recognised at the transaction price, 
and subsequently measured at each balance sheet date at fair value, 
with movements in the fair value of the assets being recognised 
directly in equity.
On disposal of these ﬁnancial assets the difference between 
the carrying value and the consideration received (including any 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity) is 
included in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in 
trade receivables and stated at cost plus attributable proﬁt less any 
foreseeable losses. Payments received on account for construction 
contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable 
on construction contracts. 
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are 
stated at amortised cost. 
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, 
are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset 
to which they relate. The discount to nominal value, which will be 
paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over 
the period of the credit term and charged to ﬁnance costs using the 
‘effective interest rate’ method.
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction 
contracts are included in trade payables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and balances in 
bank accounts with no notice or less than three months notice 
from inception.
| Accounting policies 56
Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Financial statements
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right to offset in hand 
and overdraft balances, and the Group intends to net settle the 
outstanding position, the offset arrangements are applied to record 
the net position in the balance sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method in the income statement.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – swaps
The Group has entered into derivative transactions in the form of 
swap arrangements to manage the interest rate risk arising from the 
Group’s operations and its sources of ﬁnance. The use of ﬁnancial 
derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the 
Board of Directors as detailed in note 23 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The swap arrangements are designated as a hedge against changes 
in future cash ﬂows as a result of interest rate movements. To the 
extent that these hedges are effective, gains and losses on the fair 
value of these swap arrangements are taken to reserves until realised. 
On realisation such gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement. To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and 
losses on the fair value of these swap arrangements are recognised in 
the income statement.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as 
to match with related costs that they are intended to compensate. 
Grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of 
the asset. Grants related to income are deducted from the related 
expense in the income statement.

Financial statements
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements there are 
a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have 
been published. All of these have been endorsed by the EU with 
the exception of IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’, IFRIC12 ‘Service 
Concession Arrangements’, IFRIC13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ 
and IFRIC14 – IAS19 – ‘The limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ and are therefore 
mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2007 and later periods. The Group has not early adopted any 
standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to 
impact upon the Group are: 
• IFRS7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. IFRS7 introduces 
new disclosures on quantitative and qualitative risks arising from 
ﬁnancial instruments. This standard will apply to the Group from 
the annual period commencing 1 July 2007 and is expected to 
impact upon the Group by requiring additional disclosures in the 
annual ﬁnancial statements.
• IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS8 amends the current 
segmental reporting requirements of IAS14 and requires a 
‘management approach’ to be adopted so that segment 
information is presented on the same basis as that used for 
internal reporting purposes. This standard will apply to the Group 
from the annual period commencing 1 July 2009 and is expected 
to impact upon the Group by requiring additional disclosures in the 
annual ﬁnancial statements.
• Amendment to IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements Capital 
Disclosures’. This amendment introduces new disclosures about 
an entity’s management of its capital resources. This amendment 
will apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 
1 July 2007 and is expected to impact upon the Group by 
requiring additional disclosures in the annual ﬁnancial statements.
• Amendment to IAS23 ‘Borrowing Costs’. This amendment 
requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset 
as part of the cost of the asset. A qualifying asset is one that 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. 
The option of immediately expensing these borrowing costs is 
removed. This amendment will apply to the Group from the annual 
period commencing 1 July 2009 and its impact is currently being 
assessed. 
• IFRIC14 – IAS19 – ‘The limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction’. IFRIC14 states when 
refunds or reductions in future contributions can be treated as 
available under IAS19 and how a minimum funding requirement 
affects future contributions or may give rise to a liability. This 
interpretation will apply to the Group from the annual period 
commencing 1 July 2008 and its impact is currently being 
assessed. 
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and 
interpretations are not expected to have any material impact on the 
ﬁnancial statements of the Group:
• IFRIC10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’. IFRIC10 
prohibits the reversal of impairment losses recognised in previous 
interim periods on goodwill, investments in equity instruments or 
ﬁnancial assets.
• IFRIC11 ‘IFRS2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’. 
IFRIC11 requires all share-based payment transactions for which 
services are received in exchange for shares in the company to 
be treated as equity-settled. It also requires that where the parent 
grants share-based payment transactions to the employees of a 
subsidiary that they be treated as equity-settled, whereas if the 
subsidiary grants shares to its employees the transactions are 
treated as cash-settled. This interpretation will apply to the Group 
from 1 July 2007.
• IFRIC12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’. IFRIC12 provides 
guidance upon the accounting for public-to-private infrastructure 
service concession arrangements. This interpretation will apply to 
the Group from 1 July 2008.
• IFRIC13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’. IFRIC13 requires 
the credits given as part of customer loyalty schemes to be 
recognised at their fair value as a separate component of revenue. 
The revenue related to these schemes should only be recognised 
when the entity’s obligations are fulﬁlled. This interpretation will 
apply to the Group from 1 July 2008.

Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Financial statements
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed 
below the critical accounting judgements made in, and the key 
sources of estimation uncertainty within these ﬁnancial statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a signiﬁcant impact upon the ﬁnancial 
statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt 
with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are discussed below.
Carrying value of land and work in progress
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and property 
development. Due to the nature of this activity, much of the 
development entered into by the Group is speculative in nature. 
Accordingly, the Group has in its balance sheet at 30 June 2007 
current assets that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s 
internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the 
carrying value of land and work in progress is less than the lower of 
cost or net realisable value.
Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the proﬁt that the Group is able to recognise 
on its developments in a speciﬁc period, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current 
year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete 
on such developments. In making these assessments there is a 
degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal 
controls to assess and review carrying values and appropriateness of 
estimates made.
Recognition of proﬁt where developments are accounted for under 
IAS11 ‘Construction Contracts’
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when 
recognising revenue and proﬁt on partially completed contracts. The 
application of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect 
of the total expected costs to complete each relevant contract. 
The Group has in place established internal control processes to 
ensure that the evaluation of costs and revenues are based upon 
appropriate estimates. 
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of the impairment of goodwill requires an 
estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated as deﬁned in note 10. The value-in-use 
calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ﬂows expected 
from these cash-generating units including the anticipated growth 
rate of revenue and costs and requires the determination of a suitable 
discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash ﬂows. The 
carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £816.7m 
with no impairment recognised during the year ended 30 June 2007.
Impairment of brands
The determination of the impairment calculation for indeﬁnite life 
brands requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the brands as 
deﬁned in note 11. The value-in-use calculation requires an estimate 
of the future cash ﬂows expected from these brands including 
the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs and requires the 
determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value 
of the cash ﬂows. The carrying amount of indeﬁnite life brands at the 
balance sheet date was £100.0m with no impairment recognised 
during the year ended 30 June 2007.
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
The Directors engage a qualiﬁed independent actuary to calculate the 
Group’s liability in respect of its deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. In 
calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be 
made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, 
price inﬂation, the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets and 
mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from 
those assumed, the pension liability may differ from that included in 
these ﬁnancial statements. 
Hedge accounting
The Group has a gearing target of around 2.5 times net debt/earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). The 
gearing target supports the land spend activity and the Wilson 
Bowden acquisition.
The majority of the Group’s facilities are ﬂoating rate, which exposes 
the Group to increased interest rate risk. The Group has therefore 
taken out £860.0m (note 22) of ﬂoating to ﬁxed interest rate swaps. 
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the 
basis that it is highly probable that there is sufﬁcient forecasted 
debt to match with the period of the swaps. If the highly probable 
criteria was not met in future then any changes in fair value of the 
swaps would be recognised in the income statements, rather than 
in reserves. At 30 June 2007, there is a gain of £12.3m (2006: £nil) 
included in reserves related to these swaps.

6. Tax (continued)
In addition to the amount charged/(credited) to the income statement, deferred tax of £2.5m (2006: £1.3m credit) was charged directly to equity 
(note 16) and corporation tax of £3.3m (2006: £nil) was credited directly to equity.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The tax assessed for the year is lower (2006: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30.0% (2006: 30.0%). The differences 
are explained below:
2007 2006
£m £m
Proﬁt before tax 427.8 391.4
Proﬁt before tax multiplied by rate of corporation tax of 30.0% (2006: 30.0%)  128.3 117 .4
Effects of:
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.7 (0.2)
Additional tax relief for land remediation costs (1.7) (1.6)
Adjustment in respect of previous years – 0.8
Impact of change in rate on future deferred tax balances  (1.9) –
127.4 116.4
The impact of the changes introduced in the Finance Act 2007 regarding Industrial Buildings Allowances and impact of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate from April 2008 to 28% has been to reduce the Group’s tax charge by £1.9m in the year due to the reduction in deferred 
tax provided.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £300.4m (2006: £275.0m) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust which are treated as 
cancelled, which were 258.6m (2006: 238.5m).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £300.4m (2006: £275.0m) by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start 
of the year, giving a ﬁgure of 262.8m (2006: 242.8m).
The earnings per share from continuing operations were as follows:

The goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of Wilson Bowden on 26 April 2007. Goodwill of £792.2m has been allocated to the 
housebuilding segment and £24.5m has been allocated to the commercial development segment. The goodwill balance has been allocated to 
both segments as it is attributable to:
• the highly complementary geographical ﬁt, which will enable the Group to deliver synergies from the rationalisation of the number of operational 
divisions and consolidation of the central functions
• the acquisition of the skills and experience within the workforce of Wilson Bowden
• an increased consented land bank enabling increased operational ﬂexibility
• increased access to commercial and mixed-use developments
• access to an expanded portfolio of strategic land and the associated skills within the Wilson Bowden strategic land team
An impairment review was performed at 30 June 2007 comparing the value-in-use of the housebuilding and commercial development 
segments with the carrying value of their assets and allocated goodwill. The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future 
cash ﬂows of the housebuilding and commercial development segments. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those 
regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and expected changes in site costs to complete. The 
Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate 
to the housebuilding and commercial development businesses and therefore the discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be 
appropriate is a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 12.0%. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based upon past experience 
and expectations of future changes in the market. 
As a result of this review no impairment was recorded.

11. Intangible assets (continued)
The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the 
Directors consider that this has an indeﬁnite life. The Directors consider that this brand has an indeﬁnite life due to the fact that the Group intends 
to hold and support the brand for an indeﬁnite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so. The brand of Wilson Bowden 
Developments valued at £7.0m is being amortised over ten years as it is a business to business brand operating in niche markets.
The Group tests indeﬁnite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts are determined using value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding 
the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and expected changes in site costs to complete. The Directors 
estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the 
housebuilding and commercial development businesses and therefore the discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is 
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 12.0%. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based upon past experience and expectations of 
future changes in the market.
As a result of this review no impairment was recorded.

Available for sale ﬁnancial assets principally comprise interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a legal 
charge over the respective property. These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash ﬂows taking into account the estimated 
market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment. The movement in fair value during the year that has been recognised in equity 
is shown in note 27.
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets are non-interest bearing, and the Group has no concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a 
number of customers and the amounts secured over a number of freehold and leasehold properties.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of the available for sale ﬁnancial assets is equivalent to their fair value as the time value of money 
is taken into account when calculating their carrying value.

All deferred tax relates to the United Kingdom and is stated on a net basis as the Group has a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised 
amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. Gross deferred tax assets and liabilities are:

In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of £1.8m (2006: £nil) in respect of capital and other losses that are not 
considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The impact of the changes introduced in the Finance Act 2007 regarding Industrial Buildings Allowances and impact of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate from April 2008 to 28% has been to reduce the Group’s tax charge by £1.9m in the year due to the reduction in deferred tax 
provided. 
The effect of the changes to be enacted in the Finance Act 2008 would be to increase the deferred tax liability provided at 30 June 2007 by 
approximately £0.8m. The increase in the deferred tax liability would decrease the proﬁt after tax in the income statement by £0.8m. This 
increase in the deferred tax liability is due to the phasing out of Industrial Building Allowances from 2007 onwards.

4,769.6 2,644.4
The Directors consider all inventories to be current in nature. The operational cycle is such that a signiﬁcant proportion of inventories will not be 
realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when speciﬁc inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a 
number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
The value of inventories expensed in 2007 and included in cost of sales was £2,354.4m (2006: £1,740.7m). 
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2007 was £3.5m (2006: £nil).
The value of inventories recognised as an expense in the year was reduced by the reversal of £1.4m (2006: £nil) that was written down in a 
previous accounting period. The reversals arose mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land and other interests that had been 
previously written down to net realisable value.

customers. 
The carrying values of trade and other receivables are stated after an allowance for doubtful receivables of £3.7m (2006: £nil) has been made. 
The allowance has been estimated by the Directors based upon either speciﬁc knowledge or past experience of their assessment of the current

Total payables include £116.0m (2006: £76.1m) secured by legal charges on certain assets.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of the trade and other payables included in current liabilities approximates to fair value as a result 
of the short maturity period of the amounts as at the year end. 
Trade payables included in non-current liabilities are carried at their discounted present value of expected future cash ﬂows using the effective 
interest rate method. The effective interest rate used in the calculation is 5.25% (2006: 5.25%). The Directors therefore consider that the carrying 
value of these liabilities approximates to fair value.

ii) Fixed rate sterling private placement notes
The Group has ﬁxed rate sterling private placement notes (‘Notes’) which were valued at their current value at the date of acquisition 
of Wilson Bowden, as follows:
• A £30.0m Note (2006: £nil) with a current value of £30.2m that expires in April 2009 and is subject to a ﬁxed rate coupon 
of 6.98%.
• A £10.0m Note (2006: £nil) with a current value of £10.0m that expires in April 2009 and is subject to a ﬁxed rate coupon of 6.84%.
• A £20.0m Note (2006: £nil) with a current value of £20.9m that expires in October 2010 and is subject to a ﬁxed rate coupon

of 7.86%.
The Group can elect at any time to prepay an amount not less than 25% of the outstanding ﬁxed rate sterling private placement notes together 
with a make-whole premium calculated by reference to the difference between the interest rate applicable for the loans and market yields at the 
date of repayment.
Interest on all ﬁxed rate sterling private placement notes is payable half yearly in arrears.

subject to ﬂoating interest rates linked to bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates as applicable.
All debt is unsecured.
b) Net debt
Net debt is deﬁned as cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and interest bearing borrowings.

Total  1,456.6 1,456.6 49.1 49.1
Floating interest rates on sterling borrowings are linked to money market rates, LIBOR and bank rate. The ﬂoating rates are ﬁxed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term ﬂexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted 
bank facilities. The weighted average interest rate for ﬂoating rate borrowings in 2007 was 5.7% (2006: 5.1%).
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The fair value of ﬂoating rate loans at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 
is considered to be equal to the book value as the interest rate on the loans and borrowings is linked to United Kingdom bank rate. The cash 
ﬂow interest rate risks of £860.0m of the ﬂoating rate debt has been hedged using swap arrangements (as detailed below).
Fixed rate sterling private placement notes of £81.8m (2006: £nil) were arranged at ﬁxed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for ﬁxed rate sterling private placement notes for 2007 was 7.5% (2006: nil) with, at 30 June 
2007, a weighted average period of 2.5 years (2006: nil) for which the rate is ﬁxed. 
The fair value of ﬁxed rate sterling private placement notes has been determined by using the current value calculated at the acquisition of 
Wilson Bowden.
At 30 June 2007, if interest rates had been 25 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net proﬁt would 
decrease/increase by £1.4m (2006: £0.5m decrease/increase). 
f) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – swaps 
The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash ﬂow risks, related to interest rates, arising 
from the Group’s sources of ﬁnance. 
At 30 June 2007 the Group had outstanding ﬂoating rate sterling debt and overdrafts of £1,401.5m (2006: £8.4m). In obtaining this funding the 
Group sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated 
future debt requirements. 
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to swap £860.0m (2006: £nil) of this debt into ﬁxed rate sterling debt in accordance with 
the Group treasury policy outlined in note 23. After taking into account swap arrangements, the ﬁxed interest rates applicable to the debt 
were as follows:

f) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – swaps (continued)
The swap arrangements are designated as a cash ﬂow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements 
at 30 June 2007, which is based on third party valuations, was £12.3m (2006: £nil) with a gain of £12.3m (2006: £nil) being credited directly to 
equity in the year. In addition, £1.5m was transferred to the income statement on the settlement of the former Wilson Bowden US Dollar swaps 
following the repayment of the former Wilson Bowden US Dollar private placement notes. There was no (2006: nil) ineffectiveness arising from 
the swaps to be taken through the income statement during the year.
Further disclosures relating to ﬁnancial instruments are set out in note 23.
23. Financial instruments
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and available 
for sale ﬁnancial assets. The Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables (including land payables) and 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
a) Financial risk management
The Group’s operations and debt ﬁnancing expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most signiﬁcant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed 
system for the reporting and forecasting of cash ﬂows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly 
identiﬁed and appropriate actions taken by the central treasury department. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme 
that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its ﬁnancial performance in particular by using ﬁnancial instruments, including debt 
and derivatives, to ﬁx interest rates. The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting speciﬁc, clearly deﬁned guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group. A 
Treasury Operating Committee has been established which operates within speciﬁc parameters set by the Board and consists of any two 
of the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. In addition, the Directors approve and review all facilities and 
derivative transactions that they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee. The Group operates a central treasury department to 
implement the guidelines established by the Board, to which it reports regularly. 
i) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term ﬁxed rate 
funding and medium-term ﬂoating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate ﬂexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. 
In order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash ﬂow risks relating to interest rate movements on a 
proportion of its debt. The Group has a policy that 60%-80% of the forecasted debt for the year end is at a ﬁxed rate, with an average minimum 
duration of ﬁve years and an average maximum duration of ﬁfteen years.
ii) Credit risk
The Group has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers. The exposure 
to credit loss on cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables is equivalent to their balance sheet carrying value.
The Group has a credit policy that is limited to ﬁnancial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies. The 
Group only contracts derivative ﬁnancial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place. These 
agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The Company was exposed to £8.4m (2006: £8.4m) of credit risk in relation to ﬁnancial guarantees and the bank borrowings of subsidiary 
undertakings at the year end. Further details are provided in note 31.
iii) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has 
sufﬁcient available funds for operations. At 30 June 2007, the Group had committed facilities of £2,630.0m (2006: £400.0m) and total facilities of 
£2,786.3m (2006: £471.2m).
The Group’s objective is to minimise reﬁnancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed facilities and 
private placement notes is at least three years. At 30 June 2007, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.5 years.

At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.4m (2006: £0.2m), which were paid on or before the due date.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
The Group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is now closed to new entrants. A full actuarial 
valuation was carried out at 30 November 2004 and updated to 30 June 2007 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. The projected unit method 
has been used to calculate the current service cost. This will rise over time (as a percentage of payroll) as the members of the scheme approach 
retirement as the scheme is closed to new members. At the balance sheet date there were no outstanding contributions (2006: £0.7m).
Following changes introduced by the Finance Act with effect from April 2006, the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme has implemented revised terms for 
members exchanging pension at retirement date for a tax-free lump sum. An analysis of the changes in commutation behaviour of scheme 
members will be undertaken by the Trustees for the 30 November 2007 actuarial valuation of the scheme. After the results of this are made 
available, the Group may change its assumptions regarding commutation. Accordingly, no gain or loss has been recognised in the period.
The assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme have been calculated at fair value. The liabilities of the scheme have been calculated at each balance 
sheet date using the following assumptions:
2007 2006
Principal actuarial assumptions
Weighted average assumptions to determine beneﬁt obligations
Discount rate  5.80% 5.25%
Rate of compensation increase 5.30% 5.00%

The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to 
calculate the scheme liabilities.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk 
free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is 
invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the 
target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Details of the share option schemes
a) Executive Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The grant of share options under this Plan is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options 
must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from 
the date of grant. The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the 
Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial 
years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those 
options granted in and since 1999.
b) Employee Share Option Plan
In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Board approves the grant of share options to 
employees under this Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of the options 
granted under the Plan are subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in the 
basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index 
by at least 9%. 
Those who have participated in the Executive Share Option Plan do not participate in the Employee Share Option Plan.
c) Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take 
effect from 1 July 2003. Further details relating to the LTPP are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 42 to 49.
d) Wilson Bowden plc 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘WBSRSOS’)
Under the WBSRSOS, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an approved savings authority under a contractual savings 
scheme for a period of three or ﬁve years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in 
Wilson Bowden plc at a discount, of no more than 20%, to the middle market price of Wilson Bowden plc’s shares immediately prior to the date 
of grant.
The exercise of options under the WBSRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, as the WBSRSOS is Inland Revenue 
approved and open to all eligible employees.
In consequence of the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, under the rules of the WBSRSOS, options granted which were not already exercisable 
became exercisable during the six months following 23 April 2007, to the extent of the savings made under related savings contracts at the time 
of the exercise together with any accrued interest or bonus due. Pursuant to the provisions of Wilson Bowden Limited’s Articles of Association, 
shares arising upon exercise of such options after the Reorganisation Record Time for the Scheme of Arrangement by which the acquisition 
was effective (the ‘Scheme’) being 6pm on 24 April 2007, but prior to expiry of such six month period, will automatically be acquired by the 
Company in consideration for the payment by the Company to the holders of option shares substantially equivalent to that receivable under 
the Scheme had the option shares been in issue at the Reorganisation Record Time. Any options outstanding upon the expiry of this six month 
period will lapse. Details of ordinary shares held under option under the WBSRSOS together with options exercised or lapsed during the period 
under review are provided in the table on page 80.

26. Share-based payments (continued)
The weighted average share price, at the date of exercise, of Barratt share options exercised during the year was 1,075p (2006: 886p).
The weighted average life for outstanding Barratt share options at the end of the year is 4.7 years (2006: 6.1 years).
Income statement charge
A charge to the income statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 in 
accordance with IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. 
Long-Term Performance Plan
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2007 was 788p (2006: 609p) per award. The awards have been valued using a 
Present-Economic Value model for the EPS element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the TSR element of the scheme.
The weighted average inputs to the Present-Economic Value model were as follows: 
2007 Grants 2006 Grants
Average share price 1,095p 856p
Average exercise price – –
Expected volatility 25.0% 25.0%
Expected life  2.6 years 2.6 years

Average exercise price – –
Expected volatility 25.0% 25.0%
Expected life  2.6 years 2.6 years
Risk free interest rate – –
Expected dividends 3.0% 3.5%
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected 
life of the options. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Total expense
The Group recognised an expense of £4.4m (2006: £3.1m) in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions for the year ended 
30 June 2007. At 30 June 2007, an accrual of £1.2m (2006: £1.5m) was recognised in respect of National Insurance liabilities on share-

Barratt Developments PLC issued 102,571,785 ordinary shares of 10p nominal value to shareholders of Wilson Bowden as part of the 
acquisition consideration. The fair value of the shares issued was £1,118.0m which was determined using the closing bid share price at 25 April 
2007. In addition, at 30 June 2007, the Company has a liability to issue shares with a fair value of £1.3m to satisfy the remaining Wilson Bowden 
plc 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme options.
The fair value adjustments comprise:
• The £103.5m adjustment to intangible assets relates to the write-off of £3.5m of goodwill on the Wilson Bowden balance sheet at acquisition 
and the recognition of £107.0m of intangible assets related to the brands acquired with Wilson Bowden (note 11).
• A £34.4m uplift to the carrying values of inventories to reﬂect the fair value of land and work in progress acquired.
• A £1.8m adjustment to trade and other payables.
• A £41.2m adjustment to deferred tax, including £32.1m related to the brands acquired, £10.3m related to the fair value uplift on inventories   
and other adjustments related to deferred tax of (£1.2m).
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Wilson Bowden is attributable to the anticipated proﬁtability of the individual sites acquired, the highly 
complementary geographic ﬁt, increased access to commercial development opportunities and the anticipated future operating synergies from 
the combination including ﬂexibility in relation to the expanded strategic and consented land bank.

for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Report of the Directors to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, and as regards the 
Group ﬁnancial statements Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report of 
the Directors is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not 
disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code 
2003 speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement and the Group Chief Executive’s Statement. We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the 
Report of the Directors to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of the Directors to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of the Directors to be audited. 90

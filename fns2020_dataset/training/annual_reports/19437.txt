RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
I concluded my message in the 2013 Annual Report with the hope that the events in Ukraine would soon settle peaceably. Unfortunately,  
12 months later, it remains headline news and has now been joined by an unforeseen and rapid drop in both the oil price and the Rouble. 
The positive news is that our operating results for 2014 have exceeded our expectations given the international sanctions that have been in place 
for the majority of the year. Underlying earnings have increased from $60million to $67million, our investment property portfolio was virtually 
fully let throughout the year, our weighted average term to debt maturity is now 4.8 years and our weighted average lease term is 4.2 years.  
At today’s date, we have $247million of free cash, the majority held in the Guernsey holding companies. 
Unfortunately and inevitably, the geopolitical events and resulting depreciation of the Rouble at the year end have affected our balance sheet. 
Investment property and property under construction valuations have decreased by $145million (2013: increase of $55million) and the US Dollar 
equivalent value of our Rouble denominated assets by $45million. This has resulted in an IFRS loss after tax for the year of $88million (2013: loss 
of $4million) and a fully diluted, adjusted net asset value per share of 106cents (2013: 126cents).
Despite the prevailing negative sentiment on Russia, we have been able to refinance $275million of our debt during the year, reducing our 
overall cost of debt from 7.2% to 7.0%. Since the year end, we have also drawn a further $66million on existing facilities, a significant achievement 
in the current market.
Our proposed final distribution, equivalent to 3.5p per share, makes a total of 6p per share for 2014, a 20% increase on 2013 and reflects the 
successful operating results in the year. Again, we intend to distribute by way of a tender offer buyback of 1 in every 14 ordinary shares at 48p  
per share.
The current year will be an important one for Raven Russia. We have made every effort to mitigate the effects on our business of the various 
macroeconomic and political events facing the Russian economy and we will continue to do so. We are naturally cautious on the outlook for  
the current year and the significant uncertainties regarding Ukraine, the oil price and the currency. We are strong financially, with an effective 
local management team in Russia and are well-placed to benefit from any economic recovery.
As always, I would like to thank our shareholders, employees, advisers and all of our stakeholders for their continued support in a  
challenging period.

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
We will manage our relatively simple business effectively and 
will keep our distribution policy under constant review. This is 
disappointing given our progress and we look forward to the  
eventual recovery when we will benefit from the high quality 
portfolio we have created.
Glyn Hirsch
Chief Executive Officer
8 March 2015
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S  
REPORT
In many ways 2014 has been a good year.
The portfolio of 1.5million square metres (“sqm”) is 94% let, securely 
financed and we have significant free cash at holding company level. 
Our operating performance has been excellent although our balance 
sheet has suffered from the effects of the weak Rouble at the year end.
Our underlying earnings have risen to $67million, up 11% from 
$60million in 2013.
We have $247million of free cash at today’s date, a level we believe is 
prudent in these uncertain times.
Inevitably, property valuations and the US Dollar value of our Rouble 
denominated assets have suffered in this difficult environment and 
year end adjusted fully diluted Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share 
was 106cents (2013: 126cents). With no investment transactions and 
continuing uncertainty it is hard to predict where valuations might go 
next and we remain cautious.
All of our progress in 2014 is overshadowed by the very difficult 
economic and geopolitical issues Russia is facing and how they will 
impact on our future prospects.
Whilst the vast majority of our leases are contracted in US Dollars, our 
tenants will typically have Rouble revenues. Some of our tenants are 
suffering and we will work with those who really need help and who 
recognise it is a reciprocal arrangement. Rouble rents are not out of 
the question provided this can be justified by other contractual terms, 
including lease term, indexation and covenant.
Our long term strategy is unchanged and we still believe that our 
high quality portfolio in a structurally undersupplied market can 
generate attractive returns. The problem is that the long term now 
looks further away and so our key objective is to make sure we are 
ready when it eventually arrives.
As you would expect, we have put any immediate acquisition plans 
on hold. We will not be starting any further speculative property 
development and our focus is on conserving our cash and managing 
our existing portfolio efficiently and effectively. 
With a final tender offer distribution of 3.5p the distribution for the 
year is 6p, a 20% increase over 2013. To save cash we will not be 
offering an option to oversubscribe for more than each shareholder’s 
pro rata entitlement.
Given future uncertainty it seems unlikely that the rising distribution 
trend we had developed will continue until we can see how all of the 
current uncertainties unfold. Whilst we want to make distributions to 
shareholders when we can we have to maintain a reserve of cash to 
deal with the uncertainties we will face.  25
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
BUSINESS 
MODEL
Our Strategy
Our strategy is simple: to build an investment portfolio of Grade A 
logistics warehouses in Russia that delivers progressive distributions 
to our shareholders.
We have had success in implementing this strategy in the last four 
years after the hiatus of 2009 and 2010. However, the combination 
of the political and economic pressures on Russia, culminating in the 
rapid depreciation of both the oil price and the Rouble in the last four 
months, means that we have entered another period of caution.
The difference between the position today and at the end of 2008 is 
that we have a high occupancy, completed investment portfolio, very 
little development exposure and a strong balance sheet with high 
levels of free cash.
The logistics market in Russia remains undersupplied, even without 
a buoyant economy. Our objective in the medium term is to secure 
the position we have in the market and be well placed to take 
opportunities as and when we come out of the problems of the 
current cycle.
Business Model
Our business model has adapted over time, from one initially 
focussed on deploying our equity in forward funding construction 
projects with local joint venture developers, to a geared development 
model with in house construction project management. The bulk 
of our investment portfolio was completed in 2009 and we entered 
into a sustained period of letting activity. Today, we are a maturing 
investment property group with a focus on growth through proactive 
asset management, organic development projects and acquisitions.
Our tenants are a mixture of large, local and international businesses: 
retailers; distributors; manufacturers; and large, third party logistics 
providers. Where possible, we look to partner tenants to assist in their 
growth, the development at Noginsk over the last three years being a 
good example, with high specification developments completed for 
large Russian retailers.
The current market conditions mean that any potential development 
projects and acquisitions have been put on hold and asset 
management of the investment portfolio is our primary focus. 
In particular, the letting of vacant space and dealing with lease 
maturities arising in 2015/16 in the context of depressed market 
rental levels combined with addressing the pressure on certain 
tenants caused by the weakened Rouble.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The opportunity of high, US Dollar denominated yield attracted us 
to this market and our KPIs are yield and shareholder distribution 
focussed. Our results are driven by increasing rental income and NOI 
performance, underpinned by the portfolio ERV and vacancy rates.
Our central overheads are reasonably stable and can support more 
growth. We focus on measurements that reflect our ability to pay cash 
covered distributions, principally underlying earnings and operating 
cash flows after interest. The latter forms the key measurement in our 
incentive plan targets.
We have struggled to find comparable indices for our stock. The 
Russian property sector is dominated by developers and we do not 
know of any similar investment companies in our part of the property 
universe. Similarly, comparing ourselves to UK REITs does not work 
given the disparity in metrics.
However, we have shown a comparison of our total shareholder 
return over the last 5 years to both the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 
350 indices later in the Annual Report, which shows a significant 
outperformance over that period until the impact of the low oil prices 
and Rouble depreciation at the year end. 26

2014 was a year when our long term strategy of investing in the best assets and leasing them to strong tenants enabled us to remain virtually 
fully let. We began and ended the year with a vacancy rate of just 3% on a like for like basis. At the year end we delivered 107,000sqm of new 
space at our Noginsk and Nova Riga projects in Moscow, which is already 56% let to large Russian and international tenants. This new space 
increased our vacancy in the portfolio to 6% at 31 December 2014. Contracted NOI is now $185.3million, increasing to $199.3million including 
LOIs and PLAs, with the potential to rise further to $209million if the vacant space leases up. The reality today is that our primary objective for 
2015 and 2016 is to maintain the cash flow we have in a market which has been hit by Rouble depreciation and a record delivery of new space.
During 2015 we have 140,000sqm of lease expiries reflecting the defensiveness of our portfolio in the short term. Looking further ahead this 
number increases to 323,200sqm in 2016. There are no break clauses outstanding at the year end. Our strategy is to renew these leases at the 
earliest opportunity to de-risk the portfolio.

Valuation in the current environment is a challenging exercise as there is very little evidence to help the valuers reach their conclusion. Buyers 
have of course been put off by the geopolitical and economic issues, but we are not seeing any distress as most owners and developers in our 
sector are not over leveraged forcing them to sell. That means yields have moved out by around 100-150 bps in Moscow to 12-12.5%, to 13.25% 
in St Petersburg and 14.5% in the regions. Over supply and Rouble weakness has hit rents in the second half of the year with ERVs falling by $10-
15 per sqm. However, because our portfolio is generally well let on long term leases the impact of ERV change is not as dramatic on valuations as 
it otherwise would have been.
Our investment properties were valued by Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL”) at the period end, in accordance with the RICS Valuation and Appraisal 
guidelines, and are carried at a market value of $1.6billion (see note 11 to the financial statements). This resulted in a decrease of $133million 
in portfolio value since 2013, reflecting the increase in yields and the reduction in ERVs, partly offset by a revaluation uplift on our new 
developments at Nova Riga and Noginsk in Moscow.

and terms on 75,000sqm of 2015 maturities have been agreed to date. 
Moscow 
In Moscow we have nine projects totalling 1,073,000sqm, producing 
an annualised income of $145.2million at the year end. Following 
the completion of new space at Noginsk and Nova Riga at the year 
end, there is 82,000sqm of vacant space. In the last quarter of 2014 
market rents fell on Rouble weakness and over supply in some areas 
of the market.
At Noginsk we have completed a further 39,284sqm for Dixy, the 
leading Russian retailer, who has recently taken occupation of the 
building and are contracted to sign a 15 year lease at an annual rent 
of $8.5million. 
At our new project in Moscow at Nova Riga we have completed the 
first phase of 67,388sqm together with the associated infrastructure 
for the majority of the project. We have signed PLAs with Azbuka 
Vkuza and Pernod Ricard for 20,480sqm in total.

St Petersburg
Tenant Mix
Our diverse, but quality tenant base should help to protect us in the current 
year. The sector hardest hit by the rapid Rouble depreciation in the second 
half of the year appears to be the third party logistic operators for whom 
rent is a large proportion of their cost base. This represents 39% of our 
tenants with a weighted average unexpired lease term of 4 years. 76% of this 
figure comprises DHL, Itella, DSV, Kuhne and Nagel and our own subsidiary 
Roslogistics who all have the financial strength to meet their rental obligations.
Given the current situation in Russia, an international business that had a 
nascent plan for entering the Russian market has probably put that on ice, 
but those who are already here seem willing to commit for the medium term 
as is evidenced in our own portfolio with the likes of Bacardi signing lease 
extensions in Moscow since the year end. As a tenant, if you are in Russia, 
trading margins and volumes may be down in 2015 but the fundamental 
characteristics of the country still look attractive for many of our tenants.
In St Petersburg, the market has also been affected by the current situation, although we ended the year with only 3,291sqm vacant. During the 
year, we invested circa $7million on a spare land plot to create new truck parking and ancillary facilities for Dixy, which they have leased until 
2023 at a rent of $1.3million per annum.

We completed the construction of 107,000sqm during the year at 
Noginsk and Nova Riga in Moscow. In the current market it is unlikely 
we will undertake any further speculative development although, we 
hold another 26 ha at Noginsk on which we can build 134,000sqm 
and at Nova Riga there is the potential to add a further 130,000sqm 
on the additional 25 ha we own.
Demand in the regional cities across Russia has reduced dramatically 
and as a result we have reassessed the carrying values for the regional 
land bank, reducing them from $22.6million to $3.2million, after the 
effects of Rouble depreciation and including writing off the value of 
our holdings in Ufa and Chelyabinsk where our development leases 
expire in 2018. The development lease at our site in Saratov lapsed 
during the year and we have not renewed this. It is clear regional 
development will take some time to recover and where possible we 
will seek alternative uses for our sites.
The Market
Landlords, developers, banks and tenants are all in search of the “new 
normal” following six months of turbulence. In Moscow new supply 
rose by 1.6million sqm during 2014 with take up decreasing to circa 
860,000sqm according to JLL. They also estimate the year end vacancy 
rate in Moscow at 7.9%. 
It is clear that the depreciation of the Rouble against the US Dollar 
has made rents more expensive for tenants, many of whom had not 
hedged their US Dollar exposure. This has led to a raft of requests 
to renegotiate rents. Some developers have also delivered large 
schemes into a falling market and in certain locations there is a lot 
of competition for tenants. There is however, a two tier market: that 
for vacant space, where developers are competing for tenants very 
aggressively; and the lease renewal market. The latter is somewhat 
different, and whilst tenants are seeking competitive rents, the cost and 
aggravation of moving, training new staff and disruption to the supply 
chain is such that better rents can be achieved. Many developers with 
vacant space today are offering Rouble rents and this is something we 
will do in the short term providing we also get the benefit of annual 
Rouble indexation alongside an appropriate lease term and covenant.
Land Bank
Supply is expected to continue to rise over the first half of 2015 in 
Moscow as schemes already started are brought to the market. By the 
end of 2015 we expect take up to have eroded the amount of vacant 
space leaving the vacancy rate at around 5.5%. Looking further ahead 
into 2016 we do not expect much new supply. Development finance 
simply is not available and with rents where they are, it does not make 
sense, currently, to build speculatively even after allowing for the fall 
in construction costs in US Dollar terms. If there is continued demand 
and the stranglehold on supply caused by lower rents and the lack 
of finance remains, then the market could quickly swing back into 
equilibrium and even to an under supply by the end of 2016. 
Investment volumes fell from $8.1billion in 2013 to $3.5billion in 2014 
according to JLL, caused by the uncertain geopolitical and economic 
outlook. Approximately 76.2% of this investment was from Russian 
sources. Yields have also moved out as demonstrated by our valuations. 
Comparatively, yields for warehouses in Athens are 10.5%, Brazil 10.5% 
and China 7.5%. Russia still looks good value in that context. The cost 
and availability of investment and development finance has changed as 
banks both local and international are more risk conscious and dealing 
with sanctions. This is likely to reduce development (a good thing) but 
also restrict investment (not so good) over the next year.
2015 will be all about collecting rent, minimising vacant space and 
tenant retention. If we can get these three things right we will be well 
placed in 2016 when the market looks like it could be better balanced.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW 30
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
Our results for the year show a very distinct split. Operating results for the year have met expectation but the impact of the rapid depreciation of 
the Rouble over the year end has hit the US Dollar value of our closing balance sheet.
The comparison of our key performance indicator of Underlying Earnings to IFRS earnings demonstrates the impact.
With our investment portfolio running at 97% let for the year, like for 
like, our net rental and related income increases from $187million 
in 2013 to $192million in 2014. There were no significant tenant 
maturities in the year, potential acquisition projects were put on 
hold in the last quarter and the two new construction projects 
completed at the end of the year and so were not income 
generating in the period.
General underlying administrative expenses have increased from 
$26million to $27million. The element relating to the property 
investment portfolio (see note 4 to the financial statements) was 
$16.7million (2013: $16.0million) and central overheads were $6.9 
million (2013: $6.1million). The majority of the increase was due to 
the relative strength of Sterling to US Dollar over the year compared 
to 2013.
Foreign exchange movements in underlying earnings relate to the 
increase in the Rouble equivalent of US Dollar net liabilities on our 
property owning Rouble balance sheets at the year end. The largest 
translation movement was a $25million loss relating to the carrying 
value of US Dollar tenant deposits held. As these are converted to US 
Dollars at the time of receipt, the cashflow impact of the exchange 
loss to the Group would be neutral if repayment of deposits was 
to crystalise at the balance sheet value. This has been offset by 
a $10million gain on US Dollar cash reserves held in the Russian 
operating companies.
Underlying operating profit before foreign exchange movements was 
$166.3million (2013: $163.3million). This compares to our operating 
cash inflow of $168.8million (2013: $192.3million). 2013 included 
one off proceeds from the sale of Raven Mount stock of $13million, 
distributions from the Lakes joint venture of $8milion and increased 
rents received in advance of $11million. The latter reduced this year as 
tenants were uncertain of where the Rouble rate was going to settle 
over the year end and delayed payment until the due date.
Our bank interest expense including amortised costs (note 7) 
increased to $67.7million (2013: $63.2million) following refinancings 
completed during the year and our preference share expense almost 
halved to $20million (2013: $38.3million) following the conversion 
exercise at the end of 2013. The underlying net finance expense for 
the year was $75.7million (2013: $91.4million).
Underlying profit after tax increased to $66.7million (2013: 
$60.3million). The foreign exchange movement caused by the year 
end Rouble depreciation has offset the saving on the preference 
share coupon following the conversion at the end of last year. Basic 
underlying earnings per share is 9.32cents (2013: 10.92cents) with the 
increased number of ordinary shares in issue following the preference 
share conversion at the end of 2013.

Our IFRS results incorporate the impact of the mark to market valuation of our property assets, hedging instruments and other non cash items. 
The table in note 9 to the financial statements reconciles the Underlying Earnings to IFRS results, the principal reconciling items being the 
revaluation loss on our investment properties and property assets under construction of $145.4million (2013: profit of $55.3 million), and the 
mark to market valuation of hedging instruments showing a loss of $9.8million (2013: profit of $6.4million). 
These amounts are a factor of the conditions existing at the balance sheet date and anticipate the tougher operating environment in Russia in 
the coming year.
In 2013, we also had the one off accounting charge of $86 million following the conversion of half of the preference shares to ordinary shares on 
a 1 for 2 basis.
Investment Properties
Our completed investment property portfolio had a market value at 31 December 2014 of $1.61billion (2013: $1.65billion). This follows transfers 
from assets under construction of $106million and a valuation loss of $132.9million based on independent valuations at 31 December 2014 (see 
note 11). Investment property under construction had a market value of $46.7million at the year end, down from $116.0million at the beginning 
of the year following the completion of phases at Noginsk and Nova Riga and after a net revaluation loss of $10.0million. This includes a write 
down on the carrying value of regional land assets of $10.9million (see note 12).

FINANCE REVIEW
Cash and Debt
Net cash generated from operating activities was $168.8million. Construction and improvement costs in the year were $105.6million, principally 
funded from a net increase in borrowings of $89.5million. Bank borrowing costs were $70.9million (2013: $72.0million) and distributions to 
ordinary and preference shareholders totalled $87.2million (2013: $75million). Cash held at the year end was $171.4million (2013: $201.3million). 
The majority of the foreign exchange impact on cash balances relates to the conversion of Rouble cash balances to US Dollars at the balance 
sheet date. As Rouble cash is held to cover Rouble expenditure the benefit of this is realised in future cashflows.
We have total debt outstanding of $905million at the year end (2013: $815million), with $68million (2013: $43million) unhedged at the year end. 
$42million of this has been hedged with caps since the year end. Our weighted average cost of debt reduced to 7.0% (2013: 7.2%) and weighted 
average time to maturity increased to 4.8 years (2013: 4.7 years) following a number of refinancings during the year. 
Our nearest term maturity is in April 2016, all other facilities maturing between March 2017 and June 2024.

The Group has refinanced $275million of debt facilities in the year, 
generating additional cash of $110million. This encompasses a new 
facility of $73million secured on our Novosibirsk asset, a $180million 
facility secured on our Noginsk project with $141million drawn before 
the year end and a $38million facility secured on the asset at Lobnya. 
The facility secured on the Konstanta asset has also been rolled over 
for two and a half years on existing terms.
A facility secured on the Nova Riga site was completed prior to 
the year end, with $15million drawn before the year end. Since 31 
December 2014, the Group has drawn a further $27million on the 
Nova Riga facility and $39million on the Noginsk facility.
Subsidiaries
Raven Mount now consists of the joint venture for second homes at 
The Lakes in the Cotswolds and legacy UK land bank. It contributed 
$1.4million to profit this year (2013: $2.5 million).
Roslogistics has contributed $8.3million to profit (2013: $14.7 
million), the decrease simply a factor of the decrease in the US 
Dollar equivalent of the subsidiary’s Rouble denominated income 
in the latter part of the year. Because of the impact of the Rouble 
depreciation on the outlook for Roslogistics, the goodwill carried in 
the balance sheet of $3million has been impaired.
Provisions
The provisions carried have now unwound following the final court 
decision on the litigation on the Pushkino asset. Details are given in 
note 24 to the financial statements.
In summary, the good operating results for the year have allowed us 
to propose a final distribution equivalent to 3.5p and 6p for the year. 
Our adjusted, diluted NAV per share drops from 126cents to 106cents 
following revaluation losses, anticipating a tough year ahead.

RISK 
REPORT
The Board places significant importance on identifying and managing 
the risks facing the business. These encompass the risks, real and 
perceived, of operating in a foreign market such as Russia, and the 
more obvious cyclical, property specific risks, presented by the 
development and investment in a large property portfolio. Risk and 
uncertainties are accepted as part of doing business and managed 
accordingly. Over the reporting period, the risks which could 
impact our business have increased, however the Board, through 
its committee structure and management team have monitored, 
mitigated and minimised the impact of these risks where possible. 
Within the Audit Committee report we have set out the process of 
how risks are identified, evaluated, analysed and mitigating actions 
implemented where possible. Within this section of the report we 
have highlighted the key risks, opportunities and uncertainties which 
currently face the Group.
Our balance sheet at the year end reflects the impact that the rapid 
drop in the oil price had on the strength of the Rouble, exacerbated 
by the international sanctions deployed against Russia. This has 
significantly increased our credit risk for the coming year. Our 
property management team is discussing the position with all of our 
tenants and to date we have no significant overdue debts. This has 
heightened the focus on the management of our financial risks.
Financial Risks
Our strategy remains to build an investment portfolio in the Russian 
warehouse sector which allows us to generate a high US Dollar 
denominated, ungeared yield on cost. We believe that this will 
translate into attractive distribution yields for our shareholders. A key 
element of that strategy is the management of foreign exchange risk. 
Tenants accept the US Dollar/Rouble exposure with US Dollar pegged 
rents, in exchange for reduced inflationary indexation (linked to US 
CPI rather than Russian inflation). The macro economic and political 
risks that have arisen over the last year and the subsequent rapid 
depreciation of the Rouble, has increased the pressure on our Rouble 
based tenants to meet their lease obligations, especially smaller third 
party logistics providers. This translates into heightened credit risk for 
certain sectors of our tenant base. Our lease contracts are robust, with 
secure parent company or bank guarantees or cash deposits in place, 
however we have entered into dialogue with tenants to understand 
their needs and concerns, especially those with near term maturities. 
Given the weakness of the Rouble, in some instances, Rouble rents 
with annual Russian inflationary indexation may be attractive on new 
or maturing leases. The upside if the Rouble was to strengthen could 
be considerable and the higher indexation gives some downside 
protection. If we were to give any assistance to tenants through 
renegotiated lease terms, this would have to be achieved in the 
context of the existing banking covenants. Indeed, any significant 
changes to lease terms would require prior bank approval where the 
related asset was mortgaged as finance security.
Gearing
Gearing has enabled us to accelerate our growth but we have 
managed the risk to the Group by raising asset secured facilities,  
ring-fenced in special purpose vehicle structures. We have not taken 
any significant bank debt exposure onto the holding company 
balance sheet to date. By structuring our investments in this way,  
it allows us to monitor our debt service obligations at an asset level 
but maintain low gearing ratios at a consolidated level. Our Group 
gearing levels, not including preference shares, have been managed 
between 44% and 52%. Year end gearing has increased to 52% 
following the drop in investment property values at the year end. 
Sanctions against Russian banks and the geopolitical situation have 
changed the banking environment. However during the year we have 
generated $275million from new facilities, re-gearing $165million 
and providing additional cash resources of $110million for the Group. 
Since the year end, we have drawn a further $66million on facilities. 
We are a preferred counterparty with our banking partners. We have 
an excellent track record of managing our debt relationships and 
facilities and our secure cash flows provide our banking partners with 
lending returns not possible in western markets. We have continued 
to push out our debt maturity profile with a weighted average 
maturity of 4.8 years at 31 December 2014.
The erosion of property values and the heightened credit risk does 
mean that covenant breach risk is higher in the coming year. We 
do have comfortable debt service ratios and where banks have 
undertaken independent valuations since the year end, no loan to 
value breaches have occurred, although the headroom has reduced. 
The majority of the Group’s financing facilities allow the borrowing 
entity to deposit cash to cover any potential marginal breaches in 
debt service or loan to value covenants and so we have mechanisms 
in place to mitigate this risk.
Key Performance Indicators
Given our distribution strategy, we place emphasis on our  
“Underlying Earnings” (as defined in note 9 to the financial 
statements) and operating cash flows after financing costs, the latter 
being the key metric in our incentive schemes. These measures give 
the most relevant and comparable information on the operating 
performance of our portfolio and our ability to pay distributions from 
those operations. 
We also monitor our loan to value ratios and the impact of valuations 
on our diluted net asset value per share. As noted previously, 
these have increased in importance this year given the economic 
environment. RISK REPORT

Property Acquisition and Development
The market in which we operate has historically been undersupplied. 
This meant that we have had to construct the majority of our 
portfolio speculatively, 2008 and 2009 being the periods of 
greatest construction activity. Since then we have undertaken a 
development programme which has delivered between 50,000sqm 
and 100,000sqm of speculative development each year. This organic 
development has enabled enhanced returns to shareholders with 
attractive unleveraged development returns. 
In 2014, the introduction of new space has resulted in downward 
pressure on market rents. Vacancy rates in Moscow at the end of the 
year have increased from 3% to 7.9% because of the introduction 
of this new space. We do not expect much new development to be 
started in the current year and as the market remains structurally 
undersupplied, it is expected that vacancy rates will contract again as 
vacant space is taken up.
There are a number of potential acquisition opportunities in the 
market, of completed, fully let properties. We continue to assess 
acquisitions of fully let income producing assets to grow our portfolio 
but with the uncertainty in the market these projects have been  
put on hold. This has resulted in some aborted transaction costs  
in the year.
Acquisitions of completed assets have the potential to carry legacy 
risks as we have not been involved in the historic construction 
and management of the sites. Whilst this adds to the potential for 
enhanced asset management returns it also adds to our investment 
property risks. This is all part of the integration risk of introducing 
new assets to the portfolio and we complete detailed in house, and 
commission independent, due diligence on all potential acquisitions.
We have set out in the following table the principal risks and 
uncertainties that face our business, our view on how those risks have 
changed during the year and a description of how we mitigate or 
manage those risks. 
Russian Political and Economic Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation Change
Ukraine
The situation in Ukraine is 
not resolved peaceably or 
escalates.
Increased isolation of Russia 
from international markets 
and increased sanctions 
exacerbate the slow down in 
the Russian economy.
It is difficult to mitigate against the worst case 
scenario if escalation were to close Russia’s borders 
to Western markets. However, we have:
- maximised cash reserves held at holding 
company level;
- an organisational structure that would allow 
us to continue to operate the Russian business 
autonomously if necessary; and
- a special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) structure 
that protects the holding company assets 
(principally cash) in a worst case scenario.
In the more likely scenario that events continue 
to weigh on the Russian economy in the medium 
term, we have dealt with specific risks in the 
various sections below.
Oil Price 
The global economy operates 
in a low oil price environment 
for the medium term.
The impact on Russia’s 
infrastructure investment 
programme and reforms 
increases the slow down in the 
economy.
When the Company was incorporated in 2005, 
it was at a time of low oil prices. The attraction 
to the market was the chronic undersupply of 
product. The risk on this occasion of low oil prices 
has been the impact on the Rouble and its rapid 
depreciation. We have mitigated this by having 
US Dollar pegged rents but as explained in later 
sections this has increased the Group’s credit risk.

Risk Impact Mitigation Change
Foreign Exchange
Adverse movements in Rouble 
or Sterling against US Dollar.
The weakening of the Rouble 
against the US Dollar leading 
to pressure on market rents, 
a reduction in our US Dollar 
denominated earnings and 
the carrying value of assets in 
US Dollars. 
If required to seek funding in 
alternative currencies to US 
Dollars an increase in foreign 
exchange risk would result.
Preference share coupon and 
ordinary share distributions 
are serviced in Sterling. 
As earnings are US Dollar 
denominated shareholder 
distributions are open to 
exchange risks.
Rental income, whilst received in Roubles, is 
pegged to the US Dollar exchange rate, and so 
the exchange risk is taken by tenants. In return, 
indexation is held to US CPI levels rather than 
Russian inflation. Sustained Rouble weakness will 
ultimately affect our tenants’ ability to pay their 
rents as they are predominately Rouble businesses. 
This translates into heightened credit risk for our 
tenants.
We retain sufficient Rouble funds from rent 
collection to meet Rouble expenditure 
requirements.
Our largest Sterling exposure is the payment 
of preference share coupon and ordinary share 
distributions. 
We have capped the exposure of our preference 
share coupon to December 2019, and retain 
Sterling cash resources where possible to cover 
known ordinary share distribution commitments. 
Construction costs are payable in Roubles, if we 
have insufficient Rouble resources to cover future 
construction payments we may enter into Non 
Deliverable Forward instruments to retain certainty 
on our US Dollar returns. However, given current 
market conditions and the weak Rouble, this risk 
has minimised in the current year.
Our balance sheet is open to unrealised losses on 
foreign exchange when the US Dollar or Rouble 
weakens.
Bank Lending
The number of banks lending 
in our market diminishes 
because of macro economic 
and/or political events.
Reduced access to funding 
and potential increase in 
funding cost.
Reduces our ability to 
refinance maturing facilities.
A reduction in gearing and 
an inability to borrow in US 
Dollars from Russian banks 
due to the effect of sanctions.
Debt facility maturities have a weighted average of 
4.8 years with one maturity in the next 2 years. 
Facilities have a mix of amortising profiles and 
approximately $58 million of principal is repaid each 
year. This means that our gearing levels are relatively 
low (52% at 31 December 2014) and debt service 
coverage ratios are more than adequately met.
Alternative sources of funding such as Rouble loans 
or capital instruments are available but could increase 
the cost of debt and the foreign exchange risk.
Interest Rates
Cost of debt increases.
Group profitability and debt 
service cover reduce.
The majority of our variable cost debt is hedged 
with the use of swaps and caps on US LIBOR; 
we have reduced our weighted average cost of 
debt during the year to 7.0%; and
the weighted average remaining term of existing 
hedge instruments is 2.8 years.
Treasury
Sanctions precipitate the 
introduction of currency 
controls.
The flow of funds out of Russia 
is restricted.
The majority of current cash resources are held at 
holding company level.
The majority of our banking facilities allow for debt 
to be serviced in alternative currencies.

Slow down in Russian growth 
and consumer spending.
Reduced consumer demand 
will impact on demand for 
new lettings, renewal of 
existing leases and restrict 
rental growth.
As noted previously, Rouble 
depreciation increases the 
credit risk of our tenants.
We have a diversified tenant base (our largest 
tenants, X5 Group and Itella each represent around 
10% of current warehouse rental income);
almost 50% of our income comes from tenants 
who individually, contribute less than 2% to rent 
roll;
the logistics market remains undersupplied and so 
is not dependent on continued growth as existing 
requirements have not yet been met; and
the biggest risk for the coming year is credit risk 
caused by the significant depreciation in the 
Rouble against the US Dollar.
Composition of portfolio
Portfolio made up of 
predominantly one asset class 
with a concentration on the 
Moscow market.
Potentially reduces liquidity 
of the portfolio and could 
cause volatility in income and 
valuation movements.
Assets are located in different local markets, 
geographically, within Greater Moscow and 
Moscow remains the main hub for supply 
throughout Russia.
Moscow has a larger population than any other 
European City save Istanbul and can support niche 
players because of its size.
There remains a structural under supply of Grade 
A warehouses in Moscow and Russia as a whole, 
although vacancy rates have increased in the last 
year due to new supply coming onto the market. 
Acquisitions
Immature investment 
market where legacy issues 
are common with Russian 
acquisitions.
Lack of available acquisitions 
requires reliance on 
speculative development for 
growth.
Where acquisitions are 
possible, legacy issues may 
erode earnings enhancement.
We have an internal management team with both 
international and Russian experience allowing 
issues to be identified prior to acquisition;
External advisers undertake full detailed due 
diligence;
The current market conditions allow opportunities 
to be taken where funding resources are available; 
Organic growth through speculative development 
managed at levels below 10% of existing portfolio 
in any one year;
Given current market conditions, potential 
acquisitions and speculative development have 
been put on hold and so this risk will reduce in the 
current year. 38

Property Development
Risk Impact Mitigation Change
Speculative Nature
Occupiers are reluctant to 
enter into commitments to 
take new space prior to asset 
construction commencement.
Requires speculative 
development which will 
reduce income through 
vacant possession cost and 
valuation impact.
We monitor market cycles and likely tenant 
demand before committing to new developments; 
our developments are built in phases to allow 
suspension of construction if markets move 
adversely; and
current development plans have been put on hold 
given the market dynamics. 
Returns
Development projects fail 
to deliver the expected 
returns through cost and time 
overruns.
Cost and time overruns, 
lower rental levels and delays 
in leasing on development 
projects can mean target 
yields are missed and 
profitability reduced.
Full project appraisals prepared with appropriate 
monetary and timing contingencies;
foreign exchange exposure hedged where 
necessary;
recent devaluations of the Rouble have reduced 
costs in dollar terms on current construction 
projects; and
as no development programmes are expected 
to commence in 2015 this risk will reduce in the 
current year.
Legacy Construction
Those schemes not built 
directly by Raven Russia which 
were acquired through a Joint 
Venture or simple completed 
asset purchase have not 
been subject to the control 
mechanisms in place in our 
construction department. 
There is therefore a risk that 
the build quality has defects 
which become apparent over 
time.
Performing technical due diligence by both our in 
house team and external advisors when an asset is 
considered for acquisition; 
should any defect appear in one scheme then the 
other assets are then specifically checked to ensure 
the defect is not present there as well; and
as any potential acquisition programme has been 
put on hold, this risk will reduce in the current year.
Russian Domestic Risk

Legal Framework
The legal framework in Russia 
is in the early stages of its 
development.
The large volume of new 
legislation from various 
state bodies is open to 
interpretation, puts strain on 
the judicial system and can be 
open to abuse.
Experienced in house legal team review new 
legislation for any impact on the business; and
external legal advisors are used when necessary. 
Russian Taxation
Russian tax code is also 
developing and new rulings 
regularly introduced.
Tax treaties may be 
renegotiated and new 
legislation may increase the 
Group’s tax expense.
The key tax treaty for the Group is with Cyprus 
and this was renegotiated during 2013 with no 
significant impact on the business;
Russia is a relatively low tax jurisdiction with 20% 
Corporation tax; and
the Group structures itself in anticipation of 
Russia’s move towards a more Western taxation 
structure encompassing concepts such as thin 
capitalisation and transfer pricing. 39

CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s foreword
In this section of our Annual Report we explain how the principles  
of corporate governance have been adopted across the Group.  
The Board is collectively responsible for upholding high standards 
of corporate governance and see it as vital to support the delivery of 
the Group’s strategic objectives, and as such, good governance has 
been embedded within the way we do business. During 2014 the 
Group’s strategy has continued, providing a progressive distribution 
to shareholders with a high occupancy portfolio, organic growth 
through development, partnering our tenants on build to suit 
projects where possible and consideration of acquisitions where  
and when appropriate. 
The economic and geopolitical situation that has created significant 
uncertainty in the Russian market may lead to a hiatus in our strategy 
to drive enhanced returns for shareholders. 2015 will be focussed on 
preserving our current market position and managing the increased 
risks that may arise from tough trading conditions.

Statement of Compliance with the Code
The Financial Conduct Authority’s listing rules require the Company 
to explain how it has applied the Main Principles of Section 1 
of the Code. This report, together with the Directors’ , Audit and 
Remuneration Committee Reports, set out how the Company has 
done so. For the financial year ended 31 December 2014, we have 
treated the Company as a ‘smaller company’ for the purposes of the 
Code. This is not strictly correct as we entered the FTSE 350 for one 
quarter of the preceding year and as such did not meet the criteria of 
a “smaller company” . This means that, as 50% of our Board, excluding 
the Chairman, did not comprise of Non Executive Directors, therefore 
we were not in compliance with section B1.2 of the Code. However, as 
our stay in the FTSE 350 was not prolonged, the Board composition 
remained unchanged. Except for this, in the opinion of the Board, the 
Company has complied fully with the Main and Supporting Principles 
of the Code throughout the financial year and to the date of this 
report. Copies of the Code can be obtained free of charge from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
Leadership 
The Role of the Board 
The members of the Board are collectively charged with governance 
of the Group, providing leadership and direction for management. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the long term success of 
the Group whilst ensuring appropriate management and operation 
in pursuit of the objectives of the Group. The Board sets the Group’s 
strategy, values, standards and culture and ensures the resources 
and controls are in place to deliver this. A formal schedule of matters 
reserved solely for consideration by the Board has been adopted, this 
forms the basis of the Board’s core activities. 
The Board has also delegated certain aspects to its Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees through terms of 
reference. Terms of reference for each Committee can be found 
on the Company’s website (www.ravenrussia.com). Together, the 
Committees and the schedule of reserved matters assist the Board 
in discharging its duties effectively. The Board and its Committees 
have regular scheduled meetings. An overview of the activities of the 
Board and its Committees is contained within this report and that of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Terms of reference delineating a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive are in place and are 
reviewed on a regular basis. The Chairman is primarily responsible 
for the effective working of the Board and the Chief Executive for the 
operational management of the business. This includes development 
of the Group’s strategy and business model, the presentation of this 
to the Board and ultimately its implementation across the Group.  42

The Board and its Committees 
Board composition 
During the year, the Board comprised eight directors: Non Executive Chairman, Richard Jewson; four Executive Directors; and three Non Executive 
Directors. The Board considers all of the Non Executive Directors to be independent for the purposes of the Code, however having due regard 
for the tenure of Stephen Coe and David Moore, the Board, through its Nominations Committee recognise the importance of refreshing the Non 
Executives when it is appropriate to do so. Further information on the conclusions of the Nominations Committee can be found below. The Board 
considered the Chairman to be independent on appointment. The balance of skills and expertise of the Board ensures that no individual or group 
of individuals dominate the Board’s decision making, allowing for independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s deliberations. 
Christopher Sherwell is the Senior Independent Director of the Company.
Biographies for each director are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The full Board meets at least six times a year to consider general matters affecting the Company and otherwise as required. Committee 
meetings comprising any two or more Directors meet on an ad hoc basis to consider transactional and related matters concerning the 
Company’s business. During 2014, there were twelve such committee meetings. Meetings are generally held in Guernsey at the Group’s  
head office, however at least once a year, the Board will hold a formal meeting in Russia to review the Group’s operations and meet  
local management. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information, including briefing papers distributed  
in advance of any board meeting and regular management information. All of the Directors are entitled to have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense where they deem it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. On appointment,  
a Director receives advice from the Company’s financial and other professional advisers as to the affairs of the Company and their responsibilities, 
an estimation of time commitments necessary to undertake the role and a commitment to receive other such training and induction as may  
be appropriate.

Effectiveness 
Board performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes annual performance evaluations of its own  
and its Committees’ activities. These are led by the Chairman  
and where dealing with his own performance, by the Senior 
Independent Director.
The performance evaluations during 2014 were undertaken internally, 
which included face to face interviews with each of the directors 
and included group discussions on the themes which arose from 
the interviews. It was concluded that the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and individual Directors was effective and the Board 
had the necessary balance of skills, expertise, independence and 
knowledge required to direct the business. 
The Board and Nominations Committee consider annually the 
composition of the Board and its Committees with reference to the 
Group’s needs and also the requirements of the Code. In accordance 
with the Code, all Directors will be put forward for re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting. Having considered the balance of 
skills, expertise and performance of the Board, its committees and 
individual Directors, the Board recommends each Director for  
re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Anton Bilton, Christopher 
Sherwell and Richard Jewson, who is Chairman. The Committee 
undertakes an annual review of any succession planning and 
ensures that the membership and composition of the Board and its 
Committees are constituted appropriately in light of the requirements 
of the Group, with the necessary balance of skills, expertise, 
independence and diversity to undertake their roles effectively. The 
Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its Committees 
in light of the Code. The Committee agreed that no formal policy will 
be adopted to meet any diversity targets, including gender, as this 
could be unfairly prejudicial and bias the opinions and judgements 
of the Board and its Committees in a selection process with any 
proposed appointment made on merit and giving due consideration 
to the existing Board composition. 
The Committee came to the conclusion that, although it was 
satisfied with the balance of skills and expertise of the Board, it was 
appropriate, given the tenure of Stephen Coe and David Moore, 
that an additional two Non Executive Directors should be sought. 
Two suitable candidates where put forward to be considered by the 
Committee. No search agency or advertising was used in sourcing 
these appointments. Interviews and meetings were held with the 
Chairman, Executive team and the Senior Independent Director to 
ensure that the individuals had the relevant experience to add value 
to the activities of the business and complement the skills of the 
existing Board members while adding a fresh view and approach. 
Following the rapid deterioration in the oil price and Rouble at the 
end of 2014, the Committee agreed that it was in the Company’s 
and shareholders’ best interests to defer proposing new Board 
appointments until the current volatility in the Russian market 
stabilises. The Committee concluded that the experience in dealing 
with previous financial crises and challenges the Group has faced 
was necessary at this time. It will however keep this under review and 
should the operating environment stabilise the appointments will  
be reconsidered.
Diversity
The Nominations Committee consider the experience, background, 
age and tenure of each individual to contribute to the diversity of  
the Board, its Committees and the wider Group. When recruiting 
across the Group, appointments are made on merit, ensuring the  
best candidates are appointed to support the operating activities  
of the Group.

The Chief Executive, Executive Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer are the Company’s points of contact for investors, fund managers, 
analysts, the press and other interested parties. The Company’s investor relations programme includes formal presentations of the annual and 
interim results, as well as regular analyst briefings and meetings. 
The Board receives updates on the Company’s investor relations activities including any reports prepared by the Company’s brokers, external 
analyst papers, and details of any shareholder meetings.
The Board are pleased that many of the Group’s larger shareholders are signatories to the Stewardship Code and thus fully engage directly with 
the Company on behalf of their investors, rather than relying on external agencies.
The Board believes that sustainable financial performance and delivering on the objectives of the Company are key measures in building trust 
with the Company’s shareholders. To promote a clear understanding of the Company, its objectives and financial results, the Board ensures that 
information relating to the Company is disclosed in a timely manner and in a format suitable to the shareholders of the Company. The Company’s 
website has been developed to facilitate communication with all shareholders. Communication through these means allows our investors to 
receive information in a timely and cost effective manner.

Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility covers many different aspects of business but our primary focus is on the environmental impact of our activities 
and properties and the social impact in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is the responsibility of the Board to manage the 
environmental, economic and social impact of the Group’s business strategy.
The Board recognises that the way its investment properties are designed, built, managed and occupied can significantly influence their impact 
on the environment and the community in which they are located and it seeks to manage these issues. Although the Group is not required 
by statute to provide detailed reports on its environmental impact, the Board considers this an issue that must be monitored and warrants 
disclosure. Last year we started to disclose levels of greenhouse gas emissions, as required by Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.  
In this report we also include electricity consumption in our offices in Moscow, Cyprus and Guernsey, and business travel. 
The Board also recognises the social impact of its operations in each of its key jurisdictions, Russia, Guernsey and Cyprus. In Russia, this is 
particularly evident in the employment opportunities that are created in the communities where the Group’s properties are located. Staff are 
encouraged to participate in community and charitable activities and the Board has established a fund to support local causes or charities,  
which meet the corporate values of the Group. During 2014 the Group invested around $300k to support various causes from national and  
local charities to supporting local community sports groups. No political donations were made during the year.
Greenhouse Gases 
We commissioned Trucost to assist in compiling our report to comply with the Mandatory Greenhouse Gases Reporting Regulations (GHG). 
Energy consumption information was collated from all twelve warehouses in the portfolio and our three offices in Moscow, Cyprus and Guernsey. 
We also collected office car mileage and business travel of the Group’s employees to report on Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.  
The report covers 100% of our portfolio by warehouse floor area.
The table below sets out the emissions table collated and the intensity ratio agreed at tonnes / sqm of floor area for the last two years.

Data collection and methodology protocol
The Group used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for compiling its GHG data, and includes the following material GHG’s: CO2, N2O and 
CH4. The Group used the following emission conversion factor sources:
• Natural gas: DEFRA 2014 conversion factor for cubic meters natural gas
• Diesel: DEFRA 2014 conversion factor for litres diesel
• Office car: DEFRA 2014 conversion factor for kilometres of unknown fuel (average car)
• Purchased electricity: IEA Fuel Combustion (Highlights 2014 Edition) and EIA Foreign Electricity Emission Factors
• District heating: electricity factors were adjusted using the same ratio as between UK electricity, and district heating (from DEFRA 2014 
conversion factors for UK electricity, and district heat and steam)
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions increased in 2014 by 15% and 27%, respectively. However, a large increase in Scope 2 emission was mainly 
attributable to the change in conversion factor published by IEA, as underlying electricity consumption grew by only 7% over the same period, 
reflective of the increased warehouse space and occupancy in the period.
Although tenants are the end users of the energy consumed, we consider this an important metric to measure. Not only does this make our 
buildings more attractive to tenants and funders but also the more energy efficient our buildings are the less greenhouse gas production occurs 
at our sites. 
As our relations with key tenants become more established we are working with them to anticipate their requirements, with specifically designed 
buildings. In the case of energy intensive uses, such as cold storage, this allows a more efficient building to be constructed compared to the 
adaptation of a standard warehouse unit.
Other examples of increased efficiency include adopting low energy lighting in our new warehouses and new developments are being assessed 
by BREEAM, the worlds longest established and most widely used method of assessing, rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings. Our 
aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our developments and use the results of BREEAM assessments to provide practical ideas for future 
and existing development projects.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 48
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on 
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Business Strategy
The Company has had a simple business strategy since its 
incorporation: to build an investment portfolio of grade A 
warehouses in Russia, that delivers progressive distributions to our 
shareholders. Our remuneration policies for Executive Directors 
and Senior Management are driven by that strategy in a way that is 
also transparent and simple. Targets set underpin our ability to pay 
progressive cash covered distributions. The cornerstone has been 
avoiding cash incentives and maximising share based incentives 
so that progressive distributions become an important element of 
Executive Directors’ and Senior Management’s annual income. The 
Executive team has been successful in implementing this business 
strategy in the four years to 31 December 2014 but as explained in the 
Strategic Report, the year end balance sheet is showing the effects of 
the pressure on the Russian economy from the rapid decrease in oil 
price and Rouble depreciation over the year end, exacerbated by the 
continuing international sanctions.
Performance Outcomes
The impact of Rouble depreciation on our balance sheet masks  
very good trading results in 2014 in difficult trading conditions.  
The property team has maintained portfolio occupancy at 97% on 
a like for like basis, with almost 100% recovery of rental income due 
at the year end and has completed 107,000sqm of new space at 
Nova Riga and Noginsk on time and on budget. The finance team 
has successfully refinanced the most expensive debt facilities in the 
Group, reducing our cost of debt to 7.0% and building a cash war 
chest of $247million at today’s date. Based on the trading results,  
the targets for the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 
(“Current CBLTIS”) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for the 
period just concluded have been met. The proposed final distribution 
to ordinary shareholders of 3.5p per share increases annual 
distributions by 20%. 
As our share price followed both the oil price and the Rouble down 
at the year end, annual Total Shareholder Return has swung into 
negative territory for the first time in 3 years. Rather than being a 
reaction to 2014 operating results however, the share price decrease 
at the year end is a reflection of market expectations for the Russian 
economy in a low oil price, weak Rouble environment. The Committee 
has taken into account the high balance sheet liquidity, weighted 
terms to maturity for both debt and leases and tactical decisions 
made by the Executive Team in relation to potential acquisitions and 
LETTER FROM THE 
REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE
Remuneration Decisions
The performance in 2014 means that 100% of the share incentive 
available for the Executives and senior management will be issued. 
The Committee has no reason not to recommend the vesting of these 
awards. In line with policy, increases in base salaries for Executives 
have been limited to inflation and no cash bonuses are available. 
As explained in the 2013 Annual Report, performance targets for 2014 
were increased to ensure no benefit was received from the reduced 
preference share coupon following the preference share conversion 
to ordinary shares at the end of 2013.
New Remuneration Policy
The Current CBLTIS and LTIP came to an end in 2014. A new 
Remuneration Policy and Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive 
Scheme (“New CBLTIS”) was presented to shareholders at the AGM in 
May 2014. The New CBLTIS follows the same principles as the Current 
CBLTIS and is described in the Remuneration Policy table below. 
Changes include an adjustment to the calculation of the operating 
cash flow targets to eliminate the cash impact of deposits and rents 
received in advance and the introduction of a deferred award based 
on share price instead of a Total Shareholder Return fall back. The 
share price objective was requested by shareholders in discussions 
prior to presentation of the New CBLTIS at the AGM. All other policies 
will remain the same as in the previous Remuneration Policy. 
In the previous three years, some proxy voting agencies have 
criticised what seem to be easily achievable targets. But it should be 
recalled that the Current CBLTIS was designed against the backdrop of 
the uncertainties coming out of the last financial crisis. Results since 
speculative development in the last quarter of the year in considering 
performance outcomes. The approach of the Executives has 
placed the Company in a good position to deal with the issues that 
continuing economic and persistent political uncertainty may create. 
Details of the incentive schemes are given in the Remuneration Policy 
table and the summary of targets and performance is:
2014  
Performance
Maximum  
Target
CBLTIS - Operating cash  
inflow after interest
$85million $73million
LTIP - Total shareholder return  
(three years to March 2014)
220% 17.1% then have exceeded all expectations. The New CBLTIS was designed 
at a time where new uncertainties had arisen following the situation 
in Ukraine and the international sanctions employed against Russia. 
The impact of the subsequent oil price drop and Rouble depreciation 
make the future performance targets extremely difficult to achieve. 
One further point: it is important to emphasise that the majority of 
the remuneration of the Executive team and senior management 
in the last three years has been share based. The Directors have 
a required holding period for their shares, and are expected to 
hold for the long term. In practice, moreover it would be difficult 
for an Executive Director to liquidate a large proportion of their 
holding at any one time. We therefore believe that the “single figure” 
requirements in the remuneration disclosures can be misleading 
as they imply that the Directors have received the specified cash 
amount. Cash remuneration consists of only basic salary, pension 
contributions and benefits. It is inherent in our remuneration scheme 
that Executives share the risk of share price performance with 
shareholders.
The Executive Team go into the coming period as significant 
shareholders and that can only help them focus on maintaining 
shareholder value in difficult times.

Remuneration Policy and Strategy 
The Group’s remuneration policy supports the corporate strategy 
of building an investment portfolio which allows cash covered 
progressive distributions to be made to our shareholders. As with any 
remuneration policy we must be able to attract, retain and incentivise 
high calibre executives and senior staff whilst aligning their interests 
with those of shareholders and other stakeholders in the business.  
We strive to keep the remuneration structure as simple and 
transparent as possible in meeting these objectives. 
The policy:
• is weighted towards long term share ownership;
• does not include any cash bonus element for Executive Directors or 
senior management;
• is based on clear performance targets which underpin progressive 
distributions over three years; and
• ensures that the distributions become an important element of the 
Executives’ and senior management annual income as shareholders 
in the business.

package of the Executive Directors for 2015:

Combined Bonus 
and Long Term 
Incentive Scheme 
for 2015-2017 
(“New CBL TIS “)
A simple and 
transparent 
scheme with 
targets linked 
directly to the 
Company’s 
strategy of 
progressive 
distributions.
Encourages 
long term share 
ownership for key 
individuals.
No cash bonuses will be paid with reference to 
performance in the three years to 31 December 2017.
One award, in ordinary shares, is granted at the 
commencement of the scheme. Up to 75% then vest 
annually over the three years (25% each year) subject 
to the achievement of an operating cash inflow target 
and 25% vest at the end of the three year period 
subject to the achievement of a share price target.
Awards under the scheme must be held for at least 
three years following each vesting date, other than 
the sale of shares to meet related personal tax 
obligations or participation in tender offer buy backs.
However the Committee expects that Executives 
will hold the majority of shares awarded for the long 
term.
Financial misstatement which resulted in the 
overstatement of vesting plans in prior years will 
result in the claw back of awards.
The equivalent of 35million ordinary 
shares is held for the maximum awards 
over the three years of the scheme for 
up to 30 employees. Including these 
shares, 8.2% of the Company’s capital 
instruments will have been used in 
incentive schemes and 4.3% will have 
been allocated to Executive Directors 
on a 10 year rolling average.
The maximum allocation vesting 
annually in any year for Executives in 
the equivalent of ordinary shares is:
A Bilton  1,125,000
G Hirsch 1,125,000
M Sinclair 1,000,000
C Smith 1,000,000
At the ordinary share price on the day 
of grant this represents a maximum of 
percentage of basic salary of:
A Bilton 153% 
G Hirsch 153%
M Sinclair 219%
C Smith 246%
The maximum allocation on the 
amount deferred until the end of the 
three year period for Executives in the 
equivalent of ordinary shares is:
A Bilton 1,125,000
G Hirsch 1,125,000
M Sinclair 1,000,000
C Smith 1,000,000
At the ordinary share price at the date 
of grant this also represents a maximum 
of percentage of basic salary of: 
A Bilton 153% 
G Hirsch 153%
M Sinclair 219%
C Smith 246%
Assuming that the deferred element is 
spread over the three year performance 
period this means the maximum awards 
represent between 204% and 328% of 
current basic salary for Executives.
The grant price is the market value 
of shares on the date the CBLTIS was 
approved at the AGM.
Annual awards are based on progressive numerical targets for operating 
cash inflow after interest and working capital movements.
This equates to the Group’s ability to pay a progressive, cash covered 
distribution.
Operating cash inflow after interest is defined as “Net cash generated from 
operating activities plus interest received less borrowing costs paid less 
dividends on preference shares” , all as defined in the audited cash flow 
statement of the Group. This calculation is adjusted for cash working capital 
movements relating to rents received in advance and tenant deposits so 
that it better approximates to operating cash generated from that year’s 
operations. These amounts are taken from the notes to the audited accounts. 
Borrowing costs are adjusted for any element capitalised as part of 
construction programmes. 
The operating cash inflow after interest targets and percentage vesting for 
each year are the following:
For 2015:
25% $60m
100% $85m
For 2016:
25% $60m
100% $95m
For 2017:
25% $60m
100% $110m
No awards vest below the 25% level and awards vest on a straight line basis 
between the upper and lower targets.
The 25% deferred element will vest on 31 December 2017 if the share price 
trades at £1 or above for any consecutive 30 day period over the three years 
to 31 December 2017. 
The Remuneration Committee 
has no discretion over awards 
granted. 
Should the achievement of 
performance targets during 
the performance period 
not reflect shareholder 
experience, the Committee 
has discretion to reduce or 
extinguish the quantum of 
awards vesting.
If a participant has 
contributed to serious 
reputational damage to 
the Company or any act 
has resulted in serious 
misconduct, fraud or financial 
misstatement, the Committee 
again has discretion to reduce 
or extinguish the quantum of 
awards vesting.

Clawback
Financial misstatement which resulted in overstatement of vesting of plans in previous years would result in clawback.
Performance Measures
The CBLTIS performance measure of operating cash inflow was chosen as the best approximation of cash available for distribution to 
shareholders. 
The target which, if achieved, would entail the lowest level of vesting was set at $60 million of operating cash flow after interest which equates to 
the same US Dollar value of distributions made to ordinary shareholders in 2013. Thus the minimum target maintains the 2013 cash generation 
against a backdrop of low oil prices, weak Rouble, international sanctions and falling market rents.
The target which, if achieved, would pay out the maximum amount, has been set on the assumption that the political situation is resolved 
peaceably and the market environment allows for organic growth and earnings accretive acquisitions. It also assumes lease maturities are 
renewed at appropriate market rental levels.
General Remuneration Policy
The main difference between the remuneration policy for Directors and the remuneration policy for employees is the payment of cash bonuses. 
Directors do not receive cash bonuses while general employees do. Depending on their role, some senior management receive share based 
incentives only and some have a mix of share and cash bonus incentives. Other employees receive basic salary and cash bonuses. Basic salary 
increases for all employees including Directors, are linked to inflation. The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees when 
setting Directors’ Remuneration.
Potential Remuneration for Directors 
The bar charts below show the potential remuneration which each Director could receive if performance in 2015 was below target thresholds,  
if performance was in line with expectations and the maximum that could be received if expectations are exceeded. Share based remuneration  
is valued at the share price at the date of grant and does not take account of share price appreciation or accrued distributions.
The minimum amount of remuneration is the fixed element comprising basic salary, pension and benefits. On target remuneration assumes  
25% vesting of the variable remuneration. The maximum remuneration assumes full vesting of the incentive schemes, not including the  
deferred element.

Recruitment and Exit Policies
Summary details of the Executive Directors’ and Non Executive Directors’ service contracts are given later in this report. Recruitment of new 
Directors would be based on the same terms as the existing service contracts. No additional remuneration would be offered as an incentive to 
join and the composition of remuneration would be based on the same components as existing Directors.
Exit policies for the elements of remuneration are summarised in the table below:
Component Good Leaver* Bad Leaver* Change of Control
Basic Salary and Benefits 12 months notice period. No notice period or payment in 
lieu of notice.
150% of the normal notice 
provisions for basic salary.
Annual Bonus Pro rata payment based on the 
previous year’s award, payable at 
the discretion of the Committee.
No award. Pro rata payment based on the 
previous year’s award.
CBLTIS Awards not vested 
forfeited except in certain 
circumstances.**
Awards not vested forfeited. All subsisting awards vest.
Shareholder Views
The view of shareholders is sought prior to any significant change to the Remuneration Policy. Prior to the introduction of the New CBLTIS scheme, 
the views of shareholders holding over 60% of ordinary shares (67% not including Directors) were taken into account prior to formal presentation at 
the AGM. It was at the insistence of certain shareholders that the deferred element of the New CBLTIS was included.
*Bad leaver provisions relate to termination of employment for the reason of gross misconduct including breach of obligation, bankruptcy and disqualification as a director. A good leaver covers 
all other circumstances.
**If a scheme participant ceases employment due to ill health or disability, redundancy as determined by the Committee or retirement, awards not vested shall continue in effect and vest on the 
original vesting dates if performance targets are met. The Committee has discretion to reduce awards with reference to the period of time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date the 
participant ceases employment. 56

subscriptions payable.
2. Pensions are cash payments made to Executive Directors, either directly or to their pension scheme.
3. LTIP share awards have an exercise price of 25p. 
4. Valuation at vesting for 2014 assumes the price of the shares at the end of the relevant financial period for the CBLTIS plus accumulated dividends or distributions. The CBLTIS awards are 
shown in the year of the related performance targets. The 2013 estimated figure has been restated to reflect the actual share price at the date of vesting.

2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP)
This scheme is closed to new participants and no further awards can be made. All employees of the Group were eligible to receive invitations to 
participate in this plan and the EBT held 10 million ordinary shares reserved for the purpose. The options it granted over these shares vest in three 
equal tranches, subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 24 March 2013 and 24 March 2014.
Performance criteria for each tranche are based on meeting a target of total shareholder return of 7.5% over UK RPI in each of the following three 
year periods, with a starting share price of 25p:
• 24 March 2009 to 24 March 2012;
• 24 March 2010 to 24 March 2013; and
• 24 March 2011 to 24 March 2014.
Dividends roll up during the vesting period and options granted under this scheme have an exercise price of 25p.
For the period 24 March 2010 to 24 March 2014, total shareholder return was 220% and the target total shareholder return for the period was 
17.09%. Therefore the tranche available for 2014 vested.

Percentage increase in remuneration in 2014 compared with remuneration in 2013
The increase for all employees in the year, on a like for like basis, was 5.65%.
The information in the previous table illustrates the effectiveness of the focus on share based rewards. A high percentage of the CEO’s and 
other Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are share based and a significant percentage of the increase in packages relates to successful 
business performance and the resulting increase between grant price and vesting price of awards. The LTIP share price at grant was 23.5p and the 
vesting prices in 2013 and 2014 were 71p and 70p respectively. The share price at grant for the CBLTIS was 59.5p and at the year end was 47.5p.

The graph above shows the performance of the Group ordinary shares over the last six years versus FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 350 indices. Despite 
the strong financial results, the Company’s ordinary share price dropped by 40% in 2014, the majority following the rapid decrease in oil price 
and significant Rouble depreciation. The table compares the trend in CEO’s remuneration package over the same period. As explained in the 
Business Model section of the Strategy Report, we struggle to find comparable property company indices given the geographical market we 
operate in.

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT
Audit Committee Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2014. This report sets out the work of the Committee 
throughout the year.
During the year, the Committee’s role continued to be:
• monitoring of the integrity of the Group’s financial statements;
• reviewing the significant areas of judgement included in the financial statements;
• reviewing the role of the external auditors, including independence and remuneration; and
• monitoring the quality of the Group’s internal controls and risk management functions.
We have also reported to the Board on whether the Committee believes that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable.
During the year the Committee met with the external auditors, with and without management present, to assess the audit approach, audit 
independence and the working relationship between the Group auditor and management. We also had telephone discussions with Jones Lang 
LaSalle (“JLL”), the Group’s appointed independent valuers, to discuss the property portfolio, valuation methodology and more generally, the 
market conditions in the locations in which the Group operates.
In both cases, we believe that the working relationship is good and that the management approach and estimates are appropriately challenged. 
As explained in the report below, we have also assessed the ongoing engagement of our auditor and valuers and recommended their continuing 
appointment in the current financial year.
We also review the business risk and internal control frameworks regularly. The current situation in Russia, following the drop in oil prices, Rouble 
depreciation and continuing international sanctions, has obviously had a significant impact on the Group balance sheet and the implications 
have been discussed at length by the Board. The assessment is summarised in the Strategic report and Corporate Governance sections of the 
Annual Report.
Stephen Coe
Chairman
Audit Committee
8 March 2015 63
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported. The 
Committee reviews the annual and interim financial statements, the 
accounting policies of the Group, key areas of accounting judgement, 
management information statements, financial announcements, 
internal control systems, risk management, and the continuing 
appointment of the Group auditor. It also monitors the whistle 
blowing policy and procedures for fraud and bribery.
The Committee comprises David Moore, Christopher Sherwell and 
Stephen Coe (Chairman). The Chairman is considered to have recent 
and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code. The 
Committee meets at least twice a year. There are a number of regular 
attendees at meetings of the Audit Committee, including other 
members of the Board, senior management and the Group’s external 
auditor. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external 
Group auditor without management present.
The Committee met twice during 2014 and addressed:
• the recommendation to the Board to approve the 2013 annual and 
2014 interim financial statements following consideration of the 
key areas of judgement;
• the appointment, remuneration and continued independence of 
the external auditor; and
• the monitoring of the Group’s internal control procedures and risk 
management.
The action taken on these areas is expanded on below.
External Audit and Valuations 
External Audit 
During the year, the Committee has considered the appointment, 
compensation, performance and independence of the Group’s 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”).
EY was appointed in 2008 following a tender process and this is their 
seventh year of tenure as Group auditor. The current lead partner 
has been in place for four years. Discussions with the auditor have 
commenced on the succession plan for the audit lead partner once 
the five year tenure of the current partner is concluded.
The Committee met with the key members of the audit team 
throughout the year and EY has formally confirmed its continued 
independence as part of the interim and final financial statements 
process. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the lead 
audit partner outside of the formal meetings to discuss any issues 
arising in the course of the audit and to confirm no restrictions on 
scope are placed on them by management. The Chairman also has 
regular meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating 
Officer to discuss the audit approach, relationship with auditors and 
fee structure.
The external auditor prepares a detailed audit plan for the Committee 
which includes their assessment of the key risks impacting the 
financial statements. The Committee actively monitors these risks 
and obtains updates from the external auditor on the status of their 
procedures covering these risks throughout the year.
Local statutory audits of individual subsidiary companies are also 
required in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, being 
Guernsey, Cyprus, Russia and the UK. EY carry out these audits in 
Guernsey and Cyprus but trading entities in Russia and the UK are 
audited locally by Baker Tilly and Crowe Clark Whitehill respectively. 
The Committee believes that this gives a balance to our overall audit 
provision and added assurance to the audit process.
Non Audit Services 
EY has also provided non audit services to the Group where they 
are determined to be best placed to provide the particular service. 
The Committee has policies in place for the provision of non audit 
services and the external auditor will not be permitted to carry out 
services such as property valuation or accounting services. The non 
audit services provided are typically assignments, such as a review of 
the interim financial statements, tax advisory or transaction advisory 
services. As shown in note 6(b) to the financial statements, total 
fees payable to EY in the year to 31 December 2014 amounted to 
$1.76million, of which $0.54million was for non audit services.
Committee Conclusions 
The Committee has recommended a resolution for the re-
appointment of EY to be proposed to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. Proposed EU legislation on audit appointments 
including the approach to non audit services has been considered 
and relationships with other suppliers of non audit services have been 
established.
Valuers 
As with the external audit process, the Committee monitors the 
objectivity of the Group’s external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL”). 
We have had open discussion with the valuers during the year on 
the valuation process and the external auditor has direct access to 
them as part of the audit process. We also have the opportunity to 
see comparable valuations of part of the portfolio each year, where 
independent valuations are required for banking purposes and 
these are undertaken by other external independent valuers. During 
the year, valuation services were put out to tender and four service 
providers submitted proposals. The Committee and management 
agreed that JLL remained the most appropriate and experienced 
valuer for our sector and were re engaged for the year. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 64
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
Significant Issues Considered by the Audit Committee 
In recommending the approval of the 2014 financial statements, the Committee considered the following:
Matter Arising Action
Property Valuations
Valuations for investment property and investment property under 
construction are conducted by external valuers. The land bank is 
carried at Directors’ valuation.
Valuation movements can have a significant impact on the Group’s 
net asset value.
The Committee discussed the valuation approach with management, 
the external valuers and the external auditors.
The Committee also assesses the continuing independence and 
objectivity of the valuers. The external auditors have direct access 
to the external valuer and comment on the key assumptions and 
movements on property valuations. The Committee considered and 
compared the views of all of the above together with independent 
market information available and was satisfied that the judgement 
used was appropriate. Given the economic situation in Russia at the 
year end, JLL has included an uncertainty paragraph in their valuation 
report. The Committee considered the implications of this with the 
valuers and the auditors and ensured that there was appropriate 
disclosure in the annual report.
Exchange Rate and Credit Risk
The rapid depreciation of the Rouble at the year end had a significant 
effect on the carrying value of the Group’s assets. It also increases the 
Group’s credit risk as US Dollar pegged rents become less affordable 
for tenants.
The Committee discussed the impact of the Rouble depreciation on 
the Group’s business with management and external auditors. It also 
discussed the audit approach with the external auditors including 
enhanced reviews of the credit worthiness of the larger tenants and 
impact on going concern. It is satisfied that the annual report and 
accounts adequately explain the impact of the current economic 
situation in Russia and that going concern calculations have been 
appropriately sensitised.
Provisions and Acquisitions
The most significant provision previously recognised on the balance 
sheet relates to outstanding litigation inherited as part of an 
acquisition in 2012. The vendor dealt with the expected cost of this 
litigation, initially through indemnities backed by retentions held 
in escrow and latterly with a release of the escrow amounts as a 
reduction in the cost of the acquisition. 
Due to its contingent nature, the level of provision required is 
dependent on legal and management judgement. The Committee 
has discussed progress at length with management, and legal 
representation has been received confirming the outcome of the 
case. 
The Committee discussed any judgement made by management on 
the release and allocation of the provision and impact on acquisition 
accounting.
The Committee is satisfied with the both the release of the provision 
and acquisition accounting.

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
Internal Control and Risk Management  
The Board has overall responsibility for the systems of internal 
control and for reviewing their effectiveness throughout the Group. 
This is a continual process, in accordance with the guidance of the 
Turnbull Committee on internal controls, that identifies, evaluates 
and manages the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect 
the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. Such a system 
is designed to manage or reduce the effects of the possible risks 
to which the Group’s activities are subject, rather than providing 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Consideration of risks and risk management form an integral part of 
the Board’s deliberations and are key to its decision making processes. 
There are risks which the Board have no control over. These are mainly 
overriding external risks such as the wider economic environment, 
however the impact of such risks and the effect that they have on 
the Group are considered and mitigated to the extent possible. The 
strategic decisions of the Group are adjusted to address these issues 
ensuring that threats are reduced and opportunities are exploited. 
Key features of the risk management process in place during the year 
and up to the date of the annual report and financial statements 
include:
• a comprehensive system of reporting and business planning;
• a defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board;
• an organisational structure chart with clearly defined levels of 
authority and division of responsibilities;
• formal documented policies and procedures throughout the 
Group;
• the close involvement of the Executive Directors and senior 
management in all aspects of the day-to-day operations, including 
regular meetings to review all operational aspects of the business 
and risk management systems;
• the Board’s review of Group strategy and progress against 
objectives throughout the year;
• a formal whistle blowing policy;
• a comprehensive and robust system of financial reporting which 
includes regular management information, such as budgets, re-
forecasts, cash flows, treasury reporting and management accounts 
with review of financial KPIs; and
• a regular assessment of risks within the business at all operational 
levels.
The Audit Committee has established a Risk Committee to carry out 
the review and assessment of risks associated with the business. This 
Committee comprises Executive Directors and senior management 
involved in each operating jurisdiction and department of the Group. 
This engenders a culture of risk assessment within the Group and 
reinforces the strategic objectives communicated by the Board. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Risk Committee met 
six times. 
The Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee on 
its deliberations and findings. The risks and uncertainties to which 
the Group is subject are reviewed and considered by the Audit 
Committee and the Board at regular intervals, particularly with 
reference to the strategic objectives of the business. The principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group are included elsewhere in the 
Annual Report.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of these 
systems of internal control and has reported its findings to the Board 
throughout the year and up to the date of the Annual Report and 
financial statements.
Due to its size, structure and the nature of its activities, the Group 
does not have an internal audit function. The Committee has revisited 
its previous decision and concluded that there is no need for a 
separate internal audit function at this time but will continue to  
keep this matter under review. This view is supported by the Board 
given the stable nature and trading activities as an investment 
property group and the relatively small number of individual assets  
in the portfolio. 66

Going Concern
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings are described in the Financial Review and the notes to the 
accompanying financial statements. In addition, in note 35 there is a description of the Group’s objectives and policies for managing its capital, 
financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
During the year the Group continued to hold substantial cash and short term deposits. The property portfolio is running at high occupancy levels 
with a weighted average time to lease maturity of 4.2 years, stable rental income streams and overhead base. Debt facilities have a weighted 
average time to maturity of 4.8 years at 31 December 2014.
The Board receive monthly updates on future cash flow projections and have regular working capital reports presented, in particular, as part of 
the half year and full year reporting process. The Group has historically maintained significant cash which, in the current climate will provide the 
Group with the resources to deal with market uncertainties and the potential impact of geopolitical issues. After making appropriate enquiries 
and examining sensitivities that could give rise to financial exposure, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparation of these financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities 
Guernsey company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and IFRS as adopted by 
the EU. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and each has taken 
all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities below has been prepared in connection with the Company’s full Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. 
The Board confirms to the best of its knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; 
the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; 
and
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 
December 2014 and of its loss for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of Raven Russia Limited 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 
38. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 
2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team, together with our audit response to the risk:
Risk How the scope of our audit addressed the risk
Impact of uncertainties over the current economic 
environment in Russia (as described in the Strategic Report)
The current geopolitical situation remains an important area of 
focus for the Group and our audit. Continuing escalation of political 
and economic tension between the US, EU and Russia, together 
with recent movements in the oil price, have resulted in an 
economic slowdown, deterioration of liquidity in Russia’s banking 
sector and devaluation of its national currency. 
There is a risk that the impact of these events on the financial 
statements has not been adequately considered. In particular the 
impact on the valuation of investment property and the impact on 
cash flow forecasts used to assess going concern.
We performed the following audit procedures around the impact 
of uncertainties over the current economic environment in Russia:
We built an understanding of the current economic environment in 
Russia through:
• Discussions with management and EY professionals in Moscow 
and London, including valuation and financing experts and 
other teams involved in the audit of businesses operating in 
Russia;
• Performance of press searches in Russia and the UK and 
reviewing economic forecasts.
We assessed the impact of the uncertainties on the assessment of 
fair value of investment property and investment property under 
construction and the future trading and cash flow forecasts for the 
Group by applying a number of negative sensitivities to the cash 
flow forecasts prepared by management.
We documented our understanding of the areas of the Group’s 
internal control environment that respond to these specific risks.
We performed tests of compliance with banking terms and 
covenants at the year end and the forecast compliance with 
covenants, by applying negative sensitivities to the covenant 
compliance forecast prepared by management.
We assessed the impact of these uncertainties on the assumptions 
supporting the going concern basis of preparation.
Misstatement of the fair value of investment properties and 
investment properties under construction (as described in 
the Audit Committee Report and note 3 and 13 of the financial 
statements).
The valuation of investment property and investment property 
under construction requires significant judgements and estimates 
by management and the external valuer. 
The uncertainties over the current economic environment in Russia 
had an impact on the valuation of the Group’s properties. In the 
current year, as referred to in note 13, JLL have highlighted in their 
assessment of the fair value of the property portfolio that there 
is limited transactional evidence and less certainty with regard to 
valuations and that market values can change rapidly in the current 
market conditions. Accordingly, they have stated that it has been 
necessary to make more judgements than is usually required.
We performed the following audit procedures around the valuation 
of investment properties and investment properties under 
construction:
We confirmed our understanding of the Group’s valuation process 
and controls over data used in the valuation of its property portfolio.
We performed site visits to a sample of properties.
We performed testing over source documentation provided by the 
Group to the external valuer, including lease data.
We assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the 
external valuer.
With the support of our Chartered Surveyors in Russia and the UK, we:
• Challenged the valuation approach and the assumptions made 
by the external valuer and the directors in performing their 
valuation of each property;
• We conducted analytical procedures by reference to external 
market data to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuations 
adopted by the Group;
• We assessed and challenged the judgements made by JLL in light 
of the valuation uncertainties they highlight in their report in 
respect of limited transactional evidence and rapidly changing 
market conditions.
We met with the development director and assessed and 
challenged the forecast costs to complete included in the valuations 
by obtaining evidence to support these costs.
We have considered the impact of the current economic 
environment in Russia on the valuation of properties, including 
those uncertainties raised by JLL in their valuation report. 
We assessed the adequacy of the additional disclosures of estimates 
in note 3 and valuation assumptions in note 13.

uncertainties over the current economic and financial environment 
in Russia.
We performed the following audit procedures around the going 
concern assumption:
We reviewed the cash flow forecasts prepared by management 
to support their going concern conclusion and challenged the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions and considered their 
reasonableness in the context of other supporting evidence gained 
from our audit work.
We challenged the assumptions supporting the sensitivity analysis 
prepared by management.
We examined loan agreements to confirm that maturity dates and 
covenants are consistent with those used by management. 
We performed tests over the forecast compliance with covenants 
prepared by management by applying negative sensitivities.
Litigation in Toros (as described in the Audit Committee Report 
and note 24 of the financial statements).
The Group has been subject to litigation in its Toros subsidiary.
The main claim against Toros was resolved during 2014. The 
estimation of the interest to be paid to the claimant in connection 
with the other cases and the legal fees required judgement by 
management.
We performed the following audit procedures over the litigation in 
Toros.
We met with management to confirm our understanding of the 
status of the claim.
We obtained and examined legal documentation relevant to the 
claim.
We obtained and examined external legal advisors’ letters and 
opinions.
We challenged management’s estimation of the liability accrued at 
year end.
Revenue recognition (as described in note 2 of the financial 
statements).
We have identified the following risks related to the recognition of 
revenue: 
Property investment: risk that the rental revenue is not recorded 
in the correct period, including the effect of tenant incentives and 
contracted rent uplift balances. 
Roslogistics: risk that the logistics revenue is not recorded in the 
correct period.
Raven Mount: risk that sales are not recorded in the correct period.
For each segment we also identified a risk in connection to fraud 
and error. 
We performed the following audit procedures around revenue 
recognition:
We confirmed our understanding of the controls in place to 
prevent and detect fraud and errors in revenue recognition. 
We tested the controls in relation to rental and logistics income. 
We performed a detailed analytical review of rental and logistics 
income based upon quantitative expectations, formed using 
historical data and our understanding of the changes in rental and 
logistics income during the year. 
For the largest tenants, we performed a press search to assess the 
risk of default.
We obtained and examined the trade receivable ageing to assess 
the recoverability of receivables by testing subsequent cash 
receipts and confirming the credit worthiness of the tenants with 
outstanding rent.
We agreed the calculation of the IFRS rent adjustment to 
underlying lease and tenancy data.
We challenged the assessment of recoverability of the tenant lease 
incentive receivable balance by testing the credit worthiness of the 
major tenants.
We obtained and reviewed evidence supporting material inventory 
sales during the year.
We performed cut-off procedures on all revenue streams to confirm 
they had been recorded in the correct period.  71

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit 
and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining 
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement 
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the financial statements, would be changed or 
influenced. 
We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to 
determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a 
magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would 
be material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined 
materiality for the Group to be $3.4 million (2013: $3.2 million), which 
is approximately 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit (2013: 5% of adjusted 
pre-tax profit). We determined adjusted pre-tax profit adjusting the 
loss before tax to exclude the revaluation of investment property and 
investment property under construction and the foreign currency 
losses. This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and 
extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the 
risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and 
extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of 
the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall 
performance materiality for the Group should be 50% of materiality 
(2013: 75% of materiality), namely $1.7 million (2013: $2.4 million). 
The decrease in overall performance materiality compared to 2013 is 
due to the increase in the risk relating to the economic and political 
environment in Russia as described above.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of $0.17 million (2013: $0.16 
million). We also agreed to report differences below those thresholds 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group has operations in Russia, Cyprus, the United Kingdom 
and Guernsey. Our testing is performed on a consolidated basis 
using thresholds which are determined with reference to the Group 
performance materiality and the risks of material misstatement 
identified. We performed procedures at each of the Group components. 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or by 
component auditors from another EY global network firm operating 
under our instructions. For the Group entities incorporated in Cyprus, 
specific scope work on cash, intercompany and tax balances was 
performed by EY Cyprus. We determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current year’s audit cycle a visit was undertaken by the 
Group team, including the senior statutory auditor, to the component 
team in Cyprus. This visit involved discussing the audit approach 
with the component team and any issues arising from the work. The 
Group audit team interacted regularly with the component team 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and 
was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, 
together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, 
gave us appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements.
The overall audit strategy is determined by the senior statutory 
auditor, Nick Gomer. The senior statutory auditor is based in the UK 
but, since the Group has operations in Russia, the Group audit team 
includes members from both the UK and Russia. Members of the 
Group team in both jurisdictions work together as an integrated 
team throughout the audit process. The Group audit performed 
on balances related to the valuation of investment property and 
investment property under construction and income tax was also 
supported by EY Moscow experts. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual 
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated 
to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed.
Under the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review.

GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT 80
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
1. General information
Raven Russia Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together 
the “Group”) is a property investment group specialising in 
commercial real estate in Russia.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey under the 
provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The Company’s 
registered office is at 1 Le Truchot, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 6EH.
The audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2014 were authorised by the Board for issue on  
8 March 2015.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by 
the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, section 244, not to prepare 
company financial statements as group financial statements have 
been prepared for both current and prior periods. The group 
financial statements are presented in US Dollars and all values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($’000) except where 
otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
group financial statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
adopted for use in the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Companies 
(Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the 
previous financial year. The Group has adopted new and amended 
IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2014, which had no 
impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published that are mandatory for later 
accounting periods and which have not been adopted early. These are:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2017) 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
The Group is currently assessing the impact of these changes on 
its financial statements and the effect of this, if any, has yet to be 
determined.
The standards, amendments or revisions are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after the dates noted above.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and the special 
purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) controlled by the Company, made up to 
31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
or ownership of the investee entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. 
The Group has acquired investment properties through the purchase 
of SPVs. In the opinion of the Directors, these transactions did not 
meet the definition of a business combination as set out in IFRS 3 
“Business Combinations” . Accordingly the transactions have not 
been accounted for as an acquisition of a business and instead 
the financial statements reflect the substance of the transactions, 
which is considered to be the purchase of investment property and 
investment property under construction.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
entities acquired to bring the accounting policies into line with those 
used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination 
over the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair values of assets 
given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued. For business 
combinations after 1 January 2010, transaction costs associated with 
an acquisition are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill is capitalised with any impairment in carrying value being 
charged to the Income Statement. Impairment tests on goodwill are 
undertaken annually at the financial year end. Impairment charges 
are included in the administrative expenses line item in the Income 
Statement. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Where the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the cost of the combination, 
the resulting negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement.
NOTES TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of 
the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the activities require unanimous consent of the contracting parties for 
strategic financial and operating decisions.
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using 
the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in a 
joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share 
of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date. Any 
premium paid for an interest in a joint venture above the fair value 
of the Group’s share of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is determined as goodwill. Goodwill relating to a joint 
venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is 
neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of joint ventures is 
shown on the face of the Income Statement within Operating Profit 
and represents the profit or loss after tax.
Revenue recognition
(a) Property investment 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised in income on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental increases calculated 
with reference to an underlying index and the resulting rental income 
(“contingent rents”) are recognised in income as they are determined.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread 
evenly over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, 
together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to 
continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the directors 
are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
Premiums received to terminate leases are recognised in the Income 
Statement as they arise.
(b) Roslogistics  
Logistics revenue, excluding value added tax, is recognised as services 
are provided.
(c) Raven Mount 
The sale of completed property and land is recognised on legal 
completion.
Taxation
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel 
Islands, and is exempt from taxation. The Group is liable to Russian, 
UK and Cypriot tax arising on the results of its Russian, UK and 
Cypriot operations.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable  
and deferred tax.
(a) Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit (or loss) as reported in the 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income and 
expenditure that are taxable or deductible in other years and  
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
(b) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based 
on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income 
Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with  
in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
(c) Value added tax 
Revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the 
amount of value added tax except:
• where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 
the asset or as part of the expenditure item as applicable; and
• receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value 
added tax included.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, 
the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables, 
as appropriate, in the Balance Sheet.
Investment property and investment property under construction
Investment property comprises completed property and property 
under construction held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or 
both. Investment property comprises both freehold and leasehold 
land and buildings.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related 
transaction costs. After initial recognition, investment property is 
carried at fair value. The Directors assess the fair value of investment  82
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
property based on independent valuations carried out by their 
appointed property valuers or on independent valuations prepared 
for banking purposes. The Group has appointed Jones Lang LaSalle 
as property valuers to prepare valuations on a semi-annual basis. 
Valuations are undertaken in accordance with appropriate sections of 
the current Practice Statements contained in the Royal Institution  
of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 8th Edition 
(the “Red Book”). This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
property are included in the Income Statement in the period in which 
they arise. For the purposes of these financial statements, in order 
to avoid double counting, the assessed fair value is reduced by the 
present value of any tenant incentives and contracted rent uplifts that 
are spread over the lease term and increased by the carrying amount 
of any liability under a head lease that has been recognised in the 
Balance Sheet.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction 
of investment property are included in the cost of the property 
from the date of commencement of construction until 
construction is completed.
Leasing (as lessors)
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks 
and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. All of the Group’s properties are leased under 
operating leases and are included in investment property in the 
Balance Sheet.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories 
discussed below, depending upon the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets  
as held to maturity.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see financial 
liabilities policy for out-of-the-money derivatives), which are carried 
at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income 
Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Loans and receivables 
These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. In the case 
of the Group, loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables, loans, security deposits, restricted cash and cash and 
short term deposits.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition 
or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in 
administrative expenses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the 
impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment is recognised, the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any such reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and short term deposits include cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
comprises ordinary shares and warrants.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories 
listed below.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives, which 
are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in 
the Income Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities include interest bearing loans, trade 
payables (including rent deposits and retentions under construction 
contracts), preference shares and other short-term monetary 
liabilities. Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are 
initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing loans and preference shares are initially recorded 
at fair value net of direct issue costs and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are charged to the Income Statement using 
the effective interest rate method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a 
provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a 
separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Income 
Statement net of any reimbursement.
Own shares held
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income 
Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration is recognised in retained earnings.
Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group rewards its key management and other senior employees 
by a variety of means many of which are settled by ordinary or 
preference shares of the Company, these include the Executive Share 
Option Schemes and the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive 
Scheme 2012 to 2014.
Awards linked to or settled by ordinary shares 
These are accounted for as equity-settled transactions in accordance 
with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The cost of equity-settled  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
83
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date 
at which they are granted. Fair value is determined by an external 
valuer, using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance 
conditions (vesting conditions), other than performance conditions 
linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
Any other conditions, which are required to be met in order for an 
employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be 
non-vesting conditions. Like market conditions, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the fair value at grant date.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative 
expense that is recognised at each reporting date until the vesting 
date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The income statement expense or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional 
upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance and service conditions 
are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested 
on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where 
non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the 
employee are not met.
Awards linked to or settled by preference shares 
These awards are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits whereby the Group estimates the cost of awards using the 
projected unit credit method, which involves estimating the future 
value of the preference shares at the vesting date and the probability 
of the awards vesting. The resulting expense is charged to the 
Income Statement over the performance period and the liability is 
re-measured at each Balance Sheet date.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each Group entity are 
measured in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). For the 
Company the directors consider this to be Sterling. The presentation 
currency of the Group is United States Dollars, which the directors 
consider to be the key currency for the Group’s operations as a whole.
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange 
rates at the date of the initial transaction or when their fair values 
are reassessed.
(c) On consolidation 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet are translated at the 
closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet;
(ii) income and expenditure for each Income Statement are 
translated at the average exchange rate prevailing in the period 
unless this does not approximate the rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions in which case they are translated at the 
transaction date rates; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
On consolidation, the exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income. When a foreign entity is 
sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Income 
Statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s ordinary shareholders are recognised 
when they become legally payable. In the case of interim 
dividends, this is when declared by the directors. In the case of 
final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders 
at an AGM.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and judgements regarding the 
future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market 
conditions and other factors. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below.
Judgements other than estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies the 
following are considered to have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
(a) Acquisitions 
Properties can be acquired through the corporate acquisition of a 
subsidiary company. At the time of acquisition, the Group considers 
whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business.  
The Group accounts for the acquisition as a business combination 
where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the 
property. More specifically, consideration is made of the extent to 
which significant processes are acquired and the extent of ancillary 
services provided by the subsidiary.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, 
it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and 
liabilities. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets 
and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values, and no 
goodwill or deferred tax is recognised. 84
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(b) Recognition of deferred tax assets 
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is 
probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available 
in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can 
be deducted. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding 
the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax 
group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
(c) Acquisitions of investment property 
The consideration payable in respect of each acquisition is dependent 
upon certain future events. In calculating the cost of each acquisition 
the Group has assessed the most probable outcome as at the Balance 
Sheet date. These amounts are reconsidered annually at each year 
end. The assessments include consideration of the future rental levels 
and costs of construction of a property as well as the terms of the 
legal agreements governing each acquisition. Based on these factors 
management will consider whether a liability or a contingent liability 
should be recognised or disclosed at the Balance Sheet date.
Estimates
(a) Valuation of investment property and investment property  
under construction 
The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market 
for similar lease and other contracts. In the absence of such 
information, the Group determines the amount within a range 
of reasonable, fair value estimates. In making its estimation the 
Group considers information from a variety of sources and engages 
external, professional advisers to carry out third party valuations of 
its properties. The external valuations are completed in accordance 
with appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements 
contained in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal 
and Valuation Standards, 8th Edition (the “Red Book”). This is an 
internationally accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with 
the requirements of IFRS 13. In our market, where transactional 
activity is minimal, the valuers are required to use a greater degree 
of estimation or judgement than in a market where comparable 
transactions are more readily available. For the valuations at 31 
December 2014 the valuer has highlighted that as a result of market 
conditions at the valuation date it was necessary to make more 
judgements than is normally required.
The significant methods and assumptions used in estimating 
the fair value of investment property and investment property 
under construction are set out in note 13, along with detail of the 
sensitivities of the valuations to changes in the key inputs.
(b) Income tax 
As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Group 
is required to estimate the provision for income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves an estimation 
of the actual current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary 
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and 
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities, which are included in the Balance Sheet.
Russian tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations and 
changes, which may occur frequently. The interpretation of 
legislation that the Group applies to its transactions and activities 
may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. 
Additionally there may be inconsistent interpretation of tax 
regulations by various authorities, creating uncertainties in the 
taxation environment in Russia. Fiscal periods remain open to review 
by the authorities for the three calendar years preceding the years 
of review and in some circumstances may cover a longer period. 
Additionally, there have been instances where tax regulations have 
taken effect retrospectively.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for 
income tax and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
4. Segmental information
The Group has three operating segments, which are managed and 
report independently to the Board of the Group. These comprise:
Property Investment - acquire, develop and lease commercial 
property in Russia 
Roslogistics - provision of warehousing, transport, customs brokerage 
and related services in Russia 
Raven Mount - sale of residential property in the UK
Financial information relating to Property Investment is provided to 
the Board on a property by property basis. The information provided 
is gross rentals, operating costs, net operating income, revaluation 
gains and losses and where relevant the profit or loss on disposal 
of an investment property. The individual properties have similar 
economic characteristics and are aggregated into a single reporting 
segment.
Information about Raven Mount provided to the Board comprises the 
gross sale proceeds, inventory cost of sales and gross profit, including 
the share of profits or losses of its joint venture.
Roslogistics is an independently managed business and the Board is 
presented with turnover, cost of sales and operating profits or losses 
after deduction of administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses and foreign currency gains or losses are 
reported to the Board by segment. Finance income and finance 
expense are not reported to the Board on a segment basis. Sales 
between segments are eliminated prior to provision of financial 
information to the Board.
For the Balance Sheet, segmental information is provided in relation 
to investment property, inventory, cash balances and borrowings. 
Whilst segment liabilities includes loans and borrowings, segment 
loss does not include the related finance costs. If such finance costs 
were included in segment profit or loss, the loss from Property 
Investment would have increased by $67,658k (2013: $63,114k). NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9. Earnings measures
In addition to reporting IFRS earnings the Group adopts the European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) earnings measure, as set out in their 
Best Practice Policy Recommendations document issued in December 2014 and also reports its own underlying earnings measure.
EPRA earnings
The EPRA earnings measure excludes investment property revaluations and gains or losses on disposal of investment property, intangible asset 
movements, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings consists of the EPRA earnings measure, with additional group adjustments. The Directors consider underlying earnings to 
be a key performance measure, as this is the measure used by management to assess the return on holding investment assets for the long term. 
Adjustments include share-based payments and other long term incentives, the accretion of premiums payable on redemption of preference 
shares, material non-recurring items, depreciation and amortisation of loan origination costs. 90

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13. Investment property and investment property under construction - Valuation
It is the Group’s policy to carry investment property and investment property under construction at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13  
“Fair Value Measurement” and IAS 40 “Investment Property”:
• investment property consists of the completed, income producing, portfolio; and
• investment property under construction consists of development projects and land bank.
The latter is sub-categorised as:
• assets under construction - current development projects and the value of land on additional phases of existing investment property; and
• land bank - land held for potential development.
For the purposes of IFRS 13 disclosure, we have analysed these categories by the geographical market they are located in being Moscow,  
St Petersburg and the Regions (the other Russian regional cities). These form distinct markets for valuation purposes as the fundamentals  
differ in each.
The fair value of the Group’s investment property and assets under construction at 31 December 2014 has been arrived at on the basis of  
market valuations carried out by Jones Lang Lasalle (“JLL”), external valuers to the Group. JLL have consented to the use of their name in  
these financial statements.
The Group’s land bank in St Petersburg and the Regions is valued by the Directors.
Valuation process
The executive management team members responsible for property matters determine the valuation policies and procedures for property 
valuations in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The Group has three qualified RICS members on the management team, one of whom is the Chairman of RICS in Russia and the CIS. All 
have relevant valuation and market experience and are actively involved in the valuation process. They also regularly meet with agents and 
consultants in the market to obtain additional information and an alternative perspective.
The effectiveness and independence of the external valuer is reviewed each year. The criteria considered include market knowledge, reputation, 
independence and professional standards. The Audit Committee also meets the external valuer at least once a year. Executive management and 
the Directors have determined that the external valuer is experienced in the Russian market and acts as an “External Valuer” as defined in the 
“RICS Valuation - Professional Standards” .
The external valuers perform their valuations in accordance with the “RICS Valuation - Professional Standards” , the 2012 Edition (the “Red Book”). 
This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with the principles of IFRS 13.
For investment properties and assets under construction, the executive team members consult with the external valuers and the valuers then 
determine:
• whether a property’s fair value can be reliably determined;
• which valuation method should be applied for each asset; and
• the assumptions made for unobservable inputs that are used in valuation methods.
The land bank is valued by the Directors. The process followed includes regular site inspections, meetings with local real estate experts, 
comparison to any local land sale information and comparison to transactions in other regional cities including those where the Group has stable 
income producing assets. Updated acquisition appraisals and any indication of value for alternative use are also considered.
Valuations are prepared on a biannual basis. At each valuation date the executive team members review the information prepared by the 
property department for valuation purposes being submitted to the external valuers. Each property valuation is then reviewed and discussed 
with the external valuer in detail, adjustments made as necessary and results discussed with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer.
The executive management also present the valuation results to the Audit Committee and hold discussions with the Group’s auditors. Both the 
Audit Committee and the auditors also have discussions with the external valuers. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of investment property is determined using the income capitalisation method where a property’s fair value is estimated based on 
the normalised net operating income of the asset divided by the capitalisation (discount) rate. Each income stream from every tenant is valued 
based on capitalising the contracted rent for the term of the lease, including any fixed increases in rent but excluding any future indexation. 
Allowance at lease end is made for any potential letting void and an assessment is made of the estimated rental value on re-letting (ERV).  
These elements are determined based on current market conditions and values.
Assets under construction (development projects) are valued on a residual value basis using the future anticipated costs to complete 
construction, a provision for letting costs, a letting void period and an assessment of ERV. Depending on the status of the development,  
and how much of development process has been completed an allowance will also be made for developer’s profit.
Assets under construction (additional phases of existing sites) are valued on a comparable basis. The value of these plots is estimated based on 
comparable transactions in the same market. This approach is based on the principle that a buyer will not pay more for an asset than it will cost 
to buy a comparable substitute property. The unit of comparison applied is the price per square metre.
All of the above valuations are completed by JLL.
The land bank is valued by the Directors using the comparable basis.
Sensitivity analysis of significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the entity’s 
portfolio of investment property are:
• ERV;
• void period on re-letting;
• initial yield; and
• specific to property under development: construction costs, letting void, construction period and development profit.
In preparing their valuations at 31 December 2014, JLL have specifically referred to the uncertainty caused in the market by the rapid fall in the 
oil price and Rouble and the continuing impact of international sanctions on Russia. This has led to a significant increase in Russian bank base 
rates, a reduction in the availability of hard currency debt and a contraction in capital available for investment. The result is a further reduction of 
liquidity in the Russian real estate market, although given the immaturity of the market, it has always been relatively illiquid. JLL comment that 
the majority of buyers in the market are adopting a “wait and see” policy while volatility persists. This corresponds to the Group’s experience at 
this time. In the absence of completed transactions, drawing conclusions on current market yields is challenging although yields have tended  
to build in a risk factor for the Russian market, hence they have always been significantly higher than most comparable international markets.  
The weakened Rouble has also had an effect on ERVs as rents become more expensive for Rouble denominated businesses in US Dollar terms.
Significant increases (or decreases) in the ERV (per sqm p.a.) would result in a significantly higher (or lower) fair value measurement. However, 
given the relatively low level of lease maturities in the short term, changes in ERV have not had a significant effect on the Group’s portfolio 
valuation. Further significant increases (or decreases) in the long-term void period on re-letting and initial yield in isolation would result in a 
significantly lower (or higher) fair value measurement. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the year there were the following changes to the Group’s financing arrangements:
The Group agreed an increase of $23 million to the facility provided by Unicredit secured on the Noginsk project in 2013 and this was fully drawn 
in January 2014. The Group subsequently refinanced the Unicredit facility, drawing down $141 million from a $180 million facility advanced 
by VTB and secured on the asset. The facility is for a six year term and a fixed interest rate to the Group of 7% per annum. The remainder of the 
facility was drawn on 27 February 2015.
The Group also refinanced the IFC / EBRD facility secured on the Novosibirsk project, drawing down $73 million from a facility provided by 
Sberbank. The facility was fully drawn, has a ten year term and a margin of 5.6% over US LIBOR.
The Group also refinanced the Bank of Cyprus facility secured on Lobnya, drawing down $38 million from a facility provided by Unicredit.  
The facility was fully drawn, has a five year term and a margin of 6.25% over US LIBOR.
The Group also agreed a $65 million construction facility from Unicredit secured on the first phase of the Nova Riga project. $15 million was 
drawn in 2014 and a further $27 million since the year end. The facility is for 5 year term and has a margin of 7.5% over US LIBOR. The undrawn 
portion of the facility is available until 24 September 2015 and is dependent on building the next phase of the project.
A further $8 million was drawn from a $33 million facility from ZAO Raiffeisen Bank secured on the third phase of the Klimovsk project. The remaining 
$5 million of this facility was not drawn and its availability lapsed during the year.
Finally, the Group extended the HSH Nordbank facility secured on the Konstanta project for a further two and a half years at a margin of 6% over 
US LIBOR.
At 31 December the Group had undrawn loan facilities available of $89 million (2013: $36 million), of which $66 million has been drawn since the 
year end and the remainder is dependent on building the next phase of Nova Riga.
The Group has entered into hedging arrangements in respect of its exposure to floating interest rates (note 19). $222 million (2013: $305 million) 
of Group bank borrowings have been fixed with two years remaining (2013: three years) at a weighted average swap rate of 1.44% (2013: 1.43%) 
and $457 million (2013: $381 million) capped at 1.52% (2013: 1.33%) for three years (2013: four years). This gave a weighted average cost of debt 
to the Group of 7.0% (2013: 7.2%) at the year end. 102

24. Provisions
Provisions at 31 December 2013 reflected the litigation in CJSC Toros (“Toros”), the subsidiary company that owns the Pushkino project.
In December 2010, prior to the Group’s acquisition of Pushkino, a supplier to Toros filed a claim against Toros in the Moscow Region Arbitration 
Court, concerning alleged non payment of rent in respect of the supply of electricity generating equipment. The amount claimed was 827.4 
million Roubles plus interest at the prevailing Russian Central Bank financing rate. After various court hearings and appeals the claim at 31 
December 2013 rose to 1,141.7 million Roubles ($34.9 million) plus interest. Further appeal hearings were heard in 2014 and on 18 August 2014, 
the Moscow Circuit Commercial Court resolved finally that the amount payable by Toros was in fact 467.4 million Roubles. This amount was  
paid by the Company on 29 August 2014 in settlement of the claim and reduced the provision by $12.9 million. The movement in US Dollar 
Rouble exchange rate gave rise to a foreign exchange profit on translation into US Dollars of $13.3 million and the remainder of the provision,  
less an amount of $5.3 million which is reflected in accruals, was released to investment property as an adjustment to the completion  
provision on acquisition.
At the time of the acquisition the vendor of Toros, PLP Holding GmbH (“PLP”), agreed to indemnify Padastro Holdings Limited (“Padastro”), the 
acquiring entity and the new holding company of Toros, in respect of this litigation. The indemnity was secured by a cash retention and PLP 
retained conduct of the claim on behalf of Toros in return. In 2013, PLP agreed with Padastro and Toros to release the retention in return for which 
Padastro released its claim under the indemnity. Toros took over conduct of the litigation and under the terms of the agreement to release the 
indemnity, the majority of the retention monies received were restricted until the litigation was resolved. Under the terms of the indemnity, 
Padastro expects to apply for the release of the remaining restricted cash in the first quarter of 2015.
The Group has leasehold properties that it classifies as investment property and investment property under construction. Minimum lease 
payments due over the remaining term of the leases totalled $22.3 million and have a present value at 31 December 2014, as reflected above 
and in note 21, of $7.357 million (2013: $11.861 million).

32. Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group utilises a number of different Share Schemes to reward and incentivise the Group’s executives and senior staff. The Share Schemes 
operated in the year are as follows:
Executive Share Option Schemes (“ESOS”) 
The Group operates two ESOS, the Employee Retention Scheme (“ERS”) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Both schemes involved the 
grant of options over the Company’s ordinary shares by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts. The ERS vested in full on the publication of the 
audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the ERS options do not have an exercise price. The LTIP 
options vested in three equal tranches, subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 2013 and 2014. The LTIP options have an exercise price 
of 25p per option and have vested in full. Both the ERS and LTIP schemes are closed and further awards cannot be made under either scheme. 
Awards made under the ERS and LTIP have been accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012 to 2014 (“CBLTIS”) 
During 2012 the Group implemented the CBLTIS and contingent awards were made in respect of 14.3 million ordinary shares and 3.7 million 
preference shares and which cover the calendar years 2012 to 2014. The awards are subject to performance criteria linked to operating cash 
income. Awards in respect of ordinary shares are accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments. 
Awards to be settled by preference shares do not meet the criteria under IFRS for a Share-based payment and are instead accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 19 - Employee Benefits.
In 2013 the Company made a discretionary bonus award of 121,429 ordinary shares to certain senior managers below Board level.

35. Financial instruments – risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks in relation to the financial instruments it uses: market risk (including currency risk, 
price risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The financial risks relate to the following financial instruments: trade 
receivables, cash and short term deposits, trade and other payables, borrowings, preference shares and derivative financial instruments.
Risk management parameters are established by the Board on a project by project basis and overseen by management in conjunction with 
professional advisers. Reports are provided to the Board formally on a weekly basis and also when authorised changes are required.
(a) Market risk
Currency risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from a variety of currency exposures, primarily with respect to 
US Dollars, Sterling and Russian Rouble. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions (including construction contracts and 
lease receivables), recognised monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign entities.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated in US Dollars, which is also the reporting currency for the Group. The functional 
currency of the Company is Sterling, however the functional currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries vary. The analysis that follows considers  
the impact of Russian Rouble and Sterling on the Group.
Russian Rouble 
The rapid depreciation of the Rouble over the year end has heightened the Group’s currency risk. The Balance Sheet at 31 December 2014 
reflects a $45 million reduction in the US Dollar equivalent value of the Group’s opening Rouble net assets, included in movements through 
the translation reserve. The Income Statement includes a $19 million loss on the Rouble value of net US Dollar denominated liabilities in those 
subsidiaries with Rouble functional currency.The Group holds sufficient Rouble currency to cover Rouble denominated overheads and any future 
construction cost commitments.The weak Rouble also has an impact on property values as explained in note 13 to the accounts and increased 
credit risk as explained below. 
Sterling 
The Group’s exposure to Sterling is primarily driven by the Sterling denominated preference shares and the related quarterly preference 
dividends, but also head office costs and ordinary dividends. Whilst there are no Sterling foreign exchange gains and losses arising in the parent 
company itself, in preparing the group financial statements these Sterling amounts are translated to the Group’s US Dollar presentation currency 
and the resulting exchange gains and losses are included in the translation reserve. 110

The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is 
unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign 
currency exchange rates. The Group principally manages foreign currency risk on a project by project basis. The sensitivity analysis prepared 
by management of foreign currency risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The table below shows the impact on consolidation if the US Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% against the Russian Rouble or Sterling, with 
all other variables in each case remaining constant, then:

The majority of Sterling sensitivity relates to the retranslation of the value of irredeemable preference shares. 112

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings (note 22), which include preference shares issued (note 23). Borrowings issued  
at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whilst borrowings issued at a fixed rate expose the Group to fair value risk.  
The Group’s cash flow and fair value risk is reviewed monthly by the Board. The cash flow and fair value risk is approved monthly by the Board.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. It takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels 
of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows. Interest costs may increase as a result of such changes. They may reduce or 
create losses in the event that unexpected movements arise. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of 
existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Based on these scenarios the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined 
interest rate shift. The simulation is run on an on-going basis to verify that the maximum potential impact is within the parameters expected by 
management. Formal reporting to the Board on cash flows is made on a monthly basis.
To date the Group has sought to fix its exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings through fixed rate debt facilities, the use of a variety of 
interest rate derivatives and the issue of preference shares at a fixed coupon. This gives certainty over future cash flow but exposure to fair value 
movements, which amounted to an accumulated unrealised loss of $7.9 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: loss of $7.3 million). NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
113
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2014 ANNUAL REPORT
Sensitivity analysis on the Group’s interest rate borrowings, net of interest bearing deposits, indicate that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would 
increase the loss for the year and decrease net assets by $2.2 million (2013: $1.6 million). If LIBOR rates were to drop to zero then there would be 
an decrease in the loss for the year and an increase in net assets of $0.7 million (2013: decrease of $1.7 million) as the loss on income from cash 
would be greater than gains on interest expense because of the low LIBOR rates prevailing at this time and the interest rate hedges in place.
(b) Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk associated with the Group’s trade and other receivables has increased during the year. The Group transacts with tenants using US 
Dollar pegged leases, passing foreign exchange risk on to the tenant in exchange for lower US CPI indexation. The rapid weakening of the 
Rouble over the year end has meant that the foreign exchange risk carried by tenants has increased significantly. This may result in some tenants 
struggling to meet rental obligations. The Group has policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are made with tenants meeting appropriate 
Balance Sheet covenants, supplemented by rental deposits or bank guarantees from international banks. No significant doubtful receivables 
existed at the year end and the amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for 
impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the 
receivables concerned. Details of the movements in provision for impairment of trade receivables is provided in the table below.

At 31 December 2014 there were no significant amounts of trade receivables that were past due for collection (2013: $ nil).
The Group has VAT recoverable of $16 million (2013: $17 million). The timing of recovery of these balances is subject to future revenue receipts 
and application to the Russian Courts. The Group forecasts the recovery of these balances based upon the timing of future revenue receipts and 
its experience of successful application to the Russian Courts. No balances are considered past due or impaired at 31 December 2014 (2013: $ nil) 
based upon this assessment of the timing of future cash receipts. The Group believes its only exposure is in relation to the timing of recovery. 
The credit risk of the Group’s cash and short term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited to the Group’s policy of monitoring 
counterparty exposures.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Board and its advisers seek to have appropriate credit facilities in place on a 
project by project basis, either from available cash resources or from bank facilities.
Management monitor the Group’s liquidity position on a daily basis. Formal liquidity reports are issued from all jurisdictions on a weekly basis 
and are reviewed monthly by the Board, along with cash flow forecasts. A summary table with maturity of financial liabilities is presented below.
All amounts shown are gross undiscounted cash flows.

cash flows beyond 10 years.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by forecasting cash flow requirements for future years. The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and other short term borrowing facilities, bank loans 
and equity fund raisings.

The fair values of loans receivable and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates. The fair value of short term deposits, other assets, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables is assumed to approximate to their 
book values. The fair value of preference shares is assumed to be their last quoted price. The fair value of derivatives is determined by a model 
with market based inputs. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(d) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
For capital risk management, the Directors consider both the ordinary and preference shares to be permanent capital of the Company, with similar 
rights as to cancellation.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, undertake tender offers, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis 
of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities but excluding provisions, 
head lease obligations and preference shares, which for capital risk management is considered to be capital rather than debt, less cash and short 
term deposits. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the balance sheet, plus preference shares and net debt. Where the Group has a net 
cash position, the gearing ratio will be zero.

I am pleased to present the ﬁ rst full 
year’s set of results for Debts.co.uk 
plc as an AIM listed company for 
the year ended 31 July 2007. 
The Board previously set out its objectives 
regarding the IVA and debt solutions market 
place on its admission to the AIM market and 
continues to work towards these objectives.  The 
results for the year for the Group have been 
pleasing despite the publicised diffi culties across 
the whole of the industry.
As has been widely recorded, debt plays an 
ever-more important role in the UK’s economic 
landscape and the increased levels of borrowing is 
widely credited with sustaining the UK growth rate 
over recent years. However, against a background 
of the recent credit ‘squeeze’, fall in house prices 
and threat of recession in the US and potentially 
the UK, the availability of debt to individuals is 
widely expected to fall.
Chairman’s Statement
The availability 
of debt to 
individuals 
is widely 
expected to fall.
Bernard Asher
Chairman
Annual Report 2007
DB2190 – front AW08.indd   6 18/1/08   10:29:28 It is against this positive background that there 
has been an increasing level of competition in 
the market place since our Aim flotation in May 
2006, which has impacted on current trading 
performance and particular on the first half of 
2007/2008. This has been acutely felt in an increase 
in the cost of acquisition of IVA clients. However, we 
are now seeing a number of competitors ceasing 
their marketing activities where they have not 
reached a level of critical mass within their business 
models and as such there appears to be an easing 
of this situation which we believe will be felt in the 
second half of 2008.
A further factor which has affected the historic 
business model is the increase in creditor hostility 
to IVAs. The result of this has been a restriction on 
the number of debtors acceptable to lenders for 
an IVA which results in the debtor being declared 
bankrupt or entering into a debt management 
programme. This has again increased the cost of 
client acquisition as well as increasing processing 
costs due to necessary changes to our systems 
in order to take account of the variety of 
modifications requested by creditors. These have 
had a significant negative impact on the Group’s 
cash flows and future profitability.
Additionally, the recent consensus on fees charged 
by IVA providers involves a reduction in the level 
and timing of drawing fees which will impact 
both on the future profitability of the IVA business 
as well as the methodology previously adopted 
for accounting for Nominee fees (the initial costs) 
and supervisory fees (ongoing costs) as effectively 
there is now “one fee” for the entire case, the 
recoverability of which relies on whether the IVA 
continues for the full term of the arrangement.
Further, the expected increase in the level 
of second charge and mortgage broking 
commissions has been severely impacted by this 
summer’s sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US with a 
reduction in the number of panel lenders prepared 
to lend at reasonable rates falling from 8 to 2 in just 
a few weeks. 
On the other hand, the number of debt 
management programmes under management 
has increased considerably and continue to grow 
profitably and generally are an accepted solution 
by creditors.
The acquisition of Adie Financial Solutions Limited in 
June 2007 opened up further opportunities, giving 
the ability to provide a full range of debt solutions 
within Scotland. The Scottish market remains largely 
unaffected by the creditors situation in England & 
Wales and we are looking to increase our presence 
in this market place.
The Group continues to look for complementary 
opportunities to grow our client base through 
acquisition and believe that this will provide 
significant opportunities for value growth in  
the coming months and years as the industry 
further consolidates.
These changes in the IVA market and the 
associated ongoing industry wide negotiations 
with creditors are providing a shape for the future 
and the Group is adapting well to these changes, 
details of which have been set out in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s report.
Meanwhile, the Board continually looks to 
improve systems and controls to the optimum 
operational levels and where appropriate to 
ensure that the Group meets all current and future 
regulatory requirements.

I am pleased to report an 
excellent set of results for the year 
ended 31 July 2007 despite the 
publicised poor market conditions.
The board has 
worked hard to 
adapt our business 
model to meet the 
current challenges 
in the market and 
look to the future 
with a degree of 
cautious optimism.
DB2190 – front AW08.indd   8 18/1/08   10:29:30 Growth in financial Performance
The year is again a record year in all our key 
measures:
2007 2006 Change%
Revenues £11.6m £6.1m 90.2
Gross profit £9.4m £4.8m 95.8
Profit before tax £3.4m £2.1m 61.9
Significant Growth
The Group continues to deliver on all key 
performance indicators.  In particular, turnover and 
profits before tax have grown by 90.2% and 61.9% 
respectively over the 12 months to 31 July 2007.
The year started off with strong growth on the 
back of key marketing and sales activity. This 
led to good revenue growth and business 
development. The second half saw a change 
in the market conditions to which the Group 
responded with a slowdown in its marketing to 
preserve cash and profits whilst evaluating the 
potential outcomes and the optimum levels of 
marketing spend and operational resourcing.
The Group’s insolvency subsidiaries, Neville 
Eckley and Synergi Partners, which both deal 
primarily with IVAs, have both performed well. 
They saw good growth in this area in the early 
half of the year, slowing down to a steady state 
in the second half.  The quality of proposals 
continued to improve as has the number of 
acceptances and hence cases that continue 
into supervision.
The acquisition of Adie Financial Solutions 
Limited (‘AFS’), a provider of Trust Deeds and 
Sequestrations, which we announced on 25 May 
2007, has been successful and we expect this 
to continue.  The results to 31 July 2007 include 
trading from AFS for only 2 months. The Scottish 
market has been largely unaffected by all the 
issues that are currently being headlined within 
the rest of the United Kingdom and the Group’s 
fee levels remain steady and the percentage of 
acceptances of proposals high.
The Group’s debt management subsidiary, 
Debtcare, has had a good growth rate over the 
year and continues to be profitable.
Progress within Scarlet, the Group’s secured 
lending brokerage division, has been slow.  
Whilst performance has been steady, it has not 
achieved the same levels of growth as other 
areas of the business. With the recent well 
publicised difficulties in the sub-prime lending 
market and the expectation of house prices at 
best showing a small percentage increase in the 
next 12 months, the outlook for this business is one 
of slow growth.
Market Conditions
There has been a great deal of media coverage 
and speculation regarding the issues currently 
facing the IVA industry.
IVAs still have an important role to play. They are 
of fundamental importance to the UK banking 
industry and a key element of Government policy.  
It is expected that they will remain so for the 
foreseeable future. General economic conditions 
are such that levels of consumer indebtedness 
have hit record highs, long-term interest rates 
could yet increase further, levels of disposable 
incomes are at the lowest level as a proportion of 
overall income since 1997, new lending volumes 
are reducing and sub-prime lenders may have 
difficulties raising capital in the market place to 
lend in the future; such conditions inevitably lead 
to increased need for individuals to have to seek 
alternative methods to deal with debt issues.
Industry wide negotiations with creditors have 
been ongoing during most of the year with a 
consensus being reached on a number of areas. 
The area of fees has proved difficult to reach 
agreement on due in part to anti-competition 
laws preventing lenders and debt adviser firms 
coming together to agree a pricing structure.  
The most likely scenario concerning an outline 
fee structure appears to be one with fees based 
upon percentage of realisations coupled with an 
extended timescale over which fees will be paid.
This structure has had a negative impact on 
cash flows and we have seen evidence of this

within our own business over the past 6 months 
as mentioned in the Group’s interim statement.  
Additionally, there may be a reduction in the 
level of profi tability earned on each case 
although this will be offset in part by the 
introduction of more effi cient processing.
The business strategy of the Group has always 
been to offer independent advice to over-
indebted individuals and to have a range of 
services available, including those available from 
third parties.
I expect highly professional and effi cient fi rms, 
such as ourselves, to continue to achieve 
profi table growth.
Growth in Resources
Over the year the Group has continued to 
develop its product offerings and the requisite 
infrastructure.  The aim is to improve the overall 
effi ciency and effectiveness of the Group to be 
able to offer a range of solutions, including IVAs 
and Trust Deeds, debt management programmes, 
bankruptcy and secured loans or second 
mortgages, to over-indebted individuals.
I was delighted that Alan Adie and his team 
at AFS were able to join the Group. This has 
enabled us to expand our operations into the 
Scottish market through Trust Deeds (the Scottish 
equivalent to IVAs).  We have taken further 
opportunity to expand operations within Scotland 
by taking on additional facilities in Glasgow.
Selective acquisitions form an important part of 
the overall development of the Group and we 
continue to seek suitable candidates which we 
hope will become part of the Group.
The Group has also fi nished investing heavily 
in improving the overall infrastructure of the 
business.  The Chesterfi eld operations of the 
business have moved into their new 30,000 sq ft 
purpose built offi ces.
I am pleased to welcome Richard Arden to the 
Board as Finance Director also was appointed 
on 18 September 2007.  Richard was previously 
an executive Director of Westfi eld Contributory 
Health Scheme Limited, a leading provider 
of health insurance to the public where his 
responsibilities included fi nance, compliance 
and information communication technologies. 
Richard’s other experience has been at South 
Yorkshire Investment Fund Limited and Coopers 
& Lybrand, latterly PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
where he qualifi ed as a Chartered Accountant.  
Richard brings with him a wealth of experience 
operating in a low cost processing environment 
with excellent customer service.
I am also pleased that we were able to retain 
the experience of Stuart Cumberland who has 
taken the responsibility as the Board Director for 
Strategic and Commercial development.
In light of the changes within the debt 
management industry, as outlined above, 
together with the increased facilities within 
Chesterfi eld, a recent review of the Group’s 
operational structure was undertaken with a view 
to rationalise the number of separate business 
units operated. The objective is to maximise 
effi ciency and enable effective communication 
and knowledge transfer throughout the various 
businesses in the Group. This plan has been 
fully implemented and provides a platform to 
withstand the current structural changes within 
the IVA market place and position the Group to 
benefi t fully from the expected future increase in 
the demand for the current services provided.
Marketing Strategies
The change in the market with respect to IVAs in 
the second half of the year resulted in a switch 
in the marketing strategy. The advertising spend 
across all media was increased signifi cantly 
from October 2006 to February 2007 and a large 
DB2190 – front AW08.indd   10 18/1/08   10:29:32 number of leads generated which have been 
converted into client business across the Group in 
the second half of 2007.  From March onwards our 
approach to marketing was more cautious, with 
less expenditure, but with a focus on making the 
most effi cient use of our spend whilst at the same 
time reducing the associated operating costs.  
The Group spend is monitored closely. The priority 
is to be cash fl ow positive and remain profi table 
despite these diffi cult conditions.
The business continues to generate a signifi cant 
proportion of leads through marketing activities.  
Advertising is generic refl ecting our wide range of 
products. The Group believes that it is important 
to maximise our ability through advertising to assist 
current and potential clients.
The Group continues to develop affi liation links 
with a select number of preferred partners.  In 
our view, this is an excellent way of providing a 
balanced approach to client acquisition.
Current Business Overview
Since the year end the Group has continued 
to make progress despite the diffi cult market 
conditions.  It has remained profi table but it would 
be rash to make any predictions for the outcome 
of the current year.  We are confi dent and believe 
that this Group has a profi table future ahead of it.
The challenges ahead continue to be those 
we have addressed already: to improve the 
effi ciency and profi tability of the Group’s 
operations. The Group has already begun a 
managed process of streamlining operations 
to continue to generate improved profi tability. 
A signifi cant and ongoing review of costs and 
effi ciencies, including a number of potential 
redundancies, has commenced.
The reduction in marketing that started in the 
second half of the year led to fewer IVA proposals 
in the early part of the new year.  More recently 
close monitoring of our marketing spend has 
enabled an increase in the number of IVA and 
Trust Deed proposals and cases entering into debt 
management.  There is also an increasing number 
of proposals being accepted.
Finally, the market continuously changes and 
one of the keys to long-term success is one’s 
willingness and ability to adapt to the changing 
circumstances. This is nothing new to the Group 
or its management. We have one of the most 
experienced teams in the industry. Market turmoil 
may cause pain for some but it also presents 
opportunities and we are well placed to take 
advantage of these.

Statement of Directors Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare fi nancial statements for each fi nancial year, which give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profi t or loss of the Group for that year. 
In preparing those fi nancial statements the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; a. 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; b. 
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material c. 
departures disclosed and explained in the fi nancial statements; and
 prepare the fi nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume d. 
that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the fi nancial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the 
fi nancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directrors are responsible for ensuring that the Directors’ Report and other information included in 
the Annual Report is prepared in accordance with Company Law in the United Kingdom. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report includes information required by the AIM rules.
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors 
are unaware and we have taken all the steps that we ought to have taken as Directors in order to 
make ourselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Annual Report 2007
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the overall remuneration policy of the Group 
and to agree the level and extent of remuneration paid to Executive Directors and senior management.
This report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy for Directors and details of the remuneration 
received by Directors during the year ended 31 July 2007. This report has been prepared on behalf of 
the Board by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Terms of Reference
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of executive remuneration. The 
principal areas of responsibility delegated to the Remuneration Committee include the determination 
of the remuneration paid to each Executive Director including salary, bonuses, incentive payments, 
share options/awards, pension rights, terms of employment and other compensation payments. 
Additionally, the committee considers all issues relating to executive remuneration generally and makes 
recommendations to the Board on the Group’s framework of remuneration for Executive Directors.
Composition and Meetings
The members of the Remuneration Committee considering matters in respect of 2007 were Bernard 
Asher (Chairman of the Committee) and Robin Williams since his appointment to the Board on  
24 January 2007 until his resignation on 31 July 2007. No member of the Remuneration Committee has 
any personal interest in the matters to be decided by the Remuneration Committee. During 2007, the 
Remuneration Committee met formally on 2 occasions. Details of each member’s attendance at the 
meetings are set out in the corporate governance report on page 17. In addition, the members of 
the Remuneration Committee also met on an informal basis on several occasions during the year. It is 
expected that the Remuneration Committee will meet formally at least once a year.
Remuneration Policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to ensure that remuneration and incentive 
arrangements enable the company to recruit, motivate and retain high-calibre individuals capable of 
leading the Group successfully. To achieve this goal, remuneration for the Executive Directors and other 
senior managers must be competitive within the Group’s areas of expertise.
Components of Executive Director Remuneration
The Company has a total reward approach to remuneration comprising several components 
including a combination of base salary and benefits, including pension contributions. Additionally, 
the Company provides: 
Base Salary
Base salary levels for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee taking 
into account individual responsibility, experience and performance as well as salary levels for similar 
positions in comparable companies, where such information is available. The Group’s policy is to set 
salaries in order to remain competitive within the highly specialised sectors in which it operates.
From the 1 July 2007, the remuneration of Paul Carter and Barry Krite were increased to £255,000 
and £250,000 respectively. These salary increases are their first since the AIM flotation and reflect 
the significant increases in individual responsibilities arising from their board appointments and their 
respective appointments as CEO and Managing Director.

use of option awards is necessary to meet the Group’s strategic objective of attracting and retaining 
the best people in the industry, and to incentivise the Executive Directors and senior team leaders to 
maintain the Groups continued Growth.

Annual Report 2007
Corporate governance describes the operating structure put in place by a company in order to 
promote an environment in which its business objectives can be realised with due probity and on a 
sustainable basis. A key element of good corporate governance is to establish and maintain effective 
systems of internal management, strategy and control. Accordingly, promoting an effective system of 
corporate governance forms a central component of the Board’s strategic planning.
The requirements of the combined code of principles of corporate governance set out in the listing 
rules of the Financial Services Authority are not mandatory for companies traded on AIM. However, the 
Directors are committed to complying with best practice in this area, and have adopted its principles 
where they have been considered appropriate.
Board of Directors and Board Committees
The Board of Directors, which consists of four executive and one non-executive Directors, is responsible 
for the Group’s system of corporate governance. The role of the non-executive Director is to bring 
independent judgement to Board discussions and decisions.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year. It has a schedule of matters referred to it for decision, 
which includes Group strategy and future developments, allocation of financial resources, investments, 
annual and interim results, and risk management.
The Group has three Board committees, which operate within defined terms of reference.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, comprising Bernard Asher (Chairman) is responsible for reviewing the full and half 
year results. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors the framework of internal control.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising Bernard Asher (Chairman) reviews the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and any senior executive of the Group and considers the grant of options and 
payment of performance related bonuses.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, comprising Bernard Asher (Chairman) reviews the nomination of the 
Executive Directors and any new senior executive of the Group.
Board Meetings
The Board holds regular meetings throughout the year and 6 formal meetings took place during 2007 
(2006: 4). Further meetings of the Board, in person or by telephone, were held on an ad hoc basis as 
and when required.
Attendance during 2007 at formal meetings of the Board and of the Audit, Nominations and

Annual Report 2007
Directors’ Appointment
Directors are initially appointed by the Board upon recommendation of the Nominations Committee and, in 
accordance with the Company’s Bye-laws, seek re-election at the next AGM following their appointment.
Thereafter, in accordance with the Bye-laws, one-third of the Directors retires by rotation and seeks 
re-appointment at each AGM. The Nominations Committee has reviewed those individuals who will 
seek re-election at the 2007 AGM and has concluded that, in light of the relevant experience and skills 
which each brings to the Board, its Committees and the Group as a whole, each of those Directors 
should be put forward for re-election. Further details of the Nominations Committee are given above.
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and Professional Advice
The Company ensures that appropriate insurance cover is maintained in respect of leal action against its 
Directors. A procedure also exists to allow Directors, in appropriate circumstances, to take independent 
professional advice in respect of their duties, with fees incurred being paid by the Company.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the group maintains a system of internal control to 
provide them with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within 
the business and for publication and that assets are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in any 
system of internal financial control. On the basis that such a system can only provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss and that it relates only to the needs of 
the business at the time, the system as a whole was found by the Directors at the time of approving the 
accounts to be generally appropriate to the size of the business.
Shareholder Communication
The Group seeks to ensure that all shareholders are kept informed about the Group and its activities. A 
comprehensive annual report and accounts is sent to shareholders and an interim report is published.
The Annual General Meeting is a forum for shareholders’ participation with the opportunity to meet 
and question Board members including the non-executive members and the Chairmen of the 
Board committees.
Additionally, the Group operates an investors section on its website to provide further details of the 
Group’s activities.
Going Concern
After reviewing budgets and forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and Company has adequate resources to continue as an operational business for the foreseeable 
future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.

Corporate Governance
for the year ended 31 July 2007 continued
Employment Policy
The Board places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has effective 
arrangements for communicating the Group’s results and significant business issues to them.
The Directors recognise that continued and sustained improvement of the Group depends on its ability 
to attract, motivate and retain employees of the highest calibre. Furthermore the Directors believe that 
the Group’s ability to sustain the competitive advantage in the long term depends on ensuring that 
all employees contribute to the maximum of their potential. The Group is committed to improving the 
performance of all its employees through appropriate development and training.
Share ownership is at the heart of the Group’s remuneration philosophy and the Directors believe that 
the key to the Group’s future success lies in a motivated workforce holding a stake in the Group. For this 
reason the Board has implemented an Enterprise Management Incentive share option scheme which is 
available to all Group employees subject to meeting certain qualifying rules.
The Group is an equal opportunity employer. Entry into and progression within the Group is solely 
determined on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons, 
having regard to their respective aptitudes and abilities. The policy includes, where practicable, 
the continued employment of those who may become disabled during their employment and the 
provision of training and career development and promotion, where appropriate.
Corporate Responsibility
Debts.co.uk plc operates responsibly with regard to its shareholders, employees, other stakeholders, the 
environment and the wider community. The Group is committed to the wellbeing of all employees and 
ensures that their health, safety and general welfare is paramount at all times. We also maintain open 
and fair relationships with all clients and suppliers while ensuring that all transactions are operated on 
an arms-length, commercial basis. As part of this culture, the Group ensures that all suppliers are paid in 
a timely fashion, unless there are sound commercial reasons why payment should not be made.
Auditors’ Independence
The Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s relationships with its auditors, Shipleys LLP, and has 
concluded that there are sufficient controls in place to ensure the desired level of independence.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the

other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
for use in the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report is not 
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that 
specific information presented in the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement that is cross referred from the

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with 
the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement, and the 
Report of the Remuneration Committee. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups, and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

Annual Report 2007
A) Significant Accounting Policies 
Debts.co.uk plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 July 2007 comprise the Company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group).
B) Statement of Compliance
The consolidated financial statements of Debts.co.uk plc have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards incorporating International Accounting Standards as

requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that year, or in a year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current 
and future years.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on the 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are 
discussed where appropriate.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
D) Basis of Consolidation
i. Reorganisation
On 5 May 2006, the Group carried out a corporate restructuring including the introduction of a 
new holding company which acquired the entire share capital of the subsidiary undertakings 
through the allotment of 1,512,931 ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to a share purchase 
agreement dated 3 March 2006.
The above transaction has been accounted for as a Group reconstruction under merger 
accounting principles. The results and cash flows of the relevant entities are combined from the 
beginning of the year in which the merger occurred and their assets and liabilities combined at the 
amounts at which they were previously recorded.

D) Basis of Consolidation continued
In accordance with merger accounting principles, the comparatives are presented as if the 
companies in the Debts.co.uk plc Group had been owned and controlled by the Company 
throughout the year ended 31 July 2006.
Additionally, a consolidated profit and loss account from the date of incorporation of the new 
holding company is also given above.
ii. Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when a Company has the power, 
directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operational policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
iii. Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from 
intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.
E) Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in such currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Profits and losses arising on 
exchange are included in the net profit or loss for the year.
F) Property, Plant and Equipment
i. Owned Assets 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost as deemed cost less accumulated 
depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy K). 
ii. Leased Assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases.
iii. Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years 
Leaseholds Over the term of the lease or life of the asset, if shorter 
Fixtures and fittings 25% on a reducing balance basis 
Motor vehicles 25% on a reducing balance basis 
Computer equipment  33% on a straight line basis
The residual value, if not significant, is reassessed annually.

Annual Report 2007
G) Intangible Assets
i. Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents 
the amount arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions, goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable 
assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see accounting 
policy K).
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
H) Investments
i. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The Group classifies its investments depending on the purpose for which the investments were 
acquired. The Directors determine the classification of its investment at initial recognition and re-
evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
The fair value of unquoted investments is based on valuation techniques. The Group assess at 
each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired.
I) Trade and Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables are started at their cost less impairment losses (see accounting  
policy K).
J) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
K) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than deferred tax assets (see accounting  
policy S), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for 
use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then, to 
reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.

for the year ended 31 July 2007 continued
Annual Report 2007
30
K) Impairment continued
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and the value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent 
increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is only reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss as been recognised.
L) Share Capital
Dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are paid.
M) Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds (net of 
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the year 
of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
N) Employee Benefits 
i. Defined Contribution Plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in 
the income statement as incurred.
ii. Share-based Payment Transactions
The fair value of employee share option schemes is measured by a Black-Scholes pricing model. 
Further details are set out in note 16. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ the 
resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting year of the options. The value of 
the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.

Annual Report 2007
O) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
P) Trade and Other Payables
Trade payables are stated at cost.
Q) Revenue Recognition
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage 
of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed 
by reference to a review of work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are significant 
uncertainties concerning the recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
R) Expenses
i. Operating Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement 
as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii. Finance Lease Payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each year during the lease term so as to 
produce a constant yearic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii. Net Financing Costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest 
rate method and interest received on funds invested.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using he effective interest 
method. The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest rate method.

Annual Report 2007
32
S) Income Tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are 
non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising 
from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle, deferred 
tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill (or negative goodwill) or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited 
or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
T) Financial Risk Management
The Group uses a limited number of financial instruments, comprising cash, short-term deposits, 
bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables and payables, which arise 
directly from operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. 
Financial Risk Factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk 
and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s overall 
risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
a) Market Risk 
(i) Foreign Exchange Risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various 
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the UK pound and US dollar. Foreign exchange risk 
arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in 
foreign operations. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised 
assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency.

Annual Report 2007
T) Financial Risk Management continued
b) Credit Risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk and has policies in place to ensure that 
sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
c) Liquidity Risk 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and available funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. The Group ensures it has adequate 
cover through the availability of bank overdraft and loan facilities. 
d) Cash Flow and Interest Rate Risk 
The Group finances its operations through a mix of cash flow from current operations together 
with cash on deposit and bank and other borrowings. Borrowings are generally at floating rates of 
interest and no use of interest rate swaps has been made.
1. Segmental Reporting
Revenue and profit before tax are attributable to the one principal activity of the Group, that of a 
full service advertising and marketing agency. All revenue originated in the UK.

the balance sheet are net of any allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

21. Related Party Transactions

During the year, the Group engaged Olivine Partners LLP and Olivine Capital Partners Limited of 
which Stuart Cumberland is a Member and Director respectively to undertake corporate finance 
and tax advisory services. Fees payable totalled £160,500 in the period to 31 July 2007, of which 
£6,000 has been included in the share issue costs.

office buildings. Details are set out in note 21.
During the year, the Company acquired systems flooring from a building firm, Jaybuild Projects 
Limited, for £95,035. Additionally, the Company purchased security guarding services and fuel 
charges for an electricity guarantor totalling £115,412 due to the requirement for temporary electricity 
to be supplied whilst an electrical substation was completed on the site. Paul Carter has used and 
is currently using Jaybuild Projects Limited on a number of personal building projects including the 
current offices occupied by the Group in Chesterfield and the transactions are considered to be 
related by virtue of the personal relationship of Paul Carter and Jaybuild Projects Limited.
22. Subsequent Events
As part of a review of operations undertaken in October 2007, the Group announced the closure of 
the Borehamwood office of The Debt Counsellors Limited and the closure of the March, Coulsden 
and Southend offices of Neville Eckley & Co with the activities of all closed offices being transferred 
to our head offices in Chesterfield. In addition, the Group made a small number of redundancies 
within Synergi Partners Limited and Scarlet Money Limited. It is anticipated that the closures and 
redundancies will achieve approximately £2m of cost savings per annum and will not have a 
material effect on revenues.

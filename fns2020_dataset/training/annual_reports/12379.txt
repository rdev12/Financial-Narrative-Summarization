In this Annual report the terms Polyus Gold International  
Limited (PGIL), Polyus Gold, Polyus and Group refer to Poly-
us Gold International Limited together with its subsidiaries, 
whose financial results are consolidated by PGIL when pre-
paring the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
In this Report, percentage movements are based on the au-
dited numbers disclosed in the consolidated financial state-
ments for the year ended 31 December 2013, as well as on 
unrounded operational numbers, and not on the high-level 
rounded numbers (i.e. billions or millions of USD or oz) and 
therefore there may appear to be some inconsistencies due 
to the rounding of numbers.
The comparative operational and financial information for 
the year ended 31 December 2012 reflects adjustments 
made in connection with the early adoption of IFRIC 20  
(refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) 
in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 and with the presentation of 
the effect of discontinued operations following the sale of 
operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

reserves and 37% of the Group’s 
measured, indicated and inferred 
resources.
The Natalka mine, which 
is currently under development, 
will become the largest mine

has 32 m oz of JORC proved and 
probable reserves and 60 m oz 
of measured, indicated and 
inferred resources.

In addition to its use in jewellery, electronics and den-
tistry, gold provides a convenient means to store wealth 
for a variety of investors, from individuals to state cen-
tral banks. In 2013, gold supply to the global market de-
creased by 2% to 4,340 tonnes. Total demand declined 
by 15% to 3,756 tonnes. This decrease can be attributed 
to a 32% drop in central bank net purchases which was 
almost offset by a 28% increase in bar and coin demand 
by physical individuals to 1,654 tonnes. The annual aver-
age gold price declined 15% to USD 1,411 per oz. 
Supply
According to the World Gold Council (WGC), global gold 
production increased by 5% in 2013 to 3,019 tonnes, 
demonstrating the inelastic nature of production in the 
industry in 2013. Production was strong across most re-
gions, in particular Asia, Latin America and the Common-
wealth of Independent States (CIS). Africa was the outlier, 
because of the continued drop in output in South Africa. 
The industry’s response to declining gold prices has been 
to focus on cost management. Action to control operating 
costs has been widespread and, where possible, capital 
expenditure is being scaled back or deferred, although to-
date, mine closures have been limited.
According to data from the United States Geological Sur-
vey (USGS), in 2013, Russia was the fourth largest pro-
ducer, with an output of 220 tonnes, an increase of 1% 
over 2012.
Another significant source of supply to the global market 
is recycled gold (gold scrap). However, in 2013, supply 
of scrap again decreased to 1,371 tonnes, dropping to 
a five-year low as the gold price fell 29% over the year. 
Across the world, lower prices reduced the incentive for 
consumers to liquidate gold assets. Scrap receipts from 
the US, Europe and South-East Asia fell by 10-20%.

Demand
The jewellery industry is the largest consumer of gold and 
the strongest demand comes from jewellery manufactur-
ers in India and China. In 2013, demand for gold in the 
jewellery market rose by 17% to 2,210 tonnes, in response 
to the declining gold price and increase in population. Much 
of this increased demand came from the Chinese market. 
With China excluded from the global total, demand in the 
rest of the world grew by a relatively modest 12%.
Demand for gold from other industry sectors (electronics, 
dentistry, decorative industries, etc.), decreased by 1% 
to 405 tonnes in 2013. 
According to data provided by the WGC, the official sec-
tor, represented by the central banks and the International 
Monetary Fund, purchased 369 tonnes of gold in 2013, 
down 32% compared to the previous year. 
Investment demand for gold includes demand for gold 
bars, coins, medals and financial instruments linked to the 
gold price (exchange traded funds – ETFs – and similar in-
struments). In 2013, investment demand amounted to 773 
tonnes, a 51% decrease on the previous year and the low-
est level since 2009, as a number of major institutional 
players sold some of their positions in gold in the second 
quarter of 2013.
According to the WGC, investment in physical bars and 
coins increased by 28% to 1,654 tonnes, as a result of low 
price volatility. At the same time, retail investors in Europe 
and North America also saw lower prices as an opportuni-
ty to increase purchases of coins. In the second half of the 
year purchases of bars and coins returned to lower levels.

I am pleased to present to shareholders the results of Polyus 
Gold. Against a background of declining gold prices which fell 
30% between January and June 2013 to USD 1,192 per oz, Polyus 
demonstrated strong performance, which is underpinned not just 
by increasing volumes of processed ore but also by an increased 
focus on cost control throughout our operations.
We have revised our plans for the Natalka project both 
in the light of the tough economic conditions and to al-
low for further testing of advanced processing techniques, 
which are showing great promise in early testing. We now 
expect to have the full flowsheet operating at this strategic 
deposit in 2015.
There have been some major changes to the Board over 
the course of the year. Following the resignation of Dmi-
tri Razumov (a representative of ONEXIM) and Alexander 
Mosionzhik (a representative of Wandle Holdings Limited), 
Igor Gorin, a representative of Receza Limited and Wamika 
Trading Limited, joined the Board as a Non-Executive Di-
rector. Igor brings with him a wealth of experience from the 
investment and corporate banking sector. Chairman, Rob-
ert Buchan, left to take up a new executive appointment 
in late May and I was honoured to be offered the opportu-
nity to succeed him. The Board was further strengthened 
by the appointment of another Non-Executive Director, 
Edward Dowling. Edward’s deep knowledge of the min-
ing industry is certain to be of great value to the business 
in the coming years. On 13 November, Lord Clanwilliam re-
signed from the Board and Pavel Grachev, a representative 
of Wandle Holdings Limited was nominated to the Board. 
Pavel has much experience serving on the Boards of public 
companies, and as the CEO of a large fertilizer producer. 
Lastly, German Pikhoya, CEO of the Company, decided 
to resign from his position in order to pursue other activi-
ties. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Robert, 
Dmitri, Alexander, Lord Clanwilliam and German for their 
contribution to the Company’s success.
The Board and its Committees have been active over the 
year, meeting 22 times and 26 times respectively. The 
Board’s work has included visits to the Olimpiada and Bla-
godatnoye mines, and the Chairman of the Audit Commit-
tee has additionally visited Natalka. As well as being im-
portant as part of the Board’s oversight role, these visits 
serve to guide our strategic decision-making and ensure 
that we are reminded of the challenges faced by our opera-
tions teams, who work in some of the most hostile condi-
tions in the world.

report

Statement Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
Mining operations have long been considered as inherently 
dangerous and therefore ensuring the health and safety 
of everyone who works for Polyus Gold is a high priority for 
the Group. We aim to maintain a safe and healthy working 
environment and we are confident that all injuries at Group 
operations are preventable. Set against this background, 
it is therefore deeply saddening to have to report the death 
of three of our employees in 2013 while working at the 
Company’s most challenging alluvial sites. The Group con-
siders any fatality as unacceptable and is focusing on the 
complete prevention and elimination of workplace hazards. 
During the year, Edward Dowling, a long-term industry pro-
fessional, was appointed as Chairman of the Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community Committee and we are con-
fident that Edward will draw on his extensive experience 
to help further improve our safety procedures and manage-
ment systems.
We recognise that our operations impact on local communi-
ties and the environment. We aim to work with communities 
to mitigate potential impacts, through the formal stakeholder 
engagement process, environmental and social impact assess-
ment studies and community development programmes. Dur-
ing 2013, the Board approved the Company’s Human rights 
and Stakeholder Engagement Policies, setting new standards 
for the Company’s work with local communities.
As a socially responsible employer, every year we commit sig-
nificant funding to community projects and charitable causes. 
We are confident about the Company’s prospects for 2014. 
It would not be appropriate for us to offer a detailed for-
ward prediction on gold prices. For impairment purposes 
we have used a long-term price forecast of USD 1,350 
per oz, which, at the date of the publication of the con-
solidated financial statements, was in line with the market 
price. In order to be conservative we have used USD 1,200 
per oz for our budget purposes for 2014 and at that price, 
supported by external financing, we expect to remain cash 
positive for the year, even after taking into account planned 
capital expenditure of approximately USD 674 million.
We face 2014 with continued vigour. We have some of the 
world’s best reserves, both in terms of size and quality, and 
a team fully committed to delivering world-leading results 
and excellent shareholder value.

2.3. Description 
of business model 
1 
Excluding Chairman.
We have highly competitive  
operations and a strong track 
record of production from existing  
operations.
With 2013 production of 1,649 thousand ounces, 83.1 mil-
lion ounces of proved and probable JORC reserves and 150.1 
million ounces of measured, indicated and inferred JORC re-
sources, Polyus Gold is one of the top three gold companies 
worldwide by proved and probable JORC reserves, based 
on the most recent publicly available reports. Our current 
producing assets are well established, with minimal reli-
ance on third-party infrastructure, and, as they have been 
producing for many years, provide the foundation for fur-
ther gold production in the medium term. As a result of our 
solid operational performance and long-established position 
in Russia, we are well positioned to capitalise on existing 
and future opportunities in the region.
We have an extensive resource base 
and defined development pipeline, 
which provides a leading production 
growth profile from significant  
development assets.
A significant part of our reserves is within assets that are 
currently not producing. Given Polyus Gold’s solid financial 
position and strong track record of commissioning new 
mines, we are well-positioned to convert the reserve base 
into gold production. Management expects growth to come 
from both expansion of production at existing mines and 
the exploitation of new deposits, including the Natalka 
deposit. When launched, the Natalka deposit is expected 
to rank among the largest gold mines in the world, based 
on publicly available reserve and resources reports of lead-
ing gold producers.
We have wide-ranging expertise 
in gold mining and project execution 
in an opportunity-rich mining region.
Our operations are characterised by efficient use of modern 
equipment and low-cost, large-scale processes. We have 
a proven track record of project execution, with much of the 
Group’s existing production the result of successful project 
management, from initial exploration through to design and 
development and ultimately gold production. The total ca-
pacity of mills commissioned by us between 2006 and 2012 
is more than 14 million tonnes per annum. Consequently, 
we believe that Polyus is well-positioned to bring its existing 
development projects into production and to take advan-
tage of future opportunities in resource-endowed Russia.
We have a strong financial position 
which allows us to capitalise  
on opportunities.
As of 31 December 2013, Polyus had a net debt position 
of just USD 349 million, cash reserves of USD 809 million 
and an asset base of USD 5.7 billion. The Company gen-
erated Adjusted EBITDA of USD 910 million and Adjusted 
Profit for the year from continuing operations of USD 564 
million in 2013. Our current financial position and strong 
cash flow generation provide us with the financial flexibility 
to execute our organic growth strategy or to make oppor-
tunistic acquisitions.
We have a strong management  
team and an experienced and  
majority-independent Board.
The Group’s management has an experience and track re-
cord in early stage exploration, development and producing 
assets, necessary to maximise the value of existing opera-
tions, development projects and our resource base. In ad-
dition, the Company has an experienced Board of Directors, 
of whom the majority

Tax
In order to stimulate investment projects in some Far East-
ern and Siberian regions of Russia, on 30 September 2013, 
President Putin signed an Act amending the Federal Tax 
code. For the Company the changes mean that subsidiar-
ies of the Group, which own mines and deposits (for a list 
of deposits refer to section 2.9.1 “Mines and deposits”) lo-
cated in the regions covered by the Act, may be considered 
for membership of a Regional Investment Project (RIP). 
The current version of the Act covers the following regions 
where the Company is represented: the Amur, Irkutsk and 
Magadan regions and the Republic of Sakha. RIPs came into 
effect from 1 January 2014 and will remain in place until 
1 January 2029. One of the key requirements for members 
is to make capital investment of at least RUB 500 million 
(approximately USD 14-15 million) in the region. 
The benefit of membership of a RIP is entitlement to some 
exemptions from, or reduced rates of mining and income 
tax. The Company believes that some of its subsidiaries 
could potentially become members of an RIP. The data 
below summarises the potential effect on tax rates for 
members:
Gold price
The Group’s only products are refined gold and occasionally 
semi-finished products containing gold. Therefore, Group 
sales are directly affected by the gold price. The gold price 
fell 29% in 2013, and uncertainties about future price re-
main. We examined three differing business outcomes, de-
pending on the medium-term gold price. Besides impacting 
upon the Group’s revenue and profitability, a declining gold 
price could potentially bring into a question the appropriate-
ness of continuing operations at some of our mines (please 
refer to section 2.8 “Financial review”, for calculations of to-
tal cash costs and all-in sustaining costs by mines). Con-
versely, an increase in gold price could potentially lead to 
a decision to commission new mines, which at the current 
gold price would not be economically viable.
Weakening of the rouble
Section 2.8 “Financial review”, discusses the RUB/USD ex-
change rate in detail. However, in 2013 the RUB depreci-
ated by 7.6% against the US Dollar (USD) and if this trend 
continues, the Group could significantly benefit, as its sales 
are USD-denominated and are costs mainly are RUB-de-
nominated. 
Inflation effects
Over the last fifteen years the annual inflation rate in Russia 
has declined significantly. (Refer to section 2.8 “Financial 
review”, for further discussion). Should this trend continue 
it may have a positive effect on the Group’s profitability.
Current tax rate Potential tax rate
Income tax 20% 
From 0% to 10% on pre-tax income, arising as a result of capital investment, 
for the first five years after the tax period in which the capital investment was 
recorded. From 10% to 18% for the remainder of the RIPs life. 
Mining tax 6%
0% for the first two years from the date that a reduced income  
tax rate is first applied.
2.4. Future developments
During 2013, there were a number of legislative, economic 
and technological changes, which could potentially affect the fu-
ture development, performance or position of the Group. These 
are outlined below. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Technical solutions
The Company places great emphasis on research and de-
velopment and operates a research centre in Krasnoyarsk, 
a research processing plant at the Natalka deposit, and 
a research laboratory at the Olimpiada mine. The Company 
also cooperates with leading research and engineering com-
panies. This strong grounding in technologies and systems 
design allows the Company to maintain costs at a com-
petitive level and provides a platform for significant growth 
in production. The Company’s key research and develop-
ment focus includes: development of new technologies, 
providing solutions to current production problems, techno-
logical support for new projects and exploration solutions. 
The Company regularly reviews the operational flow sheets 
at its mines with the aim of finding new technical solutions 
to boost the effectiveness and profitability of its mines and 
reduce their environmental impacts. 
In 2013 the following projects were under review:
Photometric separation (PMS) at the Natalka project. On 27 
December 2013, the Company announced a re-sequencing 
in mining operations at the Natalka project. Along with the 
challenge presented by significant CAPEX requirements 
when set against the background of a depressed gold price, 
the decision to re-sequence the programme allows for the 
potential implementation of PMS as a way to pre-enrich the 
ore in order to improve efficiency. The decision to imple-
ment PMS, if made, could lead to material improvements 
in the Natalka processing plant’s efficiency, primarily to the 
ore crushing and conveying complex, a critical part of the 
plant. The Company has carried out two stages of pilot test-
ing of PMS. The potential viability of this technology for 
processing ore at Natalka has been confirmed in small-scale 
testing and, in January – August 2014, the Company will 
conduct tests on a continuous industrial scale using the ex-
isting pilot plant. If the testing programme proves success-
ful, the plan is to develop process procedures and a feasibil-
ity study of investment in a PMS facility.
X-ray-absorption separation (XAS) at the Verninskoye mine. 
The results of XAS technology aggregate testing on low-grade 
ores mined in 2013 at Verninskoye proved the feasibility of us-
ing the technology to enrich the gold content of processed 
ore. The Company plans to continue development work in this 
area in 2014 refining the technical parameters of the XAS pro-
cess. Ultimately, the use of XAS should allow the processing 
of stockpiled low-grade ores.
Pressure oxidation (POX) at the Olimpiada mine. POX pilot 
testing was carried out in 2013. The technology has proved 
successful in increasing recovery, reducing the use of cya-
nides and bio-oxidation. In 2014, the Company plans to fi-
nalise POX technology development, and produce technical 
parameters to guide further development of a feasibility 
study examining the investment necessary for its incorpora-
tion into plant design and construction.
Wastewater treatment at the Olimpiada mine. The develop-
ment of technology to treat wastewater to remove heavy 
metal ions, rhodanides and cyanides is planned for 2014 
with a view to providing the plant with circulated water. 
A significant reduction in fresh water consumption is ex-
pected if the technology is implemented.
Factors affecting demand for gold
According to the World Gold Council, in 2013, 51% of the 
demand for gold was for jewellery (for more details please 
refer to section 1.4 “Market review”). Total consumer de-
mand hinges on the demand for jewellery by individual 
consumers, together with the demand for pure gold (bars 
and coins). The strength of that demand depends to a large 
extent on the gold price, the affluence of consumers and 
population size. 
Global consumer demand increased in 2013 by 21% and 
mainly reflects changes in the gold price. Alongside price, 
consumer demand also reflects trends in population. China 
and India have been the largest jewellery and pure gold 
markets for many years. Consumer demand in India has 
been driven largely by population growth with a lesser ele-
ment attributable to growing affluence. In China, however, 
growing affluence has been the main driver of demand for 
gold. Demand is also strong in most Islamic countries (pri-
marily Turkey, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Egypt) 
where similar factors came into play. Continued population 
growth and growing affluence in these countries should en-
sure stable demand for the Group’s main product. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Our activities are associated with a variety of risks that 
may have financial, operational and reputational impact 
and which may affect the Group’s operations and financial 
results, and consequently, shareholder returns. The Group 
seeks to mitigate these risks wherever possible, although 
some risks, such as those caused by a decline in the price 
of gold, are to a large extent outside of our control.
Successful risk management requires, amongst other things, 
identification and assessment of potential threats, and the 
development of measures aimed at mitigating them. The 
Company’s risk management process is overseen by the 
Risk Committee, composed of three independent Non-Ex-
ecutive Directors and two non-independent Directors ap-
pointed by the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee en-
sures that there is a robust framework for identifying and 
assessing key risks to the business. Those principal risks 
and uncertainties are identified below, along with the meas-
ures put in place by management, at the request of the 
Committee, to mitigate against them. 
2.5. Principal risks 
and uncertainties 
Mineral resources and ore reserves
The Group’s activities are reliant on the quantity 
and quality of the mineral resources and ore re-
serves available to it. 
Background 
Mineral resources and ore reserves are difficult to quan-
tify and estimates of viable reserves may be inaccurate 
and subject to significant correction. Evaluation of mineral 
resources and ore reserves, depends to a certain extent 
on statistical conclusions made on the basis of the results 
of limited drilling and other analyses that may prove to be 
incorrect. The viability of reserves is heavily reliant on the 
prevailing world price of gold. 
Potential impact 
If the quantity and quality of the mineral resources and ore 
reserves are not as expected, reserves may, in the worst 
case scenario, become unviable. A significant decline in the 
price of gold could seriously erode margins and affect the 
viability of operations.
Risk treatment 
The Group invests considerable sums every year in geo-
logical surveys, which are undertaken using cutting-edge 
technologies. The Group engages independent interna-
tional experts to conduct audits on prospective and ex-
isting deposits and the Group’s activity is guided by their 
conclusions.
Mining and production activity
The Group is exposed to a number of risk factors 
directly related to its production activities, in-
cluding flooding, pit slope and rim slide, accidents 
caused by the use of mining equipment and explo-
sives, work preparation and performance, damage 
of power supply facilities or machinery breakdown. 
Background 
The Group’s activities are carried out in remote regions 
of Russia, from Krasnoyarsk to Magadan, often in sites 
which have complex geology and which are additionally 
subject to extreme weather. In such conditions, the risk 
of equipment failure and accidents is enhanced, plant and 
equipment is subject to additional servicing and repair costs.
Potential impact 
These risks could result in the suspension of ore production 
and recovery, increase the costs of operation and have ad-
verse social, health and safety and environmental impacts.
Risk treatment 
The Group aims to mitigate the risk of unplanned inter-
ruption to production through various processes, including 
strict enforcement of maintenance regimes, holding stock 
of critical spares, probability analysis and effective risk 
management. Such risk management includes the iden-
tification of potential threats, modelling of risk scenarios, 
and detailed analysis of potential negative events (see 
also sub-section 3.1.1 “Materiality and risk management” 
of section 3 “Sustainability report”).
Counterparty and supply chain risks
There are risks of late delivery and non-compliance 
with contracts due to failure of contractors, manu-
facturers or suppliers. 
Potential impact 
The inability to obtain consumables, materials and equip-
ment in time could adversely affect the introduction of both 
new production capacity and existing production plans.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013
21
Back to the contents
Background 
The Group’s principal operations are located in remote ar-
eas with harsh climates and poor road infrastructure. In the 
Krasnoyarsk region, the main trans-shipment terminal at Le-
sosibirsk, designed to handle, trans-ship, store and deliver 
all supplies to the sites, is connected by a 320 km road with 
a ferry crossing over the Yenisei river, or, in winter months, 
an ice crossing of the frozen river. The route is impassable 
for between two and three months each year. 
The Natalka deposit located some 410 km to the north-
west of Magadan. It is connected to Magadan by an un-
paved road, which is subject to flooding and landslip. The 
seaport of Magadan has limited freight capacity.
The delivery of supplies may be disrupted or transportation 
costs may increase. Failure by suppliers to meet schedules 
for production and delivery of the necessary supplies could 
affect the Group’s ability to conduct its operations and con-
tinue development of mines.
Risk treatment 
To mitigate these risks, the Group regularly monitors the 
financial performance of its counterparties and actively 
seeks to increase the number of counterparties. To lower 
its dependence on external energy suppliers the Company 
mines its own coal deposit and delivers it to its own power 
stations at the Olimpiada and Blagodatnoye mines. There 
is stringent quality control over deliveries of new equip-
ment prior to acceptance. A special division, LLC Polyus Lo-
gistics, has been established to oversee logistics functions. 
The Group also keeps adequate stock of spare parts and 
other inventory to avoid production interruptions at times 
when the roads are impassable (see also sub-section 3.1.3 
“Supply chain management” of section 3 “Sustainability 
report”). 
Macroeconomic risks
Background and Potential impact 
Macroeconomic risks applicable to the Company include: 
fluctuations of gold price, strengthening of RUB, inflation, 
decrease in demand for gold, and some other. For more 
information please refer to sections 2.4 “Future develop-
ments” and 2.8 “Financial review”.
Risk treatment 
In the current economic climate, gold is being used 
by many investors to hedge against potential losses in cur-
rency and capital markets. Currently, demand for gold re-
mains stable and although the price has fallen by 29% over 
the year, it remains at an historically high level. The Group 
constantly monitors gold markets. In order to reduce the 
impact of increasing energy prices, the Group is develop-
ing and modernising its own energy-generating facilities 
and has entered into long-term fixed-price contracts with 
energy suppliers. The Group forecasts inflationary changes 
as part of the budget planning process.
Regulatory risk
The activities of the Group may be adversely affected 
by the failure to obtain, the termination or the non- 
renewal of licences from government or regulatory 
authorities.
Background 
The Group holds a significant number of mining and exploration 
licences for gold and other minerals. The terms of these licences 
require the Group to comply with a range of industrial standards, 
employ qualified personnel, ensure that appropriate plant and 
machinery are used, develop and enforce quality control systems, 
maintain relevant documentation and provide information to the 
licensing authorities when requested. Renewal of existing licences 
and granting of new licences, at least in part, depends on the 
Group’s performance in this area. The Group intends to exploit the 
deep horizons at the Olimpiada deposit, which may require special 
permission to carry out underground mining works. 
Potential impact 
Failure to comply with the terms of mining and exploration li-
cences may result in the termination of licences critical to op-
erations. Alternatively the Group might incur financial or le-
gal sanctions. Failure to secure new licences or the renewal 
of existing licences, could lead to cessation of mining at the 
Group’s sites or an inability to expand operations.
Risk treatment 
The Group is focused on strengthening control over its com-
pliance with licence agreements and industrial standards 
on a continuous basis. These control activities include the 
analysis of and immediate response to comments or re-
ports made by state regulatory and supervisory authorities 
in connection with their inspections of the Group’s business 
activities.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
Environmental risk
The Group’s activities have a significant impact on the 
local environment. Mining operations create physi-
cal damage to the soil, subsoil and underlying strata, 
damage flora and fauna and result in loss of habitat. 
Spoil from mining operations and the waste products 
of processing may be toxic, requiring careful handling 
and disposal. Reputational and financial costs for en-
vironmental failure can be significant. 
Background, potential impact and treatment 
Please refer to section 3 “Sustainability report” for more 
information.
Project risks
Implementation of the Group’s investment projects 
is subject to geological, market, operational and 
compliance risks. 
Background
During the development phase of a mine or other major 
project there are significant risks caused by fluctuations 
in the prevailing price of gold, changes in exchange rates 
and the effects of inflation. Operational risks include de-
lays in commissioning the project and failures due to er-
rors in project design, which may lead to cost over-run 
and loss of forecast revenue. There is a shortage of skilled 
technicians and significant competition in the recruitment 
of workers willing to work in the remote and hostile ar-
eas where the Group operates and this may lead to delays 
in implementation. 
Potential impact
Should the identified risks occur, they may result in late 
commissioning, increased cost of projects, reduced profit-
ability and efficiency of projects, and revocation of licences 
for the exploitation of mineral resources. 
Risk treatment
To reduce these project risks, the Group has developed proce-
dures for careful and comprehensive study, selection and analysis 
of proposed investment projects. Each project is subject to ap-
proval by the Group’s Board, which is constituted from mem-
bers with expertise in economics, production and law. Control 
is exercised over investment projects at all stages of their im-
plementation. Professional and reliable consultants are engaged 
to provide audit and assistance in risk identification and ongoing 
control over the execution of large investment projects, including 
design development, subcontracting, procurement, construction, 
commissioning and reporting to stakeholders.
Political risks
Potential changes in Russian legislation aimed 
at ‘deoffshorisation’ of the Russian economy, may 
negatively affect PGIL’s operations and financial 
position. The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Fed-
eration (MoF) has developed a draft law aimed at in-
troducing significant amendments to Russian tax 
legislation as part of the ‘deoffshorisation’ process 
and further measures of both a tax, and non-tax na-
ture, may be implemented in the future to support 
the ‘deoffshorisation’ initiatives. 
Background
Russian governmental authorities and representatives have 
increasingly made statements encouraging the deoffshorisa-
tion of businesses with predominantly Russian assets that are 
held through ownership structures outside of Russia. In par-
ticular, plans have been announced to remove tax advantages 
associated with such structures and disallow their access 
to state support. As a result, companies registered in a foreign 
jurisdiction but which carry activities in Russia may find that 
the Russian government’s deoffshorisation policies could lead 
to restrictions on contracts with state bodies, and limits being 
placed on state support and tax relief. 
Potential impact
Changes in Russian laws aimed at implementing the ‘de-
offshorisation’ initiatives could increase PGILs taxes or oth-
erwise have a negative effect on our business, financial 
condition or trading price of the shares. In particular, PGIL 
is incorporated in Jersey and may face: 
• difficulties in obtaining relief on mining and income tax 
(for instance, membership of Regional Investment Pro-
jects (see section 2.4 “Future developments”)), if re-
strictions are placed on such relief measures;
• absence of state support or co-funding of infrastructure 
and power projects considered to be of local or federal 
importance (see section 2.9.3 “Development”, for a de-
scription of the Group’s projects), and
• increased tax burden on the Group due to the imple-
mentation of new tax residency rules for corporations, 
which, depending on the final text of the law, could 
lead to the increase in taxes payable by PGIL and off-
shore subsidiaries of the Group. 
Risk treatment
The Company recognises the potential impact of these 
possible changes to Russian legislation. The Company 
is monitoring developments in this area.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

2.6. Analysis using  
key performance indicators
The Board believe that of the KPIs on the corporate list, 
the following are key in assessing progress: Production, 
Total cash costs per oz sold (TCC), the implementation 
of the health and safety management system, and Lost 
time injury frequency rate (LTIFR). It is the Board’s view 
that an appropriate balance should be struck between pro-
duction and TCC, which it believes is a key measure of the 
effectiveness of Group operations. We aim to achieve maxi-
mum profitability at our operations. Our strategy envisages 
the development and commencing of new facilities, each 
more efficient than current mines. The Natalka mine and 
expanded operations at Blagodatnoye and Verninskoye will 
be the main drivers of production growth for the Company. 
The continued development of these mines is our top prior-
ity in the short and medium-term.
Health and Safety is a clear priority for the Group and 
we strive to minimise injuries and fatalities. It is our belief 
that zero fatalities is a realistic and achievable aim. In that 
regard, Health and Safety related indicators are very im-
portant when measuring operational performance. The 
Company has implemented a health and safety manage-
ment system and has made a range of health and safety 
commitments (available at http://www.polyusgold.com/ 
sustainability/health_and_safety/).
Individual KPIs, compare average results for the Senior 
management team against those agreed with each indi-
vidual from the Senior management team.

Operational and financial review
Historically high production was offset by a weaker gold 
price and we recorded revenues of approximately USD 2.3 
billion versus 2.7 billion in 2012. During the year we pro-
duced USD 422 million of operational cash flow, raised USD 
1,093 million of new debt and invested USD 1,340 million 
in capital construction. At the year-end we had USD 349 
million of net debt.
Dividends
On 31 May 2013 the shareholders approved a final dividend 
in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 
of USD 0.0824 per ordinary share and a Special Dividend in re-
spect of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 of USD 
0.0232 per ordinary share, in recognition of the successful 
sale of our gold mining assets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Romania. The Special Dividend and Final Dividend combined 
represent an aggregate dividend payment of USD 0.1056 per 
ordinary share for 2012. This resulted in a total payment of ap-
proximately USD 320 million, which is around 33% of the Ad-
justed Profit from Continuing Operations for 2012.
During April 2014, the Board will decide whether to propose 
a dividend for the financial year 2013, taking into account 
the Company’s dividend policy, the current market situation 
and financial condition.
Cost control
In the year 2013 the gold price fell 29%. Most companies 
in the sector, including PGIL, undertook cost control measures 
to align their operations with the new market conditions. Pol -
yus’ cost control initiatives were focused in three main areas:
• The Group’s 2013 budget was reviewed and we were 
able to cut selling, general and administrative expenses 
SG&A, operational and capital expenditures. We also 
decreased exploration expenditures in the Krasnoyarsk 
and Irkutsk regions;
• in January 2013, we committed to commence mining 
activities at the Natalka project by the year-end, with 
full commissioning of the mine in summer 2014. Pro-
gress reviews on the Natalka development suggested 
that, whilst this objective might be have been achiev-
able, it also carried the possibility of significant addi-
1 
Year-on-year (y-o-y). Hereinafter means comparing FY2013 with FY2012.
In January 2013, in the Trading Update for the 2012, we commit-
ted to produce 1,590-1,684 k oz in 2013. We met the production 
target thanks to the increased output at the Verninskoye mine 
(y-o-y

 increase by 43 k oz) and improved grade and recovery 
at the Olimpiada mine (38 k oz y-o-y increase).

tional expenditure and greater risks, against a backdrop 
of an unfavourable gold price environment. Our strategy 
is not to produce gold at any price and in any condi-
tions. Accordingly, we decided to re-sequence the de-
velopment plan for the Natalka project and postpone 
commissioning of the plant from summer 2014 to sum-
mer 2015 and continue working on optimising capital 
expenditures and operating technology; 
• we developed contingency plans for lower gold price 
scenarios. The plans include a detailed action list, start-
ing with improvements in operational efficiency, reduc-
tions in discretionary capital expenditures and decrease 
in the level of inventories through to measures like clo-
sure of non-efficient enterprises. The contingency plans 
also consider the possibility of hedging at certain gold 
price levels.
Impairments
Following the fall in the gold price in H1 2013, the Company, 
in line with the industry, has reassessed the future prospects 
of its exploration and evaluation (E&E) asset portfolio and has 
also reconsidered the economic recoverability of its mining as-
sets. As a result, based on a long-term gold price assump-
tion of approximately USD 1,350 per oz, the Company has 
recognised non-cash impairment charges of USD 472 million 
in 2013, where USD 49 million is related to the impairment 
of long-term stockpiles and gold-in-process. 
These impairments are indeed disappointing, but thanks 
to the Company’s conservative policy in evaluating reserves 
and projects, the level of impairments was moderate com-
pared to our global peers.
Our good operational results came out of the hard work of the 
Group’s employees over the last few years. On behalf of the 
management, I would like to thank our employees for their 
efforts in delivering this successful performance in 2013.

2.8.2. External market factors affecting 
the Group’s financial results
The Group’s results are affected significantly by movements 
in the price of gold, currency exchange rates (principally 
the Russian rouble/US dollar rate) and the prevailing infla-
tion rates. 
Gold price
The market price of gold is the most significant factor in-
fluencing profitability and operating cash flow. In 2013, the 
gold price was volatile and traded in the range USD 1,694 
per oz to USD 1,192 per oz. Gold opened the year at USD 
1,694 per oz and closed at USD 1,205 per oz, a fall of 29%. 
Average afternoon gold price fixing in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 (USD per oz)
Exchange rate
The Group’s revenue from gold sales is denominated in US 
dollars, but the majority of the Group’s operating expenses 
are denominated in Russian roubles (RUB). Accordingly, 
an appreciation of the Russian rouble against the US dollar 
may negatively affect the Group’s margins, increasing the 
US dollar value of its Russian rouble denominated costs. 
Conversely, an appreciation of the US dollar against the 
Russian rouble should positively affect the Group’s margins 
by decreasing the US dollar value of its rouble-denominated 
costs. In 2013, the USD appreciated by 7.6% against the 
RUB and by a further 10.4% in January – February 2014.
 RUB/USD exchange rate in 2013
Inflation
The Group’s principal operations are located in Russia. The 
increase in Russia’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) in 2013 
was 6.5% (2012: 6.6%), and the increase in the PPI (Pro-
ducer Price Index) was 8.1% (2012: 7%). The last fifteen 
years have seen both indices trending downwards.

In 2013, the Group’s gold sales amounted to USD 2,258,599 
thousand, 14% less than in 2012. The decrease in the value 
of gold sales is largely attributable to the fall in the gold 
price on the world market. At the end of 2013, the Group 
held approximately 34 k oz of refined gold, which were sold 
in January 2014. Thus, in the reporting period, the Group 
produced 1,649 k oz, and sold 1,616 k oz produced in 2013 
and 15 k oz produced in 2012.
Total sales volume in 2013 was 1,631 k oz, against 1,571 
k oz in 2012.
Revenue bridge for the years ended 31 December 
2013 and 2012 (USD million)
In 2013, the weighted-average realised gold price was USD 
1,385 per oz, a 17% decrease on 2012. This was USD 26 
per oz lower than the AAGPF on the London market, be-
cause of the seasonality of production from our alluvial de-
posits, which do not produce and sell gold during the first 
quarter of the year. The AAGPF for the first quarter of 2013 
was higher than the full year AAGPF.

Unrefined gold (doré) for all mines in the Krasnoyarsk business unit is stored in a single unit. Therefore gold sales volumes are bro-
ken down in proportion to refined gold production.
• In 2013, 42% of the Group’s gold sales came from 
the Olimpiada mine.
• In 2013, the Krasnoyarsk business unit sold 1,198 k oz. 
Year-end stocks at the refinery in Krasnoyarsk amount-
ed to 34 k oz, which were sold in 2014.
•  The Olimpiada mine produced 691 k oz of gold and sold 
680 k oz. Expansion of the bio-oxidation facility resulted 
in a higher recovery rate (74.5% vs. 73.7% in 2012) 
and therefore, higher production (up 6%).
• Production at the Titimukhta mine increased by 12% 
y-o-y following a plant upgrade and ore deliveries from 
the third party owned Veduga deposit.
• There was a slight decrease in ore grade at the Blago-
datnoye mine, but this was fully offset by an increase 
in the recovery rate (88.3% vs. 86.4% in 2012), follow-
ing automation of the plant.
• Production at the Verninskoye mine met its design pa-
rameters by the year-end. Following automation, the re-
covery rate increased by 10%. Sales increased by 93% 
compared to 2012.
• Output from the Kuranakh mine was stable  
at 138 k oz.
• Following the depletion of gold grade in sand washed, 
the Alluvials delivered lower volumes of gold.

Cash operating costs
Breakdown of сash operating costs for the years 
ended 31 December 2013 and 2012
Cash operating costs increased from USD 1,127,740 thou-
sand in 2012 to USD 1,267,931 thousand in 2013. This 12% 
increase resulted mainly from increasing costs for consum-
ables and spares, fuel and labour cost inflation.
Consumables and spares
A change of mining plan at the Olimpiada mine resulted in an 
increase of 28% in ore mined and coupled with the continu-
ing ramp-up in production over the year at the Verninskoye 
mine, resulted in an increased consumption of tyres, explo-
sives and spare parts. An increase in gold production at Olim-
piada (+6%), Titimukhta (+12%) and Verninskoye (+95%) 
resulted in higher consumption of cyanide, lubricants, other 
chemicals, grinding balls and spare parts. Market prices for 
some consumables and spares also increased: for example 
the average purchase price for cyanides increased by 10%.
Fuel
Fuel costs grew by 43% to USD 184,226 thousand. This 
increase was as a result of various factors:
• a 5% increase in in-house power generation at the Ol-
impiada diesel power station, to ensure stable power 
supply for the BIOX process;
• the increasing depth of mining at the Olimpiada pit 
which resulted in fuel and vehicle maintenance costs 
rising as distances lengthened;
• a fuel price increase of approximately 9%; 
• increases in consumption of diesel fuel, petrol, oil prod-
ucts and lubricants following an early start to the sea-
son at the alluvials operation.
Labour
In 2013, labour costs made up the largest component 
of cash operating costs. These costs increased by 13% 
to USD 385,781 thousand. The Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk ore 
business units were the major contributors to this increase:
•  staffing numbers increased and salary increases of be-
tween 10% and 14% were introduced at the Krasno-
yarsk operation to meet the needs of the competitive 
market for labour in the region;
• an 18% increase in the number of personnel at the Vernin-
skoye mine as a result of the continuing ramp-up;
• an increase in the number of personnel at the Com-
pany’s service business units due to the construction 
at Natalka.
Tax on mining
The mining tax charge decreased by 14% to USD 165,573 
thousand. The Group increased production by 5%, however 
this was offset by a 17% fall in the average realised gold price.
Power
Power expenses increased by 15% to USD 57,844 thousand. 
At the Krasnoyarsk business unit, external power consumption 
increased 9% as a result of an increase in ore processed. The 
Irkutsk ore business unit increased external power consump-
tion by 39%, and the Irkutsk alluvial business unit by 10%, 
as a result of connection to the federal grid.

Amortisation and depreciation 
of operating assets
Amortisation and depreciation of operating assets increased 
by 23% in 2013 to USD 209,152 thousand. The increase 
primarily relates to increases in depreciation charges for 
fixed assets at:
• Verninskoye, where the plant was put into operation 
in the second half of 2012 and the ramp-up in produc-
tion continued through 2013;
• Olimpiada, Titimukhta and Kuranakh, where the depre-
ciation of stripping activity asset has increased over the 
period due to higher carried forward balances.
Increase in gold-in-process  
and refined gold
In 2013, the total metal inventories balance increased 
by 61% mainly related to:
• an increase in ore stockpiles at the Krasnoyarsk busi-
ness unit. In the second quarter of 2013, the Group 
changed the mine plan at the Olimpiada deposit to en-
sure the optimisation of equipment use and enhance-
ments to in-pit safety, which resulted in ore stockpiling;
• continued stockpiling of low-grade ore at the Irkutsk ore 
business unit for future processing;
• mining operations started at Natalka in 2013. The stock-
piled ore will be used in production following the com-
mencement of the processing plant;
• a significant amount of refined gold accumulated at the 
Krasnoyarsk refinery plant, which was sold in January 
2014.
Various types of inventories are valued using different ap-
proaches. Refined gold is valued at the average cost of pro-
duction per saleable unit of metal. Work-in-process, stock-
piles and doré are valued at the average production costs 
at the relevant stage of production. For more details, please 
refer to section 2.8.8 “Review of the statement of financial 
position”.
2.8.5. Selling, general and administrative 
expenses (SG&A) (note 9 to the 
consolidated financial statements)
In 2013, the Group’s SG&A expenses decreased by 12% 
to USD 225,795 thousand mainly because taxes, other than 
mining and income taxes, declined by 59%.
Salaries
In 2013, the Group’s administrative labour costs increased 
by 13% to USD 151,027 thousand. 
The increase is mainly related to one-off severance re-
lated payments to former Senior managers of the Group 
and an increase in the number of administrative personnel 
at Verninskoye. 
2.8.6. Finance costs (note 12 to the 
consolidated financial statements)
The total cost of debt increased from 2.8% as at 31 December 
2012 to 4.4% as at 31 December 2013 and relates mainly 
to the 5.625% USD 750 million Notes issued during 2013. 
However, interest expenses accrued on the Notes and let-
ters of credit were capitalised within the Mine under devel-
opment balance, recognising the use of the proceeds for 
the Natalka project development. Therefore, the Group’s 
finance costs decreased by 56% in 2013 to USD 13,878 
thousand and cost of debt, net of interest capitalised, de-
creased from 2.8% to 2.7%.

as a result of the disposal of the mining assets in Kazakh-
stan and Kyrgyzstan with a net book value of USD 261,150 
thousand. The decrease in net book value on account of the 
sale was offset by transfers from capital construction-in-
progress due to: 
• completion of construction of the full flow-sheet at the 
Verninskoye mine and associated infrastructure, valued 
at USD 140,410 thousand;
• completion of various projects at the Krasnoyarsk busi-
ness valued at USD 109,748 thousand, including au-
tomation of the processing plant at Blagodatnoye and 
mill throughput expansion at Titimukhta. In addition, 
housing for 570 staff was commissioned at Olimpiada, 
replacing old facilities.

In 2013, additions to CIP were mainly driven by the following:
• a number of projects at the Krasnoyarsk business unit, 
including automation of two processing plants at Olim-
piada and one at Titimukhta, valued at USD 209,813 
thousand;
• development of infrastructure at Verninskoye valued 
at USD 53,253 thousand;
• increase of activities of the Capital construction BU at 
Natalka (USD 37,280 thousand), and
• the start of construction of the Peleduy – Mamakan pow-
er line (USD 30,949 thousand).
Mine under development (note 17 to the

Mine under development includes only the Natalka mine (Magadan 
business unit). For details see section 2.9.3 “Development” .
Exploration and evaluation assets 
(note 18 to the consolidated financial 
statements)
In 2013, the Group invested USD 32,652 thousand into 
exploration and reserves evaluation activities, some 28% 
less than in 2012. This decrease relates to a slowdown and 
termination of exploration activity:
• at Nezhdaninskoye, Degdekanskoye and some other 
unpromising deposits, which are not expected to be 
economically viable at current gold prices, and which 
were therefore impaired at 30 June 2013 (for details 
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements); 
• at Panimba, Medvezhy Zapadny and other deposits 
where exploration work has ceased because the depos-
its are in the final stage of reserve evaluation.

Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalised 
when the exploration and evaluation activities have not 
reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment 
of the existence of commercially recoverable gold resourc-
es. When the technical feasibility and commercial viability 
of extracting a gold resource are demonstrable and a deci-
sion has been made to develop a mine, capitalised explora-
tion and evaluation assets are reclassified to Mines under 
development. 
At the end of the year, exploration and evaluation assets 
decreased by 66%. Expenditures of USD 32,652 thou-
sand were offset by impairment of USD 316,468 thousand 
(see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and 
by disposal of subsidiaries (see notes 5.2 and 18 to the

This increase is represented by: 
• the rise in ore stockpiles at the Krasnoyarsk business 
unit. In Q2 2013, the Group reviewed the mine plan 
at the Olimpiada deposit in an effort to optimise equip-
ment utilisation and enhance in-pit safety. These chang-
es have resulted in an increase in stockpiled ore, which 
will be processed during 2014 and thereafter;
• mining of low-grade ore at the Irkutsk ore business unit, 
which is stockpiled for future processing;
• in 2013, 4.1 million tonnes of ore were mined for stock-
piling at Natalka, including 947 thousand tonnes at 2.0 
g/t, 1,498 thousand tonnes of ore at 1.0 g/t and 1,668 
thousand tonnes at 0.6 g/t;
• a significant amount of refined gold was accumulated 
at the Krasnoyarsk refinery plant totalling 34 k oz (2012: 
15 k oz), which the Group sold in January 2014. 
The value of stores and materials increased by 6%, from 
USD 449,767 thousand at the beginning of the year to USD 
476,366 thousand as at 31 December 2013, mainly due to:
• an increase in consumption at the Verninskoye mine;
• the Krasnoyarsk business unit which increased con-
sumption of fuel because of increased haulage costs 
following the change of the mining plan at Olimpiada 
and the works to enlarge the pit.
Capital and reserves (note 25 to the 
consolidated financial statements) 
The translation reserve has moved by USD 318,634 thou-
sand in 2013, which reflected the weakening of the Russian 
rouble. 
During the reporting period, the Group’s retained earnings 
decreased by 9% to USD 1,922,264 thousand, due to a de-
crease in net profit attributable to shareholders of the par-
ent Company of USD 140,274 thousand and USD 320,195 
thousand in dividends declared and paid in respect of 2012. 
Borrowings (note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements) 
During the year, the Company raised USD 1,092,617 thou-
sand in new debt and repaid USD 236,233 thousand. Please 
refer to section 2.8.9 “Cash flow analysis”, for details.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group’s consolidated debt 
was USD 1,205,586 thousand. The structure of the debt 
at year-end was as follows.

Net cash/(debt) is defined as short-term and long-term 
debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank 
deposits. Short-term bank deposits with an original matu-
rity of more than 3 months can be withdrawn on demand 
and therefore have the same liquidity as cash and cash 
equivalents. Net debt should not be considered as an alter-
native to current and non-current loans and borrowings and 
should not necessarily be construed as a comprehensive 
indicator of the Group’s measure of liquidity.

Operating activities
The decrease in cash inflow from operating activities resulted from a combination of factors, mainly the declining gold 
price and the increased working capital requirements due to growth in inventory balances at Verninskoye and Olimpiada.

Investing activities
The Group spent USD 1,023,381 thousand (2012: USD 
763,789 thousand) in investing activities. 
In 2013, purchases of capital construction-in-progress, ex-
ploration and evaluation assets and assets for mine under 
development totalled USD 1,347,217 thousand (2012: USD 
713,089 thousand). The Group raised USD 291,199 thou-
sand from the disposal of its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan.
Financing activities 
The Group raised USD 744,241 thousand from the issue 
of Notes due in 2020 (USD 750 million net of up front com-
mission), and USD 348,375 thousand from issued letters 
of credit and credit facilities from VTB Bank, Rosbank and 
Deutsche Bank. The Group paid out USD 363,162 thousand 
in dividends and USD 236,233 thousand to repay borrow-
ings. This resulted in a net cash inflow from financing activi-
ties of USD 493,222 thousand.
2.8.10. Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as profit before fi-
nance costs, income tax, income/(losses) from investments, 
depreciation, amortisation and interest, and is further adjust-
ed for certain items included in the table below. The Group 
has made these adjustments in calculating Adjusted EBITDA 
to provide a clearer view of the performance of its underly-
ing business operations and to generate a metric that it be-
lieves will give greater comparability over time with peers 
in its industry. The Group believes that Adjusted EBITDA  
is a meaningful indicator of its profitability and performance. 
This measure should not be considered as an alterna-
tive to profit for the year and operating cash flows based 
on IFRS and should not necessarily be construed as a com-
prehensive indicator of the Group’s measure of profitability.

In 2013, the TCC per oz sold increased by 1%. The key driver was an increase in the cost of gold sales by 6% (for more details, 
please refer to section 2.8.4 “Cost of gold sales”) partly offset by the appreciation of the US dollar against the Russian rouble. 
The aggregate Adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s principal rev-
enue generating business units is USD 917,932 thousand and 
including the results of the other companies of the Group 
gives a Group Adjusted EBITDA of USD 910,076 thousand.
2.8.11. Total cash costs per oz sold
The Group believes that the metrics total cash costs (TCC) 
and total cash costs per oz sold, although non-IFRS meas-
ures, provide a useful comparison with other industry players.  
Its use is common industry practice, although the method 
of its calculation may differ as these items are non-IFRS meas-
ures. An investor should not consider these items in isolation 
or as alternatives to the cost of sales, profit for the year at-
tributable to shareholders of the parent Company, net cash 
generated from operating activities or any other measure of fi-
nancial performance presented in accordance with IFRS.
Total cash costs per oz sold is total cash costs divided 
by ounces of gold sold during the period.

TCC per oz sold by mine in the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, USD per oz
•  Olimpiada mine: a 3% y-o-y decrease in TCC per ounce 
of gold sold as a result of an improvement in average 
grade and recovery;
• Blagodatnoye mine: a slight increase in TCC of 3% y-o-y 
from a lower grade of ore processed, offset by the im-
proved recovery rate;
• Titimukhta mine: an improvement of the recovery rate 
following installation of a new thickener and the expan-
sion of the hydro-metallurgical section, offset by a 12% 
decrease in gold grade;
• Verninskoye: a 10% increase in TCC as a result 
of a combination of an increase in consumption of vari-
ous mining and processing materials (ore mining vol-
umes increased), growth in the number of personnel 
and increased prices for goods purchased;
• Alluvials: a 5% decrease in TCC due to ongoing optimisa-
tion of the mining plan and a 6% decrease in personnel;
• Kuranakh: an increased zinc content in the ore fed to the 
plant significantly reduced the recovery rate. This metal-
lurgical issue, together with an increase in cash operat-
ing costs resulted in a 9% increase in TCC.
2.8.12. All-in sustaining cash  
costs per oz sold
In June 2013, the World Gold Council (WGC) published 
a guidance note on the all-in sustaining cash costs (AISC) 
metric for gold mining companies. It is expected that the 
adoption of AISC by precious metal producers may help 
to provide investors, governments, local communities and 
other stakeholders with better visibility into the true cost 
of producing gold.
AISC measures costs related to sustaining production
1
. 
We calculate it in accordance with the recommendation 
of the WGC including TCC, SG&A expenses, sustaining CAPEX 
and other cash costs attributable to current sales. 
In 2013, AISC for the Company was USD 1,002 per oz sold, 
which is 1% lower than in 2012 (USD 1,007 per oz sold). The 
main reasons for the decrease are explained by a 2% fall 
of the Russian rouble against the US dollar, 61% lower strip-
ping activity asset additions, and a 12% reduction in SG&A 
expenses partly offset by overall inflation in the cost of sales 
and a 31% increase in sustaining CAPEX.

Non-sustaining costs are those costs incurred at new operations and costs related to ‘major projects’ at existing operations where 
these projects will materially increase production. Companies need to publicly disclose those operations and ‘major projects’ which 
are considered non-sustaining. All other costs related to existing operations are considered sustaining.

2.9.2. Production
In 2013, the Company produced 1.65 million ounces of refined 
gold from continuing operations, a 5% increase on the 1.57 
million produced in 2012, and moved a total of 66 million cubic 
metres of rock in 2013 compared to 67 million 2012.
The Group mined 30 million tonnes
1
 of ore, up 28% on the 
23.5 million mined in 2012. The increase was primarily due 
to increased volumes at the Olimpiada and Verninskoye mines. 
In 2013, the Company processed 22 million tonnes of ore, 
3% more than last year, with all mines other than Olimpiada 
increasing their throughput.
At the Olimpiada and Verninskoye mines, the Group mined a to-
tal of 7 million tonnes more than it processed. In order to im-
prove safety of open mining operations, the Group reviewed the 
mining plan at Olimpiada. The new plan envisages a gradual 
transition from mining to stripping activities at the pit surface 
and as a result, the stripping ratio decreased to 1.8 m³/t from 
the 2.7 m³/t achieved in 2012. Mining will continue until July 
2014. After this date the feed for processing will come from the 
accumulated stockpiles. Once stripping works are complete, 
mining will recommence. At Verninskoye we maintain a high 
level of mining operations but stockpile low-grade material. 
This ore will be processed once power shortages are resolved 
(see section 2.9.3 “Development”) and new technological solu-
tions introduced (see section 2.4 “Future developments”).
Olimpiada (Krasnoyarsk region)
The Olimpiada mine is located in the Krasnoyarsk region 
of Russia, approximately 500 kilometres north of Krasno-
yarsk. Two mills with a total capacity of 8.0 mtpa process 
sulphide ores. These sulphide ores contain refractory sul-
phide minerals at concentrations of between 3% and 10%. 
The average gold grade of these sulphide ores is 3.5 g/t.
Olimpiada is an open pit mine with surface stockpiling. Rock 
is removed by excavation and hauling after blasting. The ore 
is processed using the gravity and flotation concentration meth-
od with subsequent bio-oxidation of the flotation concentrate 
and sorption leaching of bioleach product using the CIL process. 
Improved recovery rates and an increase in the average 
gold grade in the ore processed meant that total produc-
tion of refined gold was 691,273 ounces, up from 653,090 
in 2012 despite slightly lower processing volumes. Recovery 
rates continued to increase, up 0.8% to 74.5% and further 
improvements are anticipated following completion of the 
automation of the bio-oxidation facility in Q2 2014.

Blagodatnoye (Krasnoyarsk region)
The Blagodatnoye mine is in the Krasnoyarsk region, some 
25 km from the Olimpiada mine. The ores of the Blago-
datnoye deposit are quartz/micaceous schists with impreg-
nated and vein impregnated sulphide mineralisation.
The mine is an open pit with surface stockpiling. The mill 
was commissioned in 2010 and is based on gravity con-
centration, flotation and CIL. The plant has a processing 
capacity of 6.0 mtpa.
In 2013, Blagodatnoye produced 395,261 ounces. Full auto-
mation of the Blagodatnoye plant has resulted in processing 
volumes and recovery rates significantly exceeding design 
parameters offsetting a decrease in the gold grade of the 
ore processed. 
Titimukhta (Krasnoyarsk region)
The Titimukhta deposit is located 9 km northwest of the 
Olimpiada deposit. The deposit contains quartz vein and 
veinlet stockwork. Due to the close proximity of the deposit 
to the Olimpiada mine, the ores from Titimukhta are pro-
cessed through an older mill on the Olimpiada site.
Gold production at Titimukhta increased by 12% y-o-y 
to 130,789 ounces in 2013, including 9,356 ounces of re-
fined gold produced from ore purchased from the third 
party-owned Veduga mine in accordance with an off-take 
agreement. The increase was mainly due to the higher vol-
ume of ore processed and improved recovery rates follow-
ing an upgrade of the processing plant.

Verninskoye (Irkutsk region)
In December 2011, the Group commenced production at the 
Verninskoye mine, located in the Irkutsk region of Russia. 
The mill is based on gravity concentration, flotation and CIL 
and has a processing capacity of 2.2 mtpa. 
Verninskoye produced 89,100 ounces of gold in 2013, nearly 
double last year’s 45,586 ounces, as a result of higher process-
ing volumes, increased gold grade in the ore and improved 
recovery rates. Following the completion of full automation 
in Q4 2013, the Verninskoye plant is currently being fine-tuned 
to reach its design performance parameters.
Alluvials (Irkutsk region)
Our alluvial deposits are located in the Irkutsk region. 
The  Group mines gold using quarrying and dredging tech-
niques, followed by gravity separation. Stripping is per-
formed by walking excavators and bulldozers.
In the reporting period, the Company’s alluvial operations pro-
duced 205,417 ounces of gold, compared to 213,981 in 2012.

2.9.3. Development
Natalka (Magadan region)
Once fully completed, the Natalka mine in the Magadan re-
gion will be the largest gold mine in Russia (10 mtpa of ore 
processing capacity in 2015 with a potential increase up to 
40 mtpa). Over the course of 2013, the onsite construction 
team grew to 2,700 and much of the key infrastructure was 
constructed. 
The majority of the necessary engineering surveys have 
been carried out and planning of the site is complete.
Development of the facilities at the main mill are underway, 
the SAG mill and ball mill have been installed, foundations for 
the crushed ore storage facility are complete and the tem-
porary tailings dam is complete. Work continues on electric-
ity pylons to bring 110kV power lines to the facility and the 
majority of the necessary temporary roads have been con-
structed. Thirteen buildings providing canteens, recreation and 
accommodation facilities for the more than 2,400 construc -
tion workers and engineers have been built. Key technologi-
cal equipment has been delivered, the mining fleet and other 
equipment is on site (refer to note 17 “Mine under develop-
ment” to the consolidated financial statements).
The Company has decided to re-sequence the development 
plan for the Natalka mine and postpone commissioning 
of the plant from summer 2014 to summer 2015. While 
it is operationally possible to commence production at Na-
talka as previously planned, the Company deems it prudent 
to postpone final commissioning, given the recent substan-
tial decline in gold prices and the possibility of further weak-
ness. Polyus Gold expects to finalise detailed project revi-
sions by the middle of 2014 following a thorough project 
assessment, scheduled for completion during the first half 
of the year. In the meantime, development works onsite 
will continue, albeit at a slower pace. Mining works, which 
commenced in 2013, will also continue in accordance with 
the licence terms.
We believe that the re-sequencing of the project devel-
opment will allow the Company to identify additional cost 
savings and operational efficiencies, and the optimisation 
of capital and operating expenditures. Improvements to the 
project design are also being investigated, including the po-
tential implementation of photo-metric separation technol-
ogy (optical sorting) as a way to pre-enrich the ore (for 
further information please refer to section 2.4 “Future de-
velopments”).
Kuranakh (Republic of Sakha)
The Kuranakh mine is located in the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia) of Russia. Ore is mined from numerous depos-
its in the Kuranakh ore field. The area has a long history 
of mining and the deposits in the Kuranakh ore field have 
been significantly depleted and the central parts of the de-
posit which formerly had the most uniform ore bodies and 
the highest gold grade have been mined out.
Mining at Kuranakh uses open cut, drilling and blasting op-
erations. The processing plant is based on sorption technol-
ogy with subsequent electrolysis and smelting.
In 2013, Kuranakh produced 137,635 ounces of gold, which 
was in line with 2012.

Blagodatnoye mine expansion 
(Krasnoyarsk region)
The Company has been putting together detailed construc-
tion documentation for a project to expand the capacity 
of the Blagodatnoye mine to 8 mpta. We expect the docu-
mentation to be ready in the first half of 2014.
An automatic process control system was installed at the 
existing mill. As a result, in 2013, recovery increased by 2%  
(refer to note 16 “Capital construction-in-progress” to the 
consolidated financial statements).
Verninskoye processing plant automation 
(Irkutsk region)
We completed the construction and commissioning of an 
automatic process control system, and put in place a set 
of measures to optimise the operation of the mill and open 
pit, in particular partial replacement of pumps and the re-
placement of mixers and gravity and hydro-metallurgical 
equipment. This set of measures has helped to increase 
recovery rates. We expect that once this work is fully com-
pleted in 2014, recovery rates will meet planned levels (re-
fer to note 16 “Capital construction-in-progress” to the con-
solidated financial statements).
Peleduy – Mamakan power line 
(Irkutsk region and Republic of Sakha)
In order to guarantee supply to our strategic projects in the 
Irkutsk region, the Company is building a 110 kV power line 
from Peleduy in the Republic of Sakha to Mamakan in the 
Irkutsk region. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed 
detailed construction documentation, contracted all materi-
als and started the construction of foundations and pylons. 
Completion is expected by the end of 2014 (refer to note 16 
“Capital construction-in-progress” to the consolidated finan-
cial statements).
Razdolinskaya – Taiga power line 
(Krasnoyarsk region)
PGIL’s assets in the Krasnoyarsk region have a deficit of ex-
ternal grid power supply. In 2013, the Company started the 
development of project documentation to connect the Taiga 
substation near Blagodatnoye to the Razdolinskoye substa-
tion. This new power line would allow all our operating mines 
in the Krasnoyarsk region to obtain an access to the prospec-
tive power supply from the recently commissioned Boguchan-
skaya hydro power station. It is expected, that commissioning 
of this new power transmission line will lead to a decrease 
in power costs for the Krasnoyarsk business unit. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

2.9.4. Exploration (refer to note 18 
“Exploration and evaluation assets” 
to the financial statements)
In 2013 the Company carried out exploration work at 10 hard 
rock and a number of small alluvial deposits and prospective 
areas. The volume of drilling was 79 thousand metres. 
Olimpiada (Krasnoyarsk region)
The Company explored the western flank of the deposit 
in order to convert resources into reserves. This was suc-
cessfully achieved. A Feasibility Study (to Russian stand-
ards) and an estimate of reserves is underway and will 
be completed in 2014.
Blagodatnoye (Krasnoyarsk region)
Exploration of the deep levels of the Blagodatnoye deposit 
to estimate reserves and resources is ongoing and is ex-
pected to be completed in Q4 2015. Almost 11 thousand 
metres have been drilled, and a further 10 thousand metres 
of drilling is planned for 2014. Metallurgical and mineralogi-
cal testing will be undertaken in parallel with the drilling.
Verninskoye (Irkutsk region)
Exploration was completed around the flanks and at deep 
levels of the Verninskoye deposit (26 thousand metres were 
drilled). A feasibility study (meeting Russian standards) com-
menced in 2013 and will estimate the new reserves and re-
sources at the Verninskoye deposit and the associated Per-
venets and Perevalnoye deposits. Should these reserves and 
resources be proved viable, it would support an increased 
throughput at the processing plant at the Verninskoye mine.
Alluvial deposits (Irkutsk region)
38 thousand metres were drilled at 20 potential sites. 
Kuranakh (Republic of Sakha)
In 2013, a feasibility study (meeting Russian standards) and 
an estimate of reserves was undertaken and submitted for 
state approval. The results of the advanced and operational 
exploration are in hand and a block model of the 11 depos-
its in the Kuranakh ore field was created. The outlines of the 
open pits were optimised and an estimate of reserves was 
produced for each deposit in the ore field. 
In addition a feasibility study (to Russian standards) and 
an estimate of reserves contained in the low grade stock-
piles at Kuranakh was produced and submitted for state 
approval in 2013. The stockpiles also underwent an envi-
ronmental risk assessment. The LOM (life-of-mine) plan as-
sumes 16 years of mining with further processing at the 
Kuranakh processing plant. 
The total increase in JORC Proved and Probable reserves 
at Kuranakh in 2013 was 1.1 m oz.
Chertovo Koryto deposit (Irkutsk region)
A drilling programme was undertaken at potential sites 
within the exploration area and a report has been issued. 
LLC Polyus Project, the Group’s design unit, initiated the 
development of the detailed design works for construction 
of a mine at the deposit. 
Any decision to proceed with implementation of the project 
requires completion of the construction of the power line 
from Peleduy to our operating facilities in the Irkutsk region, 
as described in section 2.9.3 “Development”.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Panimba area (Krasnoyarsk region)
Exploration has been undertaken at 3 remote locations: Pan-
imba, Mikhailovsky, and Zolotoy. As a result of this exploration, 
Panimba has been identified as a gold bearing deposit. 
The Panimba deposit is a quartz schist with a low sulphide 
concentration in the ore and free gold. A feasibility study (to 
Russian standards) has been developed and was submitted 
to GKZ (the Federal Reserves Committee) in 2013. Approval 
is expected in 2014. 
Razdolinskaya area (Krasnoyarsk region)
A pre-feasibility study (to Russian standards) to estimate 
reserves and resources has been developed and reviewed 
by State experts in 2013. The JORC compliant resources 
of the deposit are estimated at 3.2 m oz of gold. Currently 
the project is awaiting a mining permit from the regional 
government.

2.11. Corporate social responsibility
The Group is committed to the principles of sustainable 
development and the objective of the removal of environ-
mental, health and safety, and social risks. These risks may 
adversely affect the Group’s interaction with stakeholders 
and the Group’s overall efficiency.
In 2013, the Company continued implementation of meas-
ures aimed at improving and developing its policies in these 
crucial areas.
Environment
The Group’s activities, like those of all other miners can 
have a severe environmental impact, damaging flora and 
fauna and their habitats. Soil and subsoil are stripped in ad-
vance of mining activities. Ore processing involves the use 
of dangerous chemicals, including cyanide, which could 
pose a significant environmental threat to watercourses 
and the ecosystems that depend on them. Our operations 
are major consumers of energy produced from fossil fuels 
and therefore our GHG (green house gases) emissions are 
significant.  
The Сompany keeps its environmental policy under continu-
al review, seeks to minimise its use of dangerous chemicals 
and has put water management systems in place. At pre-
sent, there are no legal requirements with regard to GHG 
emissions. However, while replacement and upgrading 
of gas-purifying and ventilation systems would entail signifi-
cant investment, the Company feels that, as well as being 
environmentally responsible, such investment would offer 
a competitive advantage in the long term. 
As a responsible mining company Polyus Gold conducts as-
set retirement assessments and has developed life of mine 
plans in order to mitigate long-term risks for all its stake-
holders, planning the allocation of the necessary funds and 
land rehabilitation measures in advance. 
Securing mining licences is crucial for the Group’s long-
term survival and hence strict compliance with legislation 
is essential. The Company monitors legal developments 
closely and participates in discussions on relevant legisla-
tive proposals. For information on the environmental risks 
posed by the Company’s operations, and the measures put 
in place by the Company to mitigate against them, see sec-
tion 2.5 “Principal Risks and Uncertainties” and section 3 
“Sustainability report”.
Employees
The Company, regrettably has to report three work related 
fatalities in 2013 and considers this totally unacceptable. 
Safety remains а core value and is of paramount importance 
to the Group, in all its endeavours. The Company’s current 
focus is on ensuring immediate response, medical aid and 
evacuation in case of emergency. The Company strives 
to prevent any accidents and injuries at its operations and 
constant vigilance and preparedness are prerequisites for 
fostering a culture of safety. For information on the safety 
challenges at our mines and the Company’s plans to miti-
gate against them refer to section 3 “Sustainability report”.
Polyus Gold is one of the largest employers in the are-
as where it operates. Attracting and developing talented 
and motivated employees who share the corporate values 
of Polyus Gold is crucial to ensuring continued success. De-
terioration in the quality of professional training standards 
in Russian educational institutions and the consequent 
shortage of qualified specialists could pose a serious long 
term threat to the Company. Expansions in the Group’s 
current operations and potential development projects will 
require a growing demand for highly-qualified profession-
als. Growth opportunities therefore might be limited by the 
inability to recruit appropriate staff. For information on the 
challenges faced by the Company in this area and its ef-
forts to mitigate against them, refer to section 3 “Sustain-
ability report”.
Social, community and human rights
Polyus Gold strives to establish positive relationships with 
individuals and legal entities to become more effective 
in achieving the combined social and economic goals of the 
Company and local communities. 
The Group recognises the necessity to assess the needs 
of communities in the regions where it operates and to work 
to ensure that its operations are beneficial to those commu-
nities. The Company aims to be honest in its dealings with 
local people about the Company’s true impacts on the envi-
ronment and the social and economic situation. 
Polyus Gold operates in strict compliance with Russian legis-
lation, which incorporates much international human rights 
legislation. The Сompany’s Human Rights policy was ap-
proved by the Board on 13 December 2013, and the Stake-
holder Engagement policy was signed-off by the Committee 
Chairman. These policies set new standards and parameters  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

for the Company’s work with the local communities where 
the Group operates. No issues regarding human rights were 
identified during 2013. For information on the Company’s 
work in this area and the measures taken to mitigate any 
challenges see section 3 “Sustainability report”.
Diversity
The Group’s recently introduced diversity policy (see sec-
tion 6.4 “Diversity policy”) commits the Board to open and 
transparent recruitment policies and the appointment of the 
most suitable candidate for every role.
Since its shares were admitted to the Premium segment

2.12. Going concern statement
The Group has a moderate financial position, solid opera-
tions and significant ore reserves. We start 2014 with USD 
808,675 thousand in cash and cash equivalents and USD 
1,205,586 thousand in debt. The 2013 financial results 
showed that with an average realised gold price of USD 
1,385 per oz) and a RUB/USD exchange rate of 31.85 (for 
more information please refer to 2.8.2 “External market fac-
tors affecting the Group’s financial results”) the Group gen-
erated Adjusted profit from continuing operations

 of USD 
563,791 thousand from its existing mining operations. 
Excluding growth capital expenditure requirements, our 
operating cash flows are sufficient to finance our working 
capital requirements (USD 283,148 thousand in 2013). The 
directors are confident of financing the remaining capital 
expenditure required to complete the Natalka development.
In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Direc-
tors have taken account of the Group’s financial position, 
expected future trading performance, its borrowings and 
available credit facilities and its capital expenditure com-
mitments, together with other risks facing the Group. After 
making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in opera-
tional existence for at least the next 12 months from the 
date of these consolidated financial statements with some 
uncertainties related to external market factors. The Direc-
tors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The mission of Polyus Gold International Limited stated in its 
Code of Corporate Ethics, is to develop natural resources and hu­ man potential for the benefit of shareholders, employees and the 
local community. 
PGIL firmly believes that the success of its business is inex­ tricably intertwined with its sustainability performance. The 
Group constantly strives to enhance its management of sus­ tainability and its data collection procedures so as to obtain 
timely, reliable and complete information on its performance. 
In 2013 the Group continued to develop its sustainability 
framework, creating new policies and procedures and modi­ fying its governance structure for managing sustainability.
The Group first began publishing information on safety, 
environmental protection and social responsibility in 2006. 
Initially, the Company followed a biennial reporting cycle, 
before switching to reporting on an annual basis in 2012. 
The Company’s previous Sustainability Report was pub­ lished in 2013 and covered the year 2012. 
The Group’s reports, along with additional information on its 
sustainability performance, are available on the Company’s 
website, at http://polyusgold.com/investors/reports/annu­ al_reports and http://www.polyusgold.com/sustainability/. 
This, the Group’s fifth sustainability report – Sustainability 
Report for the Year 2013 (the Report) reflects its sustain­ ability performance for the period from 1 January 2013 
to 31 December 2013.
Guidelines and standards
The Report was prepared in accordance with GRI G4 Guide­ lines and the requirements of the Mining and Metals Sec­ tor Supplement. The Report is prepared in accordance with 
Comprehensive GRI G4 requirements. 
The report has been prepared with regard to the G4 Princi­ ples for defining report quality, these are balance, compara­ bility, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and, enabling comparison 
with the Group’s previous reports and the reports of leading 
international mining companies. References to information 
sources covering the Standard disclosures are presented 
in the GRI Content Index.
The Company adheres to the AA1000 Accountability Prin­
cip les Standard – a framework based on the three following 
principles, for managing and reporting sustainability per­ formance:

to gain a full understanding of issues;
• materiality: determining which issues are important 
to the Company and its stakeholders; and
• responsiveness: responding to material issues and be­ ing transparent about the Group’s performance. 
The recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cor­ porate Accounting and Reporting Standard are used to col­ lect data on and calculate greenhouse gas emissions.
Report boundaries
GRI Guidelines were applied when defining the boundaries 
of the report as a whole, as well as for individual perfor­ mance indicators. According to these guidelines, the report 
should cover the subsidiaries over which the Group has op­ erational and financial control, as well as subsidiaries that 
impact upon the Group’s operational, financial, social and

Data measurement techniques
The primary source of data and information for the sus­ tainability report is the Group’s own corporate sustainability 
data collection system. Site­level reports are consolidated 
and verified at corporate level annually, with the aim of col­ lecting information on material sustainability indicators.
Information on health and safety, employees and social is­ sues is acquired through the internal reporting system. La­ bour performance indicators are calculated based on head­ count as at the end of 2013, and include, if applicable, 
information on the managing Company for the Russian as­ sets (OJSC Polyus Gold, located in Moscow). Environmen­ tal data is mainly collected through federal state statisti­ cal monitoring forms, which are complemented by internal 
reporting forms. The forms are aggregated regularly on an 
ad hoc, daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis depending 
on the requirements of the Company. 
The GRI indicators are calculated as specified in the GRI 
G4 Guidelines or in accordance with the Company’s internal 
requirements. 
All PGIL financial performance indicators are denominated 
in USD, which is also the currency used in the Group’s au­ dited IFRS consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2013.
Report content
In defining the report content, the Group was guided by the 
principle for defining report content stipulated by GRI 
Guidelines:
• stakeholder inclusiveness;
• sustainability context;
• materiality; and
• completeness.
The reported information is comparable with that of previ­ ous reports and serves as a basis for a comprehensive as­ sessment of sustainability performance. In seeking to fully 
and objectively reflect its performance, the Group discloses 
transparently in the Report both its achievements and the 
challenges that arose during the reporting period.
In 2013, the Group applied a more formalised approach 
to materiality assessment (see “Sustainability Approach”). 
The Report focuses on the following issues, identified 
as material in terms of their impact on the Group’s activities 
and on stakeholder interests and expectations:
• the potential impact on the Group’s business develop­ ment strategy;
• the economic, social and environmental impacts 
on communities affected by the Group’s operations; and
• stakeholders’ interests and expectations.
The material issues may have an impact both within and 
outside of the Company, affecting the Group’s performance 
as well as the communities it operates in. Particular empha­ sis was put on managing these issues during the reporting 
year, as is reflected in this Report.
Restatements and significant changes
Comparison with the 2012 Sustainability report, shows that 
there have been no material changes in applicable methods 
for measuring and presenting data, or to reporting bounda­ ries in relation to the Group as a whole.
In 2013, the Group sold its assets in Kazakhstan.
Assurance
The Group is well aware that independent sustainability re­ port assurance enables the Company to improve the qual­ ity of reported information (including compliance with the 
principles of balance, accuracy and reliability as they relate 
to the presented performance data), satisfy stakeholders’ 
requirements and determine the effectiveness of internal 
processes. With this in mind, the Group engaged a pro­ fessional firm to provide sustainability reporting assurance 
services.
In 2013, a decision was made to take a further step in en­ suring report credibility. This Report features reasonable as­ surance of a number of GRI standard disclosures, in order 
to increase the transparency and quality of the reporting 
information. The standard disclosures for which reasonable 
assurance has been given are indicated in the GRI Content 
Index. 
More detailed information on the boundaries and the sub­ ject of assurance can be found in the “Independent Assur­ ance Statement” section of the Report.
Contact information
Feedback from stakeholders on the completeness, objectiv­ ity and materiality of information disclosed in sustainability 
reports plays a key role in helping the Company to improve 
its management of sustainability and its non-financial re­ porting processes. Your questions, comments or sugges­ tions regarding this Report are therefore very welcome, and 
can be sent to:

The Company strives to achieve production growth while 
adhering to the principles of sustainable development. 
Being aware of its responsibility to investors, employees 
and communities in the regions where it operates, PGIL 
aspires to be a forward­thinking and innovative Compa­ ny, acting proactively to meet all the challenges posed 
by the demanding and versatile environment in which the 
Group works.
Having adopted the GRI G4 Guidelines, the Company em­ barked on a path of gradual but substantial internal change. 
The broad spectrum of GRI G4 requirements for materiality 
assessment calls for a significant shift in existing internal pro­ cesses and procedures, and is not yet fully incorporated in the 
Company’s day­to­day activities. PGIL realises that there 
is still a long way to go, but the Company is keen to tackle all 
the challenges involved and meet and exceed its goals. 
3.1. Sustainability approach
Comprehensive improvement of all aspects of the Group’s activities 
for the benefit of stakeholders is PGIL’s strategic priority. 
PGIL strives for constant improvement in all aspects of its activities 
taking into account the interests of a wide range of stakeholders. 
3.1.1. Materiality and risk management
At present, the materiality assessment process is based on an 
extensive analysis of the risks that the Group faces. Until 2012, 
the Group’s focus with regards to identifying material issues 
was focused on identifying production risk. Extensive consulta­ tions were held with business unit specialists; various mitiga­ tion actions were brainstormed and analysed, and an assess­ ment methodology was developed, laying the foundation for 
risk prioritisation through risk matrix compilation. Risks were 
reassessed on a half­ yearly and annual basis after BUs had 
filed reports on the risks to their business. 
In late 2012, the Company moved towards incorporating 
strategic risks, which include a wide range of sustainability 
aspects. The overall approach to consolidation of material 
issues resembles that of production risks in previous report­ ing periods, however, the risks are also defined at a much 
more senior level within the Group as well (the Corporate 
Centre and BU top management). The sustainability risks 
evaluated as significant are included in an action plan that 
specifies responsible risk managers in each BU and dead­ lines and allocated funds for the management of the identi­ fied risk. The results of the risk management activities are 
reviewed by the Board of Directors on a half­ yearly basis. 
The HR, H&S, environmental and community development 
risks thus identified are the most pressing faced by the 
Company. Although stakeholder consultation is not yet part 
of the materiality assessment process, the Company does 
not intend to stand still and plans to further enhance its 
procedures in this field. Our first step in this direction was 
adoption of a Stakeholder Engagement Policy in the report­ ing period.
The main material issues were defined with a view to iden­ tifying the following:
• the potential impact on the Group’s business develop­ ment strategy;
• the economic, social and environmental impacts 
on communities affected by the Group’s operations; 
and
• stakeholders’ interests and expectations.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.1.2. Stakeholder engagement
The Company strives to engage openly and proactively with 
all its stakeholders. In its relationships with individuals, le­ gal entities and the authorities PGIL is guided by its Corpo­ rate Code of Ethics. In fulfilling its commitments to constant 
development and improvement, the Company developed 
two crucial documents in 2013.
• A Stakeholder Engagement Policy; and
• A Human Rights Policy.
The Stakeholder Engagement Policy which was approved 
in December 2013 aims to formalise the Company’s inter­ action with stakeholders. PGIL is committed to identifying 
and engaging project stakeholders and to develop strate­ gies that are socially and culturally sensitive and tailored 
to the needs of each stakeholder group. These strategies 
aim to inform stakeholders about Polyus Gold activities, ad­ dress their concerns and expectations, provide appropriate 
feedback and enable collaboration. 
In its Human Rights Policy, the Company pledges to de­ termine and assess the impact of its operations on human 
rights, to establish a confidential grievance mechanism, and 
to monitor and report on the implementation of the Policy. 
These documents are designed to radically overhaul the 
Company’s processes and interactions. 
2013 also saw the appointment of a sustainability and com­ munity manager at the Natalka project, paving the way for 
the introduction of such a position at all operations. PGIL 
is gradually embracing international best practice, making 
stakeholder engagement an inherent part of its processes 
and fostering a culture of diversity and mutual respect. 
3.1.3. Supply chain management
PGIL does not currently conduct rigorous assessment of its 
supply chain against sustainability criteria. The key assess­ ment factors in the bidding process are the credibility of the 
potential suppliers and the quality of the products and ser­ vices. All supplier contracts are scrutinized by Legal Depart­ ment specialists to ensure compliance with Russian law. The 
majority of the Company’s suppliers are located in Russia 
and comply with Russian legal requirements, including the 
Labour Code, which guarantees labour rights. Other suppli­ ers comply with the requirements of the national legislation 
of the countries where they are registered. When transpor­ tation of hazardous substances is required, the Company 
engages only licensed providers. In 2013 about 3% of all 
the Company’s suppliers were engaged in the transporta­ tion of hazardous substances. Potential counterparties have 
to fill out a questionnaire and to provide charter and other 
documents which are also required for anti­money launder ­ ing purposes.
The Group’s suppliers include local businesses in areas where 
the Group has operations, as well as large international sup­ pliers. The Group endeavours as much as possible to engage 
and support local suppliers, with a view to enhancing commu­ nity development opportunities. In its procurement activities 
the Company at BU level also takes into account the interests 
of small­ and medium­sized businesses.

A priority in 2013 was increasing procurement transparency 
and attracting new suppliers, so as to achieve lower purchase 
prices and improved delivery times. In addition, there was 
a shift in focus towards direct contracts with manufacturers.
Regulations on the Tender Committee were developed and 
implemented, stipulating cross­ functional collective deci­ sion­making on major purchases.
PGIL is working actively on developing and implementing 
procurement risk management measures.
The Company is considering expanding its supplier assess­ ment procedures to cover environmental performance, la­ bour practices, human rights and social impact, including 
the introduction of potential supplier auditing.
 
3.1.4. Corruption
The Group complies fully with international and Russian anti­ money laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislation 
and applies anti­corruption procedures and programmes. The 
Group has approved and complies with its policy on ‘Internal 
Regulations for Counteracting the Legalisation (Laundering) 
of Proceeds from Crime and Terrorist Financing’, and an anti­ corruption policy based on the UK Bribery Act, and has ap­ pointed officers responsible for implementing its anti-corrup­ tion procedures and programmes.
The anti­corruption measures require all employees 
to remain vigilant in order to identify potential incidents 
of corruption and corruption risks. In the reporting pe­ riod, an e­learning program on the anti­corruption policy 
was developed and widely implemented. The programme 
is mandatory for all HQ employees and over 90% of them 
passed it successfully during the reporting period. Feedback 
on its content and quality has been positive. An educational 
programme on counteracting the legalisation of illegally ac­ quired proceeds is under development. For more informa­ tion please see Section 6.3 and 3.1 of this Report.
 
3.1.5. Commitments to external initiatives
The Group is actively involved in various external initiatives 
and supports a number of activities in collaboration with 
organisations such as:
• The Russian Union of Gold Producers (a non-profit or­ ganisation);
• The Partnership of Russian Mining Operators (a non­ profit organisation);
• The Russian Union of Gold Prospectors (a non-profit or­ gansation);
• The Russian Union of Mining Surveyors (a public body);
• Mining Work (a non-profit partnership that promotes 
the mining industry);
• The Eurasian Business Council (a non­commercial part ­ nership promoting trade and economic ties);
• The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 
(the Group is not yet a member but is in the process 
of achieving full compliance with ICMM requirements).

Our opinion and conclusions
Based on the scope of our work and the assurance procedures we performed we conclude that:
Reasonable assurance opinion:
• the selected sustainability performance data, listed under ‘reasonable assurance’ below, and compiled as described 
in PGIL’s basis of reporting and presented on pages 67–69; 79–85 are fairly stated;
• the PGIL sustainability reporting at a GRI G4 comprehensive level is, in all material respects, fairly stated.
Limited assurance conclusion:
• nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected sustainability performance data, listed 
under ‘limited assurance’ below, and compiled as described in PGIL’s basis of reporting and presented on pages 71–77 
are materially misstated.
Scope of our work and the assurance standards we used
We have been engaged by the Board of Directors of PGIL to perform assurance procedures on:
Reasonable assurance
• Total energy consumption (Mwh);
• Total air emissions (tonnes);
• Total waste generated (thousand tonnes);
• Total water consumption (m
3
);
• LTI frequency rate (per 200,000) hours worked;
• Number of fatalities;
• Number of new cases of occupational disease.
Limited assurance
• Composition of governance bodies and breakdown of employees per employee category according to gender, age 
group, minority group membership and other indicators of diversity;
• Average hours of training per year by employee gender and employee category;
• Benefits provided to full time employees;
• Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development 
programs;
• Monetary value of significant fines and total number of non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and 
regulations.
GRI assurance 
Using Global Reporting Initiative G4 Reporting Principles and Standard Disclosures (‘the GRI guidelines’) in preparing the 
report – PGIL’s has applied the GRI guidelines at a comprehensive level in preparing the report.
We carried out assurance on the selected key performance indicators in accordance with the International Standard on As­ surance Engagements 3000 (ISAE3000). 
To achieve limited assurance the ISAE3000 requires that we review the processes, systems and competencies used 
to compile the areas on which we provide assurance. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating 
effectiveness of processes and internal controls.

To achieve reasonable assurance the ISAE3000 requires that we review the processes, systems and competencies used 
to compile the areas on which we provide assurance. 
Considering the risk of material error, we planned and performed our work to obtain all of the information and explanations 
we considered necessary to provide sufficient evidence to support our assurance conclusion. 
Our key assurance procedures
To form our conclusions, we undertook the following procedures:
• interviewing PGIL personnel, including the Sustainability reporting team;
• analysed and reviewed on a non­statistical sample basis the key structures, systems, processes, procedures and con­ trols relating to the collation, aggregation, validation and reporting processes of the selected sustainability performance 
indicators; 
• checking the report against the requirements of GRI G4 comprehensive level;
• reviewing information and reasoning about the Reports’ assertions regarding sustainability performance in 2013; and
• reviewing the content of the Report against the findings of the aforementioned procedures and, as necessary, provided 
recommendations for improvement.
Where data relating to prior reporting years has been restated by PGIL no additional work has been undertaken by Deloitte 
to review the accuracy and completeness of the restated data. No assurance is provided over restated data.
Our independence and competencies in providing assurance to PGIL
• We complied with Deloitte’s independence policies, which address and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements

This report details our performance in several key areas 
affecting the Company’s business and stakeholders: Health 
and Safety, Sustainability Governance, Environmental Stew­ ardship, Community Development, Employee Engagement, 
and Stakeholder engagement.
Health and safety is the most critical part of Polyus Gold’s 
business and sustainability strategy. We continue to work 
towards achieving zero fatalities. We have identified and 
analysed all the incidents for 2009–2012 and implemented 
‘Golden Safety Rules’, which are designed to prevent the 
most common operational incidents. These rules are now 
used in each of our operating Business Units. Moreover, our 
‘Courageous Safety Leadership’ training was further incor­ porated, with the aim of promoting interdependent health 
and safety awareness. We believe that with a large number 
of newly trained employees, behaviors are changing, to the 
benefit of safety and health. 
Our environmental management system is another priority 
for Polyus Gold’s sustainability strategy. This year, we fo­ cused on introducing an integrated management system 
addressing both environmental and safety aspects. 
Our success is driven by our employees’ diverse back­ grounds, skills, experience and talents. At Polyus Gold we 
believe that a culture of mutual respect, transparency and 
inclusion improves employee retention and engagement, 
and enables the Company to deliver high performance and 
maintain a competitive advantage. We are committed to 
the further improvement of our labour practices, accommo­ dating international best practices and pursuing an align­ ment of corporate and individual goals. 
We continue our work with local communities. This year, 
we have established a new stakeholder engagement policy, 
which we will put into practice in 2014.
Our sustainability governance model is a key part of our 
success in adhering to our ethical and sustainable values. 
This year, we have managed to further integrate this model 
at different levels of our Company. At the Board of Directors 
level, the audit committee took an active role in improving 
our ethical and sustainable performance. The committee 
provided greater accuracy in analysing data, and develop­ ing corrective and future action plans. 
Transparency is one of our fundamental business principles: 
we strive to increase the level of transparency in our report­ ing each year, and this year we prepared our integrated report 
in compliance with GRI G4 Guidelines. We continue working 
with Deloitte as our independent auditor and for the first time 
this year we claim ‘reasonable assurance’ for several indicators.
Our goal is to maintain our successful business performance 
and, in doing so, to be among the industry leaders in sustain­ ability. We realise that this is a difficult path to take. Yet even 
though it sounds ambitious, we are taking small steps and are 
coming closer and closer towards this goal every year. 
This report is an opportunity for us to present our achieve­ ments and to share our plans for the future of Polyus Gold 
and the environment we operate in. I look forward to your 
feedback, which will help us to improve our performance. 
With kind regards,
Anthony J. Nieuwenhuys

3.3. Message from the Chief 
Operating Officer
Dear Friends,
When I reflect on our performance in 2013, I am proud of our 
progress as an organisation in terms of sustainability. 
At PGIL, we believe that our employees are our most valua­ ble asset. We aim to make sure that when children of our em­ ployees grow up and come to work for us, they will see Pol­ yus Gold as a safe, caring, and trustful company to work for.  
This approach helps us to achieve the highest targets and satisfy 
the most demanding shareholder expectations. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.4. Sustainability  
governance
Polyus Gold has robust sustainability governance procedures 
to oversee its sustainability agenda and ensure its long­term val ­ ue. The Group continues to implement its sustainability principles 
at every stage of its operations. 
The Group believes that changes made in 2013 will result in im­ proved sustainability management in 2014 and beyond. The dia­ gram below reflects these changes and shows the Group’s sus­ tainability governance structure.

The Health, Safety, Environment and Community (HSEC) 
Board Committee has been assisting the Board of Direc­ tors since 2011 and plays a key role in integrating sustain­ ability values into the Group’s decision­making process and 
mitigating risks related to health and safety, environment 
and community. Among other responsibilities, the HSEC 
Committee evaluates the effectiveness of the Group’s poli­ cies and procedures, ensures that all employees, regard­ less of their position, comply with internal practices and 
national legislation related to HSE issues, encourages the 
development of best practice, and examines management 
responses to incidents and accidents. The Committee meets 
at least four times a year. The Committee has well­estab ­ lished communication channels with the Board of Directors. 
The Board discusses the sustainability report and provides 
its input, prior to publication 
In 2013, the Group restructured its sustainability govern­ ance and redefined the processes carried out by the HSE 
and HR departments. Two regional managers were appoint­ ed to act under the HSE Department, while the HR depart­ ment delegated its responsibilities for interacting with its 
business units to one division and for personnel administra­ tion and organisational development to another.
One of the main positive changes in the Company’s sus­ tainability governance structure in 2013 is the active role 
of the Audit Committee in developing and incorporating the 
best sustainability practices at all company levels. Through­ out the last year, the Polyus Gold management team have 
been working closely with the Audit Committee, exchanging 
ideas on sustainability issues, have sought feedback on the 
Company’s Sustainability report, and developed new best 
practice policies for the Company. In addition, the Audit 
Committee took an active part in preparing the Group’s sus­ tainability report in compliance with GRI G4. In 2013, the 
Polyus Gold International Limited Sustainability report has 
been audited by Deloitte, and some indicators have been 
verified with “reasonable assurance”. The Group is commit­ ted to complying with the highest standards of the ICMM 
sustainability programme.

3.5.1. Approach
Safety remains a core value of the Company, and is the 
first priority in all its endeavors. The Group truly believes 
that everyone who works with Polyus Gold has the right 
to return home safely, and it makes every effort to achieve 
this. The Company believes that all injuries are preventable, 
and is committed to integrating safety management into all 
aspects of the Polyus Gold business. 
In the reporting period, the Group continued its committed 
approach to health and safety by identifying all potential 
risks, learning from previous incidents and implementing 
risk mitigation processes, technologies and behaviors.
The Group’s approach to safety is outlined in its Health and 
Safety Policy, a comprehensive framework written in accord­ ance with OHSAS 18001 and supported by a set of safety 
principles and mandatory safety standards. This underpins 
the delivery of the Company’s safety vision, which outlines 
a risk­ based approach to safety. To achieve its high safety 
target – zero fatalities – the Group is implementing a health 
and safety management system (HSMS) at all its operat­ ing mines and development project sites. The Group’s key 
health and safety commitments, which are fundamen­ tal to the HSMS, are highlighted on the Group’s corpo­ rate web page: http://www.polyusgold.com/sustainability/ 
health_and_safety/.
The Group’s health and safety activities are led by the 
Health, Safety, Environment and Community Committee, 
the function and responsibilities of which are described 
in details in Section 3.4 of this report.
3.5.2. Highlights of 2013
The Group continues to place the highest importance 
on upholding its values and ensuring that safety is para­ mount in every activity. Regrettably, although the Compa­ ny achieved safety improvements in the reporting period, 
three people lost their lives due to safety incidents while 
working at the Company’s most challenging alluvial sites. 
The Group considers any fatality as unacceptable and is ex­ tremely saddened by these fatalities. 
An incident and accident monitoring and reporting sys­ tem is in place and immediate in­depth investigations take 
place: the accidents were thoroughly analysed, with the 
involvement of an independent consulting company spe­ cialising in health and safety audits, with relevant follow­up 
action being taken.
The Company constantly strives to improve safety, and 
to reinforce its strong safety culture and Health and Safety 
Management structure. In the reporting period, the Com­ pany placed extra emphasis on health issues. As planned, 
a regional occupational health manager, reporting to the 
HSEC Director, was taken on, to concentrate specifically 
on improving employee health.
Another major initiative to improve occupational health 
standards at the Group was the implementation of an inter­ nal standard on medical emergency response and minimum 
occupational health requirements in each Polyus Group BU. 
In line with this standard, medical services in each BU are 
being formed and equipped. A minimum standard for 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and work uniforms 
was completed and is expected to be approved in 2014. 
In 2014, the Group will continue to monitor the implemen­ tation of the standards and update them if necessary.
As part of its continuous improvement work, the Group be­ gan registering all medical treatment injuries, so as to mon­ itor and reduce at-risk behavior at the Group BUs. The next 
step will be to monitor and control a wider range of em­ ployee health indicators, so as to identify at risk groups and 
provide timely treatment.
The Group continued to conduct health and safety audits, 
inviting leading consulting companies with vast experience 
in Health and Safety and compliance assessment. With their 
assistance, the Company strives to conduct integrated au­ dits covering both OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 manage­ ment system requirements. The Company will extend this 
integrated approach to all operating BU’s, leading to the 
development and implementation of an integrated HSE 
management system. In 2013, the Company put in place 
emergency response procedures at almost all the Group’s 
operational sites. In addition, as planned, the Group fo­ cused on increasing the efficiency of the system of medi­ cal checks for drivers and other employees, including pre­ journey, pre­shift check ­ups. This system is being tested 
at several of the Group’s sites and in future will be operated 
automatically. 
As part of its work to eliminate fatalities, the Company con­ ducted an analysis and prepared classification of the fatali­ ties and LTI’s from 2010 to 2013. Among the main causes 
of the accidents identified were: falls from heights, traffic 
incidents, and machinery and equipment related incidents. 
A five-step safety risk assessment procedure was developed 
and implemented across Group sites. This helps personnel 
to pay special attention to potential safety risks (before job 
assignment) that may be avoided if anticipated.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
Another initiative implemented by the Company at all the 
Group’s sites was a procedure for root­cause analysis of ac ­ cidents and incidents. The aim here is to identify the core 
causes of accidents, not so as to punish irresponsible per­ sonnel, but in order to eliminate the unsafe conditions and 
at­risk behavior, thus minimising and eliminating the num ­ ber of accidents.
Every accident is reported regardless of its outcome: wheth­ er lost time injury accidents are classified or not as work 
related, the reporting procedure is always thorough and ex­ ecuted promptly (the exact time depends on the accident’s 
severity, but will never be more than 24 hours). Each flash 
report contains an accident description, preliminary root 
causes and immediate actions taken. After an accident root 
cause investigation, a detailed root cause analysis report 
is prepared and distributed in the affected BU. 
As part of a programme to improve the Health and Safety 
management system, in collaboration with DuPont, a Sus­ tainable Solutions Safety Leadership Programme was devel­ oped for PGIL operating sites.
The training programme addressed issues related to the 
organisation of the safety management system in the Com­ pany, improving the efficiency of the system, the leader’s 
role in changing the safety culture, the distribution of re­ sponsibilities, risk assessment, accident root cause identifi­ cation and mitigation, etc.
In future, the Group plans to engage DuPont specialists 
again to introduce safety initiatives at PGIL BUs. One such 
initiative is a behavior based audit, aimed at consistent im­ provement in the health and safety culture at the Company.

3.6.1. Approach
Polyus Gold is one of the largest employers in each of the 
areas where it operates. Each ounce of gold mined by the 
Company creates jobs for many people. Attracting and de­ veloping talented and motivated employees aligned with 
Polyus Gold’s corporate values is crucial to ensuring contin­ ued success. The Company therefore aspires to ensure that 
all its labour practices follow the principles of sustainable 
development. This approach focuses on: 
• creating safe working conditions;
• training staff to identify and eliminate hazards at work;
• encouraging the professional growth of the Company’s 
specialists; and
• improving employees’ social conditions and supporting 
local communities.
Polyus Gold’s human resources policies aim to provide the 
Company with an effective and socially stable workforce 
capable of meeting current and future challenges.
3.6.2. Highlights of 2013 
Organizational development
The reporting year saw intensive activities to enhance the Com­ pany’s human resources (HR) management as well as changes 
in the organisational structure. To improve HR processes and 
facilitate achievement of the Group’s strategic goals, two func­ tional lines were created within the HR Department – one re­ sponsible for interaction with the BUs and the other for person­ nel administration and organisational development. 
In line with the goals set for 2013, extensive work was 
conducted on unifying the BU organisational structure, fo­ cusing on aligning business processes both within BUs and 
between BUs and the Corporate Centre. A new organisation 
structure based on the ‘client­contractor principle’ was suc ­ cessfully developed and implemented in the Logistics Ser­ vice. At the Irkutsk BU (an ore unit), the new organisation 
structure is at the approval stage and is supposed to be im­ plemented in 2014. Development the organisational struc­ ture for the Natalka project is also at the final stage. 
The personnel aspects of some other activities such as cen­ tralisation of the procurement function and development 
of an equipment reliability system were also addressed.
Incentives
Another important aspect of HR management at the Com­ pany is the unification of the incentive systems across the 
BUs. Each BU system was analysed to determine where pay­ ments need to be standardised. However, due to a number 
of obstacles, including changes in top management, some 
goals set for 2013 are still to be achieved. Development 
of a grading system and implementation of a values­based 
management system were postponed until 2014.
Employee development
Because the Group understands the importance and value 
of its employees, it strongly believes that developing its em­ ployees is crucial to maintaining a competitive advantage 
in a constantly changing and challenging economic environ­ ment. To ensure that its workforce is highly qualified, the 
Group provides a wide spectrum of training opportunities 
and skills and career development opportunities.
The internal demand for learning opportunities has in­ creased, and this in turn has lent new significance and im­ portance to the Group’s existing internal learning and de­ velopment system.
In order to improve the availability and accessibility of employ­ ee training, the Group has continued to make use of e­learn­ ing solutions. An induction programme, based on the exist­ ing e­learning course ‘Our Work is Gold’, has been updated 
and is being successfully implemented by the Group in line 
with other e­learning courses related to personal motivation, 
project management, successful negotiations and industrial 
safety. An additional plus has been that the above e­learning 
initiatives have helped reduce training costs.
The Group undertakes to provide professional retraining 
for workers that have been made redundant, with a view 
to helping them secure future employment.
All major operational BUs (Krasnoyarsk BU, Irkutsk BU (ore 
unit), Yakutia BU (Kuranakh)) have training centres, that 
provide a wide range of professional training programmes for 
personnel of the respective BUs as well as for the Group’s 
Professional Services operations and contractors. Such a cen­ tre is being created at the Magadan BU (Natalka mine) and 
is expected to start operating in the spring of 2015.
All training programmes for occupations involving danger­ ous activities have been approved and adopted by the Fed­ eral Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear 
Supervision (Rostechnadzor).
A new trend over the reporting period was the attraction 
of highly qualified specialists in various fields from the glob­ al gold mining industry, with the aim of implementing in­ ternational experience and best practices at the Company’s 
operations. One of the goals here is to develop training pro­ grammes for employees where international experts share 
their knowledge, skills and development vision. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.6.3. Life at Polyus
 
As it operates in remote locations and in harsh climates, the 
Company acknowledges its responsibility to provide decent 
working, social and living conditions for its employees and 
strives each year to improve them in accordance with Com­ pany’s Social Standard.
Among others, the Company provides financial assistance 
to employees in the following circumstances:
• Paying for the expenses for employees and their fami­ lies to travel to their workplaces on appointment, and 
for holiday travel expenses;
• providing free or subsidised meals for employees;
• organising corporate and sporting events;
• providing treatment for employees at health and reha­ bilitation centers and other medical institutions;
• compensating employees for expenses related to their 
children’s stay at health camps located in Russia;
• making one­off payments for special occasions, (e.g. 
marriages and births);
• retirement benefits; and
• financial assistance to relatives of deceased employees, 
including financing the education of children of de­ ceased employees at higher and secondary vocational 
institutions.
PGIL aims to provide comfortable accommodation, healthy 
meals and various recreational activities for its employees, 
such as libraries, gyms, cable TV and Wi­Fi.
One of the most important priorities of the Company’s so­ cial policy is to promote healthy living and to encourage 
workers to take part in regular exercise and sports.
In summer 2013, the 1st Corporate sports festival was held 
under the motto: “Fair play – a flawless victory”, bringing 
together 10 teams – a total of 150 participants – from all 
BUs and students from four Krasnoyarsk educational insti­ tutions. 
3.6.4. Attracting employees 
One of the major objectives for PGIL HR management is to 
attract and retain talented employees and to promote its 
HR brand (the profile of the Company in the labour mar­ ket). In considering its policy the Company takes into ac­ count the following human resource issues:
• Recognition of the importance of human capital to the 
Company’s success;
• The overall demographic situation in Siberia and Rus­ sia’s Far East;
• The economic impact of job creation in these regions;
• The existence of development projects requiring con­ tinual recruitment;
• Corporate risk assessment procedures (see Section 3.1.1).
To address the topic properly, two focus group surveys 
were conducted. As a result, two issues impeding recruit­ ment and retention of a talented workforce were identified:
• the Company’s low visibility in the labour market, and
• concerns about duration of the rotation­based work 
(months on/months off).
The decision was made to unify the Group’s hiring pro­ cesses and procedures and a number of measures were 
developed to this end:
• The PGIL careers website (http://rabota.polyusgold.com/  
in Russian), launched at the end of 2012, gained popu­ larity throughout the reporting year, with an average 
of 500­700 visitors daily. It provides information on ca­ reer opportunities for both young specialists and expe­ rienced professionals, giving an overview of the Com­ pany’s operations and student programmes, covering 
corporate news and events and allowing people to apply 
for jobs directly through the site. It also touches upon 
the working and living conditions at the Company’s min­ ing sites (see Section 6.3 of the Sustainability Report) 
and the characteristics of rotation­based work. 
• A communications strategy was developed. 
• The Group profile is being updated with the aim of pre­ senting the Group as a whole and forming a positive im­ age among potential employees, and to unify and sim­ plify the job application process.
• In 2013, preparations were made for the establishment 
of a corporate careers centre, which is to become fully 
operational in 2014.
• The HR department began monitoring careers websites 
and feedback about the Polyus Group in order to iden­ tify and remedy flaws. 
• A list of recommended recruitment services providers 
was compiled, helping BUs to make more informed deci­ sions when choosing partners.
• Outsourcing schemes were successfully implemented 
in the Construction Service and might be spread to other 
operations. They are useful when production tasks re­ quire large numbers of short­term employees. The Com­ Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

pany works closely with educational institutions specialis­ ing in metals and mining studies to ensure a constant 
flow of properly qualified young specialists who are keen 
to work for the Company. For further information, please 
see the Communities Section.
On November 29, the Government of the Magadan region 
held a ceremony to present the awards for the competition 
to find the “Best employer implementing a youth mentor­ ing system in the Magadan region in 2013”. The Company’s 
Magadan BU scooped the award and additionally Olga Litvi­ nova, Deputy Director General for Personnel, was awarded 
an honorary diploma.
The competition is designed to develop the labour potential 
of the Magadan region by increasing the competitiveness and 
occupational mobility of young people in the labour market. 
Next year, the PGIL HR department plans to continue im­ provements across the key areas identified. The recruit­ ment policy will remain the focal point of all HR activities. 
All other measures, including developing a grading system 
and KPIs, as well as improving social and living conditions, 
are required to support the major aim of promoting the 
Company’s brand in the labour market and strengthening the Company’s most valuable asset – its people.

The Group strives to integrate environmental stewardship into 
every activity. 
This commitment to efficient resource usage and environmental 
protection is a competitive advantage for the Company, helping 
us to reduce our environmental impact and decrease operating 
costs, thus delivering higher returns to our shareholders.
3.7. Environmental  
Stewardship
3.7.1. Key targets
Target Status Plans 
Development of closure plans for all 
mines in accordance with Russian 
legislation and ICMM guidelines. Audit 
of mine closure plans for currently 
operational Group mines.
In progress. Closure plans for several mines 
(Verninskoye, Olimpiada, Blagodatnoye, Tit­ imuhta, Natalka and Kuranakh) were reviewed 
and updated. SRK Consulting was engaged 
to conduct an audit and adjustment of Con­ ceptual Closure Plans (in compliance with 
ICMM principles and Russian law). To be continued in 2014.
Development of an Environmental 
Management System (EMS) for Group 
subsidiaries.
In progress. EMS implemented at Olimpiada 
and Kuranakh mine sites.
To be continued in 2014. 
Develop and implement EMS 
for all operational Polyus Gold 
BUs.
Development of water management 
and water balance plans for the Olim­ piada and Verninskoye mines.
A water balance and water management plan 
for Natalka project was developed and is to 
be updated in 2014. 
Develop similar water man­ agement plans for the Olim­ piada and Verninskoye mines 
in 2014–2015.
Preparation of an Environmental and 
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
report for new projects.
In 2012, the ESIA report for Natalka, was com­ pleted and is in compliance with International 
Finance Corporation standards. In 2013 the 
Environmental and Social Action Plan (based 
on ESIA study) and an environmental moni­ toring programme are being implemented. 
In 2013, the ESIA report for Nezhdaninskoye 
was completed.
In 2014, the Group will con­ tinue to implement and moni­ tor the Natalka Action Plan. 
An ESIA report for Chertovo 
Koryto will be produced.
Environmental accident and emer­ gency reporting.
In progress. A corporate environmental acci­ dent reporting standard including a root­cause 
analysis procedure was developed.
This standard for environ­ mental accident reporting will 
be introduced at all Polyus 
Gold operating BUs.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.7.2. Approach and highlights of 2013
Environmental protection and conservation is one of the 
Group’s most important activities. The Group focuses on those 
aspects of its operations which have the most impact on the 
environment. The Company identifies and prioritises issues af ­ fecting its business and stakeholders, taking into consideration 
environmental, social and economic parameters.
Development of a cyanide management system is one of 
the Company’s top priorities. An effective system will en­ sure controls are put in place on each phase of the cyanide 
management cycle: purchasing, transportation, operation 
and detox. A new cyanide tailings INCO detox plant is being 
commissioned and will begin operating in early 2014 at the 
Olimpiada mine. This process will be more efficient than the 
standard methods of neutralisation. 
The Group recognises the scale of the problems posed 
by increasing demand for reliable and secure power supply 
along with the need to decrease GHG emissions. Accord­ ingly, the mitigation of GHG emissions is one the Group’s 
of the key long­term environmental challenges. 
One of the key objectives for PGIL in 2014 will be to develop 
a Greenhouse Gas Policy which will set our framework for 
managing and reporting on GHG emissions in line with in­ ternational best practice.
A water balance assessment was conducted at our Magadan 
BU in 2012 and a similar assessment is currently planning 
to be undertaken at other BUs. Leading technical consult­ ants have been engaged to develop innovative solutions 
to maximise capture and reuse of contact water. 
Water treatment facilities are being designed at the two 
Group’s sites: Verninskoye and Olimpiada. These projects 
will make it possible to increase the percentage of reclaimed 
water at the mine site.
In the reporting period, the Company, in collaboration with 
SRK consultants and other environmental and engineering 
professionals, launched environmental programmes focus­ ing on ARDML (Acid Rock Drainage and Metal Leaching) 
studies. In these studies, the chemical interactions between 
water and waste rock, low grade ore, tailings are being as­ sessed, in order to develop and introduce measures to pre­ vent and minimise negative impact on the environment. 
Conceptual life of mine closure plans were developed for all 
operating sites. The plans developed in 2012 were reviewed 
and modified as necessary. The aim of the closure plans 
is to estimate potential costs for the rehabilitation and recla­ mation of the mine site by the end of life of the mine. These 
plans fully comply with Russian law and ICMM principles.
The Group continues to organise ongoing training for 
personnel responsible for environmental protection in ac­ cordance with environmental legislation. This helps the 
Company maintain a high level of awareness of regulatory 
requirements and respond to them promptly. 
Achieving compliance with ICMM principles on environmen­ tal policies, standards and performance indicators remains 
a key target for the Company. An audit was performed 
by the environmental consultancy ERM, in order to identify 
areas for improvement with the aim of full compliance with 
the ICMM requirements. In 2014–2015, the Group aims 
to focus on the gaps identified and to achieve full compli­ ance with ICMM requirements.
The Company continues to sharpen its focus on environ­ mental management in its projects and operations. With 
this in mind, the Company is introducing an integrated man­ agement system based on ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 re­ quirements that embraces a comprehensive approach to ef­ ficient environmental and health and safety management. 
The Group believes that timely reporting helps to man­ age environmental performance. Accordingly it is working 
on the implementation of the corporate environmental inci­ dent reporting standard, to be incorporated in all BUs.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.8.1. Approach 
Polyus Gold strives to establish relationships with individuals 
and legal entities at a local and national level, to create new 
projects, to expand the scope of cooperation and to use more 
efficient approaches to achieving the social and economic 
goals of the Company and society. 
Most Polyus Gold operations are located in rural and remote 
areas. The Company, therefore, interacts with a broad spec­ trum of local and indigenous communities with a range of in­ terests and concerns. Specifically, Polyus Gold engages with 
local and indigenous communities through: 
• their participation in the Company’s activities;
• newsletters and targeted communications; and
• public hearings and meetings.
A core component of the Polyus Gold commitment to sustaina­ bility is contribution to the socio­economic development of the 
areas and local communities where it operates. 
In the reporting year, the majority of charity and community 
development functions, with the exception of cooperation with 
educational institutions, were handed over to the Government 
relations Department. The PR Department manage sponsor­ ship projects. The basis for the Company’s charitable and 
community relations activities in its regions of operation is laid 
down in agreements on socio­economic cooperation with local 
authorities. This framework has been in place since 2009. The 
Company plans for the format of such agreements to be uni­ fied across all regions in 2014. Each agreement specifies the 
aims and targets of cooperation, and an action plan is draft­ ed every year. All requests and proposals that are submitted 
to the Company’s BUs are assessed against a set of criteria:
• their compliance with the agreements with local authori­ ties;
• the extent of their beneficial effect on the region; and
• their urgency and importance. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

In 2013, no major projects were planned and executed. How­ ever, the Company continued its charitable activity, focusing 
on the following fields:
• Science and education;
• Physical culture and sports;
• Social support and protection of the public; and

For example, the Company took an active part in the clear-up 
work following floods in the Magadan region. 
3.8.2. Students 
As part of its focus on attracting young people with initiative 
and the capability to  think innovatively the Company pays 
special attention to engagement with educational institu­ tions and students. The Company provides students with 
an opportunity to learn about global best practice in the 
mining industry, to demonstrate their talents and abilities, 
and to become part of large­scale projects.
PGIL works closely with a number of educational institutions 
specialising in metallurgy and mining studies, including the 
Siberian Federal University, the Siberian State Industrial 
University, the Ural State Mining University, the Far East­ ern Federal University and others (for a full list, see http://
rabota.polyusgold.com/dlya­ studentov­ i­ vypusknikov/pro­ gramma/ in Russian). In 2013, an agreement was signed 
with Siberian Federal University, boosting cooperation in the 
fields of education, employment and careers, research and 
development, and information technology. The agreement 
involves a number of joint activities aimed at providing a 
competitive level of graduate training.
In 2013, the Company conducted student opinion surveys, 
and designed eye­catching and innovative corporate infor ­ mation stands and placed them in universities and voca­ tional training institutions.
The following student programmes are available for univer­ sity students and students of institutes of basic and second­ ary vocational education.
Learn the worth of gold
 
“Learn the worth of gold!”, a programme of collaboration 
with professional educational institutions, was launched 
by PGIL in 2008. Since then, nearly 2,000 students have 
participated, about 20% of whom have go on to join the 
Company. The programme focuses attracting, and select­ ing young engineers and technical workers and develop­ ing their professional skills. “Learn the worth of gold!” aims 
to reduce the time needed for them to become established 
in their career.
The programme is open to senior students of universities 
and institutes of basic and secondary education specialising 
in fields that are in demand at the Company. Today, the pro­ gramme is being implemented in more than 40 universities 
and vocational training institutes nationwide.
Under the programme students are offered an internship 
at the Company after graduation. Following on­the­job 
training, the Company, the student and an educational in­ stitution may agree on specialised training and the student’s 
future employment at the Group.
During the internship, experienced mentors help the stu­ dents master the intricacies of the profession and adapt 
to working life.
“Learn the worth of gold!” provides students with an op­ portunity to:
• acquire great professional experience;
• obtain materials needed for coursework or research; and
• get a job at the Company after graduation.

The Polyus Gold-CAF Grant Competition 
 
The goal of this programme is to identify and support the best 
students and student initiatives, and to apply their abilities and 
potential to projects aimed at tackling social issues in the cities 
where the programme takes place.
The programme includes two competitions.
Student projects
The purpose of this contest is to identify and support the best 
student projects in the social sphere. The best projects receive 
grants of up to USD 3,000 per project.
The students take part in the competition’s role­playing, train­ ing and seminars, where they learn to develop, present and 
implement their own social projects.
Individual achievements
The purpose of this contest is to reward those students who 
are the most active and show the most initiative. Those who 
earn the most points for their projects and personal achieve­ ments in the calendar year receive prizes of between USD 250 
and 500. 
The competition categories are:
• Participation in university life;
• Professional and personal growth;
• Participation in public life; and
• Art and sport.
The programme is growing every year with the involvement 
of new educational institutions.
A workshop and conference: 
‘Improving the quality of train­ ing given to young profession­ als in the mining industry: 
The perspective from business and education­ al institutions’ was held in April 2013 as part  
of the ‘Learn the worth of gold!’ programme.
This conference was attended by leaders and spe­ cialists from the Company and representatives 
of leading Russian educational institutions. The 
conference discussed issues related to the reform 
of vocational education, young professionals’ expec­ tations of their future employer and the measures 
necessary to improve the quality of graduates and 
help them adapt more quickly to the working envi­ ronment.
In October 2013, the Student 
Initiatives programme was laun­
ched, with more than 400 stu­ dents from educational institu­ tions specialising in metallurgy 
and mining studies participating. 
The main event of the first stage was trip to the three 
participating cities (Chita, Irkutsk and Novokuznetsk) 
where the participants met with 15 municipal or­ ganisations working for the benefit of young people, 
in various areas: youth affairs committees, environ­ mental and children’s organisations, the city’s muse­ ums and libraries, youth business incubators, extreme 
sports communities.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

 There is no wage discrimination by gender. Re­ muneration depends on the scope, quantity and

and salaries can be explained by the structure 
of employment. Requirements of labour law and 
specific mining industry conditions, mean that 
male employees are mostly involved in produc­ tion. Female employees hold positions in service 
units (administrative services, medical centres, 
canteens and others), where salaries are lower 
than in the main operations.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for 2013.
For much of the year, the Committee was ably chaired 
by Lord Clanwilliam, who stepped down on 13 November 
2013. I would like to thank Lord Clanwilliam for his many 
years of successful service to the Board and the Remunera-
tion Committee and his support since stepping down. 
Last year’s Directors’ remuneration report received a vote 
in favour of 98.26% of votes cast at the 2013 Annual Gen-
eral Meeting and I thank shareholders for their support. 
This year, the Committee has agreed that where practicable 
and appropriate, the Company should take a best-practice 
approach and voluntarily follow UK Regulations with regard 
to the Directors’ remuneration report, although it is not 
a requirement of its Jersey incorporation. 
Therefore, in line with the new UK reporting regulations, 
the Directors’ remuneration report has been redesigned this 
year and split into three sections:
• The Remuneration Committee report describes the 
main Committee activities during the year under review 
(section 4.2); 
• the Directors’ remuneration report explains how Polyus 
Gold’s remuneration policy has been implemented and 
details the compensation paid to Executive and Non-
Executive Directors during the 2013 financial year (sec-
tion 4.3);
• the Directors’ remuneration policy report describes our 
proposed remuneration policy and its alignment with 
our business strategy, including a summary of the key 
elements of pay (section 4.4).
Our remuneration strategy has remained largely consist-
ent over many years. However, this year we continued 
the process, started in 2012, of evaluating compensation 
arrangements for Executive Directors and Senior mana-
gement in light of the Company’s UK listing. The remu-
neration policy for the Senior management team has been 
reviewed and we have approved the structure and targets 
of the short-term incentive scheme to strengthen the link 
between performance and reward. 
Going forward, we will keep our remuneration strategy un-
der review to ensure that we continue to reward the Senior 
management team for the achievement of strong financial 
results and the creation of shareholder value.

.
The current Remuneration Committee was formed by a res-
olution of the Board of Directors acting on the recommenda-
tion of the Nomination Committee.
Key objectives
•  To ensure that members of the Company’s executive 
management are provided with appropriate incentives 
to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded 
in a fair and responsible manner for their individual con-
tributions to the Company’s success;
• Review of the ongoing appropriateness and relevance 
of the remuneration policy.
Committee responsibilities
The description of the Committee’s role and responsibilities 
and its full terms of reference are available on the Compa-
ny’s website – www.polyusgold.com/company/corporate_ 
governance/remuneration_committee/.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial 
interest (other than as a shareholder), conflict of interest, 
cross-Directorships or day-to-day involvement in the run-
ning of the business. The terms of reference of the Remu-
neration Committee restrict membership to an initial period 
of three years, after which time membership may be ex-
tended by the Board for a further three years provided ap-
pointees still meet the membership criteria.
Meeting and discussions
The Remuneration Committee met seven times over the 
course of the financial year. Additionally, a number of work-
ing-group meetings and conference calls between Commit-
tee members and the Company’s legal and remuneration 
advisors were held. Please refer to section 6.3 “Board of 
Directors composition” for details of members’ attendance 
at Committee meetings.
Review of the Committee work
During the year the Committee undertook a comprehensive 
review of Senior management compensation packages. Per-
formance was reviewed against 2012 bonus scheme targets 
and the bonus pool for 2012 was approved.
Advisors to the Committee
During the year the Remuneration Committee was advised 
by specialist consultants, Towers Watson, who provided in-
dependent advice on matters under consideration by the 
Committee and updates on good practice, legislative re-
quirements and market practice. Towers Watson’s fees for 
this work amounted to USD 105,000. The Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on executive 
remuneration is objective and independent and that no con-
flict of interest arises as a result of these services. 
The Committee also received assistance from the former 
Chief Executive Officer, but it should be stressed that 
he played no part in discussions related to the setting of his 
own remuneration. In particular the Committee sought his 
advice and received recommendations from him in respect 
of his direct reports.
Since stepping down from the Board, Lord Clanwilliam has 
remained an advisor to the Committee on matters relating 
to senior executive pay. Lord Clanwilliam’s fees for 2013 
amount to USD 30,000 and he does not provide any other 
services to the Company or its subsidiaries.

In this section of the report we explain how Polyus Gold’s 
remuneration policy has been implemented during the 2013 
financial year. Given the changes in remuneration policy fol-
lowing a review in the year, the following section refers 
to a previous policy, in place for the years prior to 2013. 
This policy was closely aligned to local Russian market prac-
tice and is a legacy of the Company’s growth in Russia. 
As such, Companythe main elements of compensation paid 
to the Chief Executive Officer were a fixed base salary, an-
nual bonus and benefits.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
In 2013 there were two Chief Executive Officers:
Pavel Grachev – appointed, 27 November 2013  
as interim CEO;
German Pikhoya – resigned, 27 November 2013.
Base salary
The base salary of the Chief Executive Officer is reviewed 
on an annual basis. A number of factors are taken into ac-
count when salaries are reviewed. Key among them is cor-
porate and individual performance and competitiveness as-
sessed against appropriate peers in businesses in a similar 
sector and of a similar size and complexity.
The 2013 base salary increase for German Pikhoya was 
15%, effective 1 April 2013. Following Mr. Pikhoya’s res-
ignation, Pavel Grachev was appointed as interim CEO. 
Mr. Grachev represents the interests of a major share-
holder as a Non-Independent Director and does not re-
ceive any compensation from the Company for his ser-
vices as interim CEO.
Benefits and allowances
The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to receive benefits, 
including payments for unused holiday, meals, healthy be-
haviour payments (modest payments made to non-smoking 
employees), additional allowances when travelling on busi-
ness, compensation for travelling on business trips outside 
of contracted working days and medical insurance. During the 
financial year, this amounted to USD 1,233,450 for German 
Pikhoya, the former Chief Executive Officer. Pavel Grachev did 
not receive any benefits during the financial year.
Under the current and proposed remuneration policy, 
no Director receives pension contributions. This reflects lo-
cal Russian market practice.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus paid to the Chief Executive Officer in 2013 
relates to the previous financial year, 2012, and was based 
on annual performance and was measured by the achieve-
ment of the following financial and non-financial targets.
The table below outlines the 2012 performance metrics and 
their achievement during the 2012 financial year.

2013 Annual bonus
Pavel Grachev is not eligible to receive an annual bonus award 
for the 2013 financial year. The former CEO, German Pikhoya, 
did not receive a bonus payment in relation to the 2013 finan-
cial year, in line with his resignation from the Company.
Termination payments
German Pikhoya resigned as CEO and Director of the Com-
pany on 27 November 2013. On the date of his leaving 
the Company, compensation, as outlined in the table below, 
was paid.
Compensation Element Treatment upon termination
Base salary Base salary was paid up to the CEO’s termination date upon which all payments 
ceased.
Benefits and allowances Entitlement to ongoing benefits, allowances and other compensation ceased 
upon the date of termination. 
Compensation for unused leave to a value of USD 983,516 was paid upon termi-
nation.
Contractually entitled payments The CEO’s contract, entered into in 2011, entitled German Pikhoya to a termina-
tion payment of 12 months average salary. The calculation of average salary for 
the purposes of the termination payment is defined by Russian Law and includes 
all allowances and bonuses paid during the previous 12 months. The termination 
payment received by the outgoing CEO was USD 3,970,525.
Outside appointments for the Chief 
Executive Officer
To broaden the experience of the Chief Executive Officer, 
he may hold positions in other companies as a Non-Exe-
cutive Director provided that permission is sought in ad-
vance from the Senior Independent Director. Any external 
appointment must not conflict with the CEO and Director’ 
duties and commitments to the Company.
Pavel Grachev is a Non-Executive Director of JSC Federal 
Grid Company and received no fees from this position in the 
financial year.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Non-Executive Directors received fees for their services 
to the Company. In 2014 the Chairman’s fee level was in-
creased by 80% and the basic fee levels for other Non-
Executive Directors were increased by 40%. In addition, the 
members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional 
fee. The amount of fees is as set out in the table below.

There is no formal requirement for Directors’ to own shares 
in the Company. Information on Directors’ shareholdings 
is presented in section 5 “Directors’ report”.
There are no disclosures in this Annual report on remunera-
tion in the following sections, as the regulations would nor-
mally require, as there is no salient information to report for 
the 2013 financial year. The sections are:
• further details on pension arrangements – Directors 
do not receive pension benefits;
• Chief Executive Officers percentage change in pay ver-
sus other employees – the changes in Executive Direc-
tors during the year do not make this comparison feasi-
ble or reflective of normal practice, particularly given the 
pay arrangements for the interim CEO.
Should such events occur going forward, full disclosure will 
be provided in line with regulatory requirements.

4.4. Directors’ remuneration  
policy report
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee presents the Director’s remu-
neration policy report, which sets out Polyus Gold’s forward-
looking remuneration policy for all Executive Directors. As dis-
cussed in the Chairman’s letter, because Polyus Gold is not 
incorporated in the UK this section of the Directors’ remunera-
tion report is not subject to a binding vote by shareholders. 
However, the Committee feels that it is important to comply 
with best practice on a voluntary basis as far as practicable. 
The following policy therefore aims to follow, and be compliant 
with, the new UK reporting regulations.
In 2012/13 the Committee reviewed compensation arrange-
ments for Executive Directors and Senior management in light 
of the Company’s growth into a UK listed international gold 
miner . The policies that we summarise in this section are a re-
sult of this review and were designed to align more closely 
with the long-term sustainable growth of the Company. Our 
policy is broken into a number of sections:
• remuneration policy in 2014 for Executive Directors, 
which sets out details of our annual remuneration ele-
ments;
• other relevant policies relating to Executive Directors 
remuneration, including recruitment, service contracts 
appointment and termination;
• remuneration policies that relate solely to the Non-Exe-
cutive Directors; 
• statements regarding the contextual information that 
the Committee considers, when setting policy in respect 
of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Polyus Gold’s remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer and 
Senior management team was reviewed in 2013. 2014 will 
therefore be a period of transition into the new remunera-
tion structure. 
 
Future policy table
Executive Directors
Operation Maximum opportunity 
Base salary
To maintain package 
competitiveness and 
reflect skills and expe-
rience.
Reviewed annually, with any change taking ef-
fect from 1 June and taking into account:
• individual and business performance;
• level of experience;
• scope of responsibility including any chang-
es during the year;
• external comparisons to the international 
gold mining, UK and local Russian markets.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
an increase in base salary each year. The 
Committee will assess pay increase levels 
with reference to those factors described 
in this table but do not operate a limit 
on the level of increase that can be pro-
vided.
Other benefits
To be market compet-
itive for the purposes 
of recruitment and en-
suring retention.
The Executive Directors are entitled to certain 
additional benefits, in line with typical practice 
in the UK and Russia. These include:
• daily allowance for travelling on business 
trips;
• compensation for travelling on business trips 
outside of contracted days;
• medical insurance.
The Committee retains the discretion to pro-
vide additional benefits as may be reasonably 
required to reflect changed circumstances (for 
example, in relation to existing or new Direc-
tors). These may include, but are not limited 
to: relocation costs, tax equalisation arrange-
ments and cost of living allowances.
The Committee has not set a limit on the 
maximum level of benefits that can be pro-
vided to Executive Directors.
In providing additional benefits the Com-
mittee will ensure that costs to the Com-
pany are reasonable and not excessive.
The amount of compensation for travelling 
on business trips outside of contracted 
days is defined by the rules of Russian leg-
islation. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Operation Maximum opportunity 
Pension
To be market competi-
tive and to reward con-
tinuing service.
Retirement related benefits can be provided 
to Executive Directors based on local market 
practice either through a dedicated retirement 
scheme or cash allowances.
Currently the Company does not provide 
any retirement benefits to Executive Direc-
tors.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to reassess this position. However, any 
future arrangements will not be excessive 
and will follow best practice.
Short-term incentive 
plan (STIP)
Incentivise executives 
to achieve specific 
and stretching pre-de-
termined goals over 
a short-term period.
Annual payments under the STIP are based 
on performance conditions calibrated and set 
by the Committee at the start of each financial 
year. 
Performance is measured over the preceding 
financial year. 
Targets under the STIP reflect the Company’s 
annual plan, which in turn reflects the strategic 
priorities of the Group. The Company currently 
employs three broad STIP performance meas-
ures:
• gold production;
• total cash costs;
• individual key performance indicators.
Production and cost targets act as a gateway 
and determine the level of opportunity avail-
able which is then further assessed against in-
dividual KPIs.
Achieving ‘plan’ results will equate to on-target 
STIP payment. Maximum payment under the 
STIP will only occur for exceptional annual per-
formance under the plan. 
The Committee retains the discretion to assess, 
and change, the plan and performance measures 
each year in line with business needs.
On-target STIP opportunity is set at 100% 
of base salary for Executive
Directors.
A maximum STIP opportunity of 200% 
of base salary is available for exceptional 
performance.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to adjust the level of bonus awarded, ei-
ther up or down, in exceptional circum-
stances. If this discretion is enacted a full 
description of the circumstances and level 
of adjustment will be provided in the im-
plementation report in the following year.
• Each year the Board meets to set the budget for the year ahead. The Remuneration Committee uses the budget, external 
forecasts for macroeconomic parameters, such as gold price, inflation rate, exchange rate, and business strategy to ap-
propriately calibrate annual targets for the year. Budgets are set to be stretching to ensure a strong link between pay, 
performance and business strategy. 
• Pay arrangements for Executive Directors are similar in structure to that provided to the wider Senior management team 
and corporate head office. However, the Committee feels that, given that the majority of operating locations are in Russia 
with talent sourced locally, the pay structure applied to roles below the senior team should naturally differ in structure.
• Polyus Gold has avoided, where possible, including unnecessary discretion in the policy table. However , exceptional or genuinely 
unforeseen circumstances may arise in the future and in those circumstances it may be in shareholders’ interests for Polyus Gold 
to put in place remuneration arrangements that are outside the terms of the policy set out in this report. If this happens, Polyus 
Gold will be permitted to implement remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate in the circumstances.
• A number of pre-existing and outstanding obligations will remain at the time that the new policy becomes effective, includ-
ing obligations that are ‘grandfathered’ by virtue of being in force at 27 June 2012. Polyus Gold’s policy is to honour all 
pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into before the effective date of this policy. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

  Non-Executive Directors Anna Kolonchina and Igor Gorin each represent a major shareholder and hence are not deemed to be 
independent. Neither Anna Kolonchina, nor Igor Gorin received a fee from the Company for their Directorship. It is the Committee’s 
intention that this policy will continue for all non-independent Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors
1
Operation Maximum opportunity
Fees
To attract and retain 
high-calibre, experi-
enced Non-Executive 
Directors by offering 
globally competitive 
fee levels.
Non-Executive Director’s fees are fixed 
in the contract with each Non-Executive 
Director.
Fees are reviewed annually and com-
petitiveness of total fees is assessed 
against those in companies of a similar 
size, complexity and industry.
The contract signed with the Chairman specifies 
a fee of USD 450,000 p.a. the contracts signed 
with other Non-Executive Directors specify a fee 
of USD 350,000 p.a. for each Director. The mem-
bers of the Audit Committee are additionally paid 
USD 30,000 p.a. each for executing their duties.
Benefits Non-Executive Directors receive reimbursement of expenses that are incurred in the perfor-
mance of their duties as Non-Executive Directors. 
The Company retains the discretion to provide further benefits to Non-Executive Directors 
in line with standard practice in the market.
Recruitment and promotion policy
Polyus Gold operates in an international talent market and, as such, the Company’s recruitment policy reflects the need 
to offer market competitive remuneration packages, both in terms of opportunity level and structure. The table below 
outlines the Committee’s approach to the appointment or promotion of new Directors.
Recruitment policy
Base salary Base salary for new appointees will be set as described in the main policy table. Upon promo-
tion a Director may be granted a higher than normal pay increase to align pay with the role’s 
new responsibilities and accountabilities.
Variable pay New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Company’s incentive schemes on the same 
basis as described in the main policy table.
Buy-out of existing 
awards from previ-
ous employers
The Committee will assess the value of previous awards that a prospective employee may for-
feit upon leaving their previous employer. In doing so the Committee may seek independent 
advice and/or valuation services.
It is the intention of the Committee that any buy-out awards will be made on a value neutral 
basis, or lower, to the prospective incumbent, will not be excessive and will be provided at an 
acceptable cost to the Company.
Awards will mimic the vehicle of the forfeited award where possible with payment made 
in cash or shares. Where awards are subject to performance conditions the Committee will 
make awards of a similar expected value as the forfeited awards.
Appointment awards Where necessary, to aid the recruitment of key/critical talent, the Committee may use 
its discretion to grant additional recruitment awards, in cash or shares, in the year  
of appointment. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Statement of consideration 
of employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Company 
The Remuneration Committee will take into account the pay 
and employment conditions of other Company employees 
when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, par-
ticularly when determining base salary increases. The Re-
muneration Committee will also obtain information on the 
remuneration paid for comparable roles at other companies 
to provide a point of reference for determining remunera-
tion policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder 
views
Representatives of two of the three major shareholders 
(with 78% combined ownership); Wandle Holdings Limited 
(Anna Kolonchina and Pavel Grachev) and Wamika Trad-
ing Limited (Igor Gorin) sit on the Board and therefore the 
Committee regularly obtains feedback and views on the 
remuneration arrangements in place for Executive Direc-
tors. Whilst the majority shareholding is with three parties, 
we nevertheless communicate with our broader shareholder 
base. This allows us to respond to the needs and concerns 
of all our shareholders throughout the year.

The Directors present the Annual report on the affairs of the Group, 
together with the financial statements and the independent audi-
tor’s report, for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
Fair, balanced and understandable 
A key requirement of our financial statements is for the re-
port and accounts to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
The Directors are satisfied that the report and accounts 
meet this requirement as appropriate weight has been giv-
en to both positive and negative developments in the year. 
In justifying this statement the Directors have considered 
the robust process which operates in creating the report 
and accounts, including:
• the clear guidance and instruction is given to all con-
tributors;
• revisions to regulatory requirements, including the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, are monitored on an 
ongoing basis;
• early warning meetings are conducted between man-
agement and the auditors in advance of the year end 
reporting process;
• input is provided by Senior management and corporate 
functions;
• further reviews are conducted by Senior management;
• a meeting of the Audit Committee is held to review and 
consider the draft Annual report and accounts in ad-
vance of the final sign off; and
• final sign-off is provided by the Board of directors.
The Directors reviewed the Annual report and believe that 
the Annual report is true, fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. The report discusses all aspects of the Company’s 
business, provides non-IFRS financial metrics in addition 
to the figures disclosed in the consolidated financial state-
ments and has a significant set of non-financial statistic. 
Certain parts of the Annual report audited by independent 
consultants. The independent auditors provided an opinion 
on the report as a whole.
Principal activities 
The principal activity of the Group is the production and 
sale of gold. In order to maintain its operations the Group 
is also involved in exploration, construction and research 
activities. The Group’s gold production activity is described 
in section 2 “Strategic report”. 
The Group’s subsidiaries which principally affect the profits 
and net assets of the Group in the reporting year are de-
scribed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2013.
Business review 
Information about the business review, including the KPIs, 
risks, and operational and financial performance, can 
be found on pages 20 to 46.
• A summary of performance during the year is presented 
in section 1.2 “Performance”;
• key performance indicators are described in section 2.6 
“Analysis using key performance indicators”;
• a description of the risks associated with the Group can 
be found in section 2.5 “Principal risks and uncertain-
ties”;
• the Operational Review is available on pages 43 to 46;
• the Financial Review is available on pages 26 to 41;
• information about the use of financial instruments 
by the Company and its subsidiaries is given in note 33 
to the consolidated financial statements.
As a whole, the Annual report provides information about 
the Group’s businesses, its financial performance during 
the year and likely future developments. Other than as de-
scribed in this report, there have not been any significant 
changes to the Group’s principal activities during the year 
under review.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2013 
were 4.83 million tonnes of CO
2
e, some 5.9% higher than 
in 2012.
In 2013, 38% of the Group’s GHG emissions came from 
direct combustion of fossil fuels (petrol, diesel, coal etc.) 
at the operating mines and 62% came from indirect emis-
sions (such as purchased electricity). Carbon dioxide ac-
counted for 34% of total GHG emissions in 2013.
Total GHG emissions increase alongside increases in the 
volume of ore mined and processed. Because of the fluc-
tuating nature of the gold price, the stripping ratio and the 
gold grade, we believe that the best measurement of GHG 
emissions is ‘GHG emission in thousand tonnes of CO
2
e per 
million cubic metres of rock moved.
For more details on GHG emissions

 including a breakdown 
by gases and sources of emission, calculation methodol-
ogy, as well the Company’s GHG policy and targets for the 
reduction of GHG emissions please refer to section 3 “Sus-
tainability report”.

cy”. The dividends for the year ended 31 December 2013 are

6. Corporate  
governance report
6.1. Chairman’s statement
Polyus has applied principles set out in the UK Corporate Gov-
ernance Code, including the Principles relating to the Role and 
Effectiveness of the Board in 2012.
I am pleased to state that for the reporting year the Com-
pany complied with the provisions set out in the Code, and 
the Board complied with main principles of the Code. 
I joined the Polyus’ Board in October 2013 and was excited 
that the Company operated high-level corporate governance 
standards and welcomed new initiatives. It is my pleasure 
to chair the Board of such a Company. Such standards are 
very important for me personally and for my colleagues on 
the Board.
The Governance section explains how we achieve that and 
how the principles have been applied. you may also refer to 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the Audit Committee 
report for additional information on compliance with the Code.
Leadership
In my opinion, the Company is headed by an effective 
Board, which is collectively responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company. Every Director acts in what they 
consider the best interests on the Company, consistent with 
their statutory duties. There is a clear division of respon-
sibilities at the head of the Company between the Board 
and the executives responsible for the running of the Com-
pany’s business. No one individual has unfettered powers 
of decision. As Chairman of the Board, I am responsible for 
leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role. The Non-Executive Directors, as part 
of their role as members of a unitary Board, constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy.
Effectiveness
The Board and its Committees have the appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company to enable them to discharge their respective du-
ties and responsibilities.
Appointment of new Directors to the Board is made on the basis 
of formal, rigorous and transparent procedures and the search 
for Board candidates is made against objective criteria with due 
regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board. Detailed expla-
nation is given in section 6.11 “Nomination Committee report”.
All Directors are able to allocate sufficient time to the Com-
pany to discharge their responsibilities effectively. In com-
pliance with the Code (cl. B.3.2) the terms and conditions 
of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office 
during the normal business hours and at the AGM. 
All Directors receive an induction on joining the Board and 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge and 
familiarity with the Company as required in order to fulfil 
their role. Directors are supplied in a timely manner with 
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
them to discharge their duties.
In the year 2013 the Board undertook a formal and rigorous 
annual evaluation of its performance and that of its Com-
mittees and individual Directors. Please refer to the para-
graph headed “Evaluation”, later in this section.
All Directors are submitted for re-election annually, and 
their re-appointment is subject to their continued satisfac-
tory performance. 
Accountability
The Board’s responsibility to present a fair, balanced and un-
derstandable assessment extends to interim and other price-
sensitive public reports and reports to regulators as well as to 
information required to be presented by statutory requirements. 
The Board annually conducts a review of the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and internal control sys-
tems, including financial, operational and compliance con-
trol. Please refer to section 6.10 “Risk Committee report”.
The Board has established formal and transparent arrangements 
for considering how to apply corporate reporting, risk manage-
ment and internal control principles and for maintaining an ap-
propriate relationship with the Company’s auditors. For more 
information please refer to section 6.9 “Audit Committee report”.
Remuneration
Directors’ remuneration is sufficient to attract, retain and 
motivate Directors of the quality required to run the Com-
pany successfully. For detailed information please see sec-
tion 4.2 “Remuneration Committee report”.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Relationships with shareholders
The Board maintains a dialogue with shareholders based on 
the mutual understanding of objectives. The Board use the 
AGM to communicate with the investors and to encourage 
their participation. The Directors attended the AGM held 
on 31 May 2013. Directors have developed an understand-
ing of the views of major shareholders about the Company 
through direct face-to face contact, analysts’ briefings and 
surveys of shareholder opinion. A notice of AGM and related 
papers were made available to shareholders and placed on 
the website on 29 April 2013. 
The chairmen of the Committees usually present at the AGM 
and are available to answer questions. The Company arrang-
es for the Notice of the AGM and related papers to be sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
The Company places great importance on maintaining ac-
tive engagement with its key financial audiences: institu-
tional investors, including current and potential sharehold-
ers, bondholders and both equity and fixed income sell-side 
analysts. 
The Company strictly abides by all applicable disclosure re-
quirements for its premium listing on the LSE. Following 
the placement of our first Eurobond in 2013, we further 
improved transparency of our reporting to ensure equal ac-
cess for all financial audiences to price-sensitive informa-
tion, and to better facilitate investor communications. 
The Company releases trading updates on a quarterly basis, 
and in accordance with IFRS, releases financial results on a 
half-yearly basis. Such announcements are always support-
ed by webcast presentations and conference calls conduct-
ed on the same day and hosted by Senior management. 
Relevant reports, announcements and presentations of re-
sults and other developments of importance to the market, 
are immediately placed on the Company’s website www.
polyusgold.com in the ‘investors’ or ‘media’ sections. The 
market is informed well in advance about forthcoming re-
sults announcements in the ‘investor calendar’ section of 
the web-site. Historical financial information is also available 
on the web-site. 
The Company’s Senior management maintain contact with 
our investor base around the world through regular road-
shows (1-2 per year), investor conferences (about 10 per 
year) and other investor meetings. In 2013, the Company 
participated in 11 investor conferences and met over 150 
institutional investors.

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
I confirm that during the reporting year the Company has 
complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
corporate governance statement can be found in section 5 
“Directors’ report”. 
Details of the Board evaluation policy and its operation are 
given below. The Nomination Committee established a Diver-
sity policy, which was approved by the Board and a summary 
is presented below. In addition, the Board and the HSEC 
Committee developed the Human Rights policy. The policies 
were adopted at a Board meeting on 13 December 2013. 
Board evaluation
The Board is required to review its performance and that of 
its members. This year the process was facilitated internally 
with a review of questionnaires completed by the individual 
Directors. The results were considered by the Board as part of 
its review of performance. The questionnaire asked Directors 
to grade areas such as the performance of the Board and its 
Committees, the effectiveness of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors, the monitoring of operational performance, and cor-
porate governance, as well as leadership and culture.
In the normal course of business, an annual performance re-
view of the Board and its Committees is undertaken in accord-
ance with section В.6.1 of the Code. A performance review of 
the Chairman of the Board was undertaken in February 2014.
The evaluation process concluded that the Board and its 
Committees remain effective in fulfilling their responsibili-
ties and that each Director continues to make a valuable 
contribution to the running of the Group. An external Board 
evaluation process will be carried out in 2014.
In addition, the Audit Committee carried out a self-assess-
ment of its performance in December 2013 and the Chair-
man of the Audit Committee reported on this process to the 
Board in December.

The purpose of the Board, according to the Schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board, is to:
• monitor Group activities to see that sustainable value is 
being created;
• evaluate business strategies and monitor their imple-
mentation;
• monitor and review the performance of Management;
• monitor the performance of the existing asset portfolio 
and new business initiatives;
• develop, review and monitor Board and senior executive 
succession plans;
• maintain a current view of prevailing market conditions 
and trends;
• monitor key performance indicators;
• provide accountability to shareholders through appropri-
ate reporting and regulatory compliance;
• monitor the auditing and control mechanisms;
• understand and ensure the management of operational 
business and financial risks to which the Group is ex-
posed;
• observe and ensure compliance with Health, Safety, En-
vironment and Community policy;
• review its own contribution to the Company’s perfor-
mance;
• ensure continuing adherence to disclosure provisions of 
relevant legislation;
• safeguard the Group’s reputation, values, ethics, culture 
and assets, including knowledge;
• evaluate its own performance and that of the Board ad-
visory Committees.
Board activity
The Board acts in compliance with FCA Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, following the spirit of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code to good effect. The Board met sufficiently 
regularly to discharge its duties effectively in compliance 
with the formal schedule of matters, in the best interest of 
the Company.
In 2013, 22 meetings were held, including 7 face-to-face 
meetings, 12 conference calls and 3 meetings held by 
means of passing a written resolution. One of the meet-
ings was held in Krasnoyarsk and the Board additionally 
inspected the Company’s mining operations in the Krasno-
yarsk region. In addition, outside of the framework of Board 
meetings, the Directors inspected the Group’s other mining 
operations.
In addition to it’s discharge of the duties outlined in the 
Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, during 2013 
the Board paid detailed attention to developments with the 
Natalka project, discussion and implementation of new poli-
cies, the issue of a USD 750 million Eurobond, the sale by 
Onexim of its interests to Lizarazu Limited and Receza Lim-
ited, relationship agreements between the Company and 
its principal shareholders and subsequent changes to the 
composition of the Board. 
Natalka
On a regular basis the Board considered reports on the sta-
tus of the Natalka project. The Board’s stated plan was to 
have the full flow sheet operational by the middle of 2014, 
but continued weakness in the price of gold led to a re-se-
quencing of this plan and a decision was taken to postpone 
commissioning of the 10 mtpa plant, whilst continuing to 
develop technology at the pilot plant. The Board consid-
ered that this would additionally allow for a re-scheduling of 
capital and operating expenditures.
6.2. The Board
The Board remain committed to guiding the strategic and entre-
preneurial development of the group and support the principle 
of collective responsibility for the success of the Group. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Group policies
The Board considered and adopted new Human Rights and 
Diversity Policies. Each of these policies is described later in 
this section of the report. 
Eurobond issue
Early in 2013, the Board investigated the funding options 
available to the Group to finance its expansion plans and 
decided that its best interests would be served by the issue 
of a USD 750 million Eurobond. Management was tasked 
with putting the necessary plans in place.
Ownership and Board changes
Following the changes in ownership arising from the sale of 
the stake in the Company owned by Onexim, the Board ap-
proved new relationship agreements with its major share-
holders. These agreements led to changes in the composi-
tion of the Board and its Committees.

In particular, he will:

6.4. Diversity policy
A truly diverse Board will make good use of the differences 
and other qualities of its Directors. These differences will be 
considered when determining the optimum composition of 
the Board and where possible should be balanced appro-
priately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Board appoint-
ments will always be made on merit, in the context of the 
skills and experience that the Board as a whole, requires to 
be effective.
The Nomination Committee will engage appropriate execu-
tive search consultants for the search process for Non-Exe-
cutive Directors. The search process is expected to identify 
candidates from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives 
who meet the requirements for the role and give due con-
sideration to the benefits of diversity. The Board will only 
engage executive search consultants who have signed up 
to the voluntary code of conduct for executive search firms 
on gender diversity on corporate Boards.
The Board recognises that some challenges in achieving di-
versity on the Board arise from the industry in which the 
Company operates and are not specific to the Company. As 
such, the Company faces challenges similar to those faced 
by other organisations in the metals and mining industries.
Notwithstanding this, the Board is committed to ensuring 
that an appropriate mix of skills and experience is repre-
sented on the Board, in order to provide efficient stew-
ardship.
The Board has taken note of the policies of companies with-
in its international peer group.
The Board is committed to having female representation 
and, since its shares were admitted to the Premium seg-
ment of the London Stock Exchange, the Company has al-
ways had female representation on its Board.
In December 2013 the Board approved the Diversity policy fol-
lowing a recommendation from the Nomination Committee. 
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity. Diversity encom-
passes diversity of perspective, experience, skills, background, 
knowledge, international and industry experience, and gender, 
amongst many other factors.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

6.5. Human rights policy 
Polyus Gold International Limited and its subsidiaries (Pol-
yus Gold) recognise that all companies have a responsi-
bility to respect human rights when conducting business. 
Cognisant of the increasing recognition in the extractive 
industry of the rights of individuals, Polyus Gold is commit-
ted to observing human rights in the course of its business 
operations.
To this end, it supports the endorsement in 2011 of the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the 
rights contained in: 
•  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights;
• the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
• the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cul-
tural Rights;
• the International Labour Organization’s Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and
• voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
The policy outlines Polyus Gold’s commitment to universal 
human rights. In particular, it recognises the rights of its 
employees to a safe and healthy working environment, to 
freedom from discrimination and freedom of association. 
Further, Polyus Gold acknowledges the customs and cul-
tures of local communities in the areas in which we operate.
This policy is informed by, and should be read in conjunction 
with, Polyus Gold’s Diversity and Anti-Corruption Policies.
In December the Board approved a Human Rights policy  
to be implemented across the group. The policy reflects the 
Group’s longstanding respect for the rights of its employees  
and the individuals affected by its operations.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

6.6. Dividend policy
The Company aims to pay dividends amounting to a minimum  
of 20% of the Group’s annual net profit, calculated in ac-
cordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS). 
In developing its recommendations on the amount of divi-
dends to be paid to shareholders annually, and the corre-
sponding share of the net profit to be allocated to such divi-
dend payments, the Board will take into account the need 
to balance funding of growth projects and the payment of 
dividends, including any limitations imposed by the produc-
tion, investment and other financial needs of the Group, the 
Group’s debt position and any tax legislation applicable to 
the Group.
Following the introduction of the Dividend policy, in 2013, 
the Company declared (i) a final dividend in the amount 
of USD 0.0824 per ordinary share and (ii) a special divi-
dend in the amount of USD 0.0232 per ordinary share, both 
in respect of the financial year ended 31 December, 2012. 
The final dividend was paid on 7 June 2013 to those share-
holders who appeared on the register of the Company at 
18:00 hrs (UK time) on 24 May 2013.
The Company’s dividend policy was approved by the Board at its 
meeting on 20 April 2012.

6.7. Anti-corruption efforts
Any evidence of violations of applicable anti-corruption laws 
will be investigated, as a result of which, disciplinary meas-
ures may be taken.
The Company obeys the requirements of the national anti-
corruption laws of the countries in which it does business.
Members of the Board of Directors and senior executives of 
the Company are expected to observe high ethical stand-
ards and not tolerate any form or exercise of bribery and 
corruption from their peers, employees or contractors. The 
Board of Directors and Senior managers receive regular re-
ports on, and hold investigations into, compliance with anti-
corruption policies and legislation.
Since 2011, the Company has had an Anti-corruption poli-
cy in place across all of its business units and professional 
services arms. The Anti-corruption policy covers all of the 
prohibitions and restrictions established by the legislation of 
the countries where the Company operates, including Rus-
sian anti-corruption legislation and The Bribery Act 2010 of 
the United Kingdom.
The Company has established and applies internal anti-brib-
ery procedures, which are based on the principles recom-
mended by the Ministry of Justice of the United Kingdom. 
Procedures are regularly improved by the Company with 
due regard to any risks identified, updates to legislation and 
the recommendations of regulatory bodies. Specific tasks 
ensuring compliance with the anti-bribery procedures are 
distributed among the functional units of the Company.
The Company pays great attention to ensuring that employees 
are made familiar with the policy and other anti-corruption pro-
cedures and remain so, through regular briefings and training.
In 2013, all Company employees went through training, 
testing and certification on compliance with anti-corruption 
legislation and the execution of local Policies. In 2013, all 
employees signed a document committing themselves to 
complying with the requirements of anti-corruption legisla-
tion and local policies.
As necessary, compliance staff provide counselling to per-
sonnel and partners on all matters relating to the exercise 
of proper conduct in this area.
The Company exercises due diligence in its relations with 
third parties, partners and contractors, in order to mini-
mise the risks of prohibited acts being committed for, or 
on behalf of, the Company. The Company conducts pre-
liminary checks before approval of all contracts and project 
agreements and regularly inspects and monitors projects in 
higher-risk areas.
Accessible communication systems have been introduced 
to support whistleblowing and speak-up schemes, to report 
violations of current policies.
Responsible staff members have been appointed at the Cor-
porate Headquarters and in all business units and profes-
sional service arms of the Company, forming local teams 
to ensure compliance with the established regulations and 
policies.
Company employees regularly participate in international 
conferences on combating corruption in the private and 
public sectors, to aid the development and implementation 
of the latest compliance strategies and best practices across 
the Company.
Throughout 2013, neither the Company, nor any employees 
or officers of the Company were involved in court proceed-
ings in connection with corrupt practices.
The Company operates a zero-tolerance policy on bribery or any 
other form of corruption, at all levels. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Membership
Current members

and 
Senior Independent Director, and

The Board believes that the current composition of the 
Audit Committee has the required level of experience to 
be sufficient to meet the standards imposed by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. In the event that any issues 
should arise which would be deemed outside the areas 
of expertise of the members, independent professional 
advice would be sought.
Key objectives
• To provide effective governance over the Group’s finan-
cial reporting and the adequacy of reporting, and
• To effectively oversee the performance of both the in-
ternal audit team and the work of the external auditor.
Committee responsibilities
A description of the Committee’s role and responsibilities 
is available on the Company website www.polyusgold.com/ 
company/corporate_governance/audit_committee/.
Meetings and discussions
The Audit Committee met seven times over the course of the 
financial year. The Committee’s agenda is linked to events in 
the Group’s financial calendar and is predominantly cyclical, 
although each member has the right to call for reports on 
matters of interest. 
Please refer to section 6.3 “Board of Directors composition” 
of this Annual report for details of members’ attendance at 
Committee meetings.
Review of the Committee’s work
The Audit Committee met with management, internal and 
external auditors to ensure that management was fulfill-
ing its financial reporting responsibilities to the Directors, 
who approve the consolidated financial statements. The 
Company’s external auditors had unrestricted access to the 
Audit Committee to discuss the scope of their audit and 
the adequacy of internal controls, and to review financial 
reporting issues.
Financial reporting and compliance
The Committee’s business included the review and approval 
of financial statements for the FY2012 and H12013; review 
and approval of the Annual report and interim management 
report for the FY2012 and H12013; approval of the auditor’s 
fees for 2013; review and approval of the annual budget 
for 2014; monitoring of the external audit and audit time-
table for 2013; appointment of the external auditor and, in 
conjunction with the Risk Committee, monitoring of internal 
audit and risk management systems.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has established a continuous process for iden-
tifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the 
group faces and for determining the nature and extent of 
the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its stra-
tegic objectives. The Board regularly reviews the process, 
which has been in place from the start of the year to the 
date of approval of this report. The Board is also responsible 
for the group’s system of internal control and for review-
ing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not abso-
lute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Gov-
ernance Code, the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the group’s risk management and internal control sys-
tems. The Board’s monitoring covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. It 
is based principally on reviewing reports from management 
to consider whether significant risks are identified, evalu-
ated, managed and controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed 
a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual report. 
This assessment considers all significant aspects of risk

management and internal control arising during the period 
covered by the report including the work of internal audit. 
The audit and risk committees assist the board in discharg-
ing its review responsibilities.
The Audit Committee investigated a range of issues, which 
in their opinion, and that of their external auditors, posed 
a risk of adverse impact on Group financial statements. A 
Financial risk management policy developed in 2011, and 
the principles of a Treasury policy are formally described in 
other policies and documents of the Company. 
Following the decline in the gold price, the Committee in-
vestigated impairment of PP&E, capital construction-in-pro-
gress and exploration assets across the business, seeking 
assurances that the impairment tests used, met the re-
quirements of IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets). In particular, 
management were tasked with performing comprehensive 
impairment reviews at the Verninskoye mine, the Kuranakh 
mine and Natalka project, and examining possible impair-
ment of exploration and evaluation assets (E&E), capital 
construction-in-progress and stockpiles at Nezhdaninskoye, 
Chertovo Koryto, Poputninskoye, Panimbinskoye, Bamskoye 
and some other smaller deposits. As a result, the Company 
recognised impairment charges of USD 472 million in 2013 
(please refer to section 2.8 “Financial review”, for more in-
formation on impairments). 
Inventory is required to be carried at the lower of its cost 
and net realisable value. The measurement and valuation 
of gold in circuit and stockpiles included in inventory, and 
their net realisable values is complex, involves judgement 
and is based on assumptions about gold content and future 
processing costs. 
During the course of its review of the risk management and 
internal control systems, the Board and the Audit and Risk 
Committees have not identified nor been advised of any 
failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be sig-
nificant. 
Anti-corruption policy
A comprehensive anti-corruption policy has been introduced 
and the Company’s external auditor has been tasked with 
examining any related-party transactions to ensure that 
business was conducted ‘at arms length’. 
Internal audit
Among the Committee’s key responsibilities are the moni-
toring of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit func-
tion and approving its head, approving the annual internal 
audit plan and reviewing reports presented by the internal 
auditor. The Internal audit plan was approved by the Com-
mittee on 20 March 2013. The Audit Committee met with 
the head of internal audit on a regular basis to discuss the 
department’s remit. The Audit Committee received internal 
auditor reports on a quarterly basis. The Committee as-
sesses the effectiveness of the internal audit as satisfactory.
External auditors
Deloitte LLP who have been appointed as an auditor since 
admission to premium listing in 2012 provide the Commit-
tee with relevant reports following the audit and review re-
sults, reviews, information and advice throughout the year 
as set out in their engagement letter. Their performance, as 
well as independence, has been formally assessed by the 
Committee having due regard to their expertise, resourcing 
and experience. The Committee performs an assessment of 
the timing of the audit, significant key risk areas covered 
and procedures performed to get the audit assurance. The 
Committee also interacts with the management to receive 
its views and opinions on the work done by its auditors’, in 
particular, through an anonymous questionnaire. The Com-
mittee remains satisfied of their effectiveness. There are no 
contractual obligations restricting the Committee’s choice 
of external auditors and the Committee did not consider it 
necessary this year to conduct a tender process for the ap-
pointment of its auditors.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
In accordance with UK regulations, Deloitte LLP adhere to 
a strict partner rotation policy based on the mandatory re-
quirements of Auditing Practices Board Ethical Standard 3. 
The Committee monitors this rotation and confirms that a 
new lead audit partner will be subject for reappointment 
following the completion of the 2015 audit. The Committee 
is aware of the recommendations set out by the FRC in the 
updated UK Governance Code in relation to audit tendering, 
which states that companies should put the external audit 
contract out to tender at least every ten years. 
The Committee recognise that as with any complex opera-
tion there is always a risk of fraud and false accounting and 
it seeks to minimise this risk by flagging its concerns with 
both its internal and external auditors and seeking to en-
sure that appropriate tests and audit procedures are used.
There is a non-audit service policy in place, approved by 
the Audit Committee where it is clearly stated that any work 
related to the “Unacceptable non-audit services” need to 
be discussed and pre-approved, if applicable, by the Audit 
Committee, irrespective of any amount. Engagements that 
fall within the Audit Services classification of services, as 
set out above, are considered to be pre-approved by the 
Audit Committee to a level of USD 250,000. Audit Services 
engagements with expected fees in excess of this amount 
should be approved by the Audit Committee.
Non-audit services expenditure over USD 250,000 per en-
gagement or USD 750,000 in aggregate requires approval 
by the Audit Committee. Where fees for non-audit services 
in the year exceed USD 750,000 in aggregate, all permitted 
engagements may only be awarded to the statutory audi-
tor with prior approval of the Audit Committee before com-
mencement of the work.
Discharge of responsibilities 
According to provision C.3.8 of the UK Corporate Govern-
ance Code, the Audit Committee reports on how it discharg-
es its responsibilities on the significant issues reviewed by 
the Committee. 
In order to discharge its responsibilities, the Audit Com-
mittee invites the CFO, as well as other executive manag-
ers and external consultants, to attend meetings. The Audit 
Committee discharges financial and corporate reporting, 
internal audit and control, budgeting and planning to the 
management and independent assurance and audit to the 
external auditor. 
Audit Committee statement 
Having discussed information received from the manage-
ment, auditors and consultants, the Audit Committee be-
lieves that the Company’s procedures and financial records 
can be relied upon for the preparation of the annual finan-
cial statements. 
The Audit Committee considers that the Annual report is in 
compliance with the FSA disclosure and transparency rules. 
The Audit Committee considers that the annual financial 
statements are in compliance with IFRS. 
The Audit Committee has therefore recommended to the 
Board of Directors that the Annual report be approved.

is available on the Company website www.polyusgold.com/
company/corporate_governance/risk_committee/.
Meetings and discussions
Please refer to section 6.3 “Board of Directors composition” 
for information on attendance at the Committee.
Review of the Committee’s work
The Committee continued with its ongoing work of the regu-
lar analysis of the company-wide Risk Management System, 
quarterly review of the Production Risk Management Re-
port, oversight of internal risk management and its ongoing 
monitoring of world gold prices. This year the Committee 
additionally focused on ongoing data security and disaster 
recovery efforts and work to secure ISO2301 certification, 
developments at the Natalka project and efforts to secure 
reliable power supplies for its processing facilities.
The Committee is authorised to seek any information it re-
quires from any employee of the Group in order to perform 
its duties, to obtain, at the Group’s expense, outside legal 
or other professional advice on any matter within its terms 
of reference, and to call any employee to be questioned at 
a meeting of the Committee, as and when required. In the 
discharge of its duty to oversee the internal audit process, 
the Committee is assisted by the Audit Committee.
Risk management 
The Risk Committee reviews and commissions manage-
ment reports on strategic business risks
4
. The Committee 
also reviews the Production Risk management reports on 
current production risks on a quarterly basis, which include 
a factor analysis of current risks, information about changes 
to the most significant technical and production risks and 
the status of programmes aimed at mitigating these risks. 
Additionally, information on accidents and technical failures 
recorded at the Company’s operations are provided to the 
Committee. 
Disaster recovery 
At its meetings the Committee reviewed the issues of da-
tabase information security and a disaster recovery plan 
raised by the IT unit, aimed at ensuring uninterrupted op-
eration of the corporate headquarters and regional offices, 
in the event of adverse events (network failure, unexpected 
power loss, cyber-attack, failure of key server equipment 
due to fires and other accidents). The Committee consid-
ered that implementation of these measures had been sat-
isfactorily undertaken. 
Business continuity
In early 2013 the Risk Committee approved the engage-
ment of external consultants to implement Business con-
tinuity management
5
 at individual business units and the 
corporate headquarters. During the year , under the supervi-
sion of the Internal Control Unit and of the Operating Unit, 
work has been carried out to bring the existing system into 
compliance with the new ISO2301 international standard. 
The results of this ongoing work were reviewed by the Com-
mittee and its recommended changes will be implemented 
in the first half of 2014.

World gold prices
World gold prices fell substantially during the year . The Com-
mittee commissioned from management a series of financial 
and operational mitigation options to deal with further pos-
sible gold price falls. The Committee discussed the possible 
use of hedging instruments to protect the Company’s cash 
flow. The Committee approved the development and adop-
tion of procedures authorising limited hedge transactions 
using gold produced at the Kuranakh mine, the Company’s 
highest cost mine. In the event, such hedge transactions 
were not implemented during 2013.
The Natalka project
The Board, Company management and the Committee have 
placed a special focus on developments at the Natalka pro-
ject. Management Consultants, McKinsey, had previously 
helped to create a register of project risks and measures 
for their monitoring and mitigation, and assisted with the 
indication of timelines and responsible persons. McKinsey 
were therefore engaged to monitor the implementation of 
the project. Throughout the year, at its meetings, the Com-
mittee discussed the status of the project and examined 
reports on the management of risks associated with the 
organisation of preparation and development of the mine. 
A major risk at the Natalka project is securing the provision 
of stable power supply, as the Natalka project is located far 
from the generating plants. The Committee reviewed meas-
ures aimed both at mitigating energy risks for the Natalka 
project and ensuring guaranteed commissioning of power 
lines as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approv-
als. The Committees’ work fed directly into the decision to 
re-sequence the development plan of the Natalka project.
A more comprehensive review of the individual risks faced 
is included in section 2.5 “Principal risks and uncertainties”, 
along with measures taken by the Company to mitigate 
these risks.
Despite the Company’s efforts to mitigate risk throughout 
its operations, the Committee remains mindful of the fact 
that mining activities in remote locations and in extreme 
weather conditions will continue to pose significant risks 
and that these risks are compounded by political and regu-
latory risks and a volatile world market for gold. The Com-
mittee will continue its close monitoring of the situation in 
the year to come.

Meetings and discussions
Please refer to section 6.3 “Board of Directors composition”, 
for information on attendance at the Committee.
Review of the Committee’s work
The Committee met formally four times and informally in 
person or via conference call on approximately ten addition-
al occasions and considered new appointments to the Board 
and a new CEO, developed a comprehensive diversity policy 
and conducted an internal review of Board performance, 
including individual evaluations of Board members.
Following the announcement by Robert Buchan, that he in-
tended to step down as Chairman of the Board, the Com-
mittee evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge, experi-
ence and diversity on the Board and prepared a detailed 
person specification for an independent executive search 
consultancy. Heidrick and Struggles, a search firm, which 
has no other connection with the Company, were engaged 
to help find suitable candidates.
The Nominations Committee held a number of joint meet-
ings with the Remuneration Committee to gauge overall 
progress and to participate in specific conversations with 
selected candidates, and, in October, made a recommenda-
tion to the Board that it appoint Ilya Yuzhanov as Chairman 
of the Board and Chairman of the Nominations Committee. 
Ilya Yuzhanov has significant experience in non-executive 
positions in various mining companies and is additionally 
a member of the Supervisory Board of the Association of 
Independent Directors of Russia. At the same meeting, the 
Committee also recommended that Edward Dowling be ap-
pointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the 
Company and as a member of the Health, Safety and Envi-
ronment and Risk Committees. Later , the Committee recom-
mended that Edward Dowling be appointed as a member of 
the Audit Committee and the Nomination Committee.

At its November meeting, the Committee recommended 
that Pavel Grachev be appointed to the Board as a Non-
Executive Director. Later in November, upon the resignation 
of German Pikhoya as Director and CEO, Pavel Grachev was 
appointed as Interim CEO of the Company to serve in that 
position until a new permanent CEO is appointed. During 
2013 the Committee initiated an intensive search to recruit 
a new Chief Executive Officer.
The Committee instituted a comprehensive compliance 
programme, requiring detailed information gathering and 
background checks for all candidates. Every new member 
of the Board is informed of all premium listing disclosure 
requirements and the necessity to disclose related-party in-
formation and undergoes training sessions.
Recognising that diversity is an essential component of suc-
cessful corporate governance, the Board developed and ap-
proved a comprehensive diversity policy, which encompass-
es among other things, diversity of perspective, experience, 
skills, background, knowledge, international experience and 
gender. The policy suggests criteria for determining the op-
timum composition of the Board and procedures to ensure 
that appointments are made on the basis of merit. For a 
detailed description of the Diversity policy, see section 6.4 
“Diversity policy”. 
As part of its ongoing commitment to ensuring that the 
Company is effectively and efficiently governed, the Com-
mittee undertook a performance review of the Board and 
its Committees. Each member of the Board was asked to 
complete a detailed questionnaire, which asked them to 
grade the performance of the Board and its Committees, 
the effectiveness of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
leadership and culture and the monitoring of operational 
performance and corporate governance. Following an eval-
uation of the evidence, the Committee concluded that the 
Board and its Committees remain effective and that each 
Director continues to make an effective contribution.
In the coming year, the Committee will continue to assess 
potential enhancements to the Board and its Committees, 
and monitor relevant developments in corporate govern-
ance with emphasis on development and succession plan-
ning for Senior management, providing updates and train-
ing for Directors and facilitating an external review of the 
Board’s performance.

Review of the Committee’s work
In addition to its watchdog role, this year the Committee 
has overseen major developments in each of the areas 
within its remit, including new health and safety, environ-
mental and sustainability initiatives. In discharging its re-
sponsibilities the Committee works closely with the other 
Board Committees, particularly in the areas of risk assess-
ment and management.
The Committee arranges for periodic reviews of its own 
performance and, at least annually, reviews its constitution 
and terms of reference to ensure that it is operating effec-
tively and recommends any changes it considers necessary 
to the Board for approval.
Health and safety
In 2013, regrettably, the Company reported three fatali-
ties (compared with six in 2012). Following an independent 
third-party health and safety audit conducted at the alluvial 
operations in the Irkutsk region, where these three fatali-
ties took place, a comprehensive health and safety action 
plan was developed to be rolled out at the start of the pro-
duction season in spring 2014.

During the reporting year, the Group’s lost time injury fre-
quency rate was 0.11, a 39% decrease from 0.18 in 2012. 
Despite this progress, the Committee remains resolute 
on all workplace accidents.
The Committee oversaw the introduction of new Medical 
Emergency Response and Occupational Health standards, 
which were implemented across the Polyus Group during 
the year. The Committee will keep the system under review 
during 2014. Additionally, the Committee reviewed and ap-
proved the Polyus Gold 2013–2015 Health and Safety Road 
Map, which sets out new standards and goals for the com-
ing two years.
The safety of the Company’s employees and stakeholders 
is of paramount importance to the Board and to that end 
the Committee, along with all other Board members, took 
part in the DuPont Safety Leadership training programme 
on 13 December 2013. Further, the Committee approved 
the implementation of the second stage of the DuPont 
Safety Leadership training programme at the Krasnoyarsk 
and Magadan business units in 2014.
The Committee undertook a quarterly review of manage-
ment’s response to the most serious health and safety in-
cidents. The newly introduced procedures for incident root 
cause analysis, which were implemented across the Polyus 
Gold group, will prove an invaluable tool in investigating 
and mitigating such incidents in the future.
Environment and community
The Committee reviewed and approved the 2012 Sustain-
ability report. Further, the Global Reporting Initiative, a 
leading sustainability body, rated the report A+ in an Appli-
cation Level Check. The Committee additionally monitored 
the Group’s progress against its road map to membership 
of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an indus-
try body, founded in 2001 to improve sustainable develop-
ment performance in the mining and metals industry.
The Human Rights policy was reviewed and approved 
by the Committee and subsequently approved by the Board 
on 13 December 2013, and the Stakeholder Engagement 
policy was examined by the Committee and signed-off by 
the Committee Chairman. The policy sets new standards 
and parameters for the Company’s work with the local com-
munities affected by the Group’s operations.
Please refer to section 3 “Sustainability report” for more 
information on the Group’s activities in this area.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual re-
port and the consolidated financial statements in accord-
ance with applicable law and regulations. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. 
The Board of Directors is required to prepare the consoli-
dated financial statements in accordance with Internatio-
nal Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as 
adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Interna-
tional Accounting Standard 1 requires that the Board of Di-
rectors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group’s consolidated 
financial position and financial performance;
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction 
with the independent auditor’s responsibilities stated in the inde-

Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the consolidated financial statements, prepared in ac-

financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole;

opment and performance of the business and the posi-
tion of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a descrip-
tion of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face;
• the Annual report and consolidated financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy.

7.2. Independent  
auditor’s report
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Polyus Gold International Limited
Opinion 
on consolidated 
financial statements 
of Polyus Gold 
International Limited
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Stand-
ards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated Income Statement, consol-
idated Statement of Comprehensive Income, consolidated Statement of Financial Position, 
consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, consolidated Statement of Cash flows and the 
related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their prep-
aration is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Going concern We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 53 that the group is a going 
concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement  
is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment 
of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Potential impairment of fixed assets 
In a reducing gold price environment there 
is a risk that the carrying value of the mining 
assets, capital construction in progress and mine 
under development described in notes 15, 16 
and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 
may not be recoverable. 
Management performed impairment tests on the 
Kuranakh mines within the Yakutia Kuranakh 
business unit, the Verninskoye mine within 
the Irkutsk Ore business unit and, following 
the recently announced re-sequencing, at the 
Natalka mine under development within the 
Magadan business unit. 
We challenged management’s significant assumptions by:
• comparing foreign exchange rates and the long term gold prices 
assumed to external forecasts;
• assessed the discount rates used by recalculation and compari-
son to other gold producers; 
• holding discussions with operational management to understand 
and evaluate the details of the capital expenditure phasing at Na-
talka and the forecast spend on the planned flow increases; and 
• using our internal mining specialists, VenmynDeloitte, to perform 
a high level review of the mine plans of both Natalka and Vernin-
skoye including the operating expenditure in comparison to similar 
operations and the consistency of the discounted cash flows with 
the respective life of mine plans and the declared ore reserves. 
Potential impairment of exploration and 
evaluation (E&E) assets
The Group capitalises E&E expenditure in line 
with IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation 
of Mineral Resources. The assessment of each 
asset’s future prospectivity requires significant 
judgement. There is a risk that amounts are 
capitalised which no longer meet the recognition 
criteria of IFRS 6. 
Management has performed a review of the E&E 
portfolio of assets as set out in note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements and, following the 
decline in the gold price during the year , recorded 
a significant impairment, as several of these were 
no longer likely to be progressed to development. 
We: 
• held discussions with key operational and finance staff to under-
stand the exploration and appraisal activities;
• reviewed and evaluated management’s assessment of the existence 
of impairment indicators in the portfolio of E&E assets as set out 
in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements by assessing the 
appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates; 
•  reviewed the exploration licence conditions for any potential breach-
es; and
• reviewed management’s approved exploration budgets for 2014 in or-
der to check that exploration projects were ongoing and committed;
• where an E&E asset has been impaired we have challenged man-
agement on the events that led to the impairment,and the judge-
ments surrounding the recoverability of the carrying values.
Measurement and valuation of inventory 
Inventory, as set out in note 20 to the 
consolidated financial statements, is required 
to be carried at the lower of its cost and 
net realisable value. The measurement and 
valuation of gold in circuit and ore stockpiles 
included in inventory and their net realisable 
value is complex, involves judgement and 
is based on assumptions about gold content 
and future processing costs. There is also a risk 
of obsolescence of stores and spares. 
We: 
•  evaluated the assumptions and judgements used in management’s 
assessment of the net realisable value of ore stockpiles, including 
specifically comparing future gold price assumptions to external 
data and running sensitivities to assess the key judgements; 
•  analysed movements of the gold in circuit on a stage-by-stage basis 
and confirmed through discussions with operational management 
that the movements are in line with changes in operations;   
•  assessed management’s inventory costing calculations to confirm 
that it is measured in accordance with IAS 2 – Inventories; 
•  attended inventory counts at the Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk Alluvial and 
Irkutsk Ore business units; and 
•  reviewed the analysis of stores and spares throughput.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 140.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclo-
sures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks 
described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application 
of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the consolidated financial state-
ments that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be USD 30 million, which is approximately 5% 
of the Group’s profit before impairment charges of USD 472 million and tax, and below 1% 
of equity. Impairment charges have been added back because, if included, they would signifi-
cantly distort the materiality assessment year on year.
Lower materiality levels of between USD 15 million and USD 24 million have been applied for the 
component audits.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of USD 600,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, war-
ranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the 
scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.  
Based on that assessment, our Group audit scope focused primarily on the Krasnoyarsk and 
Irkutsk Alluvial business units which were subject to a full scope audit, and the Magadan and 
Capital construction business units, where we performed a full audit of capital construction 
in progress (CCIP) and mine under development additions. 
This has given us coverage of 84% of the Group’s revenue, 86% of the Group’s production, 
99% of the group’s operating profit before impairment charges, 86% of the Group’s fixed as-
sets, and 94% of the Group’s CCIP and mine under development additions.
In addition, other business units (Irkutsk ore, Yakutia Kuranakh and Exploration), were subject 
to specified audit procedures to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
At the parent entity level, we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstate-
ment of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to a full 
audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit engagement team also performed site visits such that the Group audit partner 
or his designate visited the Olimpiada, Blagodatnoye, Titimukhta, Natalka and Verninskoye mine 
sites and the headquarter office in Moscow. At the direction of the Group audit team the component 
audit team in Russia also visited the Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk Alluvial, Irkutsk Ore and Magadan busi-
ness units during the year .  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Matters on which 
we are required 
to report  
by exception 
Adequacy 
of explanations 
received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the consolidated financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other 
information in the 
Annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, information in the Annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited consolidated financial statements; 
or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the Annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which 
we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Other 
matter – Directors’ 
remuneration
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly pre-
pared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied 
to the company.
Respective  
responsibilities 
of Directors and 
Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the consolidated finan-
cial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our 
audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, under-
stood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A 
of the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and/or those further matters we have expressly agreed to report to them on in our engagement 
letter and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Scope of the audit 
of the consolidated 
financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited consolidated financial statements and to identify any infor-
mation that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowl-
edge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Magadan region. Further details regarding the nature of the business and of the significant subsidiaries of the Group are 
presented in note 35.1.
2. Basis of preparation and presentation
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s financial position, expected future 
trading performance, its borrowings and available credit facilities and its capital expenditure commitments, considerations 
of gold price, together with other risks facing the Group. After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of 
signing these consolidated financial statements and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these consolidated financial statements.
Compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed by the European Union (“EU”). 
IFRS includes the standards and interpretations approved by the IASB including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 
and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).
Basis of presentation
The entities of the Group maintain their accounting records in accordance with the laws, accounting and reporting regula-
tions of the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated and registered. The accounting principles and financial reporting 
procedures in these jurisdictions may differ substantially from those generally accepted under IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
Accordingly, such financial information has been adjusted to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are pre-
sented in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.

3. Significant accounting policies
3.1. Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidi-
aries, from the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively ceased. Control is achieved 
where the Company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. 
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the 
voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. 
The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an 
investee are sufficient to give it power, including:
• the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of the other vote holders;
• potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
• any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability 
to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous 
shareholders’ meetings.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company gains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company 
loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control 
until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The non-
controlling interest may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share 
of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in net assets since the date 
of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-
controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transac-
tions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes 
in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are 
adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners 
of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit and loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the 
aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and the previous carry-
ing amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for in the same manner 
as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the 
former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent account-
ing under IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition 
of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are elimi-
nated on consolidation.
Functional currency
The individual financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are each prepared in their respective functional currencies. 
The functional currency of the Company is the US Dollar. The Russian Rouble (“RUB”) is the functional currency of all the 
subsidiaries of the Group, except for the following subsidiaries operating with significant degrees of autonomy:

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.2. Presentation currency
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in the US Dollar (“USD”), as management believes it is a more 
convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it is a 
common presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from 
their functional currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows:
• all assets, liabilities, both monetary and non-monetary, are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting date;
• all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the years presented, except for signifi-
cant transactions that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
• resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as Effect of translation to presentation cur-
rency within the Translation reserve; and
• in the statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented are 
translated at exchange rates at the respective dates. All cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates 
for the years presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date of transaction.
Exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were as follows:
2013 2012 2011
Russian Rouble/US Dollar
Year end rate 32.73 30.37 32.20
Average for the year 31.85 31.09 29.39
 
3.3. Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are trans-
lated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which the most recent fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising 
from changes in exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
3.4. Revenue recognition
Gold sales revenue
Revenue from the sale of refined gold and other gold-bearing products is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership 
are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement or control over the goods sold, the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will 
flow to the entity. Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised at the time of shipment from the refining plant when the Group 
has received confirmation of sale to the third party. Revenue from gold-bearing products is recognised when the goods have 
been delivered to a contractually agreed location. Gold sales are stated at their invoiced value net of value-added tax.
Other revenue
Other revenue comprises mainly sales of electricity, transportation, handling and warehousing services, and other. Revenue 
from the sale of electricity is recognised when a contract exists, delivery has taken place, a quantifiable price has been 
established or can be determined and the receivables are likely to be recovered. Delivery takes place when the risks and 
benefits associated with ownership are transferred to the buyer. Revenue from service contracts is recognised when the 
services are rendered. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
3.5. Income tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed in ac-
cordance with the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in 
the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements of 
the separate legal entities and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for us-
ing the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and 
deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associ-
ates are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise 
the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the li-
ability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its 
assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement, except when they 
relate to items that are recognised outside the consolidated income statement, in which case the tax is also recognised 
outside the consolidated income statement, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In 
the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of 
the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.6. Operating leases
The leases of assets under which all the risks and benefits of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operat-
ing leases. Costs for operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic 
basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit.
3.7. Dividends
Dividends and related taxation thereon are recognised as a liability in the period in which they have been declared and 
become legally payable.
Retained earnings legally distributable by the Company are based on the amounts available for distribution in accordance 
with the applicable legislation and as reflected in the statutory financial statements of the individual subsidiaries of the 
Group. These amounts may differ significantly from the amounts calculated on the basis of IFRS.
3.8. Property, plant and equipment
Mineral rights
Mineral rights are recorded as assets upon acquisition at fair value and are included within Mining assets, Capital construc-
tion-in-progress, Mines under development or Exploration and evaluation assets.
Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation. Mining assets include the cost of acquiring and develop-
ing mining properties, pre-production expenditure and mine infrastructure, processing plant, mineral rights and mining and 
exploration licences and the present value of future decommissioning costs.
Mining assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of the asset, or the remaining 
useful life of mines of 7 to 16 years per mine operating plans, which call for production from estimated proven and prob-
able ore reserves under the Russian Resource Reporting Code, whichever is shorter. Amortisation is charged from the date 
a new mine reaches commercial production quantities and is included in the cost of production.
The estimated remaining useful lives of the Group’s significant mines based on the mine operating plans are as follows:
Olimpiada 14 years
Blagodatnoye 16 years
Kuranakh 10 years
Verninskoye 11 years
Non-mining assets
Non-mining assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 
the economic useful lives of such assets:
Building, structures, plant and equipment 5-50 years
Transport 3-11 years
Other assets 3-10 years Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Stripping activity asset
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered to create two benefits, being either the production of 
inventory in the current period and/or improved access to the ore to be mined in the future. Where production stripping 
costs are incurred and the benefit is improved access to ore to be mined in the future, the costs are recognised as a strip-
ping activity asset, if the following criteria are met:
• future economic benefits (being improved access to the ore body) are probable;
• the component of the ore body for which access will be improved can be accurately identified; and
• the costs associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.
If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are included in the cost of inventory which are expensed in 
the consolidated income statement as cost of gold sales as they are sold.
The stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost, which is the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform 
the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable 
overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are not included in the costs of stripping activity asset.
The Group uses an allocation basis that is based on volumes of waste extracted compared with expected volumes of ore 
extracted from a specific component of the ore body to allocate stripping costs between inventory and the stripping activity 
asset in accordance with the Group’s mine operating plans. Production forecasts included in the mine operating plans are 
based on estimated proven and probable ore reserves under the Russian Resource Reporting Code.
The stripping activity asset is accounted for as a part of property, plant and equipment and subsequently depreciated us-
ing the straight-line method over the life of the identified component of the ore body that became more accessible as a 
result of the stripping activity. After initial recognition the stripping activity asset is carried at cost less depreciation and 
any impairment losses.
In 2014, the Group is planning to adopt the unit of production method to depreciate the stripping activity asset if there is 
a material divergence in the expected future depreciation charge when compared to the straight-line method.
3.9. Capital construction-in-progress
Assets under construction at operating mines are accounted for as capital construction-in-progress. The cost of capital 
construction-in-progress comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs to bringing it into working condi-
tions for its intended use. 
Capital construction-in-progress is not depreciated. 
When the capital construction-in-progress has been completed and in a condition necessary for them to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management, the objects are reclassified to mining assets.

Comprises amounts related to new mines development and includes the costs directly related to mine development pro-
jects such as acquiring and developing mining properties, pre-production expenditure, construction of processing plant and 
mine infrastructure, mineral rights and mining and exploration licences and the present value of future decommissioning 
costs. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3.11. Finance costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets
Finance costs directly attributable to the construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until 
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying 
assets is deducted from the finance costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other finance costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
3.12. Impairment of long-lived tangible assets (Property, plant and equipment, Capital 
construction-in-progress and Mines under development)
An impairment review of long-lived tangible assets is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recover-
able amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to esti-
mate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value-in-use. If the recoverable amount of an asset 
(or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income state-
ment immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as 
a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior 
periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately, unless the relevant as-
set is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
3.13. Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets represent capitalised expenditures incurred by the Group in connection with the explora-
tion for and evaluation of gold resources, such as:
• acquisition of rights to explore potentially mineralised areas;
• topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies;
• exploratory drilling;
• trenching;
• sampling; and
• activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting gold resource.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalised when the exploration and evaluation activities have not reached a 
stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable gold resources. When the tech-
nical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a gold resource are demonstrable and a decision has been made to 
develop the mine, capitalised exploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to Mines under development.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The following facts and circumstances, 
among others, indicate that exploration and evaluation assets must be tested for impairment:
• the term of the exploration licence in the specific area has expired during the reporting period or will expire in the 
near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
• substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of gold resources in the specific area is neither 
budgeted nor planned; 
• exploration for and evaluation of gold resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially 
viable quantities of gold resources and the decision was made to discontinue such activities in the specific area; and 
• sufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to occur, the carrying amount 
of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
For the purpose of assessing exploration and evaluation assets for impairment, such assets are allocated to cash-generat-
ing units, being exploration licence areas.
Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense in accordance with the policy on impairment of tangible assets set out 
above.
3.14. Inventories
Refined gold, ore stockpiles and gold-in-process
Inventories including refined metals, doré, metals in concentrate and in process and ore stockpiles are stated at the lower of 
production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenses incurred directly 
or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued at the average cost of 
production per saleable unit of metal. Doré, metals in concentrate and in process, ore stockpiles are valued at the average 
production costs at the relevant stage of production. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for product 
based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated costs to complete production and costs necessary to make the sale.
Stores and materials
Stores and materials consist of consumable stores and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of 
stores and materials are determined on a weighted average cost basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for stores and materials less all costs necessary to make the sale.
3.15. Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised on trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose 
terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, 
which are initially measured at fair value.
The Group’s financial assets are classified into the following categories:
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”);
• held-to-maturity investments; and
• loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial rec-
ognition. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

ended 31 December 2013 (in thousands of US Dollars)

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as a FVTPL where the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as a FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future or
• it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as a FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would oth-
erwise arise or
• the financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and 
its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management 
or investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Rec-
ognition and Measurement” permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or 
loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and 
is included in the (Loss)/income from investments line item in the consolidated income statement. Fair value is determined 
in the manner described in note 33.
Held-to-maturity investments
Promissory notes with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent 
and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with income recognised on an effective yield basis.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans 
and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any im-
pairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. For financial as-
sets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the excep-
tion of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade 
receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are rec-
ognised in the consolidated income statement. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 (in thousands of US Dollars)
177
Back to the contents
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through 
the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the 
Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the trans-
ferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to 
pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group 
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocat-
ing interest income or expense, respectively, over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments, as applicable, through the expected life of the financial asset or 
liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets designated 
as at FVTPL.
3.16. Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis within finance cost.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
3.17. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
3.18. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it 
is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is 
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.19. Site restoration and environmental obligations
Site restoration and environmental obligations include decommissioning and land restoration costs. Future decommission-
ing and land restoration costs, discounted to net present value, are added to the respective assets and the correspond-
ing obligations raised as soon as the constructive obligation to incur such costs arises and the future cost can be reliably 
estimated. Additional assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life-of-mine. The unwinding of the obligation 
is included in the consolidated income statement as finance costs. Obligations are periodically reviewed in light of current 
laws and regulations, and adjustments made as necessary to the corresponding item of property, plant and equipment.
Ongoing restoration costs are expensed when incurred.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Group’s management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current 
and expected economic conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
Judgement has been applied when selecting the appropriate accounting policies. The following are the key assumptions 
concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a sig-
nificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
• justification of the economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment;
• recoverability of the exploration and evaluation assets;
• determination and valuation of the stripping activity asset;
• impairment of the tangible assets;
• estimation of the site restoration and environmental obligations; 
• interpretation of the tax legislation in accounting for income taxes; and
• assessment of the outcome of contingencies.
Economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment
The Group’s mining assets, classified within property, plant and equipment, are amortised using the straight-line method 
over the life-of-mine based on a mine operating plan, which calls for production from estimated proven and probable ore 
reserves under the Russian Resource Reporting Code. When determining life-of-mine, assumptions that were valid at the 
time of estimation may change when new information becomes available. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 (in thousands of US Dollars)
179
Back to the contents
The factors that could affect estimation of life-of-mine include the following:
• change of estimates of proven and probable ore reserves;
• the grade of ore reserves varying significantly from time to time;
• differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore 
reserves;
• unforeseen operational issues at mine sites; and
• changes in capital, processing and reclamation costs, discount rates and foreign exchange rates possibly ad-
versely affecting the economic viability of ore reserves.
Any of these changes could affect prospective amortisation of mining assets and their carrying value.
Non-mining property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their economic useful lives. Man-
agement periodically reviews the appropriateness of the assets’ economic useful lives. The review is based on the current 
condition of the assets and the estimated period during which they will continue to bring economic benefit to the Group.
Exploration and evaluation assets
Management’s judgement is involved in the determination of whether the expenditures which are capitalised as exploration 
and evaluation assets may be recouped by future exploitation or sale or should be impaired. Determining this, manage-
ment estimates the possibility of finding recoverable ore reserves related to a particular area of interest. However, these 
estimates are subject to significant uncertainties. The Group is involved in exploration and evaluation activities, and some 
of its licensed properties contain gold resources under the definition of internationally recognised mineral resource report-
ing methodologies. A number of licensed properties have no mineral resource delineation. Management assumes that all 
licences will be renewed. Many of the factors, assumptions and variables involved in estimating resources are beyond the 
Group’s control and may prove to be incorrect over time. Subsequent changes in gold resources estimates could impact 
the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets. 
Stripping activity asset 
The Group incurs stripping costs during the production phases of its surface mining operations. Significant judgement is 
required to distinguish between the production stripping which relates to the extraction of inventory and which relates to 
the creation of a stripping activity asset.
In order to perform the allocation the Group is required to identify separate components towards which the stripping 
costs have been incurred for the ore bodies in each of its mines. An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore 
body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to identify and define these 
components, and also to determine the expected volumes of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these 
components. For the purposes of identification of separate components the Group uses mine operating plans, which are 
based on estimated proven and probable ore reserves under the Russian Resource Reporting Code.
Each discrete stage of mining identified in the mine plans is considered as a unit of account. If the mine plan initially 
identifies several discrete stages of mining which will take place consecutively (one after another), these stages would be 
identified as components. These assessments are undertaken for each individual mine.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase should be allocated between inventory produced and the stripping ac-
tivity asset by using the allocation basis. The Group considers that the volume of waste extracted compared with expected 
volume of a specific component of the ore body, for a given level of ore production, to be the most suitable allocation basis. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Impairment of tangible assets
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those as-
sets are impaired. In making the assessment for impairment indicators, assets that do not generate independent cash flows 
are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets 
that do not generate independent cash flows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and 
value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation.
Factors which could impact underlying cash flows include: 
• commodity prices and exchange rates;
• timelines of granting of licences and permits;
• capital and operating expenditure; and
• available reserves and resources and future production profile.
Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could impact the carrying value 
of the respective assets.
Site restoration and environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. The Group 
estimates site restoration and environmental obligations based on management’s understanding of the current legal re-
quirements in the various jurisdictions, terms of the licence agreements and internally generated engineering estimates. 
A provision is recognised, based on the net present values for decommissioning and land restoration costs, as soon as the 
obligation arises. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially from the amounts provided. Additionally, 
future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life-of-mine estimates and discount rates could affect the carrying 
amount of this provision.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the 
Group’s provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation. There are many transactions and calculations for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the 
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period 
in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf-
ficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that 
probability includes judgements based on the expected performance. Various factors are considered to assess the prob-
ability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax 
losses carried forward and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the estimates or if these estimates must be 
adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of 
such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

5. Discontinued operations and disposal of subsidiaries
In February 2013, the Group completed the transaction for the sale of its operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Kyr-
gyzstan representing the Kazakhstan business unit for a total consideration of USD 297,282 thousand, recognizing a gain 
on disposal of USD 4,577 thousand. The following companies were sold:
• JSC “MMC Kazakhaltyn” and its subsidiaries operating in Kazakhstan; and
• Norox Mining Company Limited and its subsidiaries operating in Kyrgyzstan.
These operating subsidiaries mainly comprised the following mining operations in Northern and Eastern Kazakhstan: the 
Aksu mine (which consists of the Aksu mine and adjacent Quartzite Hills deposits), the Bestobe mine, the Zholymbet mine 
and the Akzhal mine. In addition, these assets include development properties in Northern, Eastern and Central Kazakhstan 
as well as exploration projects at Yuzhny Karaultube and Kaskabulak. 
There were no contingent liabilities or deferred consideration applicable to the sale. All the proceeds were received in cash.
As the Kazakhstan operations did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation or assets held for 
sale as at 31 December 2012 it has not been re-presented as such in the statement of financial position. The comparative 
income statement has been re-presented to show the discontinued operations separately from continuing operation for

During the year ended 31 December 2012, the following subsidiaries of the Group:
• Romaltyn Mining S.R.L., Romaltyn Exploration S.R.L., Romaltyn Limited (previously attributable to Kazakhstan 
business unit); and
• GRK Bargold Ltd and Yakutskoye GRP Ltd (previously attributable to the Exploration business unit)
 were sold to independent non related parties.
Romaltyn Mining and Romaltyn Exploration (together, “the Romanian assets”) hold rights to various mining assets in Roma-
nia including a gold treatment plant with an annual processing capacity of 2.5 million tonnes (currently not in operation) 
and a number of exploration properties. Romanian assets were acquired in 2009, together with the Group’s subsidiaries 
in Kazakhstan. The disposal of the Romanian assets was driven by the strategic objectives of the Group and the increased 
focus on our core large-scale operations. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

6. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised in the following separate business segments defined by a combination 
of operating activities and geographical area. Separate financial information is available for each segment and is reported 
regularly to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and the Executive Committee. The Group’s seven identified re-
portable segments are located and described as follows (the Kazakhstan business unit was disposed in February 2013 (note 
5.2) therefore it is not presented in the Segment information note):
• Krasnoyarsk business unit (Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation) – Extraction, refining and sale of 
gold from the Olimpiada, Blagodatnoye and Titimukhta mines, as well as research, exploration and development 
work at the Olimpiada and Blagodatnoye deposits;
• Irkutsk alluvial business unit (Irkutsk region, Bodaibo district of the Russian Federation) – Extraction, refining 
and sale of gold from several alluvial deposits;
• Irkutsk ore business unit (Irkutsk region, Bodaibo district of the Russian Federation) – Extraction, refining 
and sale of gold from the Verninskoye mine, research, exploration and development works at Chertovo Korito, 
Smezhny and Medvezhy Zapadny deposits;
• Yakutia Kuranakh business unit (Sakha Republic of the Russian Federation) – Extraction, refining and sale of 
gold from the Kuranakh mines;
• Magadan business unit (Magadan region of the Russian Federation) – Represented by OJSC “Matrosova Mine” 
which performs development works at the Natalka deposit;
• Exploration business unit (Krasnoyarsk region, Irkutsk region, Amur region, and others) – Research and ex-
ploration works in several regions of the Russian Federation; 
• Capital construction unit – Represented by LLC “Polyus Stroy” and CJSC “Vitimenergostroy” which perform 
construction works at Natalka, Verninskoye, Olimpiada and other deposits.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

6. Segment information (continued)
The reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from gold sales. The CODM performs an analysis of the operating 
results based on these separate business units and evaluates the reporting segment’s results, for the purposes of resource 
allocation, based on the segment measure; segment profit before income tax excluding the finance costs, other sales, costs 
of other sales and income from investments.
Business segment assets and liabilities are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are not disclosed in these consolidated 
financial statements. Segment financial information provided to the CODM is prepared from the management accounts, 
which are based on Russian accounting standards.
The Group does not allocate segment results of companies that perform management, investing activities and certain other 
administrative functions within its internal reporting.

Following the significant fall in the gold price in the first half of 2013 and the subsequent sustained lower price, the Group 
reassessed:
• the carrying value of its mining assets, stripping activity assets and capital construction-in-progress, at its 
Kuranakh mine in the Yakutia business unit, against its value-in-use; 
• the future prospectivity of its exploration and evaluation asset portfolio; and
• the recoverability of its long-term stockpiles and gold-in-process.
After the related tax credit of USD 50,867 thousand, the post-tax impairment charge is USD 420,790 thousand. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Impairment of Property, plant and equipment and Capital construction-in-progress
As at 30 June 2013, the group recorded an impairment charge of USD 104,482 thousand in respect of the Kuranakh mine 
in the Yakutia region, following the significant fall in the gold price. As a consequence of the sustained lower gold price, the 
extended ramp up period of Verninskoye and the re-sequencing of the Natalka project, impairment tests have also been 
performed on the Verninskoye mine in the Irkutsk region and the Natalka mine under development in the Magadan region. 
No further impairments were required.
The key assumptions that were used in the impairment testing were a weighted average long term gold price of USD 1,350 
per oz and a post-tax discount rate in the range 6-10% (pre-tax 7-12%) depending on the risk profile of each mine.
The impairment tests are particularly sensitive to the assumed price of gold and impairments would be required at an as-
sumed gold price below USD 1,250 per oz.
Impairment of Exploration and evaluation assets
The future prospectivity of its Exploration and evaluation asset portfolio was reassessed and the following impairments 
identified:
Year ended 
31 December 2013
Nezhdaninskoye deposit 247,500 
Degdekanskoye deposit 48,258 
Burgakhchan area 6,393 
Verkhnekadrinskaya area 6,483 
Vangashskaya area 6,230 
Apsakan deposit 1,604
Total 316,468 
In the new lower gold price environment the Company is prioritising its investments. Despite the identification of significant 
reserves at the Nezhdaninskoye and Degdekanskoye deposits the Company now considers it unlikely that these will be 
developed.
Impairment of long-term stockpiles and gold-in-process 
The recoverability of certain low-grade long-term ore stockpiles at Kuranakh and gravitation tailings at Verninskoye is now 
considered unlikely and accordingly these have been impaired.

28. Deferred tax liabilities
The movement in the Group’s deferred taxation position was as follows:
Year ended 31 December
2013 2012
Net deferred tax liability at beginning of the year 208,998  184,207 
Recognised in the consolidated income statement (41,275) 14,633 
Deferred tax liability disposed as a result of  discontinued operations (26,722) -
Other 12,650 -
Effect of translation to presentation currency (19,235) 10,158 
Net deferred tax liability at end of the year 134,416  208,998 
Deferred taxation is attributable to the temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets and li-
abilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. The deferred tax amounts resulted from 
temporary differences in the following accounts are presented below: Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Unrecognised deferred tax asset
The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses carried 
forward available for offset against future taxable profit of certain 
subsidiaries within the Group 87,620  40,143 
Such tax losses expire in periods up to ten years, and are not recognised 
as management does not believe it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the respective entities can utilise the 
benefits.
Unrecognised deferred tax liability
The unrecognised deferred tax liability for taxable temporary  
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 26,298  78,020 
The deferred tax liability presented above was not recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the rever-
sal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

through to 2060. Future minimum lease payments due under non-can-
cellable operating lease agreements at the end of the year were as 
follows:
Due within one year 4,385 2,928

Contingencies
Litigations
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to litigation in a number of jurisdictions, the outcome of which is 
uncertain and could give rise to adverse outcomes. At the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements there 
were no material claims and litigation applicable to the Group, except for the lawsuit related to the additional dividends 
distribution attributable to preferred shares of OJSC “Lenzoloto” for the amount of USD 8,978 thousand. Management 
believes that this claim will not have a material adverse impact on the Group.
Insurance
The insurance industry is not yet well developed in the Russian Federation and many forms of insurance protection com-
mon in more economically developed countries are not yet available on comparable terms. The Group does not have full 
insurance coverage for its mining, processing and transportation facilities, for business interruption, or for third party li-
abilities in respect of property or environmental damage arising from accidents on the Group’s property or relating to the 
Group’s operations, other than limited coverage required by law. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

32. Commitments and contingencies (continued)
The Group, as a participant in exploration and mining activities, may become subject to liability for risks that cannot be 
insured against, or against which it may elect not to be insured because of high premium costs. Losses from uninsured 
risks may cause the Group to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and financial 
condition.
Taxation contingencies in the Russian Federation
Commercial legislation in the Russian Federation, including tax legislation, is subject to varying interpretations and frequent 
changes. In addition, there is a risk of tax authorities making arbitrary judgements of business activities. If a particular 
treatment, based on management’s judgement of the Group’s business activities, was to be challenged by the tax authori-
ties, the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and interest.
Generally, taxpayers are subject to tax audits with respect to three calendar years preceding the year of the audit. However, 
completed audits do not exclude the possibility of subsequent additional tax audits performed by upper-level tax inspec-
torates reviewing the results of tax audits of their subordinate tax inspectorates. Also, according to the clarification of the 
Russian Constitutional Court, the statute of limitation for tax liabilities may be extended beyond the three year term set 
forth in the tax legislation, if a court determines that the taxpayer has obstructed or hindered a tax inspection.
Management of the Group is confident that applicable taxes have all been accrued and, consequently, creation of provi-
sions is not required.
Under the Russian tax legislation, the authorities have a period of up to three years to re-open tax declarations for further 
inspection. Changes in the tax system that may be applied retrospectively by the authorities could affect the Group’s previ-
ously submitted and assessed tax declarations.
With regards to matters where practice concerning payment of taxes is unclear, management estimate that there were no 
tax exposures at 31 December 2013 and 2012.
Environmental matters
 The Group is subject to extensive federal and local environmental controls and regulations in the regions in which it oper-
ates. The Group’s operations involve the discharge of materials and contaminants into the environment, disturbance of land 
that could potentially impact on flora and fauna, and give rise to other environmental concerns.
The Group’s management believes that its mining and production technologies are in compliance with the existing Russian 
environmental legislation. However, environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve. The Group is unable to predict 
the timing or extent to which those laws and regulations may change. Such change, if it occurs, may require that the Group 
modernises technology to meet more stringent standards.
The Group is obliged under the terms of various laws, mining licences and ‘use of mineral rights’ agreements to decom-
mission mine facilities on cessation of its mining operations and to restore and rehabilitate the environment. Management 
of the Group regularly reassesses site restoration and environmental obligations for its operations. Estimations are based 
on management’s understanding of the current legal requirements and the terms of the licence agreements. Should the 
requirements of applicable environmental legislation change or be clarified, the Group may incur additional site restoration 
and environmental obligations. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

33. Financial instruments risk management activities
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities of the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while max-
imising the return to the shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the 
Group consists of net debt (borrowings as described in note 27) less cash and cash equivalents (disclosed in note 24) and 
equity of the Group (comprising issued share capital, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests).
Major categories of financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, other non-current liabilities and trade and other payables. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has various financial assets 
such as accounts receivable and loans advanced, cash and cash equivalents, and promissory notes and other investments.

has a fair value of USD 727,943 thousand at 31 December 2013, and is classified as Level 1 as the fair value is based on 
quoted prices.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate, foreign currency, credit and liquidity risks. 
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is man -
aged by the Company by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
If the interest rate was 1% higher/lower during the year ended 31 December 2013 interest expense for the year 2013 
would increase/decrease by USD 9,761 thousand. 
The Group does not enter into any hedging contracts or use other financial instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

(continued)
Foreign currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the financial results of the Group will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates to 
which the Group is exposed.  The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Prices for gold 
are quoted in USD based on international quoted prices, and paid in RUB. The majority of the Group’s expenditures are 
denominated in RUB, accordingly, operating profits are adversely impacted by appreciation of RUB against USD. In assess-
ing this risk, management takes into consideration changes in gold price.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies 
of the individual Group entities were as follows:
31 December
2013 2012
Assets
USD 291,507  348,508 
EURO 1,597  1,888 
Total 293,104  350,396 
Liabilities
USD 1,098,881  381,499 
EURO 93,767  14,087 
Total 1,192,648  395,586 
Currency risk is monitored on a monthly basis by performing sensitivity analysis of foreign currency positions in order to 
verify that potential losses are at an acceptable level.
The table below details the Group’s sensitivity to changes of exchange rates by 10% which is the sensitivity rate used by 
the Group for internal analysis. The analysis was applied to monetary items at the reporting dates denominated in respec-
tive currencies.
Year ended 31 December
2013 2012
Profit or loss (RUB to USD) 80,737  3,852 
Profit or loss (RUB to EURO) 12,688  1,612 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to 
financial losses to the Group. Credit risk arises from cash, cash equivalents and deposits kept with banks, loans granted, 
advances paid, promissory notes and trade and other receivables, and other investments in securities.
In order to mitigate the credit risk, the Group conducts its business with creditworthy and reliable counterparties, mini-
mises the advance payments to suppliers, and actively uses letters of credit and other trade finance instruments. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year

Back to the contents
The Group employs a methodology for in-house financial analysis of banks and non-banking counterparties, which enables 
the management to estimate an acceptable level of credit risk with regard to particular counterparties and to set appropri-
ate individual risk limitations. Within the Group’s core companies the procedures for preparing new agreements include 
analysis and contemplation of credit risk, estimation of the aggregate risk associated with a counterparty (arising both from  
an agreement under consideration and from previously existing contracts, if any) and verifying compliance with individual 
credit limits. 
The Group’s credit risk profile is regularly observed by management in order to avoid undesirable increase in risk, limit 
concentration of credit and to ensure compliance with the above mentioned policies and procedures.
Although the Group sells more than 84% of the gold produced to three major customers, the Group is not economically 
dependent on these customers because of the high level of liquidity in the gold commodity market.  A substantial portion 
of gold sales are made to banks on advance payment or immediate payment terms, therefore credit risk related to trade 
receivables is minimal. The outstanding receivables for gold sales are presented as follows:
31 December
2013 2012
Trade receivables for gold sales -    20,284 
Gold sales to the Group’s three major customers, individually exceeding 9% of the Group’s gold sales are presented as 
follows:
Year ended 31 December
2013 2012
Nomos Banks       1,057,160      1,092,484 
VTB Bank      446,465      1,004,958 
Bank of Moscow           390,789         239,301 
Gold sales to three major customers 
(84% of the Group’s gold sales)       1,894,414     2,336,743 
Other receivables include amounts due in respect of the sale of electricity, transportation, handling and warehousing ser-
vices and other services. The procedures for accepting a new customer include checks by the security department and 
responsible on-site management for business reputation, licences and certification, creditworthiness and liquidity.
Management of the Group believes that there is no other significant concentration of credit risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle all liabilities as they are due.  The Group’s liquidity position 
is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed budgeting and cash fore-
casting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure that it has adequate 
cash available to meet its payment obligations.
Historically the Group has not relied extensively on external financing. Following the development of new capital projects 
during 2013, the Group issued notes and arranged certain external finance facilities with the banks, see note 27.
Management believes that, in case of need, the Group would be able to raise sufficient funding within a reasonable time-
frame, and on favourable terms, due to its strong historical operations and positive operating cash flow.  Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

The Group’s cash management procedures include medium-term forecasting (budget approved each financial year and 
updated on a quarterly basis), short-term forecasting (monthly cash-flow budgets are established for each business unit 
and a review of each entity’s daily cash position using a two-week rolling basis).

ards. However, the legislation and other statutory laws and regulations dealing with profit distribution are open to legal 
interpretation and accordingly management believes at present it would not be appropriate to disclose an amount for the 
distributable profits and reserves in these consolidated financial statements. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

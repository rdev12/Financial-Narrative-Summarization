The Executive Directors have responsibility for these areas at 
Board level, ensuring that the Group’s policies are upheld and 
providing the necessary resources.
Bribery
The Matchtech Board has made a commitment to carry out 
business fairly, honestly and openly and has also demonstrated 
a commitment to zero tolerance towards bribery. A copy of the 
Matchtech High Level Commitment Statement is included below.
Anti-Bribery High Level Commitment Statement
Matchtech Group plc is a leading engineering, professional and 
outsourcing recruitment group with 30 years’ experience. 
We value our reputation for ethical behaviour and financial

prevent bribery and provide a vehicle for confidential reporting. 
Disciplinary action, including dismissal, may be taken against any

The Group’s main Board and Legal and Compliance Department

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF 
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Disclosure of Audit Information
The Directors confirm that, as at the date this report was approved, 
so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and that he has taken all 
the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and budgets for the 
coming year, which have been drawn up with appropriate regard 
for the current macroeconomic environment and the particular 
circumstances in which the Group operates. These were prepared 
with reference to historic and current industry knowledge, taking 
the future strategy of the Group into account. As a result, at the 
time of approving the financial statements, the Directors consider 
that the Company and the Group have sufficient resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
and accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
As with all business forecasts, the Directors’ statement cannot 
guarantee that the going concern basis will remain appropriate 
given the inherent uncertainty about future events.
Auditors
The Company’s independent external auditor, KPMG Audit Plc who 
was initially appointed in March 2011, has instigated an orderly 
wind down of business. The Board has decided to put KPMG LLP 
forward to be appointed as auditors and a resolution concerning 
their appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

MATCHTECH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Cautionary Statement
Under the Companies Acts 2006, a Company’s Directors’ Report 
is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review by the 
Directors of the Group’s business, through a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the development and performance 
of the business of the Group and the position of the Group at the 
year end, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. 
The Directors’ Report set out above, including the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, and the Chief Financial 
Officer’s Report incorporated into it by reference (together with 
the Directors’ Report), has been prepared only for the 
shareholders of the Company as a whole, and its sole purpose and 
use is to assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. In 
particular, the Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise 
independently verified. The Company and its Directors and 
employees are not responsible for any other purpose or use 
or to any other person in relation to the Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward-looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the 
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the countries, sectors and business segments in which 
the Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, 
those discussed under Principal Risks and Uncertainties. These 
and other factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, 
strategy and prospects. Forward-looking statements involve 
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. They relate to events and/or 
depend on circumstances in the future which could cause actual 
results and outcomes to differ materially from those currently 
anticipated. No obligation is assumed to update any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dear Shareholder
I am once again pleased to present the Board’s Annual Report on Corporate Governance.
In writing this letter directly to all our shareholders, I would like to reiterate my personal commitment and that of the whole Board 
to the continued maintenance of good governance – meaningful, relevant and focused on our business.
Whilst the specific practices and procedures have necessarily changed over the years, Matchtech has followed the same principles 
of governance since I founded the business 30 years ago.
We treat all our stakeholders – candidates, contractors, clients, staff and shareholders – as we ourselves wish to be treated, 
honestly and openly. We are open when things go well – as we believe they usually do – and particularly when they go wrong, 
seeking to resolve them promptly.
Naturally, we have continued to disclose the usual information in the Annual Report and on the Group’s plc website  
www.matchtechgroupplc.com.
However, I would like to mention the topics on which the Board has particularly focused this year.
Continuing to Respond to Increasing Scale and Complexity
The Group has continued to increase significantly in scale. Compared with 5 years ago revenue is twice as high and compared with 
10 years ago it is up more than 5-fold. As I noted last year, in recent years we have seen further complexity with the introduction of 
a multi-brand strategy and operations outside the UK, and since the year end we have acquired Provanis, the second acquisition 
ever made by the Group.
In the context of these rapid changes – and with more expected as part of the Board’s strategy – we have spent time ensuring 
the Group has the Support Services it needs. In particular, we have increased our capabilities in HR and IT, with each now led by 
external appointments made during the year. Our plans are to invest in both these crucial areas over the next year or 2, seeking 
a strong return on our investment. 
Board Evaluation
In my role as Chairman I seek to create a highly effective Board, one which encourages debate and fostering the link between the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and executive management. My aim is to ensure the Board fully engages with the business 
and understands the dynamics of the Group at all levels. 
I continue to believe that the Group benefits from having well-informed, engaged and committed Directors who participate 
in robust and challenging debate. We have continued with a performance review for each Director, which I undertake each year 
and the Deputy Chairman undertook a similar review of me in my role as Chairman. 
In the last couple of years we have strengthened the Board with the appointments of 2 additional Non-Executive Directors,  
Richard Bradford in August 2011 and Rudi Kindts in March 2012. We promoted Keith Lewis to the Board as an Executive Director 
in September 2012. All 3 have made effective contributions. I believe the Board is a well-matched team by experience 
and temperament. 
Looking to the Future 
As shareholders will know, I will be stepping down as Chairman on 2 December 2013 but will remain on the Board in the capacity 
of Deputy Chairman and Nominations Committee Chair.
Since founding Matchtech in 1984 I have worked with some fantastic individuals who have much to be proud of. We now have a 
team of some 400 people, with revenue in excess of £400m. Crucially we have built a strong and deep leadership team and have a 
first class reputation in our chosen markets. Matchtech has always sought to do the best for our clients, contractors and candidates, 
staff and shareholders.
I believe that now is the right time to appoint Brian Wilkinson as the Group’s Executive Chairman. Brian has the external 
perspective and international experience to help accelerate the next stage of our strategic vision.
I commend Brian to you.

Non-Executive Director. Ric Piper, a Non-Executive Director since 2006, will become the Group’s 
inaugural Senior Independent Director.
Corporate Governance – A Key Priority for the Board
The maintenance of effective Corporate Governance is a key priority for the Board. Whilst the Group is not subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) applicable to companies listed on the Official List, the Directors recognise the importance of 
sound Corporate Governance. The Group seeks to comply with the Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies 
as published by the Quoted Companies Alliance, as far as applicable.
In this regard, since the previous year end, a new version of the Guide was published in Spring 2013 by the Quoted Companies 
Alliance. The Board initially reviewed the new version in September 2013 and will be reviewing it again in Spring 2014, as part of 
a review of its Corporate Governance subsequent to the appointment of Brian Wilkinson as Chairman who will join the Group on 
2 December 2013.

There is a vision of what the Group is trying to achieve, over what period and an understanding of 
what is required to achieve this ambition. A dialogue exists between shareholders and the Board, with 
the aim that the Board understands shareholders’ objectives and the shareholders understand the 
Group’s constraints
Eﬃcient Management    
The mechanisms by which important 
decisions are taken are transparent. It is clear 
where the responsibility lies for the 
management of the Group and for the 
achievement of key tasks. Procedures are in 
place to protect signiﬁcant tangible and 
intangible assets and these are regularly 
reviewed and updated
Eﬀective Management      
The Board has the appropriate composition and skills mix which are regularly 
reviewed and it has collective responsibility that requires all Directors to be involved 
in the process of arriving at signiﬁcant decisions. The Board is provided with regular 
appropriate management and ﬁnancial information on which to constructively 
challenge recommendations made to it
Ethical Management        
Behaving ethically, both in the Group’s 
decision making and through the actions of 
our employees, is a must for the Group. Our 
continued success depends on earning, 
keeping the trust of and preserving our 
reputation in the eyes of those we deal with – 
including clients, contractors, employees, 
business partners and the broader 
community
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for their decision which includes strategy, the approval of financial statements and 
shareholder circulars, treasury policy, major capital investments (including acquisitions and disposals) and risk management strategy.
The Board, including Performance Evaluation
The Board is responsible for the Group’s overall direction and management, and for the establishment and maintenance of a framework 
of delegated authorities and controls which ensure the efficient and effective management of the Group’s operations.
To ensure that vested interests should not be able to act in a manner contrary to the common good of all shareholders, at the date 
of this report the Board has 4 Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers the independence of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors annually against the criteria set out in the UK Governance Code with each being determined as independent 
of management having no business or other relationship that could interfere materially with the exercise of their judgement.
Directors are required to notify the Company Secretary of any potential conflicts of interest when they are appointed to the Board and, 
following appointment, as new potential conflicts arise. These notifications are then considered and authorised by the Board as appropriate.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further meetings when required. In addition, Directors meet as members 
of relevant Committees. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically to the Board for decision, delegating specific 
responsibilities to Committees.

The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present at least once a year. The Chairman had 
no other significant commitments in the 2 years ended 31 July 2013.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of Tony Dyer, the Chief Financial Officer, and Neil Ayton, the Company Secretary, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed 
procedure for Directors to obtain independent professional advice, paid for by the Group.
In line with the requirements of the UK Governance Code, which has applied to fully listed companies since 1 April 2011, the Group 
has voluntarily chosen that all Directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and, being eligible, will offer themselves 
for re-election.
The Board is committed to ensuring its effectiveness. It recognises the benefit of performance evaluation of the Board, Directors and 
Board Committees and exercised this during the year.
3 years ago the Board undertook individual Board member leadership profile assessments, and a Board culture survey that involved the 
whole Group management team. The recommendations arising from this process were considered by the Board and appropriate actions 
identified and implemented.
During the year the Chairman undertook performance assessments with each Director and the Deputy Chairman undertook a 
performance assessment of the Chairman. With effect from the year ending 31 July 2014, this will be undertaken annually by the 
Group’s inaugural Senior Independent Director.
The Board is satisfied with the current balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which allows it to exercise objectivity 
in decision making and proper control of the Group’s business. 
The Board recognises that the composition of the Board needs to be kept under regular review. It is anticipated that this will be 
undertaken by the new Chairman prior to the AGM in 2014.
The Board is also satisfied with the performance of each individual Board member and the Board as a whole. Where there are areas for 
improvement the Board has agreed objectives and action plans in place and will continually review progress on these.
Committees of the Board
The Board has three established Committees for Audit, Nominations and Remuneration. The Committees have Terms of Reference which 
are reviewed at least biannually by the Board, and revised as deemed necessary and appropriate. The Terms of Reference of all 3 
Committees were reviewed during the 12 months prior to the date of this report. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available on the 
Group’s website www.matchtechgroupplc.com and on request from the Company Secretary.
Following formal decision making, the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a Standing Committee consisting of any 2 Directors 
to facilitate final sign off for an agreed course of action within strict parameters.
Audit Committee
The responsibilities and operation of the Audit Committee are described in the Audit Committee’s Report.
Remuneration Committee
The responsibilities and operation of the Remuneration Committee are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Corporate Governance Report continued  page 37
MATCHTECH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Nominations Committee has full power and authority to carry 
out a formal selection process of candidates, before proposing 
new appointments to the Board.
The Group has adopted a policy for Directors’ and key employees’ 
share dealings which is appropriate for an AIM-quoted Group. 
The Directors comply with Rule 21 of the AIM rules relating to 
Directors’ dealings and in addition take all reasonable steps to 
ensure compliance by the Group’s applicable employees.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment stating 
their annual fee, their re-election at forthcoming AGMs and that 
their appointment is subject to satisfactory performance. Their 
appointment may be terminated within a maximum of 6 months’ 
written notice at any time.
Copies of the letters of appointment will be available for 
inspection prior to and during the AGM, and are also available for 
inspection at the Group’s registered office during normal business 
hours. The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in 
the Articles of Association, including reviewing the level of fees 
paid by comparator companies.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any meeting at which discussions in respect of matters relating 
to their own position take place. 
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Group’s 
governance framework and ensuring its adequacy and 
effectiveness. Internal controls, which include financial, 
operational and compliance and risk management systems, 
are central to this framework:
•	 The system of internal financial and operational controls 
is designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and aims, 
to facilitate effective and efficient operations, to safeguard 
the Group’s assets, ensure proper accounting records are 
maintained, and ensure that the financial information used 
within the business and for publication is reliable
•	 Such a system of internal control can only be designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement and loss
•	 The Board confirms that there is a continuing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the 
Group, with further improvements planned for the current 
financial year
•	 The Audit Committee and the Board review, at least annually, 
whether an internal audit function is required. Some initial 
internal audit work has been undertaken in the 2012 financial 
year and further work will be undertaken in the current 
financial year
•	 A separate report on principal risks and uncertainties is in the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties section
The Board’s statements and actions emphasise a culture of 
openness, integrity, competence, fairness and responsibility.
The Board focuses mainly on strategic issues, senior management 
and financial performance. The Group Executive concentrates on 
operational performance, operational decision making and the 
formulation of strategic proposals to the Board.
The Board determines how the Chief Executive Officer operates 
within a framework of delegated authorities and reserved powers 
which seek to ensure that certain transactions, significant in terms 
of their size or type, are undertaken only after Board review.
Risk Management Policy
The Group has an overall Risk Management Policy in place, which 
has been communicated to all staff and is continually accessible.
Corporate Policies
The Board has introduced a range of policies for the Group to 
comply with which it constantly monitors, including policies 
on the Bribery Act, Corporate Social Responsibility, Equal 
Opportunities, Disability, Diversity, Health and Safety, Gifts and 
Entertainment and the Environment.
Professional Practices
The Group is a Corporate Member of the Recruitment and 
Employment Confederation (REC). The Group encourages 
all recruitment consultants to become members and actively 
promotes the REC training programme, to ensure that all staff 
are working to the appropriate guidelines.
The Group endeavours to fully comply with the REC Code of 
Ethics, The Employment Agencies Act and Conduct Regulations 
2003 and the REC Code of Professional Practice. The Group has 
achieved REC Audited status, which means systems and processes 
comply with current legislation.
Financial Reporting
The Board approves a business plan and annual budgets 
for individual business units and the Group. The financial 
performance of individual business units is reported regularly. 
We report to our shareholders on a half-yearly basis. Forecasts 
for the Group are updated and reviewed by the Board regularly.
Independent External Audit
Information is provided in the Audit Committee’s Report.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board regards effective communication with shareholders 
as crucial.
Relations with shareholders are managed principally by the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Meetings are 
held regularly throughout the year with institutional investors, 
fund managers and analysts.
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors make themselves available for meetings with major 
shareholders. This provides shareholders with the opportunity 
to take up with these individuals any issue they feel unable to 
raise with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
The Group’s shareholders are invited to attend the AGM at which 
all Directors are present.
The Non-Executive Directors are also kept informed of the views 
of shareholders, with the Executive Directors providing updates 
on investor meetings. Additionally, the Group’s broker provides 
briefings to the Board on shareholder opinions and compiles 
independent feedback from investor meetings.
The Group’s website contains information on current business 
activities, including the annual and half-year results presentations. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Ric Piper qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1977 and is a current member of the Financial Reporting Review Panel (FRRP). 
The Board considers he has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Committee met 5 times during the year. The external auditor attended all of the meetings; and the Committee met privately with 
the external auditor on each occasion.
Operation of the Committee
The Committee’s Terms of Reference were reviewed and updated in September 2013 to conform to current best practice. No significant 
changes were deemed necessary. They are available on the Group’s website (www.matchtechgroupplc.com), as well as in hard copy 
format from the Company Secretary.
The Terms of Reference will be next reviewed by September 2015.
The main activities of the Committee during the year were as follows:
•	 Financial statements. The Committee reviewed the interim and full year financial statements. Presentations were made by 
management and the auditor about the key technical and judgemental matters relevant to the financial statements. The Committee 
was satisfied that it was appropriate for the Board to approve the financial statements
•	 Internal financial control systems. The Committee reviewed the recommendations made by the independent auditor and 
management’s responses and actions. The Committee was satisfied that it was appropriate for the Board to make the statements 
regarding internal controls included in the Corporate Governance Report
•	 Internal audit. During the year the Group undertook a number of internal audit reviews, both of financial and operational activities. 
As part of the Committee’s policy, certain specialist internal audit work was undertaken by external organisations
•	 As anticipated last year, the Committee has given greater focus to internal audit in Financial Year 2013
The Chairman of the Committee reported to the Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting, identifying relevant matters 
requiring communication to the Board and recommendations on the steps to be taken.
Independent Auditor
The appointment of the independent external auditor is approved by shareholders annually. The independent auditor’s audit of the 
financial statements is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, ISA (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board.
There are no contractual obligations that act to restrict the Committee’s choice of external auditor.
In early 2011 the Board (on the recommendation of the Audit Committee) decided that it was appropriate to put the Group’s audit out 
to competitive tender. In March 2011 the Audit Committee proposed and the Board approved the appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as the 
Company’s registered independent public accounting firm commencing with audit work for the year ending 31 July 2011.
The Committee has kept under review future regulatory and best practice developments in connection with its role and responsibilities. 
In particular, it has considered the requirements under the 2012 UK Governance Code for the independent audit contract to be put out 
to tender every 10 years. The Committee will keep this matter under regular review in the light of best practice developments. Any 
recommendation for the reappointment of the independent auditor will continue to be the subject of rigorous review each year.
KPMG Audit Plc has instigated an orderly wind down of business. The Committee has recommended to the Board that KPMG LLP be 
appointed as independent auditor of the Company.
Audit Committee’s Report  page 39
MATCHTECH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The independent auditor provides the following services:
•	 A report to the Audit Committee giving an overview of the results, significant contracts and judgements and observations on the 
control environment
•	 An opinion on the truth and fairness of the Group and Company financial statements
•	 An internal control report, following its audit, highlighting to management any areas of weakness or concern
The Audit Committee monitors the cost-effectiveness of audit and non-audit work performed by the independent auditor and 
also considers the potential impact, if any, of this work on independence. Approval is required prior to the independent auditor 
commencing any material non-audit work in accordance with a Group policy approved by the Committee. Certain work, such 
as providing bookkeeping services, is prohibited. Further, the Committee seeks positive evidence of the independence of the 
independent auditor through its challenge to management.
The Audit Committee also regulates the appointment of former employees of the independent auditor to positions in the Group.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews all fees for non-audit work paid to the independent auditor. Details of these fees can be found 
in Note 3 to the financial statements. The Committee concluded that the level of non-audit fees, which represent 43% of the audit fees 
for the Group, did not have a negative impact on KPMG Audit Plc’s independence.
The independent external auditor also operates procedures designed to safeguard their objectivity and independence. 
These include the periodic rotation of audit partner, use of independent concurring partners, use of a technical review panel 
(where appropriate) and annual independence confirmations by all staff.
The independent external auditor reports to the Committee on matters including independence and non-audit work on an annual basis.
Evaluation of the Committee
In 2012 an independent evaluation of the Committee was undertaken by the Group’s auditors who reported to the Chairman of the 
Board and subsequently issued their report to the whole Board.
As noted above, the Committee has implemented the recommendation to give greater focus to internal audit.
The Board and the Audit Committee continue to work on implementing the recommendations of the report, particularly additional 
members and the induction of new members.
Approval
This report was approved by the Committee, on behalf of the Board, on the date shown below and signed on its behalf by:

The Group has a Remuneration Committee which is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for developing 
remuneration policy. As Matchtech Group plc is an AIM-listed company rather than a fully listed 
company, it is not required to disclose all the information in the Remuneration Committee Report, 
but the Board has chosen to do so as a voluntary disclosure.
As such, the Auditor is not required to and has not, except where indicated, audited the information included in the Remuneration 
Committee Report. The audited information meets the requirements of the changes to the AIM Rule 19, effective February 2010. 
The Company’s statement on remuneration policy is set out together with details of the remuneration of each Director.

Stephen Burke and Ric Piper have both been members of the Remuneration Committee since 2006 and Rudi Kindts since 2012.
The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice a year. The Chairman of the Board attends the meetings as required, except when 
his own remuneration is under consideration.
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to review, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration policy for the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and other senior management, and to determine the level of remuneration, incentives and other benefits, compensation 
payments and the terms of employment of the Executive plc Directors and other senior executives. It seeks to provide a remuneration 
package that aligns the interests of Executive Directors with that of the shareholders.
It receives advice from independent remuneration consultants and makes comparisons with similar organisations. In 2013 advice was 
received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
The Committee has continued to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors with regard to the need to maintain a balance 
between the constituent elements of salary, incentives and other benefits. 
No Directors, other than the members of the Remuneration Committee, provided material advice to the Committee on 
Directors’ remuneration.
During the year and since the year end the Committee reviewed the way in which it operates and has implemented a number 
of changes which will contribute to a higher level of effectiveness.
Remuneration Policy
The objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy are to attract, retain and incentivise management with the appropriate professional, 
managerial and technological expertise to realise the Group’s business objectives, and align their interests with those of shareholders. 
The Group strives to link payment to performance and thereby create a performance culture.
It is the Group’s policy that all Executive Directors’ service contracts contain a 6-month notice period.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment stating their annual fee, and that their appointment is subject to satisfactory 
performance and their re-election at forthcoming Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Their appointment may be terminated within 
a maximum of 6 months’ written notice at any time.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
of the bonus or share option schemes.
The remuneration agreed by the Committee for the Executive Directors is outlined in the following sections.
Base Salary and Benefits
The Committee establishes salaries and benefits by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for Executive 
Directors of companies of comparable status and market value, taking into account the range of incentives described elsewhere in this 
report, including a performance-based commission and performance bonus. Reviews of such base salary and benefits are conducted 
annually by the Committee.

The baseline profit for the year was £8.0m.

Pension
The Group contributes 10% of Adrian Gunn’s, Tony Dyer’s and Keith Lewis’s basic salaries into a group personal pension plan.
Value Creation Plan (VCP)
As announced on 21 November 2011, the Group has implemented and made awards to Directors under a VCP.
The VCP was approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting on 18 November 2011.
The following Directors have been conditionally granted an award of units under the VCP:
Name Position
Number of 
VCP units 
Percentage of total 
number of VCP units 
allocated and  
to be allocated 
Adrian Gunn Chief Executive 266,000 26.6%
Tony Dyer Chief Financial Officer 145,000 14.5%
Keith Lewis Matchtech Managing Director 145,000 14.5%
Other senior management 248,000 24.8%
Unallocated 196,000 19.6%
No payment has been made for the grant of these awards and the VCP units have no value at grant.
The VCP has a 5 year performance period (ending after the preliminary announcement of the Group’s results in 2016) and the VCP units 
entitle the Directors to share in 7.5% of the total value created for shareholders in excess of an annual hurdle at a series of 
measurement dates.
The level of value created for Matchtech shareholders will be determined by reference to the appreciation in the Company’s share price, 
the amount of dividends paid and share buy backs. The shareholder value created at each measurement date will be calculated using 
the average share price over the 30 day period prior to the relevant measurement date, the measurement date being 30 days after the 
preliminary announcement of the Group’s results. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
page 42
The annual hurdle will be the higher of:
•	 the actual share price at the previous measurement date; and
•	 20% growth over the threshold price from the previous measurement date.
The initial price is 218 pence per Matchtech share, being the average share price of Matchtech shares for the 30 day period following 
the preliminary announcement of the Company’s 2011 final results. 
The first threshold price, for the year ended 31 July 2012 was 261.6 pence (218 pence plus by 20%) which was not exceeded, with the 
measurement share price being 307 pence. The second threshold price, for the year ended 31 July 2013, was 313.9 pence (261.6 pence 
plus 20%). 
At each measurement date each Director will receive an entitlement to Matchtech shares (in the form of a nil-cost option) with a value 
equivalent to each Director’s relevant proportion of the VCP pool created in respect of that measurement date. Any share entitlement 
will not become exercisable until the end of the fifth year of the VCP when 50% of the shares are exercisable, with the balance 
exercisable 1 year later.
Share Options Conditional on Performance
During the year the Group operated a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) for Executive Directors 
and key staff.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The plc Executive Directors receive an annual grant of zero-priced share options. The grant for the year, made on 31 January 2013, 
(2013 LTIP) was 25,000 shares for the Chief Executive Officer and 16,000 shares each for the Chief Financial Officer and Matchtech 
Managing Director.
This award will be capable of release subject to the Director remaining employed until the expiry of the holding period date set out, 
and the satisfaction of the following performance targets.
Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth
The number of shares which shall be capable of release at the end of the holding period for each unlapsed grant shall be in accordance 
with the following table, subject to the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Underpin being satisfied:

Under the scheme, staff are entitled to buy shares in Matchtech Group plc out of pre-tax salary. They can invest up to a maximum 
of £1,500 per annum, which will be used to purchase Matchtech Group shares (‘Invest shares’).
The Group will award 1 free share for every share that is purchased (Match shares). Staff will receive Match shares at the end of 
a 3 year holding period, subject to remaining employed within the Group and the Invest shares remaining in the plan throughout 
the holding period.
At 31 July 2013, the following shares were held in the scheme by the Executive Directors:

We have audited the financial statements of Matchtech Group plc

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and, in respect of the separate opinion in relation to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and reporting on corporate 
governance, on terms that have been agreed. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
Auditor’s Report and, in respect of the separate opinion in relation 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Report and reporting on corporate 
governance, those matters that we have agreed to state to them 
in our report, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 32, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, 
and express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Opinion on Financial Statements

of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 July 
2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are Required to Report by Exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 and under the terms of our 
engagement we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
•	 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which we were engaged to 
audit are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or

Matchtech Group plc is a human capital resources business dealing with contract and permanent recruitment in the Private and Public 
Sectors. The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Group’s address is: Matchtech Group plc, 1450 Parkway, Whiteley, 
Fareham PO15 7AF.
ii Basis of Preparation of the Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (EU) and which are effective at 31 July 2013.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have been applied 
consistently throughout both the Group and the Company for the purposes of preparation of these financial statements. A summary 
of the principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below.
iii Going concern
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and budgets for the coming year, which have been drawn up with appropriate regard for 
the current macroeconomic environment and the particular circumstances in which the Group operates. These were prepared with 
reference to historic and current industry knowledge, taking future strategy of the Group into account. As a result, at the time of 
approving the financial statements, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group have sufficient resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the 
preparation of the financial statements. As with all business forecasts, the Directors cannot guarantee that the going concern basis 
will remain appropriate given the inherent uncertainty about future events.
iv New standards and interpretations
New standards and amendments to existing standards applicable for the period ending 31 July 2013 are:
IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation
The adoption of the above standard has had no impact on the financial statements. Specifically, there was no impact on the Statement 
of Financial Position in the current or prior periods, and as such an additional comparative Statement of Financial Position has not 
been included.
New standards in issue, not yet effective
The following relevant Standards and Interpretations, which are new and yet to become mandatory, have not been applied in the Group 
financial statements.
Standard
E ffec t ive 	 date
(Annual periods 
beginning on or after)
IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2014
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014
IFRS improvements Various Various
Based on the Group’s current business model and accounting policies, the Directors do not expect material impacts on the figures 
in the Group’s financial statements when the interpretations become effective.
The Group does not intend to apply any of these pronouncements early.
v Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the Statement 
of Financial Position date. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has power to control the financial and operating policies 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all 
identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not 
they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of 
the subsidiary are included in the Group Statement of Financial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for 
subsequent measurement in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
vi Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for services provided, 
excluding VAT and trade discounts. Revenue on temporary placements is recognised upon receipt of a client approved timesheet 
or equivalent. Revenue from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidate’s remuneration package, is 
recognised when candidates commence employment at which point it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will be transferred. Other fees are recognised on completion of work performed in accordance with client agreements. 
Fees for the provision of engineering services are recognised on completion of work performed in accordance with customer contracts.

MATCHTECH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
vii Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset. Depreciation is charged per annum as follows:
Motor vehicles 25.0% Reducing balance
Computer equipment 25.0% Straight-line
Office equipment 12.5% Straight-line
Leasehold improvements Over the period of the lease term
Residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.
viii Intangible assets
Separately acquired software licences are included at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of that 
asset at 20%–50%. 
Other intangible assets are included at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of that asset.
Provision is made against the carrying value of intangible assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred. 
Amortisation is recognised in the Income Statement under administrative expenses.
ix Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
x Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are 
spread over the term of the lease.
xi Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on 
the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on 
the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business 
combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted 
or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if these temporary differences can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Income Statement, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as share-based payments) in which case the related deferred tax 
is also charged or credited directly to equity.
xii Pension costs
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Company. The annual contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as they accrue.
xiii Share-based payments
The transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 have been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were 
unvested at 1 August 2006. All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in the Income Statement with a 
corresponding credit to ‘share-based payment reserve’. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based 
remuneration are measured at their fair values. Fair values of employee services are indirectly determined by reference to the fair value 
of the share options awarded. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that 
the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised 
in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are 
different to that estimated on vesting. Upon exercise of share options, proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital and share premium. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
page 54
1 The Group and Company significant accounting policies continued
The Company is the granting and settling entity in the Group share-based payment arrangement where share options are granted to 
employees of its subsidiary companies. The Company recognises the share-based payment expense as an increase in the investment 
in subsidiary undertakings.
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) which is HMRC approved, and enables employees to purchase Company shares out 
of pre-tax salary. For each share purchased the Company grants an additional share at no cost to the employee. The expense in relation 
to these ‘free’ shares is recorded as employee remuneration and measured at fair value of the shares issued as at the date of grant.
xiv Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 August 2006.
Accordingly the classification of the combination (merger) remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP. Assets and liabilities 
are recognised at date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP carrying amount 
immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement. Deferred tax is adjusted for 
the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional provisions.
xv Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
In the Company financial statements, investment in the subsidiary Company is measured at cost, and provision made where an 
impairment value is deemed to have occurred.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at 
amortised cost using effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal 
of impairment is recognised in the Income Statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset expire or the financial asset is 
transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash 
flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset but assumes 
a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition 
if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Trade receivables subject to the invoice discounting facility are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position until they are settled 
by the customer. The Group is responsible for collection of trade receivables and undertakes the risks and rewards until they are settled 
by the customer.
xvi Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument and comprise trade and other payables and bank loans. Financial liabilities are recorded 
initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled 
or expires.
xvii Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits, bank overdrafts and working capital facility.
xviii Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other short-term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are 
approved in general meeting prior to the Statement of Financial Position date.
xix Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Non-monetary 
items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those 
at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. 
Notes continued

MATCHTECH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Statement 
of Financial Position date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to ‘Translation of foreign operations’ in equity. On disposal of a foreign 
operation the cumulative translation differences are transferred to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance on the cumulative translation adjustment on retranslation of subsidiaries’ net assets has been set 
to zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
x x Equity
Equity comprises the following:
•	 ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares.
•	 ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses 
of the share issue.
•	 ‘Share-based payment reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are 
exercised.
•	 ‘Merger reserve’ represents the equity balance arising on the merger of Matchtech Engineering Limited and Matchmaker 
Personnel Limited.
•	 ‘Translation of foreign operations’ represents the foreign currency differences arising on translating foreign operations into the 
presentational currency of the Group.
•	 ‘Retained earnings’ represents retained profits.
x xi Significant accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect 
the application of the Group’s accounting policies, reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made. 
They are assessed on an ongoing basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical judgements
The judgements made which, in the opinion of the Directors, are critical in drawing up the financial statements are as follows:
Invoice Discounting Facility
The terms of this arrangement are judged to be such that the risk and rewards of ownership of the trade receivables do not pass to the 
finance provider. As such the receivables are not derecognised on drawdown of funds against this facility. This facility is recognised 
as a liability for the amount drawn.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date 
are discussed below. These are included for completeness, although it is the Directors’ view that none of these have significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment
The cost of equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis and the cost of motor vehicles is depreciated on a reducing balance basis 
over their useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of property, plant and equipment to be within 2 to 8 years. These are 
common life expectancies applied in the industry in which the Group operates. Changes in the expected level of usage and 
technological development could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future 
depreciation charges could be revised.
Impairment Loss of Trade and Other Receivables
The Group’s policy for doubtful receivables is based on the ongoing evaluation of the collectability and ageing analysis of the trade and 
other receivables and on management’s judgements. Considerable judgement is required in assessing the ultimate realisation of these 
receivables, including the current creditworthiness and the past collection history of each debtor. If the financial conditions of the 
Group’s receivables were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional impairment loss 
of trade and other receivables may be required. The carrying amounts of these assets are shown in Note 14.
Share-based payments
The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values of options granted to employees under IFRS 2 are detailed under Note 19. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Future tax rate changes
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and to 23% (effective 1 April 2013) 
were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) 
and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 31 July 2013 has been calculated using a UK 
corporation tax rate of 20%.
9 Earnings per share
Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the consolidated profit after taxation attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the same basis as above, except that the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares (arising from the Group’s share option 
schemes) into ordinary shares has been added to the denominator. There are no changes to the profit (numerator) as a result of 
the dilutive calculation. The number of dilutive shares has increased due to the issue of new share options in the current year.
The earnings per share information has been calculated as follows:

The amounts due from Group undertakings in the Company Statement of Financial Position are considered to approximate to fair value.
Days sales outstanding at the year end based upon the preceding 3 months’ revenue were 48.9 days (2012: 49.6 days). The allowance 
for doubtful debts has been determined by reference to previous experience and management assessment of debts.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £6,037,000 (2012: £7,357,000) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the Directors do not believe there has been a significant change 
in credit quality and consider the amounts to be recoverable in full. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Group uses a third party credit scoring system to assess the creditworthiness of potential new customers before accepting them. 
Credit limits are defined by customer based on this information. All customer accounts are subject to review on a regular basis by senior 
management and actions are taken to address debt ageing issues.
The Directors believe that there is no requirement for further provision over and above the allowance for doubtful debts.

In addition to the share option schemes the Group operated a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which is an HMRC approved plan available to all 
employees enabling them to purchase shares out of pre-tax salary. For each share purchased the Company grants an additional share at no cost.
The fair values of the share options and the SIPS are included in the table below. The values of the LTIPS granted in the year were calculated 
using the Monte Carlo simulation method along with the assumptions as detailed below. The values of the zero price options granted in the 
year were calculated using the Black-Scholes method along with the assumptions as detailed below. The fair values of the SIPS and Deferred 
Bonus Shares were calculated as the market values on the date of the grant adjusted for the assumptions as detailed below.

The volatility of the Company’s share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of the annualised standard deviations of 
daily continuously compounded returns on the Company’s stock, calculated over 5 years back from the date of grant, where applicable. 
The risk-free rate is the yield to maturity on the date of grant of a UK Gilt Strip, with term to maturity equal to the life of the option. 
LTIP awards are subject to a TSR test. This ‘market’ based condition is taken into account in the date of grant fair calculation. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Borrowing facilities
The Group makes use of a working capital facility, details of which can be found in Note 17. The undrawn facility available at 31 July 2013 
in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met was as follows:
Group
2013 
£’000 
2012 
£’000 
Expiring in 1 to 5 years 38,625  34,927 
The working capital facility of £50m is committed until June 2015.
The Directors have calculated that the effect on profit of a 1% movement in interest rates would be £292,000.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of borrowings approximates to their fair value.
Net foreign currency monetary assets are shown below:
Group
2013

has not been included.

The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure, ie equity and financial liabilities. The Group 
manages the capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and risk characteristics of the 
underlying assets. Capital for the reporting period under review is summarised as follows:

23 Subsequent events
On 5 September 2013 the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Application Services Limited, trading as Provanis, 
a niche technology recruitment business for a total cash consideration of £4m funded from the Group’s existing lending facility. 
Provanis is a technology recruitment business which will complement the Group’s newly rebranded technology business, Connectus.
An exercise to determine the fair value of the net assets and any contingent liabilities acquired is ongoing at the time of authorising 
the Group financial statements.
On 20 September 2013, the Group placed 1,050,000 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each at a price of 405 pence, raising £4m cash. 
The proceeds of the placing were used to repay the drawdown on the Group’s existing lending facility which was used to fund the 
acquisition of Provanis. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

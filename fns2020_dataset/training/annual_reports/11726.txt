ABOUT 
THIS REPORT
Pan African Resources is incorporated in England and Wales 
and with a corporate office in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
The company is dual listed on AIM and the JSE. See Who We 
Are on page 6.
This is Pan African Resources’ second Integrated Annual 
Report and a further step in the process towards full 
integrated reporting. We seek to present to shareholders a 
holistic overview of the company’s financial and non-financial 
performance for the period 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, 
including the activities of the holding company Pan African 
Resources and all of its South African operations and 
subsidiaries. The report is a reflection of our aspiration to 
adhere to the highest possible standards in all endeavours, 
including reporting to stakeholders.
No non-financial KPIs are included for the company’s 
investment in the Australian-listed Auroch. Disclosure in this 
regard is limited to financial information. Further information 
concerning Auroch is available at www.aurochminerals.com.
Evander Mines’ financial and non-financial KPIs are included for 
the full year following its acquisition by Pan African Resources 
in March 2013.
All of the group’s subsidiaries are incorporated in South Africa 
and their functional currency is ZAR. The group’s business is 
conducted in ZAR and the accounting records are maintained 
in this same currency, with the exception of precious metal 
product sales, which are conducted in USD prior to conversion 
into ZAR. The ongoing review of the results of operations 
conducted by executive management and the board is also 
performed in ZAR.
The report includes abbreviations and terms which have been 
defined in the glossary on page 166.

ABOUT THIS 
REPORT
PROCESS FOR DEFINING 
Report content 
We have considered and applied many of the recommendations 
contained in the International Integrated Reporting Framework 
issued in December 2013.
In compiling this report the EXCO attended a workshop, 
facilitated by an external consultant, where group strategy, 
stakeholder engagement, key risks and material issues (as well 
as other related matters) were analysed.
We have elected to focus in this report on key risks, rather 
than separate material issues. Our prevailing focus, irrespective 
of terminology, remains those issues that materially impact our 
ability to create and sustain value over the short, medium and 
long-term and those issues and groups on which the company 
materially impacts in the course of doing business, as well as 
how these have been integrated into business strategy.
Further, the report has been prepared in line with the LSE’s AIM 
Rules and the JSE’s Listings Requirements. We have also applied 
the majority of principles in the King III Repor t with an explanation 
for any not so applied, and the UK Code has been taken into 
consideration. The report was further prepared based on GRI 
principles and guidance (GRI G3.1 standard disclosure guidelines 
and the Mining and Metals Sector Disclosure guidelines) – the  
Pan African Resources’ Sustainability Report is compiled based 
on a self-declared Application Level B.
The annual financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides 
as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and the 
requirements of the South African Companies Act and the 
UK Companies Act 2006.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
This report represents one of three elements of Pan African 
Resources’ 2014 financial year communication strategy with 
stakeholders, the other two being:
Pan African Resources’ Sustainability Report, containing 
additional non-financial disclosures referencing GRI; and
Pan African Resources’ Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Report, which provides detailed technical information on the 
mineral assets of Pan African Resources in compliance with the 
SAMREC Code.
The above documents, together with this 2014 Integrated 
Annual Report, are available at (www.panafricanresources.com). 
Printed copies can be requested from the company secretary, 
whose details appear on page 176.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this report, other than historical facts, that 
address without limitation exploration activities, mining 
potential and future plans and objectives of Pan African 
Resources are forward-looking statements and forward-
looking information that involve various risks, assumptions and 
uncertainties and are not statements of fact. The directors and 
management of Pan African Resources are of the belief that the 
expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements 
or forward-looking information are based on reasonable 
assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections. 
However, such statements should not be construed as being

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ

economic, business and financial market conditions; political 
risks; industry trends; competition; changes in government 
regulations; delays in obtaining governmental approvals; 
interest rate fluctuations; currency fluctuations; changes in 
business strategy or development plans; and other risks.
Although Pan African Resources has attempted to identify 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to 
be as anticipated, estimated or intended.
Pan African Resources is not obliged to publically update any 
forward-looking statements that are included in this report, 
or revise any changes in events, conditions or circumstances 
on which any such statements are based, occurring after the 
publication date of this report other than required by regulation.

Stakeholder Growth Profitable Sustainable 24 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
CHAIRMAN’S
REPORT
The 2014 financial year was a challenging one for the gold 
industry. It recorded the first annual decline in the gold price 
in 13 years. However, Pan African Resources remains well 
positioned in relation to its peers in adapting to this and 
responded quickly to volatile markets.
With the acquisition of Evander Mines, the group has evolved 
rapidly to become a larger operator and producer and can 
now certainly be classified as an African-focused mid-tier 
precious metals miner. The addition of Evander Mines in 
2013 has diversified the group from the previous single asset 
business model and in so doing, reduced operating risk. The 
Evander Mines operations have been successfully integrated 
into the group and the newly commissioned BTRP became fully 
operational during the year. The group’s total gold output for 
the year increased to 188,179oz (2013: 130,493oz), of which 
Evander Mines contributed 76,556oz.
In addition, the board established the following priorities for the 
year under review: strengthening our board and management 
team, enhancing our governance structure, and driving an 
intense focus on mining sustainably. I am pleased to report we 
have made solid progress in all of these areas.
Management changes
We implemented numerous board level changes in the year, 
most notably the appointment of Ron Holding as CEO. Ron was 
previously Pan African Resources’ Joint Interim CEO and prior 
to that, closely involved with the group’s operations as COO. 
Ron’s highly experienced record has seen him occupy a number 
of senior positions across the various stages of developing 
and mining gold and platinum mineral deposits. He is a 
seasoned operator, with deep technical and executive skills 
and a proven track-record of delivering the full potential from 
operations under his direction. His appointment has significantly 
strengthened the company’s market position and will help drive 
further growth in the year ahead.
In addition, Cobus Loots was appointed FD after holding the 
position of Joint Interim CEO with Ron. Cobus has been a 
Pan African Resources’ director since 2009, having previously 
held the position of managing director of Shanduka. Busi Sitole 
resigned as FD with effect from 30 September 2013. I would like 
to thank Busi for her contribution to the company and wish her 
the best in her future endeavours.
With the acquisition of Evander 
Mines, the group has evolved rapidly 
to become a larger operator and 
producer and can now certainly be 
classified as an African-focused 
mid-tier precious metals miner.

Governance
Pan African Resources is committed to the highest standards 
of governance. We are pleased to have appointed Thabo 
Mosololi as a non-executive director in the year, reinforcing 
the independence of the board. He brings with him a wealth of 
experience in governance and audit. We also recently appointed 
Rowan Smith as an independent non-executive director. He was 
previously managing director of Shanduka and has more than 
20 years’ experience in the minerals and investment banking 
industries. His appointment will further strengthen the technical 
and commercial expertise available to our board.
Rob Still resigned as an independent non-executive director 
on 1 July 2014, after serving on the board for 10 years. I thank 
Rob for his invaluable contribution to Pan African Resources’ 
journey of growth from a junior exploration company to a mid-
tier miner.
Financial results
Both Pan African Resources’ earnings and headline earnings 
declined in the year under review. Although this decline was 
generally attributable to factors outside of our control, such as 
the low grade mining cycle at Evander Mines and gold prices, 
we are aware that shareholders require a return on investment 
even over the short term. The new dividend policy (refer to 
page 125) and attractive dividend recommended by the board 
demonstrates our confidence in Pan African Resources’ business 
going forward.
Mining sustainably
While the pervasive local labour unrest continues to pose a 
significant risk in our industry, we are proud to report that we did 
not experience significant disruptions at our operations during 
the year under review. Despite our best efforts, we believe that 
the labour environment in South Africa will be challenging for 
some time yet, and as such, all parties have to cooperate in 
order to ensure the sustainability of our industry in the future. 
We are committed to maintaining our good relationships with 
the unions by continually adopting a proactive, consultative, 
open-door approach.
More than 10 years ago the South African government set formal 
targets for social development and community upliftment as 
encapsulated in the Mining Charter. With 2014 marking a decade 
since the charter’s inception, the government expectation is for 
mining companies to now reach full compliance. We continue to 
strive to meet and also exceed these targets.
A key target of the Mining Charter includes the conversion 
of all hostels into family units as part of a larger scheme 
of improving living conditions for mineworkers. We have 
committed substantial investment to an extensive improvement 
programme in this regard, upgrading and converting old hostels 
into single accommodation and family units at Evander Mines. 
In line with the Mining Charter, Barberton Mines recruits only 
from its local region, an area with high unemployment, which 
sees the majority of its employees living off-mine.
We are committed to eliminating or minimising the negative 
impacts of our operations and continuously look to improve 
our environmental performance. To this end environmental 
management is well integrated into management practices. 
In terms of our long-term environmental obligations, 
environmental plans at the mines are compliant with presiding 
regulatory requirements. Provisions in this regard are based on 
the net present value of the estimated cost of restoring the 
environmental disturbance. The estimated cost of rehabilitation 
is reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate for changes in 
legislation or technology. We are also constantly rehabilitating 
old mining areas, and reducing final closure costs in this manner.
At Pan African Resources we strongly believe that our employees 
and communities should benefit from our mining activities, and 
we continue to undertake a number of community projects 
with the goal that they become fully sustainable organisations in 
their own right over time.
Please see our Sustainability Report on our website  
(www.panafricanresources.com) for further detail on our efforts in this 
regard.
Outlook
Looking forward to 2015, we expect to see further 
improvements in our business as we continue to drive 
efficiencies and streamline our activities. Specifically, 2015 will 
see the commissioning of the ETRP at Evander Mines in the third 
quarter of the financial year and in the second half it will exit the 
current low grade mining cycle. I am confident that the company 
has the team and resources in place to continue on a path of 
operational excellence.
Thank you
I would like to thank my fellow board members for their 
guidance and insight during the year. Thank you as well to our 
shareholders, our employees, all business partners and the 
industry regulators for your ongoing support of Pan African 
Resources.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S
REPORT
Year in review
I am pleased to report that we have delivered on our strategic 
priorities for the year under review. Despite challenges 
(on which I will elaborate further in this report), Pan African 
Resources’ quality assets and dedicated, experienced staff and 
management have again delivered returns for shareholders. 
These returns can be measured in profits, but also importantly 
in another attractive dividend to shareholders. This dividend, 
and also our new policy to pay a progressive annual dividend 
(refer to page 125), demonstrates the board’s confidence in  
Pan African Resources’ operations, our people, and our ability 
to continue to deliver and improve results.
We have made good progress towards solidifying our position 
as an African-focussed mid-tier precious metals miner. 
Our annual revenue was up by 41.2% and gold production up 
by 44.2%. Evander Mines is now fully integrated and part of the 
group. At Barberton Mines, the BTRP became fully operational 
and has been delivering ounces at above the originally 
planned margin.
Nonetheless, we continued to see a challenging macro-
environment during the year, and our results and margins were 
impacted by the continued weakness in precious metals prices 
as well as inflationary and other cost pressures in South Africa. 
In addition and as anticipated, at Evander Mines, mining in lower 
grade areas also had a significant adverse impact on our financial 
results. We are actively implementing a number of measures to 
mitigate the impact of this lower grade mining cycle. Measures 
implemented, or in progress, to mitigate the impact of the 
current low grade cycle at Evander Mines include the following:
 The construction of the ETRP to yield an estimated 10,000oz 
of gold per annum with a LOM of 17 years. The ETRP project 
is progressing well and expected to be in production by 
January 2015.
 Surface sources throughput in the Evander Mines’ plant has 
been increased from 18,000t per month to approximately 
30,000t per month. To maintain these tonnages for the full 
2015 financial year, additional sources are being investigated.
 Vamping (the mining of historical “leftovers” remaining after 
previous mining operations) at Evander Mines No. 7 Shaft 
has been expanded to include the 15 level return airway mud 
accumulation project. This has been contributing additional 
ounces from July 2014.
 Management is concentrating efforts to increase availability 
of conveyor belts in the Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft declines. 
A refurbishment programme has been implemented to effect 
the necessary mechanical improvements and upgrades.
Pan African Resources’ quality 
assets and dedicated, experienced 
staff and management have again 
delivered returns for shareholders. 27
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
 Management has rescheduled the mine planning and 
improved mining flexibility by increasing development rates 
on 25 and 25A levels at Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft to access 
more stoping areas.
Through focussed initiatives, exploration and planning at our 
operations, we have positively enhanced these valuable assets’ 
respective LOMs:
 Barberton Mines’ LOM increased to 19 years (2013: 17 years) 
due to exploration ounces added at Fairview Mine and 
Sheba Mine;
 BTRP’s LOM has been increased to 15 years (2013: 12 years) 
by remodelling the tonnages at the Harper South dam 
and converting the Consort and Sheba tailings dams into 
a probable Mineral Reserve;
 Evander Mines’ LOM was increased to 17 years (2013: 
14 years) as a result of including the mining area between 
25 and 26 levels at Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft, not previously 
in the LOM plan – now termed the Decline Extension project. 
A robust mine design was considered in order to convert the 
Mineral Resource into a Mineral Reserve;
 ETRP has established a LOM of 17 years (aligning with the life 
of No. 8 Shaft) and will exploit the slimes on Kinross tailings 
dams; and
 Phoenix Platinum’s LOM has increased to 28 years (2013: 
20 years).
Strategy
In the year under review we made good progress in targeting 
high margins at a low cost. This is borne out by the highly 
cost-effective BTRP operation, the construction of the ETRP 
at Evander Mines and a potentially larger successor plant – the 
Elikhulu Project (see ’Looking ahead’ below).
The LOM at Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft has been increased 
by extending the decline system down to 26 level (the Decline 
Extension project) to access the resources between 25 and 
26 level, which will also alleviate mining flexibility constraints by 
creating additional stoping areas.
Our strong balance sheet and well-established cash-generative 
operations are key differentiators from our peers. These 
provide Pan African Resources with a competitive advantage 
to further growth (through our operations and organic project 
pipeline) and also position the group to capitalise on potential 
acquisition opportunities. In the year ahead we will focus on 
maintaining our statement of financial position, while also 
seeking new opportunities to create value for shareholders. 
We plan to continue rewarding shareholders through dividends.
Health and safety
Our commitment to safety remains at the heart of our culture 
and is evident in the way we operate and manage the group. 
It was with great sadness that we experienced four fatalities in the 
group during the year.  We extend our deepest condolences to 
the families, friends and colleagues of the deceased. In an effort to 
prevent a recurrence the group continues to focus on safety. We 
have implemented corrective actions to as far as possible prevent 
any further recurrences. Further detail in this regard can be found in 
our Sustainability Report on our website (www.panafricanresources.com).
Performance
Our flagship asset, Barberton Mines, continues to underpin 
the group’s performance with high-margin underground 
production. It remains one of the lowest cost mines in South 
Africa. The BTRP was completed in 2013 on schedule and on 
budget. It supports Barberton Mines as a long life, low cost gold 
producer. The BTRP has increased efficiencies and further dilutes 
the costs at the mine as a whole. The plant became operational 
at the beginning of the year in review and has already achieved 
its targets. At year-end it was producing gold at an all-in cost of 

At Barberton Mines, the successful commissioning of the BTRP 
assisted in offsetting a reduction in underground production 
which occurred when the Sheba Mine lost a month’s production 
due to flooding caused by excessively high rainfall (just on 
200mm in 10 hours) during March 2014, as well as a temporary 
technical setback at the central BIOX
®
 plant.
During the year Barberton Mines’ wage costs increased in 
excess of inflation in line with our two-year wage agreement 
with NUM. Labour and staff costs were further impacted by 
the introduction of a medical aid scheme for Barberton Mines’ 
employees. Salaries and wages represent the greatest single cost 
at Barberton Mines at 44.7% (2013: 48.5%) of total production 
costs. These necessary increases and initiatives reflect our 
commitment to our people and our social obligations.
Evander Mines is performing as anticipated and contributed 
to the group for the full year as opposed to four months’ 
contribution in the prior year. As planned the mine is 
currently operating in a low grade mining cycle that is 
impacting underground gold production and cash unit costs. 
We expect this cycle to continue until February 2015 where 
after mining will gradually move into the high grade cycle 
by August 2015. To compensate for the lower grade cycle 
we have increased tonnages from surface sources, targeted 
additional vamping areas at No. 7 Shaft and are recovering gold 
from the Kinross plant mill floor. During the year the board 
approved the necessary capital expenditure for construction 
of the ETRP, through the refurbishment of dormant sections 
of the existing Kinross metallurgical plant, to recover gold from 
the retreatment of gold tailings. This is envisaged to increase 
Evander Mines’ gold production by up to 10,000oz per annum 

At our CTRP Phoenix Platinum’s performance improved during 
the year and the operation saw its first year of profitability. Plant 
recovery rates increased to 29% during the year (2013: 21%). 
This was achieved through adjusting the reagent suite in the 
extraction process to deal with variable feed sources. 28 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
Finally, the depreciation of the ZAR against the USD, and 
good control of aggregate and unit costs in ZAR terms, 


in capital expenditure spent on the BTRP even though Evander 
Mines’ gold production declined as result of the low grade 
mining cycle.
Financial performance
Group revenue year-on-year increased by 41.2% to 
ZAR2,608.8 million (2013: ZAR1,848.1 million). In terms of costs, 
the total cost of production was up 82.3% to ZAR1,795.9 million 
(2013: ZAR985.1 million).
During the year, ZAR39.0 million was added to the bottom line 
upon realising profits from zero cost collars.
We have proposed a dividend of ZAR258.0 million, a 7.4% 
increase from ZAR240.3 million declared in the 2013 
financial year.
Please refer to the FD’s Report on page 42 and the financial 
statements for further detail.
Commodity prices
During the year under review gold prices retreated considerably 
 
a decrease of 16.1% year-on-year. Please refer to the FD’s 
Report on page 42 for further detail.
Looking ahead
The construction and commissioning of the ETRP is significant, 
as it has an estimated resource of 0.4 million ounces and 
adds immediate production ounces to Evander Mines. Should 
the ETRP project meet targets, we will evaluate a project to 
commission a further, much larger plant – the Elikhulu Project – 
situated at Evander Mines to treat tailings from the Winkelhaak, 
Leslie, Bracken and Kinross dam storage facilities, with an 
estimated resource of 1.5 million ounces.
The refurbishment of Fairview No. 2 and 3 Decline Shafts at 
Barberton Mines will continue for another 18 months, after 
which operations will revert to six shifts per week.
Once the above plans are actioned we will be on track to 
achieve our targeted 250,000oz of annual production from our 
current portfolio of assets and infrastructure. 
Our commitment to safety remains at the heart of our culture 
and is evident in the way we operate and manage the group.

ENGAGEMENT
Stakeholders are integral to the group’s growth and sustainability 
and have been identified as one of the four key strategic pillars. 
Stakeholder feedback and concerns are therefore carefully 
considered when reviewing and refining strategy. To the group’s 
advantage, this in turn fosters an accurate perception by our 
stakeholders of our business, decisions and performance.
On reflection we consider our stakeholder communication 
to have been a key contributor to our growth trajectory. 
For instance, in a year characterised in the mining industry by 
widespread industrial action, our operations did not suffer 
a single organised labour unrest incident. Post year-end, 
Barberton Mines did however have a one-day strike action 
following the issuance by the CCMA of a non-resolution 
certificate on the matter of AMCU seeking organisational rights. 
Management successfully interdicted AMCU as they do not 
meet the necessary requirements of 45% plus one membership 
target, as required in the recognition agreement with NUM.

ETHICAL
LEADERSHIP 
HIGHLIGHTS FY2014


oversee group-wide procurement practices

and other policies
The board strives to ensure that the group conducts its business 
with integrity, leading by example. This commitment is formalised 
in a Code of Conduct (available at www.panafricanresources.com) 
which applies beyond the board to prescribed officers and all 
employees of the group.
The Code of Conduct sets out the group’s values and practices 
over and above requirements of formal governance codes and 
legal requirements such as the King III Report and the South 
African and UK Companies Acts. It is designed to provide 
guidance as to ethical conduct in all areas and across all activities.
To supplement the efficacy of the Code of Conduct, directors, 
executive management and operational management receive 
ongoing training in regulations and separately, in ethical 
leadership.
Further, Pan African Resources has a zero-tolerance approach 
to bribery and corruption. A separate bribery and corruption 
policy is in place, which is again communicated to all employees 
as well as to mine contractors, all of whom are expected to 
comply fully.
During the year the group evolved its focus on ethics to establish 
a dedicated group tenders committee to oversee tender 
processes and ensure that Pan African Resources complies 
fully with the UK Bribery Act in this area. In addition, a group 
Procurement Manager was appointed to oversee the group 
procurement practices in order to ensure maximum efficiency 
and ethical conduct when procuring goods and services within 
the group. Each relevant employee at each operation in the 
group is trained in these procurement procedures and practices.
In the event of a breach of the Code of Conduct, policies or 
practices above, by an employee, the group HR disciplinary 
procedures are followed. No breaches were reported during 
the year. 39

FINANCIAL DIRECTOR’S
REPORT
Pan African Resources remains committed to creating value 
for all stakeholders. For shareholders specifically, value is 
determined by share price performance, sustainable earnings 
and cash flow growth and by consistent dividends paid by 
the company.
The group amended its dividend policy in order to provide 
more certainty to its shareholders. Historically, the board has 
recommended an annual dividend to shareholders, for approval 
at the AGM. The board recognises that where possible, 
shareholders require a cash return on their investment.  
Pan African Resources has now revised and further clarified its 
dividend policy, going forward the company will pay a progressive 
annual ZAR dividend. Any dividend recommendation and 
payment, however, will still be dependent on prevailing gold 
prices and other external factors, as well as the performance of 
and outlook for the group. It has also recommended an attractive 
dividend for the 2014 financial year, demonstrating confidence 
in Pan African Resources’ prospects going forward. In the 2014 
financial year, earnings and cash flows were negatively affected 
by the low grade mining cycle at Evander Mines coupled with 
a two-year low on the gold price.
All of the group’s subsidiaries are incorporated in South Africa 
and their functional currency is ZAR. The group’s business is 
conducted in ZAR and the accounting records are maintained 
in this same currency, with the exception of precious metal 
product sales, which are conducted in USD prior to conversion 
into ZAR. The ongoing review of the results of operations 
conducted by executive management and the board is also 
performed in ZAR.
The group’s presentation currency is GBP due to its ultimate 
holding company, Pan African Resources, being incorporated 
in England and Wales and also being dual-listed in the UK and 
South Africa.


exchange rate was ZAR18.01:1 (2013: ZAR15.01:1). The year-
on-year change in the average and closing exchange rates of 
22.0% and 20.0%, respectively, must be taken into account for 
the purposes of translating and comparing year-on-year results.
Pan African Resources has now 
revised and further clarified its 
dividend policy, going forward the 
company will pay a progressive 
annual ZAR dividend. 43

EXTERNAL DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL 
RESULTS
The profitability of the group is impacted by various external 
and economic drivers, the most significant of which are:
 USD precious metal spot prices – determines the price 
received for gold and PGE produced

ZAR for gold and other metals produced and ultimately the 
group’s revenue. Also drives specific costs of production and 
capital goods
 South African general inflation, wage rate and other price 
increases – determine the rate of increase in the group’s 
costs – the most significant of which is salary and wage costs

performance in GBP
 Interest rates – determine interest payable and received for 
borrowings and cash on hand
USD precious metals spot prices
During the course of the year a lower average USD gold price

South African inflation, wage rate and other cost 
increases
During the year the CPI was reported at 6.6% (2013: 5.5%). 
The main indicator of PPI was recorded at 8.1% (2012: 5.9%).
The group was able to negotiate a two-year wage deal effective 
1 July 2013 to 30 June 2015 at our gold mining operations. 
The agreed increases were:
Year 1:
1. Category workers (union – NUM) – between 7.5% – 8.5%
2. Union officials (union – UASA) – 7.5%
Year 2:
1. Category workers (union – NUM) – average CPI% + 1%
2. Union officials (union – UASA) – average CPI% + 1%
Electricity price inflation
Electricity remains one of the largest cost contributors to the 
gold mining and platinum retreatment operations. The group’s 
electricity costs of ZAR253.6 million represent a total of 14.1% 
of the group’s total cost of production of ZAR1,795.9 million. 
Eskom’s electricity increases in the current year amounted to 
8% (2013: 16%). Eskom’s most recent communication that there 
is a possibility of an additional 4% increase above the planned 
8% increase in the 2015 financial year, will have a material effect 
on the group’s production costs.
GBP/ZAR exchange rate
Given that the ZAR’s performance against the GBP is a key 
determinant of the GBP results, it is important for shareholders 
both in South Africa and in the UK to be aware of the effect this 
exchange rate has on reported results. The value of the ZAR 
against the GBP deteriorated for the major part of the year 

weaker at ZAR16.88:1 when compared to the previous year 
(2013: ZAR13.84:1).
Interest rates
The group pays a margin of 280 basis points above the 
Johannesburg interbank agreed rate (JIBAR) on its Revolving 
Credit Facility (RCF) balance outstanding, and receives interest 
on cash on hand at quoted call account rates. Changes in interest 
rates affect the interest expense and income. JIBAR at 30 June 
2014 was quoted at 5.7% (2013: 5.0%).
Financial objectives scorecard
In the 2013 Integrated Annual Report, the group set specific 
financial objectives for the 2014 financial year. The objectives 
and detail of the performance against these objective are 
summarised as follows:
1. Fully integrate Evander Mines into the group
Evander Mines successfully implemented a new enterprise 
resources planning system, Microsoft Dynamics 2012 during 
the year to align with Barberton Mines’ systems, in turn 
assisting the group in aligning the reporting of and comparison 
between the operations. Evander Mines’ procurement 
has been integrated into Barberton Mines’ procurement 
department to leverage group economies of scale and 
achieve improved pricing, sourcing and quality of goods. The 
new system was also successfully implemented at Phoenix 
Platinum and the Pan African Resources’ corporate office.
2. Cost containment
Management teams at our gold mining operations were 
able to lock in a two-year wage agreement. Wage costs 
significantly impact the cost of the operations averaging 
about 47.5% of the group’s cost of production. The effective 
increases of the wage in year two would be closely linked 
to CPI versus the current year under review, due to the 
introduction of a medical aid scheme at Barberton Mines 
over and above the standard agreed increases.
CPI increased from 5.5% to 6.6% in FY2014, putting pressure 
on the annual production cost increases. Production costs 
at Barberton Mines increased in the current year due 
to the commissioning of the BTRP resulting in additional 
gold production as well as costs. The procurement teams, 
now reporting to a newly appointed, dedicated group 
procurement function, have implemented a procurement 
strategy to ensure long-term effective procurement to assist 
with cost containment.
3. Maintain dividend payments
The group paid a dividend of ZAR240.3 million in December 
2013, therefore re-introducing the dividend following the 
Evander Mines’ acquisition. The dividend represented 
a yield of 5.6% when recommended by the Pan African 
Resources board.

The 2014 group results include a full year of operations for 
Evander Mines, whilst the comparative 2013 period only 
included four months of operations, from the date that Evander 
Mines was acquired from Harmony.
Group revenue year-on-year increased by 41.2% to 
ZAR2,608.8 million (2013: ZAR1,848.1 million). Of this increase, 
Evander Mines contributed ZAR586.9 million, Barberton 
Mines contributed ZAR160.8 million, and Phoenix Platinum 
contributed ZAR13.0 million resulting in a ZAR760.7 million 
total increase year-on-year.
Barberton Mines grew revenue as a result of an increase in gold 
ounces sold, with the commissioning of the BTRP on 1 July 2013. 
Evander Mines’ revenue increased as result of consolidating a 
full year’s production revenue compared to only four months 
post-acquisition revenue in the prior year. Phoenix Platinum 
recorded an increase in revenue due to selling more ounces of 
PGEs at higher prices.



Pan African Resources’ year-on-year total cost of production 
reflects an increase of ZAR810.8 million to ZAR1,795.9 million 
(2013: ZAR985.1 million), of which Barberton Mines’ contributed 
ZAR166.2 million, Evander Mines ZAR637.9 million and Phoenix 
Platinum ZAR6.7 million.
The group’s cost of production per kilogram increased by 28.9% 



The group has adopted reporting cash costs in line with the 
recommendation of the World Gold Council.
The group’s all-in sustaining cash cost of production per 
kilogram (including direct cost of production, royalties, 
associated corporate costs and overheads and sustaining capital

The all-in cost per kilogram (sustaining cost of production 
and once-off expansion capital) increased by 8.7% to 

1. Lower gold ounces sold as a result of the Evander Mines 
low grade mining cycle and Barberton Mines reduced 
underground gold ounce sold as result of the Sheba Mines 
flooding.
2. Once-off capital expenditure required to construct the 
ETRP amounted to ZAR79.2 million. The construction of 
the ETRP is currently funded by a ZAR200 million gold loan 
facility with a remaining term of 3.5 years.
3. Barberton Mines incurred additional once-off capital totalling 
ZAR26.5 million (2013: ZAR2.6 million) on four additional 
raise boreholes to improve environmental conditions 
underground. 46 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
The improved overall production performance at Barberton 
Mines was as a result of the commissioning of the BTRP, which 
contributed an additional 22,885oz of gold production. The 
group’s adjusted EBITDA remained largely in line with the 
previous year, with a small increase of 1.4% to ZAR745.5 million 
(2013: ZAR735.2 million).
Profit after taxation decreased by 19.1% to ZAR452.1 million 
(2013: ZAR558.9 million), primarily due to the points highlighted 
in the HEPS movement below as well as prior year’s results 
which included a net income amount of ZAR71.9 million as 
summarised below:
 Evander Mines acquisition bargain purchase gain of 
ZAR322.4 million;
 Impairment charges of ZAR242.3 million related to Phoenix 
Platinum and Auroch;
 Loss on sale of asset held-for-sale of ZAR8.2 million.
The group’s EPS in ZAR was 24.74 cents (2013: 34.51 cents) 
a decrease of 28.3%.
The group posted a 7.2% decrease in headline earnings to 
ZAR452.0 million (2013: ZAR487.0 million). The group’s 
HEPS in ZAR terms decreased by 17.7% to 24.74 cents (2013: 
30.07 cents).
The HEPS decreased due to the following reasons:
 The low grade mining cycle at Evander Mines, which resulted 
in reduced production and profits compared to the prior year;
 Barberton Mines underground production decreased largely 
as result of flooding at Sheba Mine during March 2014, this 
was however off-set by the additional gold production 
contributed to the group by the commissioning of the BTRP;
 The group realised a 1.7% decrease in the average ZAR gold 
 
whilst our production costs were subject to inflationary  
increases.
 The weighted average number of shares in issue increased by 
12.8% during the year to 1,827.2 million (2013: 1,619.8 million). 
This increase was due to the new shares issued in January 
2013 in the rights issue to shareholders, to partly fund the 
acquisition of Evander Mines.
The group’s total taxation charge decreased by 28.1% 
to ZAR120.8 million (2013: ZAR167.9 million) due to:
 a decrease in deferred taxation as result of an adjustment 
to Evander Mines’ long-term deferred taxation rate to 26.5% 
(2013: 28%).
 a reduction in gold profit margins due to the lower average 
ZAR gold price and margins in the year under review when 
compared to the prior year.
The group paid a dividend of ZAR240.3 million (GBP14.7 million) 
for the 2013 year, equating to ZAR0.1314 per share 
(0.80p per share).
The board has proposed a dividend of ZAR258.0 million 
(approximately GBP14.5 million
1
) for the 2014 financial year, 
equating to ZAR0.1410 per share (approximately 0.7898p per 
share
1
), resulting in a dividend cover of 1.8 times.
1 The GBP proposed dividend was calculated based on an exchange rate of 
ZAR17.85:1. The UK shareholders are to note that a revised exchange rate will 
be communicated prior to final approval at the AGM. Therefore the proposed 
dividend is approximately 0.7898p per share.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
Non-current assets increased by 5.8% to ZAR3,941.5 million 
(2013: ZAR3,726.2 million). The increase was partly attributable 
to further capital expenditure at Evander Mines for the 
construction of the ETRP, expected to commence production 
in January 2015. The group’s capital expenditure by operation of 
ZAR363.0 million (2013: ZAR381.6 million) is disclosed below 
and also contributed to the increase in non-current assets. 
Included in non-current assets is also the rehabilitation trust 
fund balance of ZAR278.4 million (2013: ZAR254.8 million), 
which increased by ZAR23.6 million as a result of growth in 
investments. The rehabilitation trust fund’s amount is invested 
in interest-bearing short-term investments or medium-term 
equity linked notes issued by commercial banks.
Capital expenditure during the year amounted to  
ZAR363.0 million (2013: ZAR381.6 million), and is detailed by 
operation below:

Total capital expenditure 363.0 21.5 381.6 27.6
Current assets increased by 5.5% to ZAR423.4 million 
(2013: ZAR401.5 million) as a result of an increase in cash on 
hand to ZAR101.2 million (2013: ZAR71.6). The group remains 
cash generative with a net debt position of ZAR101.0 million 
(2013: ZAR93.6 million) at year-end, which includes the gold 
loan outstanding with Absa.
The increase in the group’s equity is a result of an increase 
in retained earnings, due to this year’s profit after tax of 
ZAR452.1 million, less the dividend paid of ZAR240.3 million 
in December 2013.
Non-current liabilities decreased by 4.7% to ZAR1,144.1 million 
(2013: ZAR1,200.9 million). The decrease is a result of a 3.8% 
decrease in the deferred taxation liability to ZAR780.8 million 
(2013: ZAR811.3 million) due to a downward revision of 
the long-term effective tax rate at Evander Mines to 26.5% 
(2013: 28%). The deferred taxation rate applied to calculate the 
deferred tax liability is based on the effective statutory taxation 
rate at which the deferred taxation liability is estimated to be 
realised over the life of the operation.
Current liabilities increased by 19.7% to ZAR432.4 million 
(2013: ZAR361.2 million). The majority of the increase is 
attributable to an increase in the current portion of new long-
term debt related to the Absa gold loan and an increase in the 
current taxation liability from the prior year.
Share price and return performance
Pan African Resources’ share price performed well in the year 

index), and outperformed its peers within the SA gold mining 
index (see page 20). The AIM share price performance reflects 
that the group remained competitive and in line with its peers 
during the year, again outperforming on occasion.
The group’s dividend yield had improved from 3.0% in 2011 to 
5.6% in the 2014 financial year.
Financial objectives for the 2015 financial year
1.  Maintain attractive dividend payments
2. Improve profitability from current operations
3. Implement earnings and cash flow accretive growth

Overview
Barberton Mines consists of three mines: Fairview, Sheba and 
New Consort, and now the BTRP. Fairview produces 50% 
of Barberton Mines’ gold production with Sheba and New 
Consort producing 30% and 20%, respectively. Operating three 
mines continues to provide flexibility and versatility in terms of 
resource allocation.
The mix of high grade ore from the mines is planned monthly to 

giving Barberton Mines the advantage of managing cash flows 
from an early stage in the mining process. The operation 
has a proven track record of consistently delivering a solid 
performance, driven to a large extent by an embedded culture 
of cost control.
The mining methods used are an underground semi-mechanised 
up-dip cut and fill and up-dip room and stick. An estimated  
16%–18% of gold is recovered by sweeping and vamping 
contractors focusing on worked-out areas and high grade pillars. 
Gold is extracted using the BIOX
®
 gold extraction process, an 
environmentally friendly process, which uses bacteria to release 
gold from the sulphide ore.
Gold was originally discovered in the Barberton area in 1886 
and comprises the sediments and metavolcanics within the 
Barberton Greenstone Belt. Barberton Mines has therefore 
been mined for over a century with current production practices 
now embedded. Given the aged mine infrastructure, the 
operations undergo ongoing maintenance and refurbishment.
Historically Barberton Mines’ relative isolation has spurred 
creative engineering solutions, which contribute to its cost 
control. Facilities established over the years such as an in-house 
workshop for maintenance of the mines’ fleet not only help 
control costs, but also allow for in-house manufacture or 
customisation of equipment. Barberton Mines has been 
ISO 9001:2008 certified for 10 years.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
The main year-on-year cost contributors were the following:
 The BTRP operations resulted in additional processing costs 
amounting to ZAR97.1 million for the financial year.
 Salary and wages increased by 15.5% to ZAR369.9 million 
(2013: ZAR320.3 million). The increase was driven by 
additional employees for the management of the BTRP, 
resulting in additional costs of ZAR9.5 million (or increase 
of 3.0%), coupled with a two-year wage agreement in 
line with the Chamber of Mines. Barberton Mines also 
introduced a medical aid scheme for category workers four 
to eight of which the company contributes 60% towards each 
member’s premium, this added costs of ZAR6.7 million in the 
current year.
 Mining costs increased by only 4.1% to ZAR102.6 million 
(2013: ZAR98.6 million) due to the vamping contractors gold 
production having decreased from the prior year by 7.4%. 
The mining costs excluding the vamping contractors costs 
increased by 8.9% year-on-year.
 Processing costs (excluding the BTRP reagents) increased by 
8.4% to ZAR61.8 million (2013: ZAR57.0 million).
 Engineering and technical services costs increased by 12.5% to 
ZAR64.0 million (2013: ZAR56.9 million). The majority of this 
increase was for additional secondary support installations 
required at Fairview Mine, and increased maintenance on the 
TWM following the fatality as reported.
 Electricity costs excluding the BTRP increased by 6.4% to 
ZAR76.7 million (2013: ZAR72.1 million), which were lower 
than the average 8% increase in Eskom tariffs. The decrease 
in electricity usage reflects the three-week closure of Sheba 
Mine following flooding during March 2014. The electricity 
cost of the BTRP amounted to ZAR9.2 million resulting in the 
total Barberton Mines electricity costs increasing by 19.1% to 
ZAR85.9 million (2013: ZAR72.1 million).
 Security costs were well controlled and only increased by 
4.7% to ZAR26.8 million (2013: ZAR25.6 million).
 Administration and other costs increased by 10.3% to 
ZAR33.2 million (2013: ZAR30.1 million). The higher than 
CPI increase was mainly due to additional insurance costs in 
relation to the BTRP.
 Barberton Mines had gold inventory movements decreasing 
the cost of production by ZAR14.4 million due to the BIOX
®
 
locking up gold concentrates equivalent to 59.4 kilograms 
(1,910 ounces) of gold at year-end. During the last quarter 
of the financial year, the Biox
®
 experienced a temporary 
set-back in recoveries, due to oil contamination resulting 
from a breakdown at the Fairview primary crusher. This 
necessitated the management team in having to separate 
certain gold concentrates from the BIOX
®
 at year-end to 
stabilise the bacteria organisms. The gold concentrates will 
be reprocessed during the new financial year. The overall 
recoveries as a result of the incident decreased for the full 
year to 90% (2013: 91%).
 The total combined USD all-in cash cost per ounce 

Barberton Mines’ ZAR combined all-in cash cost per kilogram 

kg). This decrease in all-in cash costs was mainly as a result of 
the once-off non-sustainable capital expenditure decreasing 
by ZAR188.9 million due to the BTRP construction in the 
prior year.
Mining operations
Barberton Mines’ (excluding BTRP) gold sold decreased to 
88,738oz (2013: 96,296oz). Mining operations tonnes milled 
decreased by 5.9% to 292,121t (2013: 310,484t). The decrease in 
tonnes milled was mostly as a result of the Sheba Mine flooding 
during March 2014 as a result of a cloud-burst, forcing the mine 
to close for three weeks. This effectively reduced production 
tonnages by 9,000t (or 2.9% of the prior year’s production 

resulting in an estimated reduction of 2,165 ounces of gold sold.
The decrease in gold sold from Barberton Mines underground 
and surface mining operations was therefore as a result of:

91%) as a result of the BIOX
®
 incident mentioned above.
The total underground and surface USD cash costs per ounce 

per kilogram terms, total cash costs increased by 17.0% to 

From a people perspective, the mines continue to operate in an 
area with a high unemployment rate, causing constant demand 
from the community for job creation. Further and sadly, during 
the year three fatalities were suffered. (Please see group Safety 
and Health on page 90 for further details.)
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure at Barber ton Mines decreased by 52.3% 
to ZAR151.0 million (2013: ZAR316.8 million). Maintenance 
capital expenditure of ZAR33.3 million (2013: ZAR45.1 million) 
and development capital expenditure of ZAR50.5 million (2013: 
ZAR42.1 million) was incurred. Expansion capital incurred 
on the BTRP construction totalled ZAR40.7 million (2013: 
ZAR229.6 million), and capital on the development of four new 
raise boreholes at Fairview Mine to improve environmental 
conditions was ZAR26.5 million (2013: ZAR2.6 million).
New ore reserve projects and exploration drilling projects 
continued to grow organically which resulted in the extension 
of Barberton Mines’ LOM to 19 years (2013: 17 years).
Looking ahead
Barberton is expected to maintain its current levels of 
production, which given the age of the mine infrastructure is a 
commendable achievement. 52 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
BTRP
HIGHLIGHTS FY2014
 Inaugural gold pour
 On target for recoveries
Overview
When Barberton’s mines were first exploited, mining extended 
into the sulphide-rich zones where recoveries fell dramatically. 
The aged mines therefore produced substantial mill tailings, 
some with relatively good grades by modern mining standards of 

treatment processes have resulted in more efficient recovery 
from these tailings.
The ZAR313.6 million BTRP was designed to re-treat 100,000t 
of old and new gold tailings per month at an estimated average 

followed by electro-winning and smelting to produce a saleable 
gold product. The plant is expected to treat about 12,000t per 
month of current tailings via a pipeline from the existing Fairview 
Mine concentrator and BIOX
®
 plant, and some 88,000t per 
month from the older tailings dumps.

The year in review
The BTRP construction was completed in the prior financial 
year and production commenced on 1 July 2013.
The plant recovers tailings from the Fairview dams according to a 
mining plan. While it is not yet operating at full capacity in terms 
of tonnage, it nonetheless remains on target for recoveries. 
Further, with the operational costs lower than expected, it is also 
expected to pay back the initial capital expenditure investment 
within three years based on the operations profitability.
BTRP gold sold was 22,885oz for the year. The plant processed 

than expected recovery of 56% (originally planned recovery: 
50%).

 Looking ahead
Sheba and New Consort tailings dams will provide potential 
future sources of tailings which has supported the increased 
LOM of 15 years (2013: 12 years).

Overview
Evander Mines exploits the Kimberley reef in the Evander 
basin, part of the greater Witwatersrand basin. Mining methods 
employed are underground conventional scraper mining 
and rail bound equipment with some trackless mechanised 
development.
With No. 8 Shaft at a depth of 2.3km, it takes the workforce 
approximately an hour to reach the mining area via a lift and 
locomotive and two chairlifts. The rock is then hauled along 
11 conveyors from the rock face to the bottom of No. 7 
Shaft, where it is hoisted to surface. The gold is extracted at a  

Unfortunately there was one fatality during the year. (Please see 
group Safety and Health on page 90 for further details).

The year in review
Evander Mines has now been successfully integrated into the 
group with all health and safety policies and standard operating 
procedures aligned with group policies.
The strategic highlight of the year was undoubtedly the approval 
of the ETRP following the positive outcome of the feasibility 
study. The ETRP comprises a total Mineral Reserve of 
416koz in dams one and two of the Kinross tailings facility. 
The ZAR200 million plant is expected to re-treat 2.16Mt per 
annum of gold tailings over a 17-year life span. Once completed it 
is anticipated to contribute approximately 10,000oz per annum 
to Evander Mines’ gold production. Commissioning of the 
ETRP is scheduled to start in January 2015 with full production 
expected by June 2015.
Evander Mines gold sold decreased to 76,556oz (2013: 
95,089oz
1
). Mining operations tonnes milled increased by 10.7% 
to 656,028t (2013: 592,484t
1
). The increase in tonnes milled was 
mostly due to an increase in surface stockpiles processed of 
58,789t, whilst underground tonnes milled increased by 4,755t.
As a result of the low grade mining cycle, the underground 

1
). The Kinross 
processing plant performed well, and achieved improved plant 
recoveries of 96% (2013: 95%
1
).
As previously announced, this low grade mining cycle at Evander 
Mines is expected to continue until February 2015, and will 
therefore also impact group results and earnings for the first 
eight months of the 2015 financial year. Measures implemented, 
or in progress, to mitigate the impact of the current low grade 
cycle at Evander Mine’s have been highlighted in the CEO’s 
report on page 26. 54 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
The total cost of production including off-mine costs increased 
by 9.5% to ZAR914.7 million (2013: ZAR835.4 million
1
). The 
Evander Mines management team successfully focussed on 
containing their costs whilst in the lower grade mining cycle, 
resulting in their cost per tonnage decreasing by 1.1% to 

The main year-on-year cost contributors were the following:
 Salary and wages increased by 7.1% to ZAR448.9 million 
(2013: ZAR419.0 million
1
). The salary and wages increased as 
a result of the Chamber of Mines wage settlement.
 Mining costs increased by 28.1% to ZAR89.4 million (2013: 
ZAR69.8 million
1
) due to additional vamping occurring in No. 7 
Shaft, and additional maintenance on blasting barricades.
 Processing costs increased by 22.3% to ZAR33.5 million 
(2013: ZAR27.4 million
1
), due to the additional surface 
tonnages being processed through the plant.
 Engineering and technical services costs increased by 26.6% 
to ZAR86.6 million (2013: ZAR68.4 million
1
). The majority 
of this increase related to additional costs to improve 
maintenance of the 11 conveyor belts on No. 8 Shaft, which 
has a total length of 14 kilometres, as well maintaining and 
improving the trackless fleet.
 Electricity and water costs were well controlled and decreased 
by 3.2% to ZAR164.2 million (2013: ZAR169.7 million
1
) due to 
benefits realised from the load clipping optimisation programme 
that manages and improves the consumption of power.
 The security costs remained well controlled and decreased by 
22.6% to ZAR12.7 million (2013: ZAR16.4 million
1
), highlighting 
the cost benefits of a centralised security monitoring team for 
both Barberton Mines and Evander Mines.
 Administration and other costs decreased by 24.5% to 
ZAR57.7 million (2013: ZAR76.4 million
1
) as result of not 
sharing in Harmony’s corporate and other costs in the 
current year.
 Off-mines costs decreased by 23.5% to ZAR1.3 million 
(2013: ZAR1.7 million
1
) in line with the lower gold production 
supplied to the refinery.
 Evander Mines had gold inventory movements increasing the 
cost of production by ZAR20.5 million (2013: ZAR13.4 million 
decrease in production costs
1
).
The total underground and surface USD cash costs per ounce 

1
). 
However, in ZAR per kilogram terms, total cash costs increased 

1
).
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure at Evander Mines was 
ZAR210.5 million (2013: ZAR201.1 million
1
). Maintenance capital 
expenditure was ZAR27.9 million (2013: ZAR65.0 million
1
) and 
development capital expenditure was ZAR103.4 million (2013: 
ZAR54.2 million
1
). Expansion capital related to the ETRP plant 
construction was ZAR79.2 million. In the prior year Evander 
Mines spent expansion capital on the shaft deepening project 
of ZAR81.9 million
1
.
1
 The prior year Evander Mines values were obtained from historical financial 
records to allow for consistent reporting with the group’s current gold 
operations costs. Therefore the values may vary from Harmony’s previously 
announced values.
Looking ahead
By February 2015, Evander Mines is expected to have gradually 
moved out of the low grade mining cycle.
Potential projects on the horizon include exploiting the mineral 
resources of long-standing Poplar, Evander South and Rolspruit 
projects. The group is currently assessing the financial viability 
of progressing these brownfield projects from prefeasibility to 
bankable studies. With Poplar between 500m and 1.2km in depth, 
and Evander South between 350m and 1km, options will be 
explored to find a business case that will optimise these deposits.
Evander Mines is projected to return to 100,000oz a year 
operation towards the end of FY2015, which could see the 
mine become a 160,000oz-a-year operation once the ETRP and 
possibly the Elikhulu tailings projects are in production in the 
long term.
PHOENIX PLATINUM
HIGHLIGHTS FY2014
 Excellent safety record maintained
 Recovery increased to 29%
 First year of profitability
Phoenix Platinum recovers PGEs from chrome tailings at a CTRP 
located on IFM’s Lesedi Mine. The Buffelsfontein, Elandskraal 
and Kroondal mineral resources originates from the mining 
of chromitite seams from the Bushveld Igneous Complex. 
The Bushveld Complex is host to the world’s largest deposits 
of PGEs.
The operation is expected to produce PGEs over a LOM of 
28 years. It has a total process capacity of 240kt per annum. 
The PGEs are extracted in the flotation plant and the 
concentrate is delivered to Lonmin’s Mooinooi Smelter for toll 
extraction.
The CTRP was designed to treat sulphide material from the 
Lesedi Mine, which initially supplied Phoenix Platinum with 
sulphide-rich material. However, subsequent to commissioning 
the plant, IFM stopped its underground operations at Lesedi and 
focussed on oxidised material from their open-cast operation. 
OPERATIONAL
PERFORMANCE (continued) 55
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
This resulted in oxidised tailings being blended into the 
Phoenix Platinum feedstock during the year under review. The 
metallurgy of oxidised tailings negatively affects the recovery 
and concentrate grade in the CTRP. This in turn results in poor 
PGE concentrate production.

The year in review
An improved performance at Phoenix Platinum in the year 
under review resulted in PGE ounces sold increasing by 11.2% 
to 7,204oz PGE (2013: 6,480oz PGE). Several challenges were 
encountered during November 2013 as a result of furnace ash 
and talc material which was historically deposited by IFM on the 
Buffelsfontein dumps affecting plant recoveries. Furnace ash and 
talc dilutes the final concentrate grade and must be chemically 
modified to prevent a negative effect on the plant recoveries. 
The problem was identified by a process of elimination and by 
metallurgical test work carried out, and an estimated 500 PGE 
ounces were lost during the year under review as a result of this 
contamination. Despite this, Phoenix Platinum was still able to 
improve its recoveries to 29% (2013: 21%) and improve PGE 
ounce production.
In the year under review, the effective average PGE basket price 



improved production. The plant feed decreased during the period 
by 8.4% to 251,182t (2013: 274,190t) as result of the talc and furnace 
ash complications highlight above.
The total cost of production increased by 1 3.7% to ZAR55.6 million 
(2013: ZAR48.9 million).
The main year-on-year cost contributors were the following:
 Salary and wages of 9.9% to ZAR17.7 million (2013: 
ZAR16.1 million), comprising a standard increase of 7.5% 
granted to the employees in line with the gold operations and 
an incentive bonus scheme for achieving targets and realising 
a profit.
 Processing costs increased by 16.0% to ZAR33.3 million 
(2013: ZAR28.7 million) as result of increased reagent costs 
and consumption to address the talc and furnace ash in the 
tailings processed, whilst additional processing costs were 
incurred due to higher chrome content fees charged during 
the refining process.
 Administration costs increased by 50.0% to ZAR0.6 million 
(2013: ZAR0.4 million), due to an increase in consulting fees.
 Security cost remained well controlled at ZAR0.5 million 
(2013: ZAR0.5 million).
 Electricity costs increased by 12.5% to ZAR3.6 million 
(2013: ZAR3.2 million). Phoenix Platinum sources electricity 
from IFM and the effective cost per kWh increased as result 
of IFM no longer benefiting from a historical Eskom rebate.
 Phoenix Platinum was able to achieve its maiden headline 
profit of ZAR3.7 million (2013: ZAR6.4 million headline loss) 
for the financial year, despite challenges highlighted above 
and the five-month platinum industrial action that occurred 
during the financial year.
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure at Phoenix Platinum decreased to 
ZAR0.4 million (2013: ZAR2.2 million).
Looking ahead
In July 2014, IFM resumed mining at Lesedi Mine and the 
expected tonnages from this sulphide material should improve 
Phoenix Platinum’s production and plant recoveries.

PAN AFRICAN RESOURCES’ REPORTING IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAMREC CODE
To meet the requirement of the SAMREC Code that the material 
reported as a Mineral Resource should have “reasonable and 
realistic prospects for eventual economic extraction”, Pan 
African Resources has determined an appropriate cut-off 
grade which has been applied to the quantified mineralised 
body. In determining the cut-off grade, Pan African Resources 

the optimal cut-off is defined as the lowest grade at which 
an orebody can be mined such that the total profits, under a 
specified set of mining parameters, are maximised. The Mineral 
Resource optimiser tool that was accordingly developed 
in-house was applied to the Mineral Resource inventory.
The optimiser programme requires the following inputs to 
convert the Mineral Resource to the Mineral Reserve:
 the database inventory of all mineral resource blocks;

 planned production rates for each mine;
 MCF;
 plant recovery factors, and
 planned cash operating costs and other efficiency factors, 
which are calculated using historical achievements as 
a baseline.
The Mineral Reserves represent that portion of the Measured 
and Indicated Mineral Resources above cut-off in the LOM 
plan, and have been estimated after consideration of the 
modifying factors affecting extraction. A range of disciplines 
has been involved at each mine in the LOM planning process 
including geology, surveying, planning, mining engineering, rock 
engineering, metallurgy, financial management, HR management 
and environmental management.
Phoenix Platinum, BTRP and the ETRP are optimised on a 
100% extraction plan on their Mineral Reserves. No selectivity 
was applied on tonnages and thus no cut-off grades were 
determined.
The competent person for Pan African Resources, Mr Barry 
Naicker, the group Mineral Resource Manager, signs off the 
MR&MR for the group. He is a member of the South African 

has 13 years of experience in economic geology and mineral 
resource management.

The total decrease in Mineral Resource can be attributed to a lower gold price and inflationary cost drivers in the reporting 
of the 2014 Mineral Resources.
Group Mineral Reserve
Pan African Resources’ Mineral Reserve increased from 9.2Moz in June 2013 to 10.1Moz in June 2014 – a gross annual increase of

GROUP STRATEGY – MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE
Pan African Resources has an exceptional asset base and attractive growth opportunities, both in established projects and brownfield 
exploration prospects. Strategy in this regard is based on global best practice in MRM to aggressively explore and develop projects, 
that will become next generation long-term business units.
This strategy includes:
 improving the conversion of Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve by accessing, developing and exploiting underground 
orebodies and surface assets
 unlocking the value of major organic projects and
 identifying new expansion opportunities to sustain growth
The Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve underpin the enterprise value of Pan African Resources, and position the group to realise 
its four strategic pillars as below.

PROFITABLE
Pan African Resources’ mineral deposits are located in geological 
terrains that are described as world-class quality mineral assets 
with high grade and significant production tonnage profiles, 
enabling operational and profitable delivery to maximise value 
to stakeholders.
Applying the MRM framework of survey, geology, resource 
estimation and mine planning, the focus is to optimise the all-in 
cost margin and maximise earnings and returns to shareholders. 
This requires a clear understanding of the nature of the 
orebody, its resource inventory and the ability to effectively 
exploit its mineral endowment profitably. Effective LOM plans 
are designed to execute mining methods that are safe and low 
cost, which in turn enables optimal cut-off grades to yield the 
desired financial margins.
STAKEHOLDER
The group’s strategy of investing in large, long-life mines and 
operations means that Pan African Resources operates on 
extended time horizons. This long-term vision provides 
the opportunity to plan and implement projects to deliver 
sustainable contribution to social wellbeing, environmental 
stewardship and economic prosperity. Pan African Resources 
is pleased to report zero production stoppages due to labour 
issues during the year under review. This positively impacted 
the realisation of targeted grade tonnage profiles at each of 
the operations.
The group is committed to complying with the Mineral and 
Petroleum Resources Development Act and achieving the 
objectives of the Mining Charter. In this regard, it continues to 
engage with stakeholders both within and outside the group.
SUSTAINABLE
MRM at Barberton Mines, Evander Mines and Phoenix Platinum 
plays a strategic role in converting a mineral asset from an 
initial Inferred Resource at the exploration phase to a Proved 
Reserve at the production stage, and ultimately to a saleable 
product. The diligent application of this methodology allows for 
greenfield, brownfield, near-mine and organic growth projects 
to be realised and economic value add to deliver a sustainable 
business model.
Brownfield exploration aims to grow or sustain the value 
of our existing operations. It capitalises on projects in which 
we have already made significant investment. The acquisition 
of Evander Mines comprised a substantial brownfield gold 
Mineral Resource inventory of 21.3Moz. Pan African Resources 
is diligently developing these assets to increase the economic 
value of the company. Recent brownfield successes include the 
accretive earnings of BTRP for the year under review and the 
current construction of ETRP.
GROWTH
A key objective is to create value by growing the MR&MR – the 
major asset of the group. This is driven by an active acquisition 
strategy, a well-defined exploration programme, innovation in 
 continual optimisation of the asset portfolio.
In the current year, the acquisition of Evander Mines has 
propelled Pan African Resources to a mid-tier status through 
the significant increase in its mineral asset. The group’s Mineral 
Reserve increased by 9.5%, resulting in all operations increasing 
their respective LOM production profiles.

The evolution of a project from initial testing to commissioning can take 12 to 18 months or longer, and involves a series of study 
stages to reach investment approval and implementation.
We distinguish the group from our peers by having a clear focus on growth and only mining resources that must be profitable in all parts 
of the price cycle, in order to deliver long-term economic value to Pan African Resources. The graph on the previous page demonstrates 
the group’s mineral assets within the value chain and how value is realised through projects such as the BTRP and ETRP.
Group organic growth
The operations’ robust LOM plans support the group business plans. Current exploration drilling as well as accessing and developing 
of the orebody were aggressively maintained during the year. The strategy of converting Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve was 
progressed by moving organic projects further up the mining value chain towards commissioning. The tables below reflect the 
progress of near-mine growth projects that have contributed ounces to the Mineral Resource for the year.

The board acknowledges that applying good corporate 
governance principles is a dynamic responsibility in line with 
developments in the UK, South Africa and internationally. 
Pan African Resources’ board is committed to responsibility, 
accountability, fairness and transparency in accordance with the 
King III Report, the UK Code and applicable laws, reflecting in 
integrity in all business dealings. The board aims to integrate 
this responsible corporate citizenship into the group’s business 
strategy, audits and assessments and to embed sound corporate 
governance practices into daily operations and processes 
throughout the group.
The standards of disclosure relating to corporate governance 
at the group are regulated by the UK Companies Act 2006, 
the Companies Act, AIM Rules, the JSE Listings Requirements 
and King III. In addition, the board has considered the principles 
of corporate governance contained in the UK Code and the 
guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales (commonly known as the Turnbull 
Report) concerning the internal control requirements of the 
Combined Code.
In line with King III’s “apply or explain” approach, the directors 
will continue to state the extent to which the company applies 
good corporate governance principles to create and sustain 
value for stakeholders over the short, medium and long term, 
and to explain any non-application.
To optimally manage its application of King III, the company 
has adopted the IoDSA Governance Assessment Instrument, 
allowing for the maintenance of a register recording its progress 
in applying the principles of King III as well as the JSE Listings 
Requirements.

GOVERNANCE (continued)
The board
The board is responsible and accountable for the performance 
and affairs of the group, and has full control over all subsidiaries 
and operations. It acts as the focal point for and custodian of 
our corporate governance. In doing so, it ensures the group 
remains a responsible corporate citizen, cognisant of the impact 
our operations may have on the environment and society in 
which we operate, while acting in accordance with our own 
Code of Conduct.
At report date our unitary board comprised seven directors:

1.  Keith Spencer is an independent non-executive director as per the King III 
requirement, but a non-executive director as per the AIM rules.
Changes to the board during the year were as follows:
 Ron Holding was appointed CEO with effect 9 September 
2013 (having served as Joint Interim CEO with Cobus Loots)
 Busi Sitole resigned as FD with effect 30 September 2013
 Cobus Loots was appointed FD with effect 1 October 2013
 Thabo Mosololi was appointed independent non-executive 
director with effect 9 December 2013
 Rob Still resigned as an independent non-executive director 
with effect 1 July 2014
 Rowan Smith was appointed on 8 September 2014 as an 
independent non-executive director.
Our board reflects a balance of executive and non-executive 
directors, the majority of whom are independent as required. 
More importantly, the board reflects significant experience in 
mining and related activities, adding depth to board discussions 
with a wealth of industry knowledge.
The responsibilities of the independent non-executive 
Chairman and the CEO, and the remaining non-executive and 
executive directors, are strictly separated to ensure checks and 
balances in decision-making. No single director is positioned to 
exercise unfettered decision-making, which protects against the 
influence of possible personal interests and thereby ensures 
that the interests of all stakeholders are represented and taken 
into account.
The Chairman provides independent board leadership and 
guidance and facilitates suitable deliberation on all matters 
requiring the board’s attention. He further ensures the board 
operates efficiently and as a unit. The CEO and FD supported 
by the EXCO are accountable for strategy implementation 
and day-to-day operational decisions and business activities. 
Non-executive directors are not involved in the daily operations 
of the company.
A formal board charter is in place to regulate the parameters 
within which the board operates and to ensure the application 
of good corporate governance in compliance with the group’s 
Code of Conduct. The charter was reviewed in the year under 
review and will be adopted in the current year. A copy of the 
board charter is available from the group company secretary 
on request. 75

Independence
Keith Spencer is 
considered an 
independent director in 
terms of King III and as 
such by the company. 
As a result of historical 
share options issued 
during 2007, the UK 
Companies Act does 
not consider Keith 
Spencer independent.

The Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee is 
not independent as required 
by the King III and the JSE 
Listings Requirements. 
Nevertheless, the board is 
satisfied that the interests 
of the executive directors 
and employees can be 
fairly and adequately met, 
this point notwithstanding, 
and that the Chair’s 
contribution outweighs the 
legislative interpretation of 
independence.

Mandate The Audit Committee 
is responsible for 
ensuring that the 
financial performance, 
position and prospects 
of the group are 
properly monitored, 
controlled and reported 
on and for meeting the 
auditors and reviewing 
their reports relating to 
accounts and internal 
controls.
The Remuneration 
Committee reviews 
the performance of 
the executive directors 
and determines their 
remuneration and the basis 
of their service agreements 
with due regard to the 
interests of shareholders. 
It also determines the 
payment of any bonuses 
to executive directors 
and the grant of options 
to employees, including 
executive directors, under 
the group’s share option 
scheme, as well as short- or 
long-term incentives. 
The Nominations Committee is 
required to review the composition 
of the board and board committees 
and to make recommendations 
to the board in this regard. The 
appointment of directors is a 
transparent and formal process 
governed by the committee’s 
mandate and terms of reference as 
well as the board charter. 
With regard to composition of the 
board, the committee ensures that 
its size, diversity and demographics 
make for an effective board and that 
it is structured to ensure a wide 
range of skills, views, knowledge 
and experience in order to guide 
the group to meet our strategic 
objectives. 
The committee also ensures that 
a formal succession plan for key 
executive directors is in place, and 
that induction and ongoing training 
and development of directors 
continues.
The SHEQC Committee 
is the cornerstone of 
ensuring the group 
maintains its social licence 
to operate. (See page 89

BOARD PROCESSES
Rotation of directors
In terms of King III and the group’s MOI, one-third of the board’s 
non-executive directors must retire from office at each AGM 
on a rotation basis. The directors to retire are those who have 
been longest in office since their last election. Retiring directors 
may make themselves available for re-election provided that 
they remain eligible as required by the MOI and in compliance 
with the AIM Rules and JSE Listings Requirements. Accordingly, 
Cobus Loots, Hester Hickey and Thabo Mosololi, will retire 
by rotation at the upcoming AGM, and being eligible, will offer 
themselves for re-election.
A brief CV of each director standing for election at the AGM is 
contained in this Integrated Annual Report. The Nominations 
Committee, having assessed the performance of those directors 
who are due for re-election, makes a formal recommendation 
for re-election to the board and shareholders.
Reviews
An annual effectiveness evaluation is undertaken in respect of 
the board and the Audit Committee, both from a self-evaluation 
and independent evaluation perspective. The evaluations in the 
year found the board and Audit Committee to be satisfactorily 
effective, subject to the caveat that the composition of the 
board and all its committees would benefit from the inclusion of 
one more independent non-executive director. Thabo Mosololi 
was subsequently appointed, as above. The Audit Committee 
further performed an assessment of the independence of each 
independent non-executive director, as above.
Share dealings
All group employees above Patterson Grading D (which 
includes operational management, EXCO and OPSCO ) with 
access to financial and any other price-sensitive information 
are prohibited from dealing in Pan African Resources’ shares 
during “closed periods”, as defined by the AIM and JSE rules, or 
while the company is trading under cautionary. An appropriate 
communication is sent to all such employees alerting them 
that the company is entering a closed period. Should any of 
the relevant employees wish to trade Pan African Resources’ 
shares, written permission must be obtained from either the 
CEO or FD and confirmed with the South African and UK-
based corporate advisors prior to the trade taking place. There 
were no contraventions of this policy during the year.
Succession planning
Succession planning for the board, management team and 
senior executives falls to the board, assisted by the Nominations 
Committee. The committee regularly reviews the group’s 
succession strategy. Succession plans are in place for the 
incumbent key executives, with an informal “on-the-job” mentor 
programme for identified successors supporting this process.
New appointments
The Nominations Committee identifies, interviews and 
proposes potential candidates to the board. The board 
evaluates each individual in the context of the board as a whole 
– the objective remains having a board that can best perpetuate 
our success and represent shareholder interests through the 
exercise of sound judgement using its diversity of experience. 
The company ensures all new directors are informed of the 
JSE and AIM rules with the assistance of the UK Nomad and 
JSE sponsor, given that all appointees are accomplished board 
directors and familiar with the fiduciary duties expected of 
them. However, new appointees are provided with the latest 
annual and interims results, Integrated Annual Report and 
minutes of previous board meetings. It is intended that a formal 
induction programme will be introduced in the short term.
Ongoing development
All directors receive ongoing training on relevant matters and 
in addition, directors who are chartered accountants comply 
with SAICA CPD requirements. The UK-based Nomad ensures 
that the directors remain up to date with AIM regulations, 
while the South African sponsor ensures the same vis-à-vis the  
JSE Listings Requirements. The company secretary and Chair of 
the Audit Committee are further responsible for keeping the 
board abreast of new legislation, recommendations and best 
practice.
SUPPORT FUNCTIONS
Independent advice
All independent non-executive directors have unrestricted 
access to management at any time as well as to the groups’ 
external auditor. Further, all directors are entitled to seek 
independent professional advice on any matters pertaining to 
the group as they deem necessary and at the group’s expense.
Company secretary
Pan African Resources outsources the company secretarial 
function. St James’ Corporate Services Limited has been the 
group’s company secretary since 8 July 2008. The company 
secretary advises the board of any relevant regulatory changes 

Specifically the company secretary keeps record of, inter alia, 
shareholder registers, meeting attendance registers, meeting 
minutes, resolutions, directors’ declarations of personal 
interest(s), all notices and circulars issued by the company, 
directors training, guidance on directors’ duties and good 
governance and assistance of evaluation of board and board 
committees performance. He is well versed in all relevant 
updates to current legislation and regulation and is responsible 
for advising the board in this regard.  78 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE (continued)
Further, he reviews the rules and procedures applicable to the 
conduct of the board. To this end he will involve, wherever 

experts to ensure that the directors have adequate information 
to sufficiently discharge their responsibilities in the best interests 
of the company.
The appointment and removal of the company secretary is a 
matter for the board as a whole. The Audit Committee review 
the company secretary’s qualifications and competence.
The board is comfortable that the company secretary 
St James’s Corporate Services Limited maintains an arm’s length 
relationship with the board at all times and is sufficiently qualified 
and skilled to act in accordance with, and update directors in 
terms of the recommendations of the King III Report and other 
relevant local, UK and international regulations and legislation.
Advisers
One Capital is the company’s appointed sponsor in accordance 
with the JSE Listings Requirements. One Capital is responsible 
for ensuring that the company is at all times guided and advised 
as to the application of the JSE Listings Requirements (as above).
The group’s Nomad and joint broker in the UK is Canaccord 
Genuity. Peel Hunt also acted as joint broker during the 
reporting period, with their contract having been terminated 
in July 2014.
IT GOVERNANCE
Recognising the importance of this aspect to sustainability, 
the group is currently in the process of implementing an IT 
governance framework, which will be governed by an IT charter, 
to be formalised, adopted and rolled out in the current year. 
Niel Symington, part of the finance team, will assume the 
responsibilities of chief information officer.

governance of risk.
The board’s Audit Committee has conducted an evaluation of risk and is 
satisfied with the effective management of risk
2.8 The board should be responsible for 
information technology (IT) governance. 
The board is addressing IT governance in its corporate governance practices 
and will be implementing an IT governance framework including a charter 
during financial year 2015.
2.9 The board should ensure that the 
company complies with applicable laws 
and considers adherence to non-binding 
rules, codes and standards.
The board ensures that the company complies with applicable laws and 
considers adherence to non-binding rules, codes and standards. The South 
African sponsor and external auditor and UK Nomad are responsible 
for monitoring compliance. The directors take cognisance of legislation, 
regulation and best practice.
2.10 The board should ensure that there is an 
effective risk-based internal audit.
The Audit Committee has oversight of internal audit by approval of the 
internal audit plan and review of the reporting of any findings on a regular 
basis. The internal audit function currently outsourced to BDO has direct 
access to the Chair of the Audit Committee and internal audit are invited to 
attend each Audit Committee meeting.
2.11 The board should appreciate that 
stakeholders’ perceptions affect the 
company’s reputation.

2.12 The board should ensure the integrity of 
the company’s Integrated Annual Report.
The board continues to ensure that the Integrated Annual Report 
endeavours to provide a true view of the group’s commitment to financial, 
social, governance, economic and environmental value creation, although 
the sustainability information in the Integrated Annual Report is not 
independently assured. 
2.13 The board should report on the 
effectiveness of the company’s system of 
internal controls.
The board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal controls 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and group assets. Nothing has come 

caused a material breakdown in the system of internal controls.
2.14 The board and its directors should act in 
the best interests of the company. 
The board acknowledges its role as a steward on behalf of the shareholders. 
2.15 The board should consider business 
rescue proceeding or other turnaround 
mechanisms as soon as the company is 
financially distressed as defined in the 
Companies Act.
The board monitors the company’s solvency and liquidity. Business rescue 
has not been required. 
2.16 The board should elect a Chairman 
of the board who is an independent 
non-executive director. The CEO of the 
company should not also fulfil the role of 
Chairman of the board.
The Chairman, Keith Spencer, is an independent non-executive Chairman 
for JSE purposes and the roles of CEO and Chairman are clearly defined 
and separated.
2.17 The board should appoint the CEO and 
establish a framework for the delegation 
of authority.
The board should appoint the CEO and establish a framework for the

directors. The majority of non-executive 
directors should be independent.
After the appointment of Rowan Smith, the board comprises a majority 
(five) of non-executive directors, four of whom are independent  
non-executive directors. 
The responsibilities of the Chairman and CEO, and those of other non-
executive and executive directors, are clearly separated to ensure a balance 
of power and prevent any one director from exercising unfettered powers 
of decision-making. The Chairman provides leadership to the board in 
all deliberations ensuring independent input, and oversees its efficient 
operation. The CEO is responsible for proposing, updating, implementing 
and maintaining the strategic direction of Pan African Resources as well as 
ensuring appropriately supervised and controlled daily operations. In this 
regard, the CEO is assisted by the FD. 
The independent non-executive directors and non-executive director are 
high merit individuals who objectively contribute a wide range of industry 
skills, knowledge and experience to the board’s decision-making process. 
These directors are not involved in the daily operations of the company. 
2.19 Directors should be appointed through 
a formal process.
The entire board participates in a formal and transparent process for the 
appointment of new board members, including the CEO. The Nominations 
Committee recommends suitable candidates to the board following a 
vetting process, which takes into account a candidate’s skills offering, 
experience and interests such as diversity.  81

2.20 The induction of and ongoing training 
and development of directors should be 
conducted through formal processes.
All directors receive ongoing general training with the assistance of SAICA 
(in reference to qualified Chartered Accountants), the UK Nomad, the 
South African sponsor, the company secretary and the Chair of the Audit 
Committee. The induction programme is managed and controlled by the 
Nomad and South African sponsor.
2.21 The board should be assisted by a 
competent, suitably qualified and 
experienced company secretary.
The company secretary function is outsourced to St James’ Corporate

whole and accordingly maintains an arm’s length relationship with the board 
and its directors. The appointment and removal of the company secretary 
is a matter for the board as a whole. The Audit Committee reviews the 
company secretary’s qualifications and competence. 
The board is comfortable that the company secretary maintains an arm’s

and skilled to act in accordance with, and update directors in terms of the 
recommendations of the King III Report and other relevant local, UK and 
international regulations and legislation.
2.22 The evaluation of the board, its

The group’s remuneration philosophy reflects Pan African Resources’ 
commitment to best practice. The Remuneration Committee determines 
the remuneration policy on executive and senior management 
remuneration in line with the group’s remuneration philosophy. A detailed 
remuneration report is contained in the Integrated Annual Report on

RISK
MANAGEMENT
We recognise that the ongoing and effective management of business risk is vital to Pan African Resources’ continued growth and 
success.
The system of internal controls and monitoring relating to risk is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance as to 
the integrity and reliability of the financial statements. Further, the systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate applicable 
risks, safeguard and verify the accountability of the group’s assets and to identify and minimise significant fraud, potential liability, loss 
and material misstatement while complying with applicable laws and regulations.
The identification of risks is informed by the external environment, and the nature of the individual operations’ activities.
A formal risk management process is in place, as below:
The board of the company 
is ultimately responsible for 
the management of risk. In 
this endeavour, the directors 
are assisted by the Audit 
Committee. The board 
regularly reviews the risk 
reports from the operations, 
ensuring that the appropriate 
risk management programmes 
and monitoring of progress 
against key risk indicators are 
being effectively implemented. 
The board, together with 
executive management, 
is also responsible for the 
identification of strategic 
risks and opportunities. 
Strategic workshops are 
conducted to evaluate risks 
and opportunities, confirm 
or amend group strategy and 
establish strategic actions for 
the forthcoming period.
Controls and actions to 
mitigate strategic risks can 
be implemented at the level 
of individual operations, 
across a group discipline (HR 
for example) or at executive 
management level.

The Remuneration Committee assists the board in ensuring 
that group remuneration and recruitment are aligned with the 
overall business strategy, with the aim of enabling Pan African 
Resources to attract and retain personnel who will create long-
term value for all stakeholders.
The committee is an independent and objective body, which 
monitors and strengthens the credibility of the group’s executive 
remuneration system. It reviews the performance of the CEO, 
executives and senior management and sets the scale, structure 
and basis of their remuneration and the terms of their service 
agreements. It also considers and makes recommendations to 
the board on remuneration packages and policies in this regard.
All executive directors have employment contracts with the 
company and are remunerated by the company for services 
performed.
Pan African Resources’ remuneration philosophy seeks to reward 
executive directors and other senior management for individual 
and group performance. It recognises that these individuals 
have the ability to significantly impact the performance of the 
group, in both the short and longer terms. Executive directors 
and other senior management carry significant responsibility, 
legal and otherwise, and appropriate skills are difficult to attract 
and retain in what is increasingly a challenging environment. 
It is therefore critical that remuneration achieves, inter alia:
 Attracts the “right” senior staff
 Incentivises key staff to perform and then measures and 
rewards performance
 Retains critical skills
In order to achieve these objectives, the Remuneration 
Committee, in consultation with and with oversight from the 
board, retains flexibility in terms of how it incentivises and 
rewards performance.

SHEQC COMMITTEE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The SHEQC Committee’s responsibilities encompass monitoring 
and regulating the impact of the group on its stakeholders, and 
thus its social licence to operate. The committee serves as the 
Social and Ethics Committee as required by the Companies Act.
Pan African Resources is committed to conducting its mining 
operations in strict compliance with the mining licence 
conditions set by the DMR and the MHSA and other relevant 
regulations. This compliance is driven by the group SHEQC 
Manager, Mandla Ndlozi, within the group philosophy of 
continuous improvement. Ultimate responsibility for the group’s 
SHEQC performance rests with the board and radiates from 
the board down through the group. 
(See Pan African Resources Sustainability Report at www.panafricanresources.
com for further details.)
During the year under review a formal integrated SHEQC Policy 
and charter were approved and implemented, extending to 
safety, health, environment, quality and communities.
The committee comprises independent non-executive directors 
Keith Spencer, who chairs the committee, and Hester Hickey. 
It further comprises CEO Ron Holding, COO Anaki Karigeni, 
group SHEQC Manager Mandla Ndlozi, Executive HR Andre 
van den Bergh and the General Manager of each operation.
The committee has free and unrestricted access to the 
company’s management, employees and the findings of outside 
consultants in all matters pertaining directly or indirectly to 
SHEQC concerns.
The committee meets at least four times a year. Details of 
meeting attendance are set out on page 75.
The role of the committee includes specifically to:
 Develop the framework, policies and guidelines for 
SHEQC management.
 Review the policies and performance of the group and the 
ongoing implementation of such policies.
 Monitor SHEQC risks and liabilities at head office, all 
operations of the group and any managed subsidiaries and 
significant investments.
 Monitor key indicators on accidents and incidents and 
ensure such information is communicated to other 
companies managed by or associated with the company.
 Consider substantive national regulatory and technical 
developments in the SHEQC fields.
 Facilitate participation, co-operation and consultation on 
SHEQC matters with relevant stakeholders, including but 
not limited to, governments, national and international 
organisations, other companies and other SHEQC bodies.
Health and Safety
Pan African Resources is committed to continually improving 
its occupational health and safety performance and strives to 
reduce the risk of exposure associated with unhealthy or unsafe 
conditions in the workplace.
(For further details please see the Pan African Resources Sustainability Report at 
www.panafricanresources.com.)
Environment
Pan African Resources is committed to responsible stewardship 
of natural resources and the ecological environment and 
accordingly to eliminating or minimising the negative impacts of 
our operations. Environmental management is well integrated 
into management practices throughout the group.
The group is steadfast in its commitment to enhancing its 
approach through processes, practices and techniques to avoid, 
reduce or control the creation, emission or discharge of any 
type of pollutant or waste and to reduce adverse environmental 
impacts.
The group acknowledges that with the pending introduction 
of a national carbon tax, environmental monitoring must be 
enhanced and developed to extend to an accurate and complete 
determination of its emissions.
(For further details please see Pan African Resources Sustainability Report at 
www.panafricanresources.com.)
Quality
Pan African Resources is committed to the highest standards 
of quality and endeavours to meet the requirements of its 
stakeholders in this regard, in order to continue creating value. 
Effective communication with relevant stakeholders is therefore 
a vital element of quality management.
To achieve this, the group drives continuous improvement at 
operations by providing adequate and appropriate resources 
and relevant training and development to its employees and 
contractors. Quality is further monitored through regular audits.
Communities
Pan African Resources strives to minimise potentially negative 
social impacts while promoting opportunities for the local 
communities in its areas of operation. To this end it endeavours 
to monitor, measure and manage its social and economic impacts.
The group’s operations engage in a range of development 
and community relations activities, which aim to ensure the 
self-sustainable welfare of communities. Management at the 
mines are proactive in building and maintaining stakeholder 
relationships with the local communities and have forged close 
working relationships with ward councillors and local leaders.

OUR
PEOPLE
HIGHLIGHTS FY2014
 Zero incident of labour unrest
 Largely stable workforce
 Ongoing improvement initiatives in 
people management
 114 new jobs created at Barberton Mines
 Evander Mines concluded industry-first two-year 
wage agreement
People are a primary driver of the group’s four-pillar business 
strategy and we see our employees as fundamental to the 
sustainability of the business. Andre van den Bergh – the group’s 
Executive: HR – assisted by all management is responsible for 
our employee relations and overseeing initiatives in this regard.
Our operations are controlled by mining rights and each has 
devised a SLP, which has been submitted to the DMR.
The group has a commendable employee average turnover rate 
of 6.8%. The workforce is largely stable and continually benefits 
from improvement initiatives at the operations, such as the 
medical aid scheme that was launched at Barberton Mines in 
the year.
1 14 new jobs were created in FY2014 through the commissioning 
of the BTRP.
The group is committed to providing equal opportunity for 
individuals in all aspects of employment. The group gives every 
consideration to applications for employment by disabled 
persons where the requirements of the job may be adequately 
filled by a disabled person. Where existing employees become 
disabled, it is the group’s policy, wherever practicable, to provide 
continuing employment under similar terms and conditions 
and to provide training, career development and promotion, 
wherever appropriate.
Skills development and training
Pan African Resources is committed to skills development and 
spent ZAR20.1 million on training for the year. Barberton Mines 
and Evander Mines have onsite accredited training centres 
offering a range of occupational skills training programmes, 
while Phoenix Platinum provides on-site training or outsources 
this where applicable. Learnership programmes are also in place 
at the operations.
Labour relations
Pan African Resources complies with all applicable legislation 
and bargaining arrangements and in addition, each operation 
has a strategic, proactive and consultative engagement process 
with unions and employees. Notwithstanding a volatile labour 
situation in the South African mining sector in the year, the 
group did not experience a single incident of organised labour 
unrest at any operation, which we attribute to the success of 
the above.
At Barberton Mines NUM represents 80% of the labour force. 
UASA represents the officials, artisans and miners. Although 
Barberton Mines is not a member of the Chamber of Mines, 
it nonetheless uses many of its policies as guidance for its own 
procedures and policies. However, the mine conducts its own 
wage negotiations, which were successfully concluded during 
the year without incident. Barberton Mines currently has the 
presence of AMCU on the mine, although the union does not 
meet the recognition criteria at Barberton Mines there remains 
a risk of future industrial action regarding recognition.
At Evander Mines NUM represents 90% of the workforce, with 
UASA representing 8.5%.
100% of the workforce is covered by collective bargaining 
agreements. The mine is a member of the Chamber of Mines 
and in July 2013, was the first in the industry to sign a two-year 
wage agreement.
Phoenix Platinum employs four individuals, all in management 
positions. The operations at the processing plant are 
outsourced to a specialist metallurgical company, Metanza, who 
is responsible for further employment at the operation.
The group has committed substantial investment to upgrade 
and convert old hostels into single accommodation and family 
units, which is well underway at Evander Mines. In line with the 
Mining Charter scorecard, Barberton Mines recruits only from 
its labour setting – an area of high unemployment. The majority 
of Barberton Mines’ employees live off-mine.
Pan African Resources recognises that it has a responsibility 
beyond its own employees in the wider employment context. 
Accordingly, wherever possible and beyond Barberton Mines, 
the group employs from and upskills the local communities 
which surround its operations. 93

CSI
Our CSI focus is on the empowerment of the communities 

negotiated with local economic fora. The group targets 1% of 
NPAT for contribution to these beneficiaries, in addition to the 
per operation contributions.
Transformation
Pan African acknowledges that integrating genuine 
transformation that permeates the group is critical for the 
sustainability of its business in South Africa.
In August 2009 Shanduka exchanged its shareholding of 26% 
in Barberton Mines for 21% of Pan African Resources and 
further acquired an additional 5% in the group from Metorex 
for cash, taking the black-owned and managed Shanduka to a 
26% shareholding in Pan African Resources. Black ownership in 
the group is therefore in line with Mining Charter requirements. 
Shanduka’s current shareholding at 30 June 2014 is 23.8%.
Shanduka is as a black-owned investment holding company with 
interests in a diverse portfolio of listed and private companies 
primarily in the resources and food and beverage industries. 
Its investments are spread across South Africa, Mozambique, 
Mauritius, Ghana and Nigeria.
A total of 93.2% of the group’s 4,426 average number of 
employees are black.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The committee has evaluated the group and company financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2014 and, based on the 
information provided to the committee, considers that the group 
and company complies, in all material respects, with the 
requirements of the Companies Act and IFRS. The requirements 
from King III are continuously being assessed and improved on 
with significant issues resolved.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The committee nominated  Deloitte LLP as the statutory auditor 
and Deloitte & Touche SA for JSE reporting requirement purposes, 
for reappointment as external auditors of Pan African Resources.
The committee satisfied itself through enquiry that the external 
auditors are independent as defined by the UK Companies Act 
2006 and the standards stipulated by the auditing profession.
The Audit Committee, in consultation with executive management, 
agreed to the terms of engagement. The audit fee for the external 
audit has been considered and approved for the 2014 financial 
year-end, taking into consideration such factors as the timing of 
the audit, the extent of the work required and the scope.
The committee approved a non-audit services policy which 
determines the nature and extent of any non-audit services 
which Deloitte & Touche may provide to the company. The policy 
allows for limited tax and corporate governance advice as well as 
the provision of reporting accountant services in relation to capital 
market transactions.
FD 
The directors have considered the functioning of Pan African 
Resources’ financial department and believe that it functions 
effectively, with the required controls and systems in place.
The committee has assessed and is satisfied that the FD, Cobus 
Loots, has the appropriate skill, expertise and experience as 
required by the JSE Listings Requirement 3.84(h).
INTERNAL AUDITOR
The committee plays an oversight role of internal audit by approval 
of the internal audit plan and review of the reporting of any 
findings on a regular basis. The committee satisfied itself that the 
internal audit function is independent and has the necessary 
resources, standing and authority to discharge its duties. The Head 
of Internal Audit has direct access to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and internal auditors are invited to attend each Audit 
Committee meeting.
ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Based on the available and communicated information, together 
with discussions with the independent external auditor, the 
committee is satisfied that there was no material breakdown in 
the internal accounting controls during the financial year under 
review. The committee reviewed the auditor’s report to those 
charged with governance and can report that there were no 
material issues requiring immediate additional attention. The value 
added issues raised are receiving the appropriate attention to 
ensure increased effectiveness in all areas of financial and business 
systems and controls.

ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
DIRECTORS’
STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
The directors are responsible for preparing the integrated annual 
report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
The directors have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU. Under 
company law, the directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
In preparing these financial statements, the IAS requires that 
directors:


that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information.

specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
or conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.

concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s 
transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the group, and ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and therefore for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website.  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014 98
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2014.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The group’s principal activity during the year was gold and PGE 
mining. A full review of the activities of the business and of future 
prospects is contained in the CEO’s report that accompanies 
these financial statements, with financial and non-financial KPIs 
shown on page 26.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS 
The results for the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income on page 103. The salient features of 
these results can be found on page 12.
The Pan African Resources board of directors previously stated 
the company’s policy is to pay an annual dividend, and have 
therefore proposed to declare a dividend in respect of the 2014 
financial year subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 
next AGM. Currently, with the satisfactory results from Barberton 
Mines and Evander Mines, the board remains committed to 
continue with the company’s dividend policy and had resumed the 
dividend payment as proposed in the 2013 financial year.
The board has proposed a dividend of approximately ZAR258.0 
million (GBP14.5 million
1
) for the 2014 financial year, equating to 
ZAR0.1410 per share (0.7898p per share1), resulting in a dividend 
cover of 1.8 times.  
The proposed final dividend is calculated on 1,829,994,763 issued 
shares currently outstanding and is to be approved by shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM of the company. 
Note 1: The GBP proposed dividend was calculated based on an exchange rate 
of ZAR17.85:1. The UK shareholders are to note that a revised exchange rate 
will be communicated prior to final approval at the AGM. Therefore the 
proposed dividend is approximately 0.7898p per share.
POLICY FOR PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
It is the company’s policy to settle all agreed transactions within 
the terms established with suppliers. The company’s target credit 
days are 60 days.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The key business risks to which the company is exposed have 
been considered and addressed under the operational review of 
each business segment. Refer to page 48 for gold operations and 
page 54 for PGE operations. 
A separate risk committee is not considered necessary, as this role 
is fulfilled by the board, its sub-committees and executive 
management. The identification and management of critical risks is 
a strategic focus area for executive management, reviewed on a 
monthly basis and, together with action plans, reported regularly 
to the board. Executive management has the ability to call for 
emergency board meetings, should the need arise. Risk registers 
for each business segment are in place. The board has reviewed 
the current risks to the business and, at the time of reporting, 
believes that the current business risks do not exceed the risk 
appetite of the group. 
Residual risks include the current South African labour market and 
associated union rivalry, USD gold price, USD/ZAR exchange 
rate, and government and regulatory frameworks, as well as 
unforeseen natural disasters. 
The board believes that the current processes of identifying and 
dealing with risks are effective.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal 
controls to safeguard shareholders’ investment and group assets. 
The directors monitor the operation of internal controls. The 
objective of the system is to safeguard group assets, ensure proper 
accounting records are maintained and that the financial 
information used within the business and for publication is reliable. 
Any such system of internal control can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Internal financial control procedures undertaken by the board 
include:







The board has reviewed the operation and effectiveness of 
the group’s system of internal control for the financial year and 
the period up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Political donations
The board confirms that no political donations were made and no 
political expenditure was incurred during the current or prior 
year. 
GOING CONCERN
The board confirms that the business is a going concern and that 
it has reviewed the business’ working capital requirements in 
conjunction with its future funding capabilities for at least the next 
12 months, and has found them to be adequate. The group has a 
revolving credit facility with Nedbank Limited, ABSA Limited and 
Rand Merchant Bank. The group at 30 June 2014 had unutilised 
RCF facilities of ZAR600 million and cash on hand of 
ZAR101.2 million to assist in funding working capital requirements. 
DIRECTORS’
REPORT Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014 99
ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Management are not aware of any material uncertainties which 
may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Should the need arise the group can cease most 
exploration and capital activities, and by doing so conserve cash.

2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 

reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information

STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S
REPORT (SA)
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF PAN AFRICAN RESOURCES PLC
We have audited the consolidated and separate financial 
statements of Pan African Resources PLC. set out on pages 103 to 
157, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 
30 June 2014, and the statements of comprehensive income, 
statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for 
the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements
The company’s directors are responsible for the preparation and 
fair presentation of these consolidated and separate financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and 
separate financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
and separate financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and 
separate financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and 
separate financial statements. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and 
separate financial statements in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and 
separate financial position of Pan African Resources PLC. as at 
30 June 2014, and its consolidated and separate financial 
performance and consolidated and separate cash flows for the 
year then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards.

ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Pan African Resources is a company incorporated in England and 
Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The company has a dual 
primary listing on the AIM of the LSE and JSE. The nature of the 
group’s operations and its principal activities relate to gold and 
PGE mining and exploration activities. The financial statements 
are presented in Pounds Sterling. Foreign operations are included 
in accordance with the policies set out below. The individual 
financial results of each group company are maintained in their 
functional currencies, which are determined by reference to the 
primary economic environment in which it operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each group company is expressed 
in Pounds Sterling. The financial statements have been prepared 
on the going concern basis.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with the IFRS adopted by the EU and South Africa.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation and general information
The annual financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which 
are stated at fair value. The principal accounting policies are set 
out below and are consistent in all material respects with those 
applied in the previous year, except where otherwise indicated.
Historic reverse acquisition
On 31 July 2007 the company acquired 74% of Barberton Mines in 
a share-for-share transaction. IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’ 
defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that 
obtains control. Accordingly, the combination was accounted for 
as a reverse acquisition.
Going concern
The financial position of the group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position are described in these financial statements. In addition, 
note 30 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, 


exposure to credit, foreign currency, commodity price, interest 
rate and liquidity risk.
Management is not aware of any material uncertainties which may 
cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Based on the current status of the group’s finances, the 
directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that 
the group has, or will have, adequate resources to enable the 
group to continue to meet its financial commitments for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Further details are provided in the going concern section of the 
Directors’ report.
New and revised IFRS’s not yet adopted.
The group applies all applicable IFRS in preparation of the financial 
statements. Consequently, all IFRS statements adopted by the EU 
that were effective at 30 June 2014 and are relevant to its 
operations have been applied.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following standards and interpretations, which have been applied 
in these financial statements, for the first time, were in issue and 
effective as at 30 June 2014.

The impact of the adoption of the above standards and 
interpretations still needs to be considered, but is not expected to 
have a material impact on the financial results.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the company 
(its subsidiaries) to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where 
the company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. The results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Inter-
company transactions and balances between group entities are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the purchase method. The cost of a business combination is 
measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair 
values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classified as held-for-sale in accordance 
with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less 
costs-to-sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset, and 
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, 
the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The interest 
of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the 
minority’s proportion of net fair value of the assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised.
Change in ownership interest
In terms of IAS 27, changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a 
subsidiary that do not result in a change of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions.
Investment in associate
An associate is an entity over which the group and the company 
have significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an 
interest in a joint venture.
In the company’s separate financial statements, an investment in 
associate is stated at fair value less impairment losses, if any. 
An investment in associate is accounted for in the consolidated 
financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The 
investment in associate in the consolidated balance sheet is initially 
recognised at fair value and adjusted thereafter for the post 
acquisition change in the group’s share of net assets of the 
investment.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets, including mine development costs and mine plant 
facilities, are recorded at cost less provision for impairment and 
accumulated depreciation.
Expenditure incurred after feasibility stage to develop new ore 
bodies, to define mineralisation in existing ore bodies, to establish 
or expand productive capacity and expenditure designed to 
maintain productive capacities, is capitalised within capital under 
construction until commercial levels of production are achieved. 
Capital under construction is not depreciated. All revenue 
generated during the commissioning phase is capitalised back to 
the property, plant and equipment as per IAS16.
Mineral and surface rights
Mineral and surface rights are recorded at cost less provision for 
impairment and accumulated depreciation. 111
ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
Land
Land is shown at cost and is not depreciated.
Gain or loss on disposal or retirement of assets.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in profit or loss.
Depreciation
Mining assets, mineral and surface rights mining assets, mine 
development costs, mineral and surface rights and plant 
mine facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of mine 
(‘LOM’) to their residual values using the units-of-production 
method based, on estimated proven and probable ore reserves.
Other mining plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-
line basis over the shorter of the LOM or their estimated 
useful lives.
Depreciation of non-mining assets
Buildings and other non-mining assets are recorded at cost and 
depreciated on the straight-line basis over their expected useful 
lives, which vary between three to ten years.
Research, development, mineral exploration and evaluation 
costs
Research, development, mineral exploration and evaluation costs 
are expensed in the year in which they are incurred until they 
result in projects that the group:


Once these criteria are met, all directly attributable development 
costs and ongoing mineral exploration and evaluation costs are 
capitalised within other intangible assets. Capitalisation of  
pre-production expenditure ceases when the mining property is 
capable of commercial production.
Capitalised pre-production expenditure is assessed for impairment 
in accordance with the group accounting policy stated below.
Impairment (except for goodwill)
At each Statement of Financial Position date, the group reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset being the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell or value in use is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
(“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are 
immediately recognised as an expense. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-
controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated 
are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount 
of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the CGU, pro rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of 
a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
Taxation
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as 
adjusted for items which are non-deductible or disallowed. It is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect 
of temporary differences arising from differences between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of 
taxable profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither tax nor 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects 
the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which 
the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle 
the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recorded within 
equity, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a  112

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
business combination. In a business combination, the tax effect is 
taken into account in calculating goodwill or in determining the 
excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
over the cost of the business combination.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Statement of Financial Position date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or parts of the assets to be recovered.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount 
of associated VAT, unless VAT incurred is not recoverable from 
the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of 
VAT receivable or payable. The net amount of VAT recoverable 
from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other 
receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of 
financial position.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or 
constructive obligation resulting from past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of 
the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the Statement of Financial Position date, taking into account the 
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a 
provision are expected to be received from a third party, the 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably.
Lease assets
The group leases certain property plant and equipment. A lease is 
classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards incidental to ownership to the group. Other leases 
are classified as operating leases.
Finance lease assets are capitalised at the lease’s commencement 
at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between the 
amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments 
are recognised as an operating lease liability.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the relevant subsidiary are initially recorded at the rates 
of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in such other currencies are 
translated at the rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position 
date. Profits and losses arising on exchange are recorded in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. In order to hedge its 
exposure to foreign exchange risks, the group may enter into 
forward contracts. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of 
the group’s foreign operations are translated into Pounds Sterling 
at exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising from 
the translation of foreign operations are classified as equity and 
are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of. Translation differences on foreign loans 
to subsidiaries which are classified as equity loans are also 
accounted for as equity.
Inventories
Inventories include the gold bullion on hand, PGE concentrate, 
gold or PGE in process and consumable stores.
Bullion on hand and PGE concentrate are valued at the lower of 
cost, determined on a weighted-average basis, and net realisable 
value. Costs include direct mining costs and mine overheads.
Gold or PGE in process inventories represent materials that are 
currently in the process of being converted to a saleable gold or 
PGE product. The gold or PGE in process inventories are valued 
only if they are reliably measurable and are valued at the average 
cost of the material fed to process plus the in-process conversion 
costs.
Consumable stores are valued at the lower of cost, determined on 
a weighted average basis, and estimated net realisable value. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. Obsolete and slow-moving 
consumable stores are identified and are written down to their 
economic or realisable values.
Retirement and pension benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are 
charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed schemes are dealt with as defined contribution plans 
where the group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent 
to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan 
and are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Post-retirement benefits other than pension
Historically Barberton Mines and Evander Mines provided 
retirement benefits by way of medical aid scheme contributions 
for certain employees. The practice has been discontinued for  113
ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
some years. The net present value of estimated future costs of 
company contributions towards medical aid schemes for these 
retirees is recorded as a provision on the group Statement of 
Financial Position. The provision is reviewed annually with 
movements in the provision recorded in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Equity participation plan
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest. At each Statement of Financial Position 
date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the 
original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income such that the cumulative expense reflects 
the revised estimate, with corresponding adjustments to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Cash participation plan
Cash-settled share-based payments to employees are measured 
at the fair value of the cash instruments at the grant date. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the cash-settled share based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the company’s estimate of cash instruments that 
will eventually vest. At each Statement of Financial Position date, 
the company revises its estimate of the number of cash instruments 
expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with corresponding adjustments to the cash-settled 
employee benefits liability.
Provision for environmental rehabilitation costs
Long-term environmental obligations are based on Barberton 
Mines, Evander Mines and Phoenix Platinum environmental plans, 
in compliance with current environmental and regulatory 
requirements. The provision is based on the net present value of 
the estimated cost of restoring the environmental disturbance 
that has occurred up to the Statement of Financial Position date. 
Increases due to additional environmental disturbances are 
capitalised and amortised over the remaining lives of the mines. 
The estimated cost of rehabilitation is reviewed annually and 
adjusted as appropriate for changes in legislation or technology. 
Cost estimates are not reduced by the potential proceeds from 
the sale of assets or from plant clean up at closure.
Contributions to rehabilitation trust
Contributions are made to a dedicated environmental 
rehabilitation trust to fund the estimated cost of rehabilitation 
during and at the end of the life of the group’s mines. The trust’s 
assets are recognised separately on the Statement of Financial 
Position as non-current assets at fair value. Interest earned on 
funds invested in the environmental rehabilitation trust is accrued 
on a time proportion basis and credited to the provision for 
environmental rehabilitation costs.
Provision for decommissioning costs
The group provides for decommissioning costs other than 
rehabilitation costs, if any, when the directors have prepared a 
detailed plan for closure of the particular operation, the remaining 
life of which is such that significant changes to the plan are unlikely, 
and the directors have raised a valid expectation in those affected 
that it will carry out the closure by starting to implement that plan 
or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
Revenue recognition
Sales represents the value of minerals sold, excluding value-added 
tax, and is recognised when goods are delivered and risk and 
reward has passed, and is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable. Interest income is accrued 
on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the interest rates applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life 
of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Dividend 
income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ 
rights to receive payment have been established. Revenue is 
recognised when the buyer takes title, provided that:

(b) the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the 
 (c) the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery 

(d) the usual payment terms apply.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments and that are not quoted in an active 
market are classed as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less impairment if necessary. Interest income is recognised 
by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term 
receivables, when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at Fair Value Through Profit and 
Loss (“FVTPL”), are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
Statement of Financial Position date. Financial assets are impaired 
where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have 
been negatively impacted.
Derecognition of financial assets
The group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of  114
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND COMPANY
ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
for the year ended 30 June 2014
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
ownerships of the asset to another entity. If the group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated 
liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred 
financial asset, the group continues to recognise the financial asset 
and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds 
received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the group
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial 
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at 
FVTPL or “other financial liabilities”.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial 
liability is either held-for-trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held-for-trading if:


 the group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of 


instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held-for-trading 
may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:

measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 


financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the group’s 
documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that 


derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or 
liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or 
loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on 
the financial liability. The group has no financial liabilities classified 
as FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially valued at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest recognised on an effective yield 
basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, 
a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The group derecognises financial liabilities only when the group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
In the ordinary course of its operations, the group may enter into 
a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure 
to commodity prices, volatility of interest rates and foreign 
exchange rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at cost at the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each Statement of Financial Position date. 
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of 
Comprehensive Income immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event 
the timing of the recognition in Statement of Comprehensive 
Income depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. A 
derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current 
liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The group may designate certain hedging instruments, which 
include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in 
respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash 
flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. 
Hedges of foreign exchange risk or firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the group documents whether the  115
ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of any derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change 
in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in 
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in 
the line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income relating to 
the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of 
the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit 
or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of any derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the 
“other gains and losses” line of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss 
in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or 
loss, in the same line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a  
non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or 
liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the group revokes 
the hedging relationships, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that 
time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-on-hand and demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly-liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Non-current assets held-for-sale
A non-current asset is designated as held-for-sale when its 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use and the asset is 
available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is 
highly probable. A sale is considered highly probable if management 
is committed to a plan to sell the non-current asset, an active 
divestiture programme has been initiated, the non-current assets 
is marketed at a price reasonable to its fair value and the disposal 
is expected to be completed within one year from classification. 
Non-current assets held-for-sale are stated at lower of carrying 
value and fair value less cost to sell and are reviewed for impairment 
at each subsequent reporting date.
At the time of classification as held-for-sale, these assets are 
reviewed for impairment. The impairment charged to the income 
statement is the excess of the carrying value of the non-current 
asset and its expected net selling price (fair value less costs to sell). 
At each subsequent reporting date, the carrying values are 
reassessed for possible impairment. A reversal of impairment is 
recognised for any subsequent increase in net selling price but not 
in excess of the cumulative impairment loss already recognised. 
No depreciation is provided on non-current assets from the date 
they are classified as held-for-sale.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Pan African Resources’ 
executive committee. Management has determined the operating 
segments of the group based on the reports reviewed by the 
executive committee that are used to make strategic decisions. 
The executive committee considers the business principally 
according to the nature of the products and service provided, with 
the segment representing a strategic business unit. The reportable 
operating segments derive their revenue primarily from mining, 
extraction, production and selling of gold and 6PGEs.
3  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
AND JUDGEMENTS
In preparing the annual financial statements in terms of IFRS, the 
group’s management is required to make certain judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that may materially affect reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense 
during the reported year and the related disclosures. The estimates 
and judgements are based on historical experience, current and 
expected future economic conditions and other factors. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements made by 
management
The following judgements, that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements, have been 
made by management in the process of applying the group’s 
accounting policies: 116

Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries. South 
African income tax on mining income is determined according to a formula which takes into account the profit and revenue from 
mining operations. South African mining taxable income is determined after the deduction of all mining capital expenditure, with the 
proviso that these deductions cannot result in an assessed loss. Capital expenditure amounts not deducted are carried forward as 
unredeemed capital expenditure, to be deducted from future mining income. At year-end the group has the following unredeemed 
capital expenditure carried forward and deductible against future profits, held within Phoenix Platinum and Evander Mines (due to 
the expenditure on the ETRP.

15 DIVIDENDS
Historically, the board has recommended an annual dividend to shareholders, for approval at the AGM. The board recognises that 
where possible, shareholders require a cash return on their investment. Pan African Resources has now revised and further clarified 
its dividend policy, going forward the company will pay a progressive annual ZAR dividend. Any dividend recommendation 
and payment, however, will still be dependent on prevailing gold prices and other external factors, as well as the performance of 
and outlook for the group.
The group paid a dividend of ZAR240.3 million (GBP14.7 million) for the 2013 year, equating to ZAR0.1314 per share (0.80p per share).
The board of directors has proposed a dividend of approximately ZAR258.0 million (GBP14.5 million1) for the 2014 financial year, 
equating to ZAR0.1410 per share (0.7898p per share1), resulting in a dividend cover of 1.8 times.
Note 1: The GBP proposed dividend was calculated based on an exchange rate of ZAR17.85:1. The UK shareholders are to note that 
a revised exchange rate will be communicated prior to final approval at the AGM. Therefore the proposed dividend is 
approximately 0.7898p.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated 
at acquisition to the cash generating units (“CGU’s”) that 
are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
All the group’s goodwill has been allocated to Barberton 
Mines CGU.

The group tests the Barberton Mines goodwill carrying amount annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill carrying amount is not considered to be impaired and the review was performed in 
accordance with the group’s accounting policies.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during 
the year. Management estimates the discount rate using post-tax rate of 9.00% (2013: 11.00%) for Barberton Mines, which reflect 
the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU to the extent not already reflected in 
the cash flows being discounted, an average gold price of R440,000/kg ($1,294/oz) (2013: R400,000/kg ($1261/oz))over the life of 
projects. The life of mine was estimated at 19 years (2013: 17 years) for Barberton Mines at the end of the financial year. Changes in 
selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 128

 Emerald Panther is a company acquired to facilitate the acquisition of Evander Mines from Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, and therefore holds the investment 
in Evander Mines. Emerald Panther holds 100% of Evander Gold Mines Ltd and Evander Gold Mining Pty Ltd, which are both incorporated in South Africa, and operate in 
mining.

 During the prior year the group disposed of its investment in the Manica exploration project to Auroch. The consideration partly comprised a 42% shareholding in Auroch 
which was recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and has been subsequently treated as an investment in associate. The transaction triggered a loss on disposal 

the gold price in the prior year and related challenges in the mining and operating environment, recorded a £3.2 million impairment against the carrying value of its 
direct shareholding (based on Auroch’s prior year-end share price, being the best estimate of its fair value)and also fully impaired the £7,024,203 deferred consideration. 
The resulting total impairment charge was £9,481,379.

 Pan African Resources Management Services Company Pty Ltd previously known as Clidet 790 Pty Ltd, was acquired within the group. Ordinary shares previously held 
by Evander Gold Mines Ltd where transferred to Pan African Resources PLC. This company was acquired to function as a management and other services provider and 
administrator to the group.

 Pursuant to a share sale and purchase greement, dated 27 August 2012, relating to the sale of Manica Gold Projects, certain terms were amended between the 
contract parties and as a result the company made a decision to sell its investment in Auroch Minerals (42% shareholding) for a total consideration of AUD 2,000,000. 
The following proceeds have been received during the year: 129

The contract parties concluded that the consideration of AUD 350,000 already received will constitute an option fee income to 
Pan African Resources PLC and shall in no circumstances be refundable. Therefore these proceeds were recognised on the statement 
of comprehensive income.
At year-end, the investment in Auroch is still recognised as an investment in an associate, due to uncertainty of the amended terms 
being fulfilled. Therefore the investment in Auroch will be reported as such until the terms of the sales agreement have been fulfilled.
The remainder of the total consideration is scheduled to be received according to the following time frame:

The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position 
are net of allowances for doubtful receivables of £35,578 (2013: £36,051) relating to other receivables, estimated by the group’s 
management based on the current economic environment and individual debtor circumstances. The credit risk on liquid funds is 
limited because the counterparties are dealt with in accordance with the group’s credit policy. Rand Refinery is the one major 
customer that represents more than 5% of the trade receivables balance for the individual gold mining subsidiaries (Barberton Mines 
and Evander Mines), and Western Platinum Ltd (Subsidiary of Lonmin PLC)is the one major customer that represents more than 5% 
of the trade receivables balance of Phoenix Platinum. 
The average credit period is:
Group
30 June 2014 30 June 2013
Number of days 22 30
The ageing of trade receivables decreased due to improved cash collection initiatives, especially from Evander Mines. Although 
overall debtors days improved from the prior year, Phoenix Platinum reported trade receivables of £2.3 million (2013: £1.9 million) 
at year-end. This is due to five months PGE production from Phoenix Platinum which was delivered to Western Platinum Ltd 
(Subsidiary of Lonmin PLC) prior to year-end, however payment for these deliveries will only be realised in the 2015 financial year, 
as a result of the platinum sector strike delaying the processing of concentrates by Lonmin.
No interest is charged on trade receivables.
Before accepting any new customers, the group uses a credit bureau or performs a credit assessment to assess the potential 
customer’s credit limit and credit quality. The group only transacts with creditworthy customers and large institutions within 
South Africa.
The fair value of trade receivables is not materially different from the carrying value presented. Receivables have been pledged as 
security, in terms of the Revolving credit facility. 131

GROUP CASH-SETTLED SHARE OPTIONS
On 9 May 2011, the company established a cash settled share appreciation right programme entitling selected executives and 
employees of the group, as approved by the board of directors and the remuneration committee of the company, to be allocated 
notional shares in the group. These notional shares confers the conditional right on the participant to be paid a cash settlement equal 
to the appreciation in the company share price from the date of allocation to the date of surrender or deemed surrender of notional 
shares. Participation in the share appreciation program is subject to the agreement of a selected participant and acceptance by said 
participant of the rules and regulations governing the share appreciation programme.
The share appreciation settlement is determined no later than the sixth anniversary of the date that the notional shares are 
allocated. However the participant can elect, subject to approval by the Companies Remuneration Committee, to surrender his/her 
notional shares and receive the share appreciation settlement at a date prior to the sixth anniversary date.
The share appreciation settlement is regarded as remuneration for income tax purposes and thus subject to the deduction of Pay 
As You Earn (“PAYE”) and all other taxes and contributions via the payroll of the company or the relevant subsidiary. These taxes 
are for the account of the participant.

Financial risk management objectives
The group seeks to minimise the effects of financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures where 
appropriate. The use of any financial derivatives is approved by the board of directors, who also on a continuous basis provide guidance 
on managing foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, 
and the investment of excess liquidity. Exposure limits are reviewed on a continuous basis. The group does not enter into or trade 
financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative use.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. 
The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where 
appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk. 
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position 
are net of allowances for doubtful receivables of £35,578 (2013: £36,051) relating to other receivables, estimated by the group’s 
management based on the current economic environment and individual debtor circumstances. The credit risk on liquid funds is 
limited because the counterparties are dealt with in accordance with the group’s credit policy. Rand Refinery Pty Ltd is the one major 
customer that represents more than 5% of the trade receivables balance for the individual gold mining subsidiaries (Barberton Mines 
and Evander Mines), and Western Platinum Limited (Subsidiary of Lonmin PLC) is the one major customer that represents more 
than 5% of the trade receivables balance of Phoenix Platinum .

Market risk
The group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the gold price. 
Where appropriate, the group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency 
risk and the commodity price risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. 141
ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014
Foreign currency risk
The group undertakes certain transactions in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuation arise. Exchange rate 
exposures are managed within approved policy parameters. The group specifically ensure USD receipts are converted into ZAR as 
quickly and economically as possible.
Commodity price and foreign exchange rate risk
The group may enter into forward contracts to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates on specific 
transactions. The contracts are matched with anticipated future cash flows from gold sales receipts.
Interest rate and liquidity risk
Fluctuations in interest rates impact on short-term investment and financing activities, giving rise to interest rate risk. In the ordinary 
course of business, the group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. Cash is managed to ensure that surplus funds are invested to maximise returns whilst ensuring that 
capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent by only investing with reputable financial institutions. Contractual arrangements for 
committed borrowing facilities are maintained to meet the group’s normal and contingent funding needs.

Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the group’s short term funding and liquidity management requirements. This framework involves 
constant weekly monitoring of the group’s cash position, cash flow forecast, and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities to enable management of the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings 
facilities.
The group has access to financing facilities at Barberton Mines and its Funding Company, of which all of the facilities were undrawn 
as at 30 June 2014, however a gold loan of £11,225,364 was outstanding at year-end (Refer to note 28). The group expects to meet 
its other obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.

 Fair value hierarchy
The following is an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
They are grouped into levels I to 3 based on the extent to which fair value is observable.
The levels are classified as follows:
Level 1 –  fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or 

Level 2 –  fair value is determined using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 

Level 3 – fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data.

 The fair value of the gold loan, which is a recurring fair value measurement treated as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, was estimated by discounting future expected 
 forward curve. These are discounted at a rate of approximately 8%, which takes into consideration the credit risk.
31 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT INFORMATION
Predominantly most employees are required to be members of either the Barberton Pension Umbrella Fund, Sentinel Retirement 
Fund, Mine Workers Provident Fund or the Shanduka Group Provident Fund. These are defined contribution funds and are registered 
under and governed by the South African Pension Act, 1956, as amended. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the group in funds and they are in the control of the trustees. The total costs charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
of £4,747,602 (2013: £2,457,148) at group level and £112,853 (2013: £85,063) at company level and represent employer contributions 
payable to the schemes by the group and company at rates specified in the rules of the scheme. The calculation of the provision for 
post retirement medical benefits is performed internally by management using the South African Revenue Services life expectancy 
tables as the benefits payable are a fixed amount per pensioner. The balance of post retirement medical benefits were 
£90,832 (2013: £108,781). 146

34 EQUITY SETTLED SHARE OPTIONS
On 1 September 2005, the company established a share option programme relating to equity-settled share options entitling specific 
employees, officers, directors and qualifying consultants as approved by the board of directors of the company and its subsidiaries 
to purchase shares in the company. The share option exercise price is determined using the closing price at which shares are traded 
on the JSE or AIM (as determined by the board of directors), on the trading date immediately preceding the date upon which the 
board authorised the grant of the opportunity to acquire the relevant share options, as the case may be to a participant. Pursuant 
to resolutions of the board passed in accordance with the rules of the share option programme, share options may be released from 
the share option programme to participants, share options may be exercised by participants and allocation shares may be delivered 
to participants as follows for allocations prior to 21 July 2008:

(ii) up to 66.67% of the total number of shares allocated after two years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the 

(iii) the balance of the shares allocated after three years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
and for allocations subsequent to 21 July 2008, the vesting date was amended from three years to four years as follows: 
 (ii)  up to 50% of the total number of shares allocated after two years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of 

(iii) up to 75% of the total number of shares allocated after three years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of 


board may, at its discretion, anticipate or postpone such dates. 
An option holder may not exercise a share option under the share option programme by later than the end of the year preceding 
the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Upon death of an option holder the estate would be entitled to exercise the options vested 
to date within twelve months of the date of death, if the options are not exercised the total available share options would lapse. 
The directors have the discretion to approve the vesting of the deceased total number of unvested share options.
The number of vested share options to which an option holder is entitled to expires after of period of six months due to resignation, 
retirement, redundancy or disability of the option holder.
During the year, an equity linked incentive was implemented for the new executive directors appointed.  
The terms of the scheme are as follows:
Total number of potential shares 2,650,000
Grant date 1 September 2013
Vesting date 28 February 2015
Vesting period 18 months
Exercise price nil
Market conditions to be met

outperformed the JSE gold index by 10% or more during the 18-month period starting 
1 September 2013, 1,750,000 ordinary shares of Pan African Resources will be issued by the 
vesting date, or alternatively cash settled.

following inputs:

A company dividend rate has not been determined and therefore is not taken into account in option fair value calculations. The volatility 
of the company’s share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of volatilities of share prices of the company on the 
corresponding dates. The volatility of share price of the company was calculated as the average of annualised standard deviations of daily 
continuously compounded returns on the company’s stock, calculated over 1 to 4 years back from the date of grant. Therefore, volatility

ACQUISITION OF EVANDER MINES
In the prior year, 28 February 2013, the group acquired 100% of the recorded voting shares of Evander Mines, thus obtaining control of 
Evander Mines. Cash consideration paid for the acquisition was ZAR1.313 billion. It was determined that this transaction represents a 
business combination with Emerald Panther identified as the acquirer. The group began consolidating the operating results, cash flows 
and net assets of Evander Mines from 1 March 2013. Evander Mines was a public unlisted mining company that was wholly owned by 
Harmony. The tables below present the purchase cost and our provisional allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities 
acquired. This allocation was calculated as at the date of acquisition to reflect the provisional determination of the fair values of the assets 
and liabilities acquired. The significant adjustments were to increase property, plant and equipment by ZAR1,058 million and deferred 
income taxes by ZAR465 million, with a corresponding bargain purchase gain of ZAR322 million recognised in the consolidated results. 
There were no significant adjustments made to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income after applying these adjustments 
retroactively to the acquisition date.

 The bargain purchase gain arose due to net consideration paid being less than the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the acquisition cost has been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. BDO Corporate Finance was used to assist the group 
in determining the fair value of the mining rights and property plant and equipment acquired.

10. As at 18:00 on 15 September 2014, the company’s issued share capital comprised 1,829,994,763 ordinary shares of 1p each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
the company as at 18:00 on 15 September 2014 was 1,829,994,763. 
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS AND DOCUMENTS ON DISPLAY
11. A statement or summary of transactions of directors (and their family interests) in the share capital of the company and copies of 
their service contracts will be available for inspection at the company’s registered office during normal business hours (Saturdays and 
public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM and will also be available for inspection at the

CREST
12. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST manual. CREST personal members or 
other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
13. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the 
information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, 
be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID: RA10) by 10:00 on 19 November 2014 (or 48 hours preceding the date 
and time for any adjourned meeting). For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
14. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s) to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of 
the CREST system by any particular time). In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the 
CREST system and timings. 166 Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2014

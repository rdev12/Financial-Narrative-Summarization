£[•]m
Belief in the  
opportunity and the  
strategy remains  
undiminished
Overview:
Chairman’s 
statement
Financial results 
Revenue from continuing operations grew 
by 14% to £131.2 million (2012: £115.1 million) 
with lighting segment revenue growth of 51% 
to £68.5 million (2012: £45.5 million). Group 
contribution margin from continuing operations 
reduced from 46.1% to 44.7% due to the effects 
of the downturn in the Obstruction business. 
However, contribution margins in the Lighting 
segment grew from 44.3% in 2012 to 45.5% 
in 2013. 
Underlying profit from operating activities 
from continuing operations was £14.5 million 
(2012: £19.6 million). Non-underlying costs 
of £2.9 million (2012: £nil) were incurred during 
the year including an intellectual property past 
use access fee of £1.4 million, relating to a 
one-off payment for access to certain patents 
and intellectual property over the last five years, 
goodwill and asset write downs of £0.8 million 
and employee severance, restructuring and 
other costs of £0.7 million. Profit from operating 
activities was £11.6 million (2012: £19.6 million). 
Whilst 2013 has been a 
challenging year for Dialight, 
the belief in the opportunity and 
the determination to achieve our 
strategic goals is undiminished. 
There is real enthusiasm at the 
way we have addressed key 
issues within the obstruction 
business, whilst still managing to 
achieve growth in our industrial 
lighting business.
During the year under review the Group 
delivered profit at a level that was lower than 
expectations. As a matter of good governance, 
the Audit Committee, following discussion with 
the full Board, has undertaken an assessment 
of the Group’s forecasting and performance 
process. The Audit Committee was supported 
in this by KPMG Audit plc (“KPMG” or “Auditors”), 
who were engaged to provide critical challenge 
of the 2013 reforecasting and 2014 forecasting 
process. This assessment has highlighted 
a number of process improvements, the 
implementation of which has begun. The review 
has been fully embraced by the Interim Chief 
Financial Officer and it is envisaged that 
following completion of these improvements, 
the Group will have a much more robust and 
focused system of internal control that will 
support Dialight’s growth in the coming years.
Profit before tax was £11.2 million 
(2012: £19.8 million). There was a profit 
after tax on the disposal of discontinued 
activities of £0.7 million (2012: £0.1 million).
Basic underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) 
was 30.8 pence (2012: 41.7 pence) with 
basic EPS of 26.2 pence (2012: 42.0 pence). 
At 31 December, net cash was £7.1 million 
(2012: £15.0 million).
Dividend
The Board is recommending, subject to approval 
by shareholders, a final dividend of 9.5p giving a 
total dividend for the year of 14.4p (2012: 13.5p). 
This will be paid on 3 June 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the 2 May 2014.
Developments
During the year we established Dialight Brasil 
Participacoes Ltda (“Dialight Brasil”), opening 
sales opportunities to the Mercosul region. It is our 
intention to start some light assembly of Dialight 
products in this region in 2014. Additional 
operational capacity was also added at our 
manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Mexico. 
This will provide all of the operational support 
required to meet the Company’s growth in the 
immediate future. 
Staff
Our employees continued to work hard 
throughout the year and their efforts are 
gratefully received. I thank everyone for their 
continued commitment, support and hard work 
both in 2013 and going forwards in 2014.
Board changes
Two new Non-Executive Directors, Stephen Bird 
and Tracey Graham, joined the Board on 
10 January 2013 and have made an excellent 
contribution during that time. 
Mark Fryer left the Company on 15 January 2014. 
We wish him well for the future. An executive search 
firm has been engaged to find his successor. 
In the meantime, Kevin Higginson has joined 
the Company as Interim Chief Financial Officer, 
but has not been appointed a statutory Director.
Full details on the Board can be found 
on pages 38 to 39.
Outlook 
With market-leading innovative products, 
expansion of our sales channels and continued 
buoyancy in the industrial lighting market, the 
Board expects to drive strong Lighting growth 
for 2014 and the years to come. This, combined 
with a stabilisation of the Signals business, 
leads the Board to expect a return to earnings 
growth in 2014.

Strategic  
report
Chief Executive’s  
introduction
The focus of 2013 was the 
continued growth in Industrial 
Lighting and the repositioning 
of Obstruction Signals as 
a systems business offering 
monitoring and control to 
the major tower operators. 
Once again, Industrial Lighting 
posted significant growth of 
£23.0m, with strong contributions 
from all geographies driven 
by our ever-increasing sales 
force and industry-leading 
product performance. 
We have continued to address the key 
constraint on our growth, namely the 
need to recruit more sales people as well 
as refocusing our sales efforts in those 
areas more likely to deliver higher returns.
Dialight remains a great business that is 
well placed to enjoy real growth in its chosen 
markets. The fundamentals of the business 
and the story remain sound.
The following pages contain the Strategic report 
which provides an explanation of our business and 
how we operate (Our business model), information 
on our business objectives and how we plan to 
achieve them (Our objectives and strategy), details 
of how we measure our success towards achieving 
those objectives (Key performance indicators), 
a full review of our performance in the last year 
(2013 review) and finally details of the risks 
and uncertainties facing our business 
(Risk management).

Our strategy  
and objectives
Strategic report:
Oil, gas & petrochemical
Safety is a number one priority for both upstream 
and downstream operators. Our products meet 
the market’s heavily regulated requirements 
and specifications. Customers benefit from 
improved safety, quality of light and reliability.
Chemical & pharmaceutical
Process heavy chemical and pharmaceutical 
applications take advantage of our maintenance-
free fixtures eliminating the need to change 
bulbs in dangerous environments.
Mining
Our products are built to withstand extensive 
shock and vibration and their reliability is 
of paramount importance to customers 
in this market.
Heavy industrial
Steel foundries, pulp and paper mills, 
automotive manufacturers and other heavy 
industrial producers often operate around the 
clock. Our energy and maintenance savings 
quickly pay dividends for our customers.
Power generation 
The heavily regulated nuclear, fossil and 
renewables power industry requires rugged 
products with demanding certifications. 
Our products’ reliability eliminates constant 
maintenance burdens while drastically reducing 
energy consumption.
Food & beverage
Food processing, agricultural, cold storage 
and food grain industry operators all profit 
from our consistent, high performance products 
which can be illuminated 24 hours a day.

Identify and target key markets
We have identified the following markets where we 
believe our products are best placed to succeed:
Our objectives are 
simple. We aim to:
 » be the number one 
Industrial LED Lighting 
supplier worldwide;
 » develop world-class new 
technology in the field of 
power supplies, controls 
and monitoring systems; and
 » maintain our competitive 
advantage leading the field 
in terms of product efficacy, 
reliability and return on 
investment for our customers.
10 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013
The key features of our products 
meet the strict and highly regulated 
requirements of many customers 
whose businesses operate within 
the markets opposite. Identifying these 
markets and understanding their 
requirements means we are able to 
develop better solutions and deliver 
key products to our customers. 
Some of our competitors are 
already well established in these 
markets. We remain competitive by 
building long-lasting relationships 
and staying at the forefront of 
technological advances.   Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013 11

Targeted expansion Focus, develop 
and protect products
We carefully consider the need to 
be present in those regions occupied 
by our target markets. 
Our focus on key products allows us to remain at 
the forefront of technological developments and 
break down barriers to penetrate regulated markets. 
Focused, targeted expansion of the appropriate 
channels to market will support Dialight’s growth 
through 2014.
Dialight currently operates in The Americas, Asia/
Australia and Europe/Middle East. We are always 
investigating potential opportunities that will provide 
better access to key customers. We consider many 
options including the engagement of direct and 
indirect sales representatives and distributors as well 
as the establishment of branches or representative 
offices. We also consider acquisitions with strong 
geographical coverage and proven technology 
which we believe will benefit our business.
Our products are known for meeting our 
customers’ strict requirements regulated 
by their operating market. 
We continually strive to improve our existing 
products and innovate new products which 
we protect by registering intellectual property 
rights where possible and vigorously defend 
any infringements. We invest in highly educated 
and skilled engineering teams and reinvest our 
profit into research and development, thereby 
investing in the future of the Company. We also 
use our low-cost manufacturing base and 
continually review and monitor cost-saving 
opportunities to reduce material cost without 
compromising quality of our products.
Ongoing development, re-design and 
re-engineering of our products reduces costs 
and improves performance. These savings 
are all passed onto our customers. 
Further detail on the number of patents we 
registered in 2013 can be found on page 12.
Focused, targeted expansion 
of the appropriate channels 
to market will support Dialight’s 
growth through 2014. ”

Strategic report
Strategic report:
The year has been impacted by 
the transition of the obstruction 
business (to a systems business 
offering monitoring and control to 
the major tower operators), and 
the continued delay in the award 
of large contracts by cell phone 
tower operators in the US. The 
performance of the traffic 
business in the US and in Europe 
was also impacted with revenues 
being down £3 million on 2012.
We suffered from the late receipt 
of orders in the Lighting segment 
as well as investment decisions by 
certain end customers, primarily 
in the US, being deferred until 
2014. When all this is taken 
together the Group managed 
to achieve underlying profit 
for the full year of £14.5 million 
(2012: £19.6 million). This reflects, 
in part, the full impact of the 
Group’s increased sales costs 
without the benefits of 
increased sales.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are described within this Financial review. The financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described below.
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with a broad spread of customers across 
different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have also considered 
the Group’s forecasts and projections. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Income statement
Revenue (excluding discontinued operations) grew by 14.0% to £131.2 million compared with 
£115.1 million in 2012. The overall growth of £16.1 million was due to significant growth in Lighting 
revenue of £23 million (50.5%) offset by reductions in revenue of £6.3 million in Signals and 
£0.6 million in Components. A combination of higher sales volume and improved margin on 
Lighting resulted in an increased contribution of £11.1 million. The positive impact of this was 
offset by lower contribution from Signals and increased operating costs.
The proportional geographical split of revenue is as follows:
2013
% of total
2012
% of total
North America 63.0% 69.5%
UK 9.2% 9.0%
Rest of Europe 13.0% 9.9%
Rest of World 14.8% 11.6%
This demonstrates the Group’s sensitivity to its North American business and the potential impact 
of changes in US Dollar exchange rates. The major currencies the Group is exposed to are the 
US Dollar and the Euro. The following exchange rates were used in translating the income statement 
and balance sheet of the Group and Company:

growth. The performance of Lighting was further enhanced with the contribution margin increasing

Signals revenue fell by 13.1% to £41.8 million. Contribution margin was lower by 5.1% and

The Components business had marginally (£0.6 million) lower sales in 2013. Contribution margin

Central overhead costs which are not allocated to the three business segments remained fairly 
static with an increase of only £0.1 million to £3.5 million in 2013. This resulted in a profit from 
operating activities (underlying) of £14.5 million (2012: £19.6 million).
In 2013 there were non-underlying costs of £2.9 million (2012: £nil) which comprised three major 
elements. First there was a charge of £1.4 million for the historic use of third party intellectual 
property rights over the past five years. Second, as part of the impairment and goodwill review, 
it was decided that the carrying value of the goodwill, intangibles and certain other assets should 
be written off in relation to the Group’s Japanese business, resulting in a charge of £0.8 million. 
Third there were severance, restructuring and other costs of £0.7 million mainly related to the 
closure of the Group’s UK research and development site.
The profit from operating activities was £11.6 million (2012: £19.6 million) after taking account of the 
non-underlying costs.

Underlying net finance expense was £0.1 million (2012: £0.1 million income) and there was 
a non-underlying finance expense of £0.3 million (2012: £0.1 million income) for changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration.
The underlying tax charge for 2013 is £4.5 million (2012: £6.5 million) which represents an 
underlying tax rate of 31.3% (2012 33.0%). This is a reduction from the effective rate in 2012 
as the mix of profit generated in the UK has increased together with the lower effective rates 
in the UK. The impact of lower future rates of UK corporation tax and the UK tax advantage 
for companies with UK patents on the products it sells should enable the Group to continue to 
marginally lower the effective rate going forward. The non-underlying expenses of £2.9 million 
gave rise to a reduction in the tax charge of £1.0 million (2012: £nil), resulting in a total tax charge 
of £3.5 million (2012: £6.5 million).
The Electromagnetic Components business which was mostly disbanded in 2012 was classified 
as a discontinued operation. The residual trading results related to this business are presented 
as a gain from discontinued operations of £0.7 million (2012: 0.1 million). For more detail of the 
gain and the tax impact please refer to note 5 of the financial statements on pages 82 and 83.
Underlying profit for the year was £9.9 million (2012: £13.2 million) and there was a net loss 
from non-underlying trading of £1.5 million (2012: £0.2m profit) resulting in a profit for the year 
of £8.4 million (2012: £13.4 million). The profit attributable to equity holders of the Company was 
£8.5 million (2012: £13.5 million) with £0.1 million due to non-controlling interests in both years.
The basic EPS from the underlying business were 30.8 pence (2012: 41.7 pence) and the total EPS 
were 26.2 pence (2012: 42.0 pence).
Balance sheet
Group net assets have increased by £3.7 million to £66.7 million (2012: £63.0 million). The main 
reason for this increase has been the increase in property, plant and equipment plus intangible 
assets of £5.4 million. The increase in working capital of £6.9 million has been largely offset 
by a corresponding reduction in cash of £7.9 million (net of the bank overdraft of £1.7 million 
shown in other payables). The working capital to sales percentage has increased from 21% 
in 2012 to 23.6% in 2013.

Cash flow
There was an overall reduction in the Group’s net cash position of £7.9 million in the year.
Cash generated from operations was £6.9 million (2012: £13.8 million). The reduction of £6.9 million 
was due mainly to two factors: underlying operating profit reduced by £5.0 million and working 
capital movements. 
Cash generated was further enhanced by £1.3 million from disposals (2012: £4.3 million). This 
was then utilised to fund capital expenditure of £9.3 million (2012: £7.0 million); of this, £4.4 million 
(2012: £2.8 million) was spent on new product development. In addition there were tax payments 
of £2.2 million (2012: £4.3 million) and dividend payments of £4.6 million (2012: £3.4 million). 
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor 
and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board 
considers consolidated total equity as capital. As at 31 December 2013 this totalled 
£66.7 million (2012: £63.0 million).
The Board’s target is to generate a return on capital in excess of 25% excluding cash holdings. 
In 2013 the return was 20.0% compared to 40.8% in 2012. 
In respect of dividend, the Board has a dividend policy and aims for three times cover.  
The result for 2013 was 1.7 times (2012: 3.2 times).
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Banking
The Company has banking relationships with Barclays Bank PLC and its US subsidiary has 
a banking relationship with Wells Fargo. The Group has a £3.0 million overdraft facility as well 
as a revolving secured credit facility of $10.0 million. The Group had utilised £1.7 million of the 
£3.0 million overdraft facility at 31 December 2013. The remaining facilities were unutilised.
The Group has relationships with Capital One in the US and SME EuroFinance in Europe 
to offer finance facilities to its customers. These facilities are not underwritten by the Group.

Performance 
review
Since our entry into the lighting market, our 
strategy has been to address sizeable niche 
markets with defensible barriers to entry and 
where reliable, efficient LED based lighting can 
produce a strong return on investment. This is 
important as we are constantly in the process 
of persuading customers of the benefit in the 
replacement of their existing conventional 
lighting fixtures with Dialight lights. These 
customers are concentrated in the industrial 
market, particularly those industries involving 
hazardous environments alongside heavy 
manufacturing, food and beverage processing, 
and peripherally, warehousing and cold 
storage. We support users in the oil and gas 
market, power generation, waste water 
treatment and many other segments where 
operations run around the clock and where 
shutdowns are both difficult and expensive. 
These markets have an existing installed base 
of conventional lighting valued at the tens of 
billions of pounds globally. Our sales of 
£68.5 million demonstrate not only the minimal 
penetration of LED lighting to date, but most 
importantly the long-term growth prospects for 
companies like Dialight who are able to offer a 
compelling proposition to customers in these 
markets and to offer savings lasting well in 
excess of ten years.
It is in these applications that Dialight’s ability 
to save more than 50% of the energy bill and 
guarantee uninterrupted lighting for up to ten 
years drives rapid paybacks and significant 
returns on investment.
Dialight serves its chosen markets on a global 
basis and has manufacturing operations in 
Brazil, Denmark, Malaysia, Mexico, the UK 
and the US to support our sales offices 
throughout the world. During 2013 our 
salesforce has increased to over 100 people 
(2012: 55) in almost 30 countries and we 
expect it will continue to grow in 2014.
This year has seen rapid progress in new 
product development. We entered the year 
with products that had just achieved an 
output efficiency of 100 lumens per watt 
and start 2014 with an industry-leading 25% 
improvement on that, allied with a ten-year 
full performance warranty, again a first in the 
industry. These improvements come in the 
main from Dialight’s own technology and the 
comprehensive vertical integration of both 
design and manufacturing of the end product. 
In addition to superior performance and 
lifetime, Dialight has delivered its first products 
equipped with integral controls and monitoring, 
allowing our users to apply control to fine tune 
the savings they can obtain from their lighting. 
The introduction of these new and superior 
products has enabled Dialight to secure some 
significant customer wins. After extensive trials 
and validation, Ford Motor Company has 
chosen Dialight’s new Vigilant range of high 
performance lights to be its preferred light 
for factory installation. First shipments have 
commenced and, while no quantities are 
guaranteed, we believe there is scope for 
significant future sales.

Signals
Although down overall, 
Obstruction posted higher 
revenues in the second half 
of 2013 than in the previous two 
halves and received significant 
customer qualifications which 
positions products well for any 
major contracts that may be 
awarded in 2014.
Much progress has been made since the 
separation from our former reseller and the 
business is no longer merely a light fixture 
business but one supplying sophisticated 
monitoring and control for Obstruction. Dialight 
is now approved as a supplier to a number 
of the major tower operators in the US and 
we believe there is significant potential in the 
Latin American market for these new products.
Within Obstruction there is a European 
business which addresses the market place 
for lights for wind turbines. This business 
showed good progress in 2013.
The balance of the Signals segment was down 
due to softness in the US traffic signals market. 
Neither Traffic nor Transportation sales are 
expected to show growth in the coming years.
Dialight has been the pioneer of LED 
technology for use in Obstruction for a number 
of years. This market did not really take off until 
2010 with the advent of an LED based white 
strobe light which addressed a market to place 
lighting on top of thousands of cellphone 
towers around the US. The potential market is 
around 80,000 towers and sales grew to almost 
£18 million in 2011 with prospects of continued 
growth. 
Up until the second half of 2012 Dialight’s 
channel to market had been primarily through 
a value added reseller. At this time this reseller 
became a competitor, the result of this was to 
stall the market at the time when a major tower 
operator was about to place contracts for a 
retrofit project of up to 7,000 towers.
In the ensuing months, our Obstruction 
business saw a significant downturn in 
revenues affecting both the second half of 
2012 and the first half of 2013. It was only in 
the second half of 2013 that we saw any sort 
of recovery which resulted in revenues in the 
second half of 2013 being 10% ahead of the 
same period in the prior year but down 20% 
on the full year of 2013.

As expected, this business is flat and while 
over time it may suffer the market fluctuations 
associated with the electronics Original 
Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) market, 
it is not expected to suffer the same degree 
of revenue fluctuation or price pressure as 
other components. Product contribution 
margins have been stable over a number of 
years and there are no significant customer 
concentration issues. Much of the business 
is transacted through distributors with over 
15,000 end customers.
Operations and Engineering
Once again our Engineering and Operations 
teams had a busy year, from the introduction 
of groundbreaking new products to establishing 
manufacturing presence in a new region, 
South America, where we are setting up 
an assembly plant in São Paulo for Industrial 
Lighting products in the Brazilian market.
Our latest product offering is the new 
125 lumens per watt Vigilant series using 
our latest Resonant Power Supply technology 
with a ten-year full performance warranty. 
This new power supply is the key to both 
the improved efficiency and the longer life 
of our light fixture. Developed in our own 
laboratories, this technology is the beginning 
of further significant developments in the ways 
that we improve the value of our products 
to our customer base. We expect to see 
further improvements and new features 
throughout the coming months.
Not only have our Industrial Lighting products 
seen the benefit of skills of our engineering 
and scientific teams, but Obstruction has been 
completely reinvented and now offers the most 
comprehensive monitoring and control systems 
on the market, offering tower operators 
significant benefits in communications and 
diagnostics with the ability to upgrade the 
system remotely.
During the year we have almost doubled 
our manufacturing space in Mexico and 
made major investments in equipment for 
both power supply and completed light 
fixture manufacturing.
Intellectual property is important to us and 
in the year we had 23 new patents granted. 
We filed 32 new applications and we had 
87 patent applications pending at the year end. 
At the end of 2013, Dialight joined the Philips 
Luminaire Licensing Programme, which gives 
access to a broad range of Philips’ intellectual 
property relating to luminaries.

Constant development
We are constantly developing 
new products for markets and 
applications that were unable 
to benefit from LED technology 
until now. Our products are also 
evolving with the integration of 
lighting controls and advanced 
power supplies.
 In January 2014 we introduced a 125+ lumens 
per watt fixture – our most economical High 
Bay yet. The 26,000+ lumen fixture can be 
used in very high ceiling applications, and can 
often eliminate the number of light fixtures 
required to illuminate an area. The product is 
backed by our industry-leading ten-year full 
performance warranty.
Vigilant LED High Bay  
125 lumens/watt
In September 2013 we once again expanded 
our product portfolio with the addition of a 
new flood light for hazardous and industrial 
applications. Its superior efficacy combined 
with its 100,000+ hour life drastically reduce 
our customers’ total cost of ownership, even 
in the most demanding environments.
Our commitment to being at the cutting edge 
of technology is evident with the release of 
our next generation SafeSite LED Linear. In 2013 
we improved fixture efficacy to 106 lumens 
per watt and reduced its weight by over 35%. 
By reducing overall fixture weight our customers 
save both time and money on installation.
SafeSite LED Flood Light
Next generation

Our system allows our customers to control 
on and off and dimming levels of individual and 
group LED light fixtures. The system can also 
be used in conjunction with daylight sensing 
or motion detection technologies and can also 
be scheduled to operate for various times of 
the day or week. The system provides our 
customers greater control, together with 
further efficiency, reliability and longevity.

With the integration of our new solid state 
power supply – the latest innovation in our 
rapid technology development programme – 
we became the first to unveil both Class I, Div 2 
and ATEX/IECEx Zone 1 hazardous location 
certified high output LED fixtures available with 
a ten-year full performance warranty. In 2013 we 
also continued to expand our SafeSite High Bay’s 
global reach with the receipt of Japan’s TIIS 
certification and Brazil’s INMETRO certification.
Providing efficiencies of up to 108 lumens per 
watt, the SafeSite LED Area Light is a powerful 
and effective lighting solution for any industrial 
and hazardous applications.
Available with a simple retrofit kit, the LED Area 
Light offers ease of installation in a compact 
form and can replace up to 250w traditional 
fixtures while consuming no more than 70w.

improvements in weight, size and efficiency. 
Impressively, the use of diamond-cut tooling  
and patented reflector-based optics enables us  
to surpass FAA light cutoff requirements by about 
six times and nearly eliminate light pollution.
The world’s first and only available LED High 
Intensity Strobe is used in obstruction lighting 
applications above 500 feet, eliminating costly 
tower climbs to replace light bulbs. During 2013 
the strobe was further developed and as a result 
the product is smaller, lighter and more efficient.

Now with Brazil’s INMETRO certification and 
emergency battery backup versions available, 
it is well positioned to capitalise on Brazil’s 
quickly growing oil and gas market.

(Brazil), and in Houston, Texas (US) and regional 
headquarters in Farmingdale, New Jersey (US).
2013 saw Dialight push the boundaries of lighting 
technology with the development and release of 
brighter and more efficient lights, but more 
importantly with the introduction of more durable 
power supplies and the integration of controls 
and networking capabilities. 
Power supplies can often be the cause of failure 
for lighting systems. We have significantly invested 
in research and development so we can offer our 
customers ultra-efficient, reliable and longer lasting 
power supplies. As a result we have developed 
and launched a new power supply, which makes 
our products up to 94% more efficient, even more 
reliable when used in extreme hazardous and 
industrial conditions, and able to last up to 200% 
longer than before.
LED technology is known for its energy saving 
qualities over traditional lighting and Dialight has 
been working hard to provide customers with more 
control over their lights and additional savings where 
possible. In April 2013 we launched our lighting 
controls system which gives customers the ability 
to control their lighting through various access 
points, including wall mountable manual controllers, 
wi-fi enabled devices (such as smartphones, 
tablets, laptops and computers), cloud-based 
controls, and integrated into an existing building 
management system. Areas of lights can also 
be connected as separate networks and can 
be independently controlled. 
The controls and networking capabilities are 
smart grid ready and offer other features including, 
but not limited to, dimming/trimming, flexible 
scheduling, daylight harvesting, and fault 
management and diagnostics. These capabilities 
can also be used in conjunction with occupancy 
and daylight sensors to further reduce usage and 
energy costs, and have been applied to both our 
Lighting and Signals products.
We have also pushed forward with the certification 
of our products. Without the required certifications 
Dialight would be unable to sell into certain 
markets. We are continually looking at global 
certifications and have developed a system to gain 
accreditation quickly and efficiently. In 2013 alone 
we gained nine certifications for the hazardous 
markets in Brazil, Canada, China, Russia and 
Kazakhstan and are looking to obtain at least 
the same number in the coming year.
The Americas generates the highest proportion 
of revenue in the Group. The brand and products 
are longer established in the region. As highlighted 
in the Performance review, the Signals segment 
was down due to delays in contract awards and our 
repositioning of the Obstruction business. However, 
this should not take away from the continual growth 
in Lighting, the profit made in Signals and the next 
generation technological developments made 
during the year.
The next generation 
of lights will provide 
customers with even 
more reliability, longevity, 
flexibility, control and 
increased energy savings. ”

Horizontal Well Drillers’ (HWD) flagship HWD1000 
rig is a 92 foot, 250 ton top drive state-of-the-art 
technology capable of 17,000 foot drilling depth 
in a fully automated round-the-clock operation 
system. The drill delivers 26,000lbs of torque 
powered by a pair of 14 litre engines delivering 
1,300hp. When operating the drill creates a 
high-vibration environment as it bores through 
layers of old compressed rock and is frequently 
transported from site to site.
HWD were using T8 fluorescent lighting on 
its sites which were not optimal as the lights 
would prematurely fail due to the unavoidable 
conditions and environment the rigs operate in. 
Aside from the initial expense of replacing the 
lighting fixtures, the procedure to replace failing 
lights was less than ideal from a safety 
perspective, requiring a rig hand to climb the 
erected structure, power to be cut temporarily, 
and production to be interrupted. As a result 
the process was always performed under strict 
time constraints, in order to restore normal 
operating conditions as quickly as possible.
When looking to replace its lighting system 
HWD found their requirements for safety, 
reliability and longevity specific to their market 
could be satisfied by Dialight’s SafeSite High 
Bay and Linear products which are Class I Div 
1 and Class I Div 2 certified. Dialight lights were 
initially installed at one site where HWD quickly 
enjoyed the benefits of substantial energy and 
maintenance savings. As a result HWD has now 
replaced the entire lighting system on four of its 
rigs with Dialight LED hazardous location rated 
fixtures and is looking to replace its lighting 
system for its whole fleet, both existing and 
new build.

Our Asian operations are relatively new to 
Dialight. 2013 saw time and effort spent further 
building our brand and laying essential foundations 
towards sustainable and continued growth. 
We increased knowledge and understanding 
of our products by delivering training to both 
our trading partners and end-users. We also 
worked to acquire regional certifications, 
which we believe will open doors to markets.
We increased our direct sales force to drive 
forward the business. Asia is an extensive 
geographical area and we continually monitor 
our business opportunities in the area. 
With expansion come challenges and our 
teams have been working hard to overcome 
difficulties associated with non-English 
speaking areas.
During the year we also worked with key mining 
companies to obtain preferred supplier status, 
thereby allowing us to develop our supply to 
this industry in the area with more ease in the 
future. We also continued to build our 
relationships with key operators in the oil and 
gas markets which has resulted in a combined 
100% sales increase in Australia since 2012. 
We continue to engage with stockists and have 
tripled our outlets in Australia in 2013 alone, 
thereby expanding our reach.
Our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia, 
was established in July 2012 and production 
began shortly thereafter. In 2013 we increased 
our manufacturing capabilities with the addition 
of a further seven production lines and six 
moulding machines. As a result we have 
dramatically increased our production efficiency 
and capabilities. The facility has to date been 
manufacturing products for the Components 
segment of our business, but from early 
2014 it is anticipated that the facility will be 
manufacturing Lighting products, including 
High Bays and Bulk Heads for delivery in this 
region. This development will allow Dialight 
to take advantage of free trade agreements 
in place between countries and allowing us 
to better support the area’s increasing sales.

LED lighting solutions for industrial and 
hazardous area applications, visit

A remote island coastal location means 
exposure to high temperatures, humidity 
and rainfall which, combined with the tough 
24-hour mining process, requires specialist 
lighting that can withstand such an environment. 
The natural resource mining company quickly 
understood the features and benefits attached 
to Dialight fixtures which addressed all the 
requirements for lighting. As a result 
they engaged with the extensive range of our 
certified and specific use fixtures to almost 
completely retrofit its existing facility.
Dialight’s DuroSite 17 ,000 lumen and 25,000 
lumen High Bays were installed in their large 
vehicle maintenance buildings. The lights 
were mounted at approximately 18 metres 
and are run 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. The inspection pit within the building 
is classified as a hazardous area. Dialight 
was able to satisfy this requirement with the 
installation of its SafeSite 24w bulkhead fixtures. 
The hazardous location rated fixtures were 
installed in the entire length of the pit to provide 
under carriage lighting for the maintenance 
of heavy vehicles.
Having experienced the benefits of Dialight’s 
fixtures and their ease of installation, they 
are now swapping out their existing lighting 
one-for-one with DuroSite 17,000 lumen High 
Bays as and when their existing lamps fail 
in its expansive workshops. They have also 
replaced all emergency eyewash stations 
lighting in their workshops with DuroSite LED 
Emergency Shower Safe Luminaires as these 
luminaires are designed to better deal with 
voltage spikes and are virtually maintenance 
free. In its warehouse, domed 17,000 lumen 
High Bays were installed to reduce glare for 
forklift drivers. A combination of DuroSite 
bulkheads and 17,000 lumen High Bays have 
also been used to illuminate walkways and 
platforms on the site.
LED StreetSense street lights were installed 
to illuminate parking areas and surrounding 
workshops and pathways as well as roadways 
leading to the processing plant. Finally, they 
used a combination of DuroSite and certified 
SafeSite products to illuminate regulated 
fuelling areas in the ship-loading areas 
of the site.

The region includes manufacturing facilities 
in Denmark and the UK and offices in Germany 
and the United Arab Emirates.
In 2013 focus has been on the growth of the 
European Obstruction business, specifically 
in the wind market and the cellular, broadcast 
and industrial market. As a result business 
has grown and we have successfully delivered 
aviation obstruction solutions for four wind 
farms in Germany and are working directly 
with a wind turbine manufacturer to deliver 
on this project. 
With increasing interest in wind farms in 
southern Africa, Dialight also worked with 
a local distributor to be the first supplier 
of Obstruction lighting solutions to this 
relatively new market which is experiencing 
rapid growth. Through agreements with 
a distributor we are able to meet all local 
requirements in project specification in 
this new and expanding geography.
2013 also saw some significant wins for 
our European Lighting business in the heavy 
industrial and oil and gas markets, noticeably 
in the United Arab Emirates. The focus on 
targeted key accounts resulted in some 
significant orders from large customers 
where Dialight lights were installed and 
continue to be installed across many sites. 
We continue to drive our channel expansion 
strategy of delivering ever-increasing reach 
and competence into our target markets. 
We also continue to invest through ongoing 
expansionary recruitment of sales professionals 
across the whole region. 
Our products have also received further 
acknowledgement for their performance 
and low energy usage. In 2013 we became 
a Carbon Trust accredited supplier in the UK. 
The Carbon Trust is an independent expert on 
carbon reduction and sustainability and helps 
organisations to reduce their carbon emissions 
and become more resource efficient.
We have gained and continue to apply for 
further certifications in the area, opening 
more doors in our targeted markets.

Energy savings are at the forefront of Koehler 
Paper Group’s (“Koehler”) objectives, so much 
so that Koehler has dedicated teams looking 
to continually improve their savings. In keeping 
with its group environmental strategy Koehler 
was looking to reduce its lighting energy 
needs as well as its maintenance costs. 
Its energy-hungry 440w metal halide lights 
were in operation 24/7 and were drawing 475w. 
With a lot of cellulose fibre in the atmosphere 
the high temperature lamps attracted dust 
which caused lens discolouration and impaired 
performance. At 17 metres mounting height it 
was a problem to access them for maintenance 
or replacement, as many were positioned over 
production machinery and processes were 
liable to be subject to disruption to allow 
maintenance to take place safely.
All existing 164 metal halide lamps were 
replaced one-for-one with Dialight’s DuroSite
®
 
Series LED High Bays each drawing only 171w 
to deliver an immediate cut in energy use 
and CO
2
 emissions. The benefits of the LED 
High Bays are evident as provided opposite. 
Additionally for Koehler, the LEDs’ low 
operating temperature avoids the problem of 
dust accumulation on the lens and consequent 
variation in colour. As sealed fittings with no 
end-of-life failures, there is no risk that parts 
can fall into the production line to contaminate 
product or cause a fire hazard and with no 
UV output they will not cause discolouration 
of product.

As Dialight continues to grow and 
remains focused on its delivery 
against market expectations, its 
approach and recognition of the 
importance of its environmental 
responsibilities, treatment of 
employees and the way it does 
business increases in parallel. 
Dialight continues to adopt 
a more cohesive and holistic 
approach to its corporate 
responsibilities through more 
centralised oversight, improved 
data gathering, more effective 
communication and the 
introduction of initiatives and 
targets to stimulate activity 
in this area.

Methodology
The data collected in 2013 has formed the 
information set for the base year of reporting 
using the financial control boundary as its 
reference point. In line with the requirements 
of the Regulations this will enable reporting 
on the degree of change with reference to 
the 2013 data. The collection of data this year 
will enable the business to identify trends, set 
appropriate key performance indicators and 
seek out opportunities for emission reductions 
in future years. Data has been collated utilising 
a uniform methodology to ensure accurate 
reporting. Data sources included utility bills 
and meter readings, business travel in company 
owned and leased vehicles, and outcomes 
of maintenance activities involving refrigerant 
gases. Calculations of emissions for the period 
have been based where possible against the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs (“Defra”) published emission factors. 
Where this has not been possible assumptions 
have been made based on available UK 
data to provide consistency in the reporting 
methodology. Similarly, where data has 
not been available, a standard methodology 
of proportionality of emissions has been 
utilised based on facility footprint.
Environmental responsibilities
Environmental management system
Dialight’s environmental management system 
(“EMS”) continues to be certified to ISO 14001 
across its European business. The EMS has 
been subject to two external audits by British 
Standards Institute (“BSI”) to ensure continued 
compliance with the standard. 
Certified sites are located in Denmark, Germany 
and the UK. The scope of the registration is 
environmental management in the design 
and manufacture of electrical and electronic 
components and sub-assemblies. The EMS 
includes procedures for the management of 
waste, trade effluent, hazardous substances, 
environmental processes and procedures, 
enforcement actions, and compliance with 
regulatory frameworks and legislation. 
An internal safety and sustainability portal 
has also been created to make EMS 
documents also readily available.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Dialight is now required to report its annual 
greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
(“Regulations”). Dialight has responded to 
this new obligation by collating data throughout 
2013 and will report against its emissions for 
the full year to 31 December 2013, in parallel 
with the Company’s financial reporting 
year end.
Strategic report:
2013 review:  Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013 31

Strategic report
Waste management
At the start of the year a study was undertaken 
to establish which waste materials were 
currently being recycled across the Group, and 
where opportunities for recycling were available 
but not currently being implemented. This 
encouraged management to make informed 
decisions on the most appropriate available 
waste stream for the range of materials being 
disposed of.
As a result of this activity Dialight now has three 
zero waste to landfill sites in Australia, Denmark 
and the UK. Additionally, the variety of waste 
recycled across the business as a whole has 
increased with locations being supported in 
identifying where additional recycling potential 
exists and what facilities are available to 
minimise waste to landfill.
Across the business as a whole 1,228 tonnes 
of solid waste has been recycled, this significantly 
reduces the overall environmental impact of 
Dialight’s business activities as well as resulting 
in savings for the business. 
Environmental registrations
Dialight is registered and discharges its duties 
in relation to packaging waste, Waste Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment Regulations (“WEEE”) 
waste, batteries and trade effluent. Dialight 
holds the following registrations with regards 
to environmental management required as 
a result of its activities and undertakings: 
WEEE (Germany and the UK) Packaging 
Waste Obligation (Germany and the UK), 
Battery Recycling (Germany), Trade effluent 
(UK), ISO 14001 Environmental Management 
System (Denmark, Germany and the UK), 
Non-Hazardous Waste Producer (Mexico) 
and Hazardous Waste Producer (UK).
Environmental enforcement actions 
and governance
There were no environmental enforcement 
actions or statutory nuisance control orders 
issued against Dialight in 2013. Dialight works 
with all relevant regulatory organisations to 
ensure risks to the environment as a result 
of its undertakings are minimised, and that 
all legal obligations are met.
There were no environmental incidents 
(unintentional emissions to air, land or water) 
as a result of Dialight’s undertakings in 2013.
Greenhouse gas emissions continued
Intensity ratio
To enable year-on-year comparison of its 
greenhouse gas emissions an intensity ratio 
has been determined. This is based on the 
tonnes of greenhouse gas used during the year 
expressed as tonnes CO
2
e per £1 million of 
turnover; for 2013 this has been calculated 
as 44.66 tonnes CO
2
e emitted per £1 million, 
of turnover.
Assurance
Data was collected and collated in accordance 
with the Defra recommendations and the 
methodology was independently assessed by 
Ricardo-AEA and found to be fit for purpose.
Energy and water use
The Company is required to report on energy 
and water use as part of its environmental 
management reporting. The data for this 
is produced for the Group as a whole 
and by each location.
Operations across the Group consumed 
the following resources:

Ethical business
The Code of Business Conduct
Dialight’s Code of Business Conduct (“CBC”) 
was introduced during 2011 and formalised the 
expected standards of behaviour and conduct 
that were applicable to employees and third 
parties engaged on the Group’s business. The 
CBC contains guidance on general standards 
of conduct, corporate hospitality and gifts, 
bribery and corruption, conflicts of interest, 
confidentiality, fraud, political and charitable 
donations, employment, health and safety, 
relationships with third parties, the community 
and the environment. All parts of the CBC are 
underpinned by a number of supporting policies.
Anti-bribery and corruption
Dialight is committed to conducting all its 
business in an honest and ethical manner. 
We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption and are committed to acting 
professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our 
business dealings and relationships wherever 
we operate, as well as implementing and 
enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.
The workplace
Health and safety
Dialight is committed to providing a safe 
working environment for all employees across all 
locations and activities, from production teams 
to lone working sales force team members.
The Group Chief Executive and Board 
acknowledge their responsibility for health 
and safety and continually act to identify 
opportunities for improvement, maintain 
regulatory compliance, and ensure safe 
environments for employees, and visitors 
to our buildings alike through delegated 
actions by senior management at each 
location, coordinated by the Group Health 
and Safety Committee.
Health and safety is a standing item on 
the Board meeting agenda and includes 
information collated from senior management 
reports to provide the Board with full visibility of 
any major safety concerns within the business.
During 2013 Dialight rolled out a Group wide 
Safety Management System designed to give 
all senior managers the tools to ensure safety 
within their areas of control. This is freely 
available on the Company intranet and offers 
guidance on good behaviours and best 
practice for all activities being undertaken. 
Work continues to fully embed this new 
system into the organisation.

employment and promotion will be based 
on ability and merit. The Board of Dialight has 
considered the recommendations of the Davies 
report published in 2011 and confirms its 
commitment to the recruitment and promotion 
of all individuals throughout the Group, 
including those at Board and Executive level, 
on the grounds of ability and merit only. 
No discrimination of any kind is tolerated.
Dialight is a global company with a global 
workforce whose diversity contributes to 
Dialight’s success. Regular review of the 
composition of the Group’s employees will

 » The Group’s sales and profits 
may be impacted by spending slowdowns 
and/or increasing inflationary pressures.
 » A continuing significant slowdown in economic 
conditions globally and in certain territories such 
as North America could have a material effect 
on sales and operating profit, in particular for the 
Components segment. Increasing inflationary 
pressures on areas such as raw material and 
sub-contract costs may have an adverse impact 
on operating margins. The current adverse 
conditions for public organisations to reduce 
and/or defer their capital spending budgets 
may impact on sales of some of our products.
 » We closely monitor the general electronics 
demand index as well as industry forecasts 
so as to become aware of market trends.
 » Monthly data provided by distributors in 
America is examined, documented and 
reviewed as this is also considered to provide 
valuable information on market demand. 
 » National and local policies, with regard to energy 
savings in a number of areas such as transport 
and communication, are constantly evolving. 
This should favour Dialight’s efforts in growing 
sales in some key niche current and potential 
opportunities identified by the Signals segment. 
Additionally, legislation may introduce new higher 
and more exacting specifications for existing 
products which will require product re-design 
and regulatory re-certification. Therefore, changes 
in product specifications should favour Dialight 
in giving it an advantage over competition.
 » It is Dialight’s policy to operate in highly 
regulated markets which require suppliers 
to achieve compliance with demanding 
product standards.
 » Our design and engineering departments 
have a proven track record in technical ability 
evidenced by strong working relationships 
with customers and regulatory bodies, the 
design and introduction of new products and 
a portfolio of registered intellectual property.
The principal risks and uncertainties which could affect the Group are identified below. 
There may be other risks and uncertainties which are not yet known or which are currently 
considered to be immaterial, but later turn out to have a material impact. Some of the 
areas set out will be outside of the Company’s influence or control. Should any risk 
actually materialise then Dialight’s business, financial condition, prospects and share 
price could be materially adversely affected.  Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013 35

Governance:
Dialight is incorporated as a public limited 
company and is registered in England with the 
registered number 2486024. The Company’s 
registered office is Exning Road, Newmarket, 
Suffolk CB8 0AX (“Registered Office”). 
The Board of Dialight presents its Corporate 
governance and Directors’ report (“Report”) and 
the audited financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2013. The Strategic report can 
be found on pages 6 to 37 which, together with 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee, are 
incorporated by reference into this Report and, 
accordingly, should be read as part of this Report.
Code
In accordance with the Code, Dialight is required 
to describe its corporate governance from two 
points of view: the first dealing generally with the 
application of the Code’s main principles and the 
second dealing specifically with non‑compliance 
with any of the Code’s provisions. It is the view 
of the Board that Dialight has been compliant 
with the provisions of the Code throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2013 with 
the following exceptions:
I.  disclosure of policy and objectives regarding 
diversity (B.2.4); and
II.  conducting an external Board evaluation (B.6.2).
The Board formally adopted a statement in relation 
to its approach to diversity in December 2013 and 
this can be found in the Nominations Committee 
report on page 44. Dialight was therefore 
non‑compliant in that this action had not been 
taken at the beginning of the year but it is felt 
that this now meets the requirements of the 
Code going forwards. Similarly, the Board took 
the view that the appointment of two additional 
Non‑Executive Directors at the beginning of 
2013 made it necessary to delay the conduct 
and completion of an external Board evaluation. 
However, it is expected that the Board will seek 
to conduct an external Board evaluation during 
2014 that will consider the work of the Board 
and its Committees during both 2013 and 2014 
and will provide a full report on the outcomes 
following this review in the 2014 Annual Report.
Leadership
Our governance structure
The Board is accountable to the Group’s 
stakeholders, including its shareholders, 
for the standards of governance operated 
throughout the Group and at all operating 
locations. Specific responsibilities are delegated 
to the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees and these are documented through 
the relevant committee terms of reference. 
The Dialight Board further delegates authority, 
within clearly defined limits, for the day‑to‑day 
management of the Group to the Executive 
Directors (“Executive”). The Executive, in turn, 
may further delegate this authority to senior 
management or Directors of Group subsidiary 
companies. Levels of authority delegated to the 
Executive, senior management and Directors 
of Group subsidiaries are reviewed from time 
to time.
The matters reserved for Board decision and 
the committee terms of reference are reviewed 
on an annual basis. These are available on 
the Company’s website at www.dialight.com, 
or from the Company Secretary at the 
Company’s Registered Office.
The Board
The Board has adopted a formal schedule 
of matters that are specifically reserved for 
its decision including the approval of annual 
and interim results; the recommendation of 
dividends; approval of annual budgets; review 
of Group strategic plans; the approval of larger 
capital expenditure and investment proposals; 
review of the overall system of internal control 
and risk management; and the review of 
corporate governance arrangements. 
Corporate 
governance and 
Directors’ report Leadership continued
The Board continued
The Board confirms that it has conducted 
a review of the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2013 covering all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. 
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during 
2013 including a three‑day annual strategy and 
planning meeting in the US as well as meeting 
on a number of other occasions as the situation 
and circumstances required. Further details of 
Directors’ attendance at all scheduled meetings 
of the Board and its Committees can be found in 
the table above. There are eight Board meetings 
scheduled to take place in 2014. 
Board agendas are prepared by the Chairman 
in conjunction with the Group Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary. At each meeting 
the Board is provided with information on the 
financial and trading performance of businesses 
within the Group, and of the Group as a whole, 
together with reports on operations, health and 
safety, markets and other relevant issues. Board 
and Committee papers are distributed to Directors 
in advance of Board and Committee meetings 
to facilitate informed debate at the meeting.
Board composition
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Executive and four Non‑Executive 
Directors. Following Bill Ronald’s appointment 
as Group Chairman following the retirement 
of Harry Tee CBE on 12 September 2012, 
Robert Lambourne assumed Bill Ronald’s 
existing responsibilities and became Acting 
Senior Independent Director and Acting Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee until additional 
directors were appointed. Stephen Bird and 
Tracey Graham became Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
respectively with effect from 21 February 2013, 
at which point Robert Lambourne relinquished 
these additional responsibilities. Mark Fryer was 
Group Finance Director during the year but left 
the Board on 15 January 2014. A successor 
is currently in the process of being recruited 
for this position.
All of the Non‑Executive Directors are considered 
to be independent in accordance with the Code 
Governance
 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013 41
www.dialight.com
and it is thought that the current balance on 
the Board ensures that no individual or group 
dominates the Board’s decision making process. 
The Board reconsidered this position during 
2013 as part of its normal year‑end compliance 
review. It was noted that although there was 
a commercial relationship between Dialight 
Europe Limited, a Group subsidiary company, 
and DS Smith Packaging Limited, where 
Richard Stuckes is an Executive Director, 
the Board agreed that this relationship was 
of such a level and materiality that there was 
no impact on Richard Stuckes’ independence.
The Board have reconfirmed that the 
Non‑Executive Directors are independent of 
management and are free from any relationship 
which could affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement and therefore 
meet the criteria set out in the Code.
All Directors’ biographies appear on pages 
38 and 39. The Dialight Board demonstrate 
a range of experience that brings independent 
judgement to issues of strategy, performance, 
resources and standards of conduct which 
are vital to the future success of the Group. 
The Board has considered and confirmed 
that each Non‑Executive Director continues 
to demonstrate that he has sufficient time 
to devote to the Company’s business.
All Non‑Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and assist in developing the strategy 
of the Group and scrutinise the performance of 
management against the Group’s objectives and 
strategy. The Chairman holds meetings with the 
Non‑Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present on a range of matters whilst 
the Senior Independent Director does the same 
with other Non‑Executive Directors as part of 
the Chairman’s annual performance appraisal 
as well as on such other occasions as required.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for aiding 
the Board in managing its financial reporting 
responsibilities and oversees Dialight’s reporting, 
risk management and internal control systems 
and process. The report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on pages 45 to 48.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines 
the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and the Company Secretary whilst 
monitoring the levels of remuneration of those 
individuals defined as senior management by the 
Dialight Board. The report of the Remuneration 
Committee can be found on pages 52 to 66.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is responsible for 
the structure, size and composition of the Board. 
This ensures that the correct balance of skills 
and experience are present to assist the 
Company as it continues to grow and provides 
for appropriate discussion around succession. 
The report of the Nominations Committee can 
be found on page 44.
Responsibilities
The Board has established and approved clearly 
established roles for the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive and the Senior Independent Director. 
Individual, documented role statements are 
available on the Company’s website or from 
the Company Secretary at the Company’s 
Registered Office.
Group Chief Executive
The Group Chief Executive has delegated 
responsibility for the management of the Group’s 
day‑to‑day operations. In addition he is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of strategic 
options for the Group’s growth in shareholder 
value and sets the operating plans and budgets 
required to deliver the agreed strategy. The 
Group Chief Executive is also responsible for 
ensuring that the Group maintains appropriate 
risk management and control mechanisms.
The Chairman
In addition to other matters, the Chairman 
has responsibility for the leadership of the 
Board, ensuring the effectiveness of the Board, 
organising and planning Board meetings 
and the effective and timely communication 
of information to shareholders.

Responsibilities continued
The Chairman continued
The Chairman provides advice, counsel and 
support to the Group Chief Executive as and 
when required and maintains open and continual 
contact with the Non‑Executive Directors to allow 
any issues to be addressed outside of the formal 
scope of the regular Board meetings.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director takes 
responsibility for meeting with the Non‑Executive 
Directors as part of the Chairman’s annual 
performance appraisal as well as on such 
other occasions as required and addressing 
shareholder concerns where the normal 
channels of Group Chairman or Group 
Chief Executive fail to resolve an issue 
or where such contact is inappropriate.
Commitment
Service contracts of the Executive and 
the terms and conditions of appointment 
of the Non‑Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s Registered 
Office during normal business hours on any 
weekday (except Bank Holidays) and at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Further 
details of these can be found in the Report 
of the Remuneration Committee on page 58.
Development
All new Directors receive a full and formal 
induction programme on joining the Board. 
This includes the provision of information 
on the Group, its products and markets, 
financial information and general advice on 
Directors’ duties under the CA 2006 and 
the Listing Rules. Visits to Group locations 
also form part of the process, as do meetings 
with key Senior management.
Further training needs are provided as required 
following discussion between individual Directors 
and the Chairman. Any resources required in this 
respect are provided by the Company.
Information and support
The Company Secretary, in accordance with 
guidance from the Chairman, takes the lead 
on ensuring that the Board and its Committees 
receive the necessary information that they 
require to operate efficiently. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to 
the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with. The Company 
Secretary is also responsible for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all matters of 
governance and best practice. In addition, the 
Company Secretary ensures that the Directors 
receive appropriate training as necessary. 
Directors may take independent professional 
advice on any matter at the Company’s expense 
if they deem it necessary in order to carry out 
their responsibilities effectively. No such advice 
was taken during the year.
Evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
has recently been by way of responses to 
a questionnaire issued to all members of 
the Board. Feedback from these questionnaires 
has then been gathered and collated by the 
Company Secretary for presentation to the Board 
in order to facilitate discussion. The Chairman 
is responsible for conducting the performance 
evaluation of the Group Chief Executive. 
The Non‑Executive Directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director, are responsible 
for evaluating the performance of the Chairman 
and the Group Chief Executive conducts 
evaluations of any other members of the 
Executive and Senior management. No such 
review was undertaken during 2013. Instead, 
the decision was made that an external 
evaluation would be undertaken during 2014 
to enable the new members of the Board to 
have sufficient time in order to gain experience 
of the Company so that maximum benefit from 
all Board members could be gained from the 
exercise. Conducting an external evaluation 
too early was considered to be wrong approach 
and one that would not provide the best use 
of an externally facilitated review.
Re‑ election
The Board has decided to adopt provision 
B.7.1 of the Code so that all Directors will 
stand for re‑election on an annual basis. 
How we engage with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given 
high priority. Although overall responsibility for 
ensuring that there is effective communication 
with investors lies with the Chairman, on a 
day‑to‑day basis the Board’s primary contact 
with major shareholders is via the Executive.
The Non‑Executive Directors are kept appraised 
of shareholder views through the provision of 
a report at each Board meeting on shareholder 
activity, and where possible analyst briefings and 
feedback from results road shows. In addition, 
all Directors are offered invitations to attend all 
presentations and meetings with shareholders.
The AGM
The AGM presents an additional opportunity 
to communicate with private and institutional 
investors. The Chairman aims to ensure that 
the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees are available at these 
meetings to answer questions.
Each substantially separate issue is proposed 
as a separate resolution. Details of resolutions 
to be proposed, and shareholders’ options for 
voting, at the forthcoming AGM can be found in 
the separate circular to shareholders. The Notice 
of the AGM (“Notice”) and related documents 
are sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the date of the meeting.
The Company’s forthcoming AGM will take 
place at 11.30am on 16 April 2014 at Glaziers 
Hall, 9 Montague Close, London Bridge, 
London SE1 9DD. 44 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Governance:
Objectives
The Nominations Committee leads the process for 
all Board appointments, making recommendations 
to the Board where required. It is responsible for 
reviewing the size, structure and composition of 
the Board, giving consideration to the provision 
of adequate succession planning for the 
Executive and Senior management, and making 
recommendations regarding re‑election and 
re‑appointment of Directors should this be 
required. In appropriate cases, recruitment 
consultants are engaged to assist with any 
recruitment process. 
Membership
All members of the Board excluding the 
Group Finance Director were members of the 
Committee during the year under review and, 
with the exception of Roy Burton, are considered 
independent pursuant to the Code. Appointments 
to the Committee are made by the Board. 
Only members of the Committee have a right 
to attend meetings. Other individuals may be 
invited to attend for all or any part of a meeting, 
where appropriate. 
Meetings
The number of meetings attended by 
members of the Committee can be found 
in the table on page 41. 
Activities during the year
During the year the Committee undertook 
the following actions:
 » Completed the search, selection and 
appointment of two new Non‑Executive 
Directors in January 2013. This process 
had been undertaken with the support and 
assistance of Egon Zehnder International AG.
 » Considered the re‑appointment of 
Robert Lambourne as a Non‑Executive Director 
of the Company following his completion of 
three years’ service on the Board. 
The Committee will lead the search for the 
recruitment of a permanent replacement 
for Mark Fryer as Group Finance Director in 
conjunction with Independent Search Partnership. 
Neither Egon Zehnder International AG or the 
Independent Search Partnership has any other 
connection with the Company. 
Diversity
The Board of Dialight has considered the 
recommendations of the Davies Report published 
in 2011 and confirms its commitment to the 
recruitment and promotion of all individuals 
throughout the Group, including those at Board 
and Executive level, on the grounds of ability and 
merit only. No discrimination of any kind is tolerated.
Dialight is a global company with a global 
workforce whose diversity contributes to 
Dialight’s success. Regular review of the 
composition of the Group’s employees will 
provide the necessary information required for 
the Board and Senior management to address 
any issues that could negatively impact this 
approach and commitment.
Further details on Dialight’s workforce diversity 
can be found on page 33.

Objectives
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing 
a wide range of matters which are detailed in 
the Committee’s terms of reference available on 
the Company’s website and from its Registered 
Office. The responsibilities can be found below. 
The Committee reports to the Board on how 
it has discharged its responsibilities. 
Membership
All members of the Committee served 
throughout the year and are considered 
independent pursuant to the Code. The Board 
considers that the Committee Chairman has 
recent and relevant financial experience and 
an understanding of accounting and financial 
issues relevant to the industries in which 
the Group operates.
Meetings
Committee meetings are attended by the 
auditors at the invitation of the Committee 
Chairman to ensure full communication of 
matters relating to the audit.
Key responsibilities
The Committee’s key responsibilities include:
» monitoring the Group’s financial reporting; 
» internal controls and risk management systems;
» operation of confidential disclosure policy;
» monitor and review the effectiveness of the 
Internal audit function; and
» oversee the relationship with the external 
auditors and the effectiveness of the 
external audit.
Activities during the year
During the year under review the Group 
delivered profit at a level that was lower than 
expectations. As a matter of good governance, 
the Audit Committee, following discussion with 
the full Board, has undertaken an assessment 
of the Group’s forecasting and performance 
process. The Audit Committee was supported 
in this by KPMG, which was engaged to provide 
critical challenge of the 2013 reforecasting and 
2014 forecasting process. This assessment has 
highlighted a number of process improvements, 
the implementation of which has begun. The review 
has been fully embraced by the Interim Chief 
Financial Officer. It is envisaged that, following 
completion of these improvements, the Group 
will have a much more robust and focused 
system of internal control that will support 
Dialight’s growth in the coming years.
The following were identified as key areas of 
judgement following a discussion with KPMG 
at the Committee’s planning meeting in respect 
of the 2013 external audit.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating 
units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from 
the combination. The recoverable amounts 
of the CGUs are determined from value 
in use calculations. 
The Committee considered a paper presented 
by the Senior management that set out how 
all CGUs had been re‑tested in December 2013, 
based on sales projections used in Dialight’s 
three‑year strategy model along with details 
of the assumptions and outcome of these 
tests. The Committee concluded on this 
evidence that there was no need for any 
adjustments to be made to the longer‑term 
expectations for the CGUs. 
It was agreed that goodwill in Dialight Japan KK 
would be written down to £nil owing to the lack 
of any significant progress on sales, the termination 
of the management team during the year and its 
likely closure in the near future.

Activities during the year continued
Inventory valuation
Dialight operates in an industry whereby 
developments in product technology may 
result in inventory becoming slow moving or 
obsolete, which in turn may mean that inventory 
cannot be sold or sales prices are discounted 
to less than the inventory carrying value. This 
could result in a material impairment of the 
inventory balance.
The Committee considered a paper from Senior 
management and noted that the increase in 
the amount of inventory held at year end 
was the result of lower sales during Q4 2013. 
It reviewed the provision for excess and obsolete 
inventory and noted that the level of provision 
and the methodology applied were appropriate 
to the circumstances.
Revenue recognition
Dialight’s business encounters a high volume 
of transactions close to the year end due to 
customer requirements. The Group also has 
a number of customers who have different 
contractual terms, meaning that the risks 
and rewards transfer at different timings 
(such as on dispatch, on receipt at port 
of destination and on receipt by customer).
The combination of these factors results in an 
increased risk that revenue may not be recognised 
in the correct period. Following discussions with 
management, the Committee was satisfied that 
the Group’s revenue recognition policies had been 
applied in all material respects. The Committee 
considered the comments of the auditors around 
revenue recognition and noted the suggested 
improvement opportunities around revenue 
recognition timing and the documentation 
of sales timings.
Development costs
Capitalised development costs increased in 
the year, particularly in the second half of 2013, 
mainly due to the obstruction controls project. 
Total development costs of £4.5m were incurred 
in the period (2012: £5.2m), of which £3.0m or 
64% has been capitalised (2012: £2.7m or 47%). 
The book value of capitalised development 
at 31 December 2013 was £5.9m an increase 
of £2.1m from last year. 
The Committee considered the process by which 
development expenditure was capitalised and 
noted that this was set out in the Group Controls 
Manual (“GCM”). The Committee noted that 
process has operated adequately during the 
year, although improvement opportunities 
were identified in the standardisation of 
documentation across the Group. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management 
and for reviewing its effectiveness on an annual 
basis. Such systems can only be designed to 
manage, and not eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. They can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. This responsibility 
has been delegated to the Audit Committee.
Set out opposite are those elements of the 
Group’s existing system of internal controls 
that have operated during 2013. Where potential 
weaknesses have been identified or further work 
is required this has been noted.

Risk management and internal control continued
  M a n a g emen t 
structure
There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board and specific responsibility is given to the 
Executive for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. The Executive meets regularly with Senior management of the operating 
businesses on a range of issues.
  R i s k m a n a g emen t
The agreed process for the management and mitigation of risks within the business has involved the production of risk registers by 
certain parts of the business that are then reviewed centrally on a quarterly basis. Outcomes are then considered by the Executive and 
formalised as the Group’s principal risks at the end of each financial year. Changes in personnel and reporting lines have impacted 
the operation of this process during the year and so a full review will be undertaken in the first half of the year to establish a more 
effective and formal process of risk reporting and management. 
  G r o u p ’ s c om p l ia n c e 
framework
CBC: 
The CBC sets out the standards for what Dialight believes constitute acceptable behaviour for all employees as well as the 
Group’s dealings with shareholders, customers, suppliers and agents and its impact on the environment and the community. 
The CBC is underpinned by a number of supporting policies. Both the CBC and the supporting policies contain provisions 
that cover implementation, compliance and monitoring to ensure consistency of application throughout the Group. A review 
of compliance with the CBC takes place at the end of each year. 
GCM:
The GCM provides detail concerning delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control 
procedures together with accounting policies and procedures. This was introduced during the year.
  Quality and integrity  
of personnel  
Recruitment and training: 
High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment. High recruitment standards and ongoing development 
and training will ensure Dialight manages to attract and retain the most suitable people. Appointments of senior HR professionals within 
the business have provided the foundations for consistent and effective HR practices throughout the Group that will support this goal. 
  F i n a n c i a l i nf o r m a t i o n
In order to control the business the Board has a planning, budgeting and forecasting system.
Each year the Board approves the updated documents. Key risk areas are identified, reported to the Board and 
debated with management.
Performance is monitored against budget or latest forecast as appropriate and the prior year. Relevant actions are 
identified and management is charged with implementing.
The Board receives and reviews monthly management accounts and considers the likely outturn for the year in light of the 
information received. Formal reforecasts are undertaken at the appropriate time of year to ensure that the Board is monitoring 
the development of the business towards its targets. Performance against budget or forecast is closely monitored. 
In the light of the failure to reach expectations during 2013, the Board has undertaken a review of Dialight’s forecasting function 
and is implementing additional measures to make this process more robust and to provide forecasts with the best possible 
view of the forward trading of the businesses, which include:
» recognising that spend on our products tends to be one off, capital in nature and subject to the fluctuation of corporate 
budget constraints; and
» a more holistic approach to forecasting involving a wider span of management and a greater degree of hard challenge 
from the Executive.
The Executive submits papers to the Board on a monthly basis that focus on key developments, performance and issues 
in the business. The report from the Group Finance Director is to be expanded to cover a wider variety of issues this year.
  I n v e st m e n t a ppr a i s a l
Capital expenditure and research and development projects are regulated by budgetary process and authorisation levels set out 
in the GCM. For expenditure beyond specified levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board for approval. 
Reviews are carried out after the acquisition is complete and, for some projects during the acquisition period, to monitor 
expenditure; major overruns are investigated. Due diligence work is carried out if a business is to be acquired.
  A u d it C o m m it t e e
The Audit Committee monitors, through reports to it by the Group Finance Director, the controls that are in force and any perceived 
gaps in the control environment. The Audit Committee also considers and determines relevant action in respect of any control 
issues raised by these reports or the external auditors, as well as considering issues raised in accordance with the Group’s 
Confidential Disclosure Policy.
  I n t e rn a l a u d i t
Peer group financial control reviews are carried out by the Head of Internal Audit, overseen by the Group Finance Director. The Group 
also undertakes external assessment of aspects of its systems where necessary. The Audit Committee agrees the annual scope of 
these reviews and assessments in advance which may be revised from time to time according to changing business requirements 
and circumstances. Reporting of both these findings is initially to Executive management to seek response and corrective actions 
which are then reported to the Audit Committee.
  In s ur a n c e
The Group maintains insurance cover to insure all major risk areas based on the scale of the risk and availability of 
cover in the external market.
  L e g al an d 
compliance
Reports are presented to the Board on any material legal or compliance issues that may impact the Group.
  Co m p l i a n c e  
with controls
A process of control risk self‑assessment is used in the Group where senior managers are required to detail and certify controls 
in operation to ensure the control environment in their business area is appropriate. They also confirm monthly, in writing, that risk 
management processes and appropriate controls are in place and are operating effectively. 48 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013
www.dialight.com
Internal audit
The Committee has oversight of the internal 
audit process. The table on page 47 sets out 
the Group’s current approach to internal audit. 
The Committee considers whether these remain 
appropriate and suitable for the needs of 
the Group on a regular basis.
External auditor – appointment 
and independence
The Committee considers the cost effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of KPMG, the 
external auditors, on a regular basis, agrees 
their levels of remuneration and reviews the 
extent of non‑audit services provided by 
KPMG during the year.
Committee meetings are attended by the 
auditors at the invitation of the Committee 
Chairman to ensure full communication of 
matters relating to the audit. The Committee 
also meets with the auditors without the 
Executive Directors present to discuss 
the adequacy of controls and any material 
judgemental areas.
The auditors bi‑annually confirm their 
policies to ensure independence and provide 
the Committee with a report on their own 
internal quality control procedures.
Resolutions to appoint auditors to the Company 
and to authorise the Board to determine 
the auditors’ remuneration will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM.
The performance of KPMG is reviewed on 
an annual basis by the Committee following 
completion of the audit, taking account of Senior 
management and Executive feedback together 
with a review of the level of service provided by 
the auditors to the Group. The Committee is 
satisfied with the current auditors’ effectiveness. 
KPMG have been in place as the auditors 
of Dialight since 2005, a total of nine years. 
The Committee will consider conducting 
a full tender exercise during 2015.
Non-audit services
Prior approval of the provision of any non‑audit 
services must be provided by the Group Finance 
Director, although assignments with proposed 
fees over £20,000 require the approval of the 
Committee as a whole. This serves to ensure that 
independence is maintained and other potential 
providers of the service under discussion have 
also been adequately considered. 
Details of all fees paid to the external auditors can 
be found on page 86 of the financial statements. 
During the year under review KPMG have been 
engaged for certain non‑audit related assignments 
primarily in respect of pensions and tax advisory 
work. As previously stated, the Committee 
has also engaged KPMG to assist with its 
assessment of the Group’s forecasting and 
performance process by providing critical 
challenge. The decision to appoint KPMG 
to undertake this work was made following 
consideration of the scope and potential 
outcomes of this assessment. The Audit 
Committee weighed up the value added by 
using a provider with detailed knowledge of 
the business against any threats to the auditors’ 
independence and the extent to which these 
could be mitigated. The work was scoped 
to ensure that KPMG would not perform any 
management functions or take on any of the 
responsibilities of Executive management. Whilst 
some parts of the assignment were conducted 
by the audit team, key aspects were led by 
members of KPMG’s advisory team who have 
not had any previous involvement with Dialight 
or any subsequent involvement with the audit. 
The Audit Committee was thus satisfied that 
the independence and objectivity of the auditors 
would be safeguarded.

Financial risk management
Risk management objectives and policies, including 
hedging policies and exposure (including price, 
credit, liquidity or cash flow risk) of the Company 
in relation to the use of financial instruments, are 
contained in note 23 of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements on page 97.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend of 9.5 pence 
per share, making a total dividend for the year 
of 14.4 pence per share (2012: 13.5 pence per 
share). Subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM, the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 June 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 2 May 2014. 
Auditors
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
The Directors further confirm that they have taken 
all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and have ensured that the auditors are 
aware of such information. In light of organisational 
changes within KPMG, the Board has agreed 
that KPMG Audit Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of KPMG LLP , will step down as auditors at the 
forthcoming AGM and that a resolution to appoint 
KPMG LLP as auditors and to authorise the 
Directors to set their remuneration will be proposed.
Share capital and structure 
As at 31 December 2013 the Company had 
32,359,892 fully paid ordinary shares of 1.89 pence 
each in issue which are listed on the Main Market 
of the London Stock Exchange. The Company 
has a single class of shares. There are no specific 
restrictions on the transfer of the Company’ s shares, 
although the Articles of Association (“Articles”) 
contain provisions whereby Directors may refuse 
to register a transfer of a certificated share which 
is not fully paid. 
No shares have been issued that carry any 
special rights with regard to the control of the 
Company. Each ordinary share carries the right 
to one vote at general meetings of the Company. 
During the year the Company issued 209,661 
ordinary shares to satisfy existing awards pursuant 
to the Company’s Performance Share Plan 
and Annual Performance Bonus Plan.
The rights and obligations attached to the 
Company’ s shares are contained in the Company’s 
Articles, a copy of which can be obtained from 
the Registered Office. The Articles may only be 
amended by a special resolution of the Company 
at a general meeting. No one person has any 
special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all shares are fully paid. 
Subject to statutory provisions, the rights 
attached to a class of shares may be varied 
whether or not the Company is being wound 
up in accordance with the Articles. 
At the 2013 AGM shareholders granted 
the Directors the authority to purchase up 
to 3,215,023 ordinary shares in the Company 
which will expire on 30 June 2014. A resolution 
to renew this authority will be put to shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM.
The Directors have the power to issue and buy 
back shares in the Company, as well as to grant 
options over or otherwise dispose of unissued 
shares in the Company, to such persons, at such 
times and on such terms as they think proper.
Full details of the Company’s share capital 
are given in note 35 to the accounts. 
Directors’ interests and  
Company share plans
The interests of the Directors and their families 
in the shares of the Company can be found 
in the Report of the Remuneration Committee 
on pages 52 to 66, together with details of 
the Directors’ service contracts. 
Significant agreements/change of control
The Directors are not aware of there being any 
significant agreements that contain any material 
change of control provisions to which the 
Company is a party. 
The Company currently operates two share 
plans: a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) and 
the Annual Performance Bonus Plan (“APBP”). 
Further details of these are provided in the 
Report of the Remuneration Committee on 
pages 52 to 66.
The rules of the PSP provide that, in the event 
of a change of control through a general offer 
or scheme of arrangement, shares subject to 
awards under the PSP could be released within 
one month of the date of notification of the likely 
change of control. 
The Company has established the Dialight 
Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust 
(“ESOT”) in which all employees of the Group, 
including Executive Directors, are potential 
beneficiaries. The ESOT held 2,514 shares at 
31 December 2013 (2012: 47,596). Since the 
year end a further 143,368 shares have been 
issued to the ESOT in order to satisfy existing 
awards under the Group’s share plans. Its current 
shareholding is 17,551 ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company. The Trustees of the 
ESOT retain the voting rights over the shares 
held in the ESOT and may exercise these rights 
independent of the interests of the Company.

Governance:
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
Group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
 » select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently; 
 » make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 » for the Group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
 » for the parent company financial statements, 
state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in 
the parent company financial statements; and 
 » prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the group and the parent 
company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the parent company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Strategic 
report, Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and Corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
 » the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 » the Directors’ and Corporate governance 
reports include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Remuneration Committee’s (“Committee”) 
report on remuneration for 2013. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with 
the provisions of the CA 2006 and Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium‑sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements 
of the Listing Rules and the DTR. As such this 
report is divided into two sections: the Directors’ 
remuneration policy details the Group’s 
remuneration policies and links to strategy, 
while the second section is the Annual report 
on remuneration, which focuses on the 
implementation of the remuneration policy 
in 2013 and how we intend to implement 
our remuneration policy in 2014.
We will be putting the Directors’ remuneration 
policy to a binding shareholder vote and the 
Annual report on remuneration to an advisory 
vote at the AGM, asking our shareholders to 
approve these reports. Subject to obtaining 
shareholder approval at the AGM, we propose 
that the Directors’ remuneration policy will apply 
from the 2014 AGM on 16 April 2014.
The sections of the report that are subject to 
audit can be found on page 60 (Single figure 
of total remuneration table) through to page 64 
(Outstanding awards under PSP and APBP).
The Committee has worked hard to ensure 
that Dialight’s remuneration arrangements 
are clear and easy to understand as well as 
transparent. At present the Group only operates 
one long‑term incentive, the PSP , and one 
bonus plan, the APBP .
Resolutions regarding the Company’s share 
plan arrangements will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM. Firstly, the Board is seeking 
approval in respect of a new set of rules for 
the PSP . The PSP is coming to the end of its 
ten‑year life and new rules are required in order 
for the Company to continue to make long‑term 
incentive awards to the Executive and to Senior 
managers in the future. The rules of this new 
PSP will be fundamentally the same as those 
in existence for the current PSP with some small 
changes. First the individual limit will be increased 
from 100% to 150% of salary. This is intended to 
provide flexibility over the ten‑year life of the plan, 
although there is currently no intention to make 
awards in excess of 100% of salary in normal 
circumstances. The exercise window for nil‑cost 
options will be reduced from ten years to two years 
post‑vesting, and we are adding flexibility to add 
a holding period to vested awards. Provisions 
are also being introduced to allow the clawback 
to reflect emerging best practice. Finally we 
are introducing discretion for the Committee 
to allow vesting of awards for good leavers to 
vest (on a time and performance pro‑rated basis) 
at the date of cessation, rather than the normal 
vesting date. This is intended to provide flexibility 
in certain circumstances such as death, rather than 
being the default treatment. These changes are 
reflected in the policy table on pages 56 and 57.
The Board will also be seeking approval from 
shareholders for the introduction of a Sharesave 
Plan that will initially be operated in the UK, USA 
and Mexico. This will be the first all employee 
arrangement operated by Dialight and will fully 
engage employees in the performance and 
success of the business as we look to expand. 
Further details of this can be found in the policy 
table on pages 56 and 57.

Committee 
report
Annual statement

Governance
Following consultation with shareholders the 
Committee implemented a number of changes 
to remuneration for 2013 which were discussed 
in detail in last year’s report. 
Details of the Company strategy and Key 
performance indicators (“KPIs”) can be found 
on pages 10 to 12. One of our main KPIs relates 
to the growth in both Lighting segment and 
Group profit. As a result, performance related 
elements of remuneration, notably the APBP 
have been linked to the growth in earnings 
before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) for the last 
three years. Other metrics have been considered 
but the Committee remains in agreement that 
the use of EBIT as a primary measure remains 
the most effective for incentivising the Executive.
Mark Fryer, the Group Finance Director, left the 
Board of Directors on 15 January 2014. Whilst 
he remains an employee until 31 March 2014 
the disclosure in this report reflects this change. 
Therefore, the Policy report provides detail on 
Dialight’s policy around remuneration for the 
Group Finance Director role and not Mark Fryer 
specifically. The Company is now actively 
recruiting a new Group Finance Director and the 
remuneration available to a successful candidate 
will be in line with the policy set out in this report. 
The Annual report on remuneration which 
reports on implementation of remuneration 
policy during the year under review includes 
details relating specifically to Mark Fryer as 
he remained a Director at the end of the 2013 
financial year.
Details of the subjects covered by the Committee 
at its meetings can be found in the table opposite. 
Key Committee decisions made during the year 
include a decision to pay cash bonuses in respect 
of the 2012 financial year in February, the approval 
of the vesting of the 2010 PSP awards, changes 
to the Company’s US subsidiary’s pension plan 
and APBP objectives for 2013. 
No bonus will be paid in respect of the 2013 
financial year as a result of the Company’s profit 
falling below threshold. The Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance of Dialight over 
the three‑year performance period 2011–2013 
has been strong and as a result the 2011 PSP 
awards all vested at the maximum (100%) level 
on 25 February 2014.

Base salary is considered by the Committee on an individuals’ 
appointment and then reviewed once a year or when an individual 
changes position or responsibilities.
When making a determination as to the appropriate remuneration, 
the Committee considers firstly pay and conditions for employees 
across the Group, the general performance of the Company, wider 
economic environment and, where considered relevant, benchmarks 
the remuneration against a bespoke group of comparator companies 
incorporated in both the US and the UK (size adjusted on the basis 
of market cap and revenue).
Benchmarking is not the only driver in salary reviews. 
The Remuneration Committee’s normal policy in relation 
to salary of an Executive on appointment is to pay lower 
quartile against the market with an expectation of paying 
around median for the Company’ s key roles and performers.
Detail of current salaries for the Executive can be found 
on page 60.
In normal circumstances, increases to Executive 
Directors’ base salaries will be broadly in line with price 
inflation subject to those situations that for reasons 
including an expansion of duties or a change in role 
these are no longer appropriate and a larger increase 
is required in order for the Company to remain competitive. 
It is not envisaged that this will be a frequent occurrence.

  Non‑Executive Director fees
The Company sets fee levels necessary 
to attract and retain experienced and 
skilled Non-Executive Directors with 
the necessary experience and 
expertise to advise and assist 
with establishing and monitoring the 
strategic objectives of the Company. 
Non‑Executive Director remuneration is determined by the Board 
within the limits set by the Articles. Fee levels take into account those 
paid for equivalent roles at companies of similar size and complexity.
The Board considers fee levels every other year. 
Non‑Executive Directors do not receive any bonus, do not participate 
in awards under the Company’s share plans and are not eligible 
to join the Company’s pension scheme.
The Company’s policy in relation to fees is to reflect 
the time commitment and responsibilities of the roles, 
normally by paying up to median level fees, compared 
to market, depending on the experience and background 
of the Non‑Executive Directors.
Details of current Non‑Executive Director fees can 
be found on page 60. 
In normal circumstances, increases to fees will be 
broadly in line with price inflation, subject to cases 
of material misalignment with the market or a change 
in the complexity, responsibility or time commitment 
required to fulfil a Non‑Executive Director role.
It remains important for the Board to have the necessary 
flexibility to step outside this general policy should the 
requirement be clear that a certain type of individual is 
required to conform with new governance requirements 
or legislation.
n/a
 APBP
The APBP provides a direct link 
between the level of profit generated 
by Dialight and the amount of 
incentive received by the Executive. 
The APBP is self-financing. 
If the threshold profit level 
is not achieved there will be 
no Company contribution. 
The APBP directly supports the 
achievement of EBIT, one of the 
key financial KPIs of the Company.
There is an alignment of participants’ 
interests with shareholders as 
shareholders receive a minimum level 
of profit prior to any incentive payments 
to participants being made.
The policy of the Committee is to reward the Executive for profit 
growth using a combination of cash and shares, subject to the 
rules of the APBP .
Bonuses are paid though a mixture of cash and deferred shares, 
subject to the achievement of the agreed objectives. Where the 
Executive receive a deferred share award as well as a cash award, 
half of the deferred share element vests after two years with the 
balance vesting after three years, subject to continued employment 
with the Group.
The rules of the APBP allow for the clawback of deferred share 
awards prior to their vesting should the Committee take the 
decision that to allow such awards to vest would be contrary 
to the best interests of the Company’s shareholders.
Dividends are accrued until the vesting and release of shares 
subject to the award at which point they are paid to the participant.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 175% of salary. 
Threshold performance will deliver payouts of up to 20% 
of maximum, while payouts for target performance will 
be up to 75% of maximum. Payouts above target 
will be delivered in shares.
APBP objectives are set by the 
Committee at the beginning of each 
financial year following the finalisation 
of the budget for that year. The primary 
measure is Company EBIT, although 
other financial measures may be 
rewarded, as may additional specific 
objectives that can be triggered 
following satisfactory achievement 
of the primary EBIT targets.
The APBP allows a close tailoring 
by the Committee of the performance 
targets to the budget and performance 
of the Company for each year. 
Background and overview of the policy
Dialight’s policy on remuneration is clear. 
The Committee believes that the base salary 
and benefits for its Executive Directors should 
represent a fair return for employment but that 
the majority of remuneration should be variable 
and dependent on the continued success of 
the Company. It was agreed by the Committee 
in December 2010 that the practical application 
of this policy meant that the Group should aim 
to position base pay between the lower quartile 
and median with key roles and key performers 
positioned at the 50th percentile or market 
median. Total remuneration should also be 
targeted to be around the same levels.
It was with this in mind that the Committee 
conducted a review of the Company’ s remuneration 
towards the end of 2012 that resulted in a number 
of changes that took effect in the year under 
review. This was primarily because it was felt 
that, whilst the existing policy and general structure 
of remuneration remained appropriate, a number 
of changes were required to ensure that the 
Company remained competitive and attractive 
to potential new executive talent as the Company 
looked to build on its strong historical performance.
A breakdown of all elements of Executive 
remuneration and its place in the Company’s 
remuneration policy can be found opposite.
Explanatory detail for future 
remuneration policy table
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment 
from any award made prior to the approval 
and implementation of the remuneration policy 
detailed in this report. Such awards include 
awards made under the PSP prior to the 
approval of the new rules at the 2014 AGM.
Performance measures and targets
For the APBP , EBIT has been selected as 
the primary measure to provide a direct link 
to one of our KPIs and ensure that the bonus is 
self‑financing. Any other measures will be agreed 
on an annual basis to ensure alignment with the 
Company’s strategy for the coming year. Targets 
are set on an annual basis taking into account 
the Company’s budget as well as external 
expectations for Dialight and the sector.
For the PSP , the Committee considers that 
TSR provides clear alignment between Executive 
Directors’ interests and those of shareholders and 
provides an objective measure of the Company’s 
success over time, while EPS provides good 
line of sight and helps focus participants on 
the Company’s financial performance. The TSR 
outperformance requirement is broadly in line with 
practice at other FTSE‑listed companies, taking 
into account Dialight’ s relative size. The Committee 
retains discretion to adjust this target for future 
awards should circumstances change. EPS 
targets will be reviewed and confirmed prior 
to each grant, taking account of the Company’s 
strategic plan, analyst estimates, historical 
performance and EPS performance ranges 
used at other FTSE companies. 
If an event occurs which causes the Committee 
to consider that an outstanding PSP award or 
bonus would not achieve its original purpose 
without alteration, the Committee has discretion 
to amend the targets, provided the new conditions 
are materially no less challenging than when 
originally imposed. Such discretion could be 
used to appropriately adjust for the impact 
of material acquisitions or disposals, or for 
exceptional and unforeseen events outside 
the control of the management team. 
Difference between Director remuneration 
policy and that for other employees
The remuneration policy for Senior management 
is consistent with that for the Executive, including 
participation in the Company’s APBP and PSP . 
Below this level employees participate in incentive 
schemes tailored to their role, as appropriate, 
and receive salaries and benefits which are 
consistent with local market practice.

 Base salary
To ensure that fixed pay represents 
a fair return for employment.
The Committee sets base salary with reference to relevant 
market data and an individual’s experience, responsibilities

 PSP
The PSP provides direct alignment 
between the interests of shareholders 
and those of the Executive and the 
senior management of the business 
through its measurement of the 
Company’s share price and earnings 
performance over a three-year period.
The PSP provides a three‑year incentive based on the achievement 
of performance conditions. 
A new set of PSP rules is being put to shareholders for approval 
at the AGM. Full details and a summary of these can be found in 
the Notice of AGM. Awards are normally made in the six‑week period 
following the announcement by the Company of its results for any 
period. The initial value of an award granted in any one financial year 
will be determined by the Committee. 
Awards made prior to and during 2014 may be structured as conditional 
shares or nil cost options with a seven‑year exercise window from the 
date of vesting. For those awards made from 2015 onwards the exercise 
window will reduce to two years. 
On the adoption of new PSP rules at the AGM, the vesting of awards 
made pursuant to these rules may, at the discretion of the Committee, 
be deferred in whole or in part following the end of a three‑year vesting 
period. The Company’s current policy is for awards to vest after 
three years. 
The Committee has the power to authorise the payment of dividends 
or dividend equivalents under the rules of the PSP .
The new PSP rules contain provisions that allow for clawback and 
malus in respect of both vested and unvested awards. 
Maximum value of award, under the new rules, 
is up to 150% of salary.
Participants in the PSP have historically been 
made awards of between 25% and 100% of salary. 
The Executive Directors have generally received 
awards of 100% of salary. It is not envisaged that 
this will change. 
Threshold vesting is at 25% of maximum.
Vesting of PSP awards is subject 
to continued employment and 
performance measures which 
are currently as follows:
 » 50% on EPS growth measured 
on a point to point basis over the 
three‑year performance period; and
 » 50% on TSR relative to a relevant 
peer group over the three‑year 
performance period.
The Committee will review the 
performance measures, weightings 
and targets prior to each grant to 
ensure that they continue to be 
well aligned with the delivery of 
Company strategy.
 Sharesave Plan
To provide a mechanism by 
which employees can save up 
to purchase shares at a discount to the 
prevailing market price on an annual 
basis, encouraging employee retention 
and engagement with the Company.
The Sharesave Plan will operate initially in the UK, the US and Mexico 
but may be introduced to other parts of the world in due course. It will 
be open to all employees of Dialight with one invitation to participate 
on an annual basis.
Employees will be able to save up to the maximum 
of the limits approved by HMRC from time to time 
(or local currency equivalent) for a total period of three 
years. At the beginning of each savings period employees 
will be granted options over shares in Dialight plc up 
to a maximum discount of 20% to the prevailing market 
price. The employees’ savings are then used to purchase 
and exercise these options at the end of three years.
There are no performance conditions 
attached to the Sharesave Plan.
 Pension
The Company provides this benefits 
package in order to be competitive 
in the relevant market and to ensure 
its ability to recruit and retain Executives.
The Company operates the Roxboro UK Pension Scheme alongside 
a 401(K) and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in the US.
There are no defined benefit schemes that are still open to new entrants 
or of which the Executive Directors are members.
Both employee and employer contributions are made to the relevant 
scheme. In addition, the Group Chief Executive receives cash in lieu 
of pension contributions subject to an agreement made in July 2012.
The Group Chief Executive’s payment in lieu of contributions is subject 
to clawback.
New Executive Directors are entitled to join the existing defined 
contribution scheme offering employer contributions of up to 15%.
Executive Directors receive contributions into defined 
contribution arrangements. The Group Chief Executive 
receives a cash payment in lieu of pension contribution. 
Further details of what has been paid during 2013 can 
be found on page 60. 
It is not anticipated that pension contributions 
(as a percentage of salary) will exceed the levels 
currently provided.
There are no performance conditions 
attached to Group pension arrangements. 
	 Bene fits
The approach of the Committee 
is that other benefits payable remain 
in line with market practice to ensure 
Dialight retains its ability to be 
competitive and remain attractive 
to prospective candidates. 
Executives receive benefits which consist primarily of the provision 
of a car allowance, life assurance and medical insurance, although 
may include any such benefits that the Committee deems appropriate.
Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; 
eligibility and cost are reviewed periodically.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher 
cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. relocation) or 
in circumstances where factors outside the company’s 
control have changed materially (e.g. increases in 
insurance premiums).
The value of all other benefits awarded to the Executive 
Directors can be found in the table on page 60.
There are no performance conditions 
attached to benefits.

Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors (and other PSP participants) 
are required to accumulate and maintain a holding 
of Dialight shares equivalent in value to their 
annual PSP award (i.e. currently 100% of salary 
for the Group Chief Executive). Executives will 
have five years from their date of joining to build 
their shareholdings to the required level. Please 
refer to the table on page 63. The Group Chief 
Executive held 365,888 ordinary shares as at 
31 December 2013 and therefore satisfies 
these guidelines. 
Recruitment policy
Executive Directors will receive base salary in line 
with the normal policy, eligibility to participate in 
the APBP (maximum payout of 175% of salary), 
eligibility to participate in the PSP (with a maximum 
award of 150% salary under the proposed new 
rules in the policy table), pension contributions 
and other benefits in line with the normal policy. 
The policy provides for an entry point on salary 
between lower quartile and median and the 
Committee retains discretion to benchmark 
prospective salary against the relevant index 
to ensure that correct consideration of all 
variables has been completed.
Should a situation present itself the Committee 
would review the impact of any decision to 
“buy out” a candidate from existing option/
awards in his or her current employing company, 
in order to encourage recruitment, this would be 
done on a case‑by‑case basis. If the Committee 
determines that is appropriate to do so if will 
apply the following approach:
The fair value of these incentives will be 
calculated taking into account the following:
»   the proportion of the performance period 
completed on the date of the Executive’s 
cessation of employment;
»   the performance conditions attached to the 
vesting of these incentives and the likelihood 
of them being satisfied; and
»   any other terms and conditions having 
a material effect on their value (“lapsed 
fair value”).
The Committee may then grant up to the 
same fair value as the lapsed fair value where 
possible under the Company’s incentive plans 
(subject to the annual limits under these plans). 
The Committee, however, retains the discretion 
to provide the lapsed fair value under specific 
arrangements in relation to the recruitment 
of the particular individual.
The maximum level of variable pay (excluding 
any buy‑outs) offered to any new Executive 
Director would be 325% (comprising 175% 
in the APBP and 150% in the PSP). 
Listing Rule 9.4.2 may be utilised in order to 
provide the flexibility to the Committee to act 
outside of the Group’s existing plans to recruit 
preferred candidates. It is likely that this discretion 
would be restricted to assist only in the facilitation 
of buy outs of previous emoluments. The approach 
to the recruitment of internal candidates would 
be similar but the Committee would continue 
to honour existing contractual commitments 
prior to any promotion.
For Non‑Executive Directors, the Committee and 
the Company would seek to pay fees in line with 
the Company’s existing remuneration policy.

The PSP provides a three‑year incentive based on the achievement 
of performance conditions. 
A new set of PSP rules is being put to shareholders for approval 
at the AGM. Full details and a summary of these can be found in 
the Notice of AGM. Awards are normally made in the six‑week period

Remuneration scenarios
The composition and value of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages at “minimum”, 
“on‑target” and “maximum” scenarios are set 
out above. The policy of the Committee is to 
align Executive Directors’ interests with those 
of shareholders and to give the Executive 
Directors an incentive to perform at the highest 
levels. To achieve this it seeks to ensure that 
a significant proportion of the remuneration 
package varies with the financial performance 
of the Group and that targets are aligned with 
the Group’s stated business objectives.
Service contracts
Executive service contracts contain provisions 
that require twelve months’ notice of termination 
on either side. Existing service contracts reflect the 
fact that the Group Chief Executive is US based 
but contain similar provisions. As a result, the 
Group Chief Executive’s contract is a US contract 
which has been reviewed and amended with 
the assistance of UK legal advisers to ensure 
compliance with UK legislation and appropriate 
best practice. Executive service contracts do 
not contain any provisions for payments outside 
the scope of those contained in the contract. 
Roy Burton’s contract has an effective date 
of 1 October 2005.
Non‑Executive Directors have specific terms 
of engagement provided in formal letters of 
appointment, which contain three‑month notice 
periods that are mutual. The Non‑Executive 
Directors are appointed for a three‑year term, 
subject to annual re‑election by the shareholders, 
at the Company’s AGM.
Payment for loss of office

and the number of shares being reduced by such 
proportion as the proportion that the period from 
the date they ceased employment to the end 
of the relevant performance period bears to the 
relevant performance period, rounding down in 
each case to the nearest whole number of shares. 
Should either of the Executive Directors leave 
the Company in any other circumstances the 
Committee retains discretion to apply the same 
criteria and award a pro‑rated amount of shares.
The new rules of the PSP that will be put forward 
for adoption at the AGM will contain the flexibility 
for the Committee to allow awards to vest earlier 
than above when an individual leaves. Awards 
will always be pro‑rated subject to the exercise 
of discretion by the Committee subject to the 
adoption of the new rules. The default position 
will be for awards to vest in line with the normal 
date of vesting rather than being released early. 
The Committee retains discretion in the event 
of a change of control to release awards under 
the PSP . It is usual in this situation that awards 
would be pro‑rated for time and performance 
subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
The Committee takes into account what the general 
rise in employee salaries was across the Company 
at the review date when considering changes 
to the remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
The Company has not expressly sought the views 
of employees when drawing up the Directors’ 
remuneration policy but has conducted a review of 
current job roles and salaries across the Group. 
Shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee consulted 
extensively with its top ten shareholders and 
the main shareholder representative bodies, 
the ABI and ISS, on the changes that were 
introduced in 2013. 
The shareholder consultation process 
consisted of briefing letters, discussions and 
meetings in a number of cases with the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee. Shareholders 
confirmed their support for the Company’s 
approach at the end of the consultation process.
Payment for loss of office continued
Notice periods continued
Subject to his compliance with those restrictive 
covenants in the contract, the Group Chief 
Executive is entitled to a severance payment 
equivalent to a full year’s salary, continuing health 
care under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act benefits (“COBRA”) for the 
same period and an amount equal to the current 
annual cost of life insurance to Dialight if his 
employment is terminated without cause. This 
does not apply should he resign or be terminated 
with cause. 
The Group Finance Director’s contract provides 
for pay in lieu of notice but does not contain any 
additional compensation provisions. Both contracts 
do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated the Committee 
will determine such mitigation as it considers fair 
and reasonable in each case. In determining any 
compensation it will take into account the best 
practice provisions of the Code and published 
guidance from recognised institutional investor 
bodies and will take legal advice on the Company’s 
liability to pay compensation and the appropriate 
amount. The Committee periodically considers 
what compensation commitments the Executive 
Directors’ contracts would entail in the event 
of early termination. There are no contractual 
arrangements that would guarantee a pension 
with limited or no abatement on severance 
or early retirement.
APBP
In the event of an Executive Director leaving 
Dialight before the end of a bonus year or prior 
to the payment of a bonus the Committee has 
discretion to allow them to be paid a portion 
of bonus relative to their point of leaving. This 
will be highly contingent on the manner of the 
Executive Director’s departure and whether 
they are classified as a “good leaver” pursuant 
to the rules of the APBP .
PSP
The PSP would operate in a similar way to 
the APBP . Assuming the Executive Director is 
classed as a “good leaver” the PSP allows for 
shares subject to awards to be released as soon 
as practicable after the later of the end of the 
performance period and the date of cessation,  60 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Executive Directors’ benefits
Executive Directors receive benefits comprising life insurance, healthcare and car allowances.
Pensions
The figure includes the amount of company contributions to Roy Burton and Mark Fryer’s pensions during the year. Mark Fryer received Company 
contributions of 15% of base salary. Roy Burton currently receives employer contributions under both a US 401(k) plan plus an employer contribution 
under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”). In addition he receives a cash contribution under the SERP of $100,000 that is made 
on 30 June of each year for three years of which the second payment was made in 2013. This contribution is subject to clawback arrangements such 
that any or all of it may be forfeited in the event of embezzlement, theft, gross negligence or other misconduct, until the benefit is transferred to him. 
Investment options under this scheme are be the same as those available under the 401(k) plan, with the same transfer of any associated investment 
charges to the executive. The first contribution under this additional arrangement was made to the SERP on 30 June 2012. 
APBP
The APBP operates on the basis that is set out on pages 54 and 55 of the Policy report. Maximum bonus potential is 175% of salary paid in a mixture 
of cash and deferred shares.

Awards made in 2011
Awards granted on 2011 were based on the TSR achieved by Dialight compared to the FTSE Electrical/Electronics Index and the FTSE Small Cap Index 
(each having equal weighting). If Dialight’s TSR was equal to the TSR of the comparator index, 25% of the shares subject to an Award would vest, rising 
on a straight‑line basis to 100% vesting if Dialight’s TSR is equal to the TSR of the index plus 15% per annum. No shares would vest if  Dialight’s TSR 
was below the percentage increase in the TSR of the comparator index.

3 Includes dividend equivalent payment of £10,000 (converted using the exchange rate of note 1). 
Awards made in 2013
Awards granted in 2013 measured performance on the following basis:
EPS 
EPS was introduced as a complementary measure of performance relating to 50% of 2013 and future awards. The EPS vesting condition is Dialight’s 
compound annual three‑year EPS growth rate. For awards made in 2013, this element will vest in full if Dialight’s three‑year EPS growth exceeds 25% 
p.a. with threshold vesting (25%) if Dialight’s three‑year EPS growth is 10% p.a. over the period. None of this element will vest if Dialight’s EPS growth 
over the three‑year period is less than 10% p.a. The Committee will review the performance targets prior to the grant of any future awards to ensure 
they are appropriately stretching but achievable.
TSR
TSR was retained in respect of the remaining 50% of awards in order to maintain strong shareholder alignment. For awards made in 2013, the TSR 
vesting condition will be based upon Dialight’s three‑year TSR % outperformance of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). This element 
will vest in full if Dialight’s three‑year TSR exceeds Index TSR by 10% p.a., with threshold vesting (25%) if Dialight’s three‑year TSR is in line with Index TSR. 
The TSR outperformance requirement is broadly in line with practice at other FTSE‑listed companies, taking into account Dialight’s relative size.

Executive salaries and Non‑Executive Director fees
The Committee has decided that no increase in salary or fees would be awarded to the Group Chief Executive and the Non‑Executive Directors 
with effect from 1 January 2014. The Group Chief Executive’s salary will remain at $560,000. On 15 January 2014, it was agreed that Mark Fryer 
would leave the Company. Details of the termination arrangements will be disclosed in the report for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Pensions
The Group Chief Executive will receive employer contributions into defined 
contribution arrangements operated by Dialight Corporation in the US 
as well as a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions of $100k 
on 1 July 2014.
APBP
The 2014 APBP will be based on targets linked to EBIT performance and 
cash conversion. The maximum opportunity for the Group Chief Executive 
will remain unchanged at 175% of base salary. This will be split 130/45 
in favour of EBIT/cash.
It is the Committee’s view that detailed disclosure of the performance 
targets in advance for the future financial year under is commercially 
sensitive. The targets are based on profit projections for the year ahead 
which would provide the Company’ s competitors with a potential commercial 
advantage and would also be price sensitive. The Committee, will, however 
provide full retrospective disclosure of the performance conditions and 
targets at the end of the relevant financial year.
PSP
Awards for 2014 will be made in April 2014 under the existing rules, subject 
to EPS and TSR performance targets. At the time of production of the 
report these measures had not formally been approved by the Committee.
The Committee and advisers
The Committee
Whilst the Board remains responsible for the Group’s remuneration policy, 
the Committee has delegated authority in respect of the determination and 
review of remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and certain 
other Senior Executives (including contract terms, remuneration and other 
benefits such as performance related bonus schemes, long‑term incentives, 
pension rights and compensation payments) as well as a responsibility 
to recommend and monitor the structure of the remuneration of the 
Group’s senior management, as defined by the Board.
Committee members
Those individuals that served on the Committee during the year can be 
found on page 52. All members served throughout the year are considered 
independent in accordance with the Code. Details of the number of meetings 
held during the year as well as details of attendance at these meetings can 
be found in the Directors’ and Corporate governance report on page 41.
A copy of the terms of reference for the Committee can be found on 
the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary 
at the Registered Office. 
The Committee has access to the advice of the Group Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary (none of whom participate in any discussion 
concerning their own remuneration) and external advisers as required. 
External advice
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Committee consulted 
Kepler Associates (“Kepler”), who provided advice regarding executive 
remuneration benchmarking, annual bonus plans and long‑term incentive 
design, and Clifford Chance LLP (“Clifford Chance”), who advised on 
the operation of the Group’s PSP and APBP . Kepler and Clifford Chance 
provided no other services to the Company. Kepler is a founding member 
and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, 
details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that its 
advisers remain independent and that the advice provided is impartial 
and objective.
The total fees charged for the provision of these services during 
the year were £43,000 and £3,000 in respect of Kepler and 
Clifford Chance respectively. 
The Committee retains the responsibility for the appointment of remuneration 
advisers and their associated fees. Kepler acts for the Committee and 
the Company and takes instruction through the Company Secretary.

Financial statements
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1.  Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Dialight Plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 70 to 112. In our opinion: 
 » the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; 
 » the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union; 
 » the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
 » the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2.  Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Goodwill (£11.9 million)
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), note 3(i) (accounting policy) 
and note 12 (financial disclosures).
 The risk – Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated 
at acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected 
to benefit from the combination. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs 
are determined from value in use calculations. This is a key judgement 
area as adverse changes in assumptions, particularly relating to the 
forecasting of cash flows and discount rates could reduce the recoverable 
amount below the carrying amount. In particular there is increased risk 
around the carrying value of the European Traffic goodwill given the maturity 
of the market in which this CGU operates. Furthermore, the series of trading 
updates issued throughout 2013, which culminated in profit before tax 
being below initial expectations, raised concerns over the adequacy 
of the cash flow forecasts used in the impairment review.
 Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others:
 » ensuring the cash generating units are consistent with the information 
used by management;
 » agreeing the cash flows in the model to the three year strategy model;
 » ensuring the long‑term growth rates in the model don’t exceed 
industry published data;
 » testing each component of the discount rate to external sources;
 » comparing the discounted cash flows to the market capitalisation 
of the Group; 
 » applying a number of sensitivities to the inputs including sales growth 
beyond the 2014 detailed forecast and discount rates in the model 
to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of the goodwill; and 
 » considered the impact of the updated forecasts (prepared for 2014 
following the actual outturn for 2013) on the headroom in the goodwill 
impairment model. 
We also considered whether the Group’s disclosures in respect of the 
impairment review and the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
review to changes in key assumptions are appropriate. 
Inventory valuation (£24.2 million)
Refer to page 46 (Audit Committee Report), note 3(j) (accounting policy) 
and note 15 (financial disclosures).
 The risk – The Group operates in an industry whereby developments 
in product technology may result in inventory becoming slow moving 
or obsolete, which in turn may mean that inventory cannot be sold or sales 
prices are discounted to less than the inventory carrying value. This could 
result in a material impairment of the inventory balance.
 Our response – The Group produces a report of all slow moving 
inventory (based on historical usage and most recent purchase date) 
and this is reviewed by the planning and production team in conjunction 
with the engineering and sales team and an appropriate provision percentage 
is then applied to each inventory line. In addition, any changes to the bill of 
materials for finished goods in response to changes in technology are 
authorised and the timing of the change agreed so that the planning 
and production team can appropriately manage the inventory levels. 
Our audit procedures in this area included, among others:
 » checking the accuracy and completeness of the historical usage 
and most recent purchase date reports; 
 » assessing the adequacy of the Group’ s provision against inventory through;
 » discussions with management and the planning and production team; 
 » determining the inventory lines sold at a loss during the year 
and ensuring they are appropriately included in the provision; 
 » comparing post year‑end sales values to the inventory valuation; and
 » testing the authorization control in respect of the bill of material changes.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the judgements used in determining the carrying value of inventory.

Opinions and conclusions arising from  
our audit continued
2.  Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement continued
Revenue recognition (£131.2 million)
Refer to page 46 (Audit Committee Report), note 3(q) (accounting policy) 
and note 4 (financial disclosures).
The risk – There is a high volume of transactions close to the year‑end 
due to customer requirements and the Group’s year‑end reporting deadline 
incentive. The Group also has a number of customers who have different 
contractual terms meaning that the risks and rewards transfer at different 
timings (such as on dispatch, on receipt at port of destination and on receipt 
by customer) with the result that there is an increased risk that revenue 
may not be recognised in the correct period. Furthermore, the series of 
trading updates issued throughout 2013, which culminated in profit before 
tax being below initial expectations, raised further risk that revenue may 
have been overstated in 2013. 
Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others:
 » testing revenue recognised either side of the year end through agreement 
to dispatch documentation and the analysis of customer agreements to 
ensure that revenue was recognised in the correct year. The sample tested 
in the US and UK was increased given the significance of these locations 
to the overall Group result to respond to the increased risk perceived due 
to the trading updates.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of revenue recognition. 
Development costs (£5.9 million)
Refer to page 46 (Audit Committee Report), note 3(h) (accounting policy) 
and note 12 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group operates in an industry whereby a high level 
of research and development into product technology is required to ensure 
the Company keeps at the forefront of technological advances in lighting. 
Costs can only be capitalised if the product or process is commercially 
and technically feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
the development therefore judgement is required in the initial categorisation 
of expenditure between research (which is expensed) and development 
(which is capitalised). Subsequently, judgements are involved in the 
application of a suitable amortisation period, and assessment 
as to whether the assets are impaired.
Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others:
 » obtaining a detailed list of costs capitalised, and reconciling a sample 
to source documentation including timesheets for relevant employees 
and invoices;
 » making inquiries of management to understand the projects and the 
rationale for capitalising the costs; 
 » corroborating through discussion with the engineering department 
and inspecting feasibility documentation, where available, to confirm 
the viability of the product and that the return on the product is expected 
to exceed the capitalised cost;
 » making inquiries of management whether the intangible asset was 
completed in the period and assessing whether amortisation 
commenced at an appropriate time;
 » recalculating the amortisation expense for the period;
 » examining expensed research and development costs in the general 
ledger to assess whether there are any other significant items recorded 
during the period that should have been capitalised to intangible 
assets; and
 » for completed projects, an impairment review was performed by 
obtaining information on sales in the current period and assessing 
projected sales/profits for the remainder of the product life. 
 We also considered whether the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of development costs and amortisation are appropriate. 
3.  Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£1.0 million. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before taxation (of which it represents 8%), which we consider 
to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Company 
in assessing the financial performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and 
uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value 
in excess of £50,000, in addition to other audit misstatements below 
that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by the Group audit 
team at the key reporting components in the USA and the UK. In addition, 
specified audit procedures were performed by component auditors in 
Australia, Malaysia and Mexico. These Group procedures covered 82% of 
total Group revenue; 73% of Group profit before taxation; and 89% of total 
Group assets. The segment disclosures in note 4 sets out the individual 
significance of operations in specific countries.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the key reporting 
components of the Group were all performed to materiality levels set by 
the Group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for 
each component and ranged from £0.475m to £0.75m.
Detailed instructions were issued to all the auditors in the other locations. 
These instructions covered the significant audit areas that should be 
covered by their work (which included the relevant risks of material 
misstatements detailed above) and set out the information required 
to be reported back to the Group audit team.

Financial statements
Opinions and conclusions arising  
from our audit continued
4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
 » the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 » the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. 
5.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 » we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; or
 » the Report of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 » the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 » the Directors’ statement, set out on page 51, in relation to going 
concern; and
 » the part of the Corporate governance statement on page 40 relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published 
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which 
are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read 
to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work 
we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2013
1. Reporting entity
Dialight plc is a company domiciled in England. The address of the 
Company’s registered office is Exning Road, Newmarket, Suffolk CB8 0AX. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”).
2. Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRSs”). The Company has elected 
to present its parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK GAAP .
(b) Consolidated basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
sufficient resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements.
(c) Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management 
has made a number of judgements. The process of preparing the Group’s 
financial statements inevitably requires the Group to make estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future and the resulting accounting estimates 
will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Significant
Goodwill (see note 12)
Each year the Group reviews the carrying values of its goodwill balances 
by carrying out impairment tests. These tests require estimates and 
judgements to be made of the value in use of its cash‑generating units 
(“CGUs”) which are dependent on key assumptions such as future cash 
flows and future growth rates of the CGUs, and discount rates.
Uncertainties associated with the current economic environment or 
the Group’s ability to carry out its strategic plans could impact key 
assumptions made as part of this review. Where these uncertainties 
present a material risk to the carrying value of goodwill, sensitivity 
analysis carried out on the relevant CGUs.
Development costs (see note 12)
The Group capitalises development costs provided they meet certain 
criteria set out in the respective accounting policy. Costs are only 
capitalised where management is satisfied as to the ultimate commercial 
viability of the projects concerned based on available information. 
The capitalised costs are amortised over the useful economic life, 
which is determined based on the reasonable commercial prospects 
for the resultant product.
Inventory provision (see note 15)
The Group operates in an environment of technological change, presenting 
the risk of obsolete inventory. Inventory is reviewed by operational and 
financial management on a regular basis, product‑by‑product, and the 
level of provision required is assessed against historic and forecast use 
for that product. The actual level of provision required may be materially 
higher or lower than expected.
Other
Warranty (see note 20)
The Group offers performance warranties on many of its products. 
A provision is made for the expected costs of future warranty claims 
relating to past product sales. This provision is estimated based on historic 
trends for returns, internal knowledge of product performance characteristics 
and the expected costs of remedying warranty‑returned product. This 
information is reviewed by management regularly. Actual returns may 
be materially higher or lower than these estimates, which may have 
a material impact on the adequacy of the provision for warranty claims. 
Contingent consideration (see note 13)
In assessing the fair value of contingent consideration in respect of 
business combinations, the directors take account of the terms of the 
underlying purchase agreement. They also consider, based on available 
evidence, the likelihood of contingent consideration becoming payable, 
the range of possible values, and any other factors that may impact the 
final amount payable. Actual consideration paid may be materially 
different to the amount provided in the financial statements.
Tax (see note 9)
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets 
to be recovered. 76      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2013
3. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and 
have been applied consistently by Group entities.
(a) Basis of consolidation
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method 
as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing 
control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures 
goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 » the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
 » the recognised amount of any non‑controlling interests in the acquire; less
 » the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the 
issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection 
with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010, goodwill 
represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt 
or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business 
combinations were capitalised as part of the acquisition.
Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRSs)
As part of its transition to IFRSs, the Group elected to restate only 
those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 January 2003. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2003, goodwill represents 
the amount recognised under the Group’s previous accounting framework, 
UK GAAP .
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra‑group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising 
from intra‑group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements.
(b) Foreign currency translation
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the assets 
and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated using exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of overseas operations are translated at average 
exchange rates for the period.
Since the transition date, resulting exchange differences are recognised 
as a separate component of equity within the Group’s translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in 
the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Foreign currency 
transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing at the date 
of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
(c) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost and 
are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation.
(e) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite 
useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
(f) Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight‑line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. Land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 16–50 years
Plant, equipment and vehicles 3–10 years Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013     77

Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(f) Depreciation and amortisation continued
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in profit and loss on a straight‑line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, 
from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Patents and trademarks 4 years
Development costs 3–5 years
Order book 1–2 years
Customer relationships 7 years
Technology 7 years
(g) Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of subsidiaries is included in 
intangible assets. For the measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, 
see note 3(a).
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses until disposal or termination of the previously acquired 
business when the profit or loss on disposal or termination will be calculated 
after charging the gross amount at current exchange rates of any such 
goodwill through the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs 
and is tested at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(h) Research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining 
new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised 
in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are 
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete the development. The expenditure 
capitalised includes direct cost of material, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure 
is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
(i) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non‑financial assets, other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are 
not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each 
reporting date. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its 
CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. A CGU is the smallest identifiable 
asset group that generates cash flows that largely are independent from 
other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash‑generating units 
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets 
in the unit (group of units) on a pro‑rata basis. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value 
in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Any impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect 
of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised. 
A financial asset, in particular the carrying value of trade receivables, is 
considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or 
more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset. Any impairment losses are recognised through the 
income statement.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion 
and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their location and 
condition at the balance sheet date. Items are valued using the first in, 
first out method. When inventories are used, the carrying amount of those 
inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related 
revenue is recognised. Provision for write‑down to net realisable value and 
losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
the write‑down or loss occurs. 
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of 
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.  78      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

(l) Share capital
(i)  Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
approved by members.
(ii)  When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased by the ESOT, 
the amount of the consideration paid is recognised as a deduction 
from equity.
(iii)  Under the terms of the PSP and deferred bonus scheme, dividends 
accrue on shares not yet vested; however if in the event that the shares 
lapse or are forfeited then the dividends will not be paid and the accrual 
is reversed.
(m) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
(ii) Defined benefit pension plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned for their service in the current and 
prior periods; discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of 
any plan assets. 
The calculation is performed by an independent qualified actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential 
asset to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value 
of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the 
plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. T o calculate the present 
value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum 
funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial 
gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect 
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately 
in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net 
defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate 
used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the 
annual period to the then‑net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into 
account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest 
expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are 
recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) Defined benefit pension plans continued
When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the 
resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss 
on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group 
recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit 
plan when the settlement occurs.
(iii) Share-based payment and deferred bonus transactions
The PSP allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. 
The fair value of the award granted is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at the 
grant date and spread over the performance period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the award. 
The fair value of the grants is measured using Monte Carlo or Black‑ Scholes models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the grants were made. The amount recognised as an expense 
is only adjusted to reflect forfeitures resulting from failures to meet 
non‑market conditions. The share‑based payments are equity‑settled.
Key Group employees are awarded shares in the Company under the 
Annual Performance Bonus Plan. The fair value of the award granted 
is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair value is measured at the grant date and spread over 
the performance period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the award. 
(n) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation. 
(o) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value and then 
subsequently stated at their amortised cost less any impairment losses. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated 
being the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessment of the time value of the money and risks specific to the asset. 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
An impairment loss in respect of trade and other receivables is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount.
(p) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and then 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
(q) Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade 
discounts, volume rebates and product returns. Revenue represents the 
invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised in the income statement 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the external customers in line with contractual arrangements and 
agreed shipping terms and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with 
the transaction will flow to the Group.  Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013     79

(r) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments under operating leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight‑line basis over the term of the lease.
(ii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest receivable, interest payable, 
borrowings, interest on pension assets and liabilities, foreign exchange 
gains and losses, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in the income statement and unwinding on discount.
(s) Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax 
expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity. 
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets 
to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited 
to profit and loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are 
recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend 
is recognised.
(t) Changes in accounting polices
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the 
accounting policies set out in this note to all periods presented in these 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to 
standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, 
with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013. Whilst there are further 
new or amended standards to those detailed below, these have not had 
a material impact on the Group and are therefore not disclosed.
 » Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 
(Amendments to IAS 1)
 » IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011)
The nature and effect of these changes are explained below.
Presentation of items of OCI
As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the Group has modified the 
presentation of items of OCI in its statement of profit or loss and OCI, 
to present separately items that would be reclassified to profit or loss 
from those that would never be. Comparative information has been 
re‑presented accordingly. 
Post-employment defined benefit plans
As a result of IAS 19 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy 
with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related 
to its post‑employment defined benefit plans.
Under IAS 19 (2011), the Group determines the net interest expense 
(income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by 
applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation 
at the beginning of the annual period to the then‑net defined benefit liability 
(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
Consequently, the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) 
now comprises: interest cost on the defined benefit obligation, interest 
income on plan assets, and interest on the effect on the asset ceiling. 
Previously, the Group determined interest income on plan assets based 
on their long‑term rate of expected return.
Post-employment defined benefit plans continued
The quantitative impact of the change is an increase in profit after 
tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 of £58,000 and a decrease 
in other comprehensive income of the same amount. In addition, the 
expected return on assets and interest charge on scheme liabilities 
have been presented net in the income statement.
No other changes to new or revised accounting standards have had 
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 80      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

3. Significant accounting policies continued
(t) Changes in accounting polices continued
Adoption of new and revised standards
A number of new, amendments to standards and interpretations are 
effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2014 and have not 
been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None 
of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.
(u) Measurement of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the 
measurement of fair values, for both financial and non‑financial assets 
and liabilities.
The Group has an established control framework, appropriate for the 
size and complexity of the Group, with respect to the measurement of 
fair values. When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group 
uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised 
into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in 
the valuation techniques as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability might 
be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair 
value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the 
entire measurement.
4. Operating segments
The Group comprises three reportable operating segments. These segments 
have been identified based on the internal information that is supplied 
regularly to the Group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes 
of assessing performance and allocating resources. The chief operating 
decision maker is considered to be the Group’s Chief Executive.
The three reportable operating segments are:
 » Lighting, which develops, manufactures and supplies highly efficient 
LED lighting solutions for hazardous and industrial applications in which 
lighting performance is critical. 
 » Signals, which develops, manufactures and supplies highly efficient 
LED signalling solutions for markets including anti‑collision obstruction 
lighting and traffic signals.
 » Components, which develops, manufactures and supplies status 
indication components for electronics OEMs, together with niche 
industrial and automotive electronic components.
There is no inter‑segment revenue.
All revenue relates to the sale of goods. Segment results include items 
directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Unallocated expenses comprise corporate costs 
including share‑based payments. 
There are no individual customers representing more than 10% of revenue. Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013     81

6. Non-underlying income/expense
From time to time, the Group incurs costs and earns income that is non‑recurring in nature or that is otherwise considered to be not reflective of 
the underlying performance of the business. In the assessment of performance of the components of the Group, management examines underlying 
performance, which removes the impact of non‑underlying costs and income. The results of discontinued operations are also considered to form 
part of non‑underlying operations.

The intellectual property past‑use access fee relates to a one‑off payment for access to certain patents and intellectual property over the last five years.
During the year, the goodwill, intangible assets and certain operating assets related to the Group’s Japanese subsidiary, Dialight Japan KK, were written 
down in full due to deterioration in the Group’s projections for that territory.
During the year, the Group closed its UK research and development site and engaged in certain other limited restructuring exercises which led to staff 
redundancies and other termination costs.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and to 23% (effective 1 April 2013) were substantively

were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax assets (liabilities) at 
31 December 2013 has been calculated based on a rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to £2.1m because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group 
can use the benefits therefrom.

Signals and Lighting segments
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination. 
CGUs are identified geographically and at a product segment level. The change in value in the Japanese Lighting goodwill is due to the write‑down 
of the carrying value during the year. This is due to a deterioration in management’s forecasts for the CGU. The change in value in the European Traffic 
goodwill figure is due to foreign currency translation. The carrying amount of the goodwill has been allocated as follows.

UK Lighting 2.3 2.3

European Obstruction 1.3 1.3
Australian Lighting 0.1 0.1
Japanese Lighting — 0.2
US Lighting 4.2 4.2
11.9 12.0
The Group tests goodwill (at the CGU level) annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The fair value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair 
value based on the inputs in the valuation technique used. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount 
rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre‑tax rates that reflect current market assessments of a number of factors that impact on the time 
value of money and any risk specific to the CGU. The rate includes management’s assessment of a normal level of debt to equity ratio within similar 
companies in its sector. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent strategic forecasts approved by management covering a three‑year period. 
Management has arrived at the three‑year plan based upon certain assumptions derived from a combination of internal assessment and research 
carried out by external consultants who specialise in areas of the Group’s business and their knowledge of the business. The key assumptions within 
the three‑year forecasts are revenue growth (which varies depending on the CGU’s product groups and the markets addressed) and contribution 
margin, which is based on management’s best estimate of material, labour and production cost trends and manufacturing efficiencies. Cash flows in 
years four and five are extrapolated using similar growth rates to the first three years. Cash flows beyond the five‑year period are extrapolated using 
estimated growth rates of between 0% and 1%.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, 
the discount rates selected, and expected long‑term growth rates.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flow for the CGUs ranged from 9.8%–10.3% (2012: 8.6–9.3%).
The growth rates management has applied in the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs over the five‑year period vary due to the nature 
of the products, industries and countries in which the CGU operates.
Adverse changes in these assumptions could reduce the recoverable amount below carrying amount.
No such risks were identified in the current year, therefore no sensitivity was performed. 90      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

On 7 June 2012, Dialight plc’s US subsidiary Dialight Corporation, acquired the trade and assets of Airinet Inc, a lighting controls company, for up‑front 
consideration of $2.6m with additional sums payable based on future revenue through to 2020 of up to $7.4 million. Dialight assumed no liabilities 
on the acquisition and all employees transferred to Dialight Corporation on completion. All patent applications have transferred to Dialight ownership.

19. Employee benefits
Defined benefit pension obligations
The Group makes contributions to two defined benefit plans (referred to below as Plan A and Plan B) to provide benefits for employees upon retirement. 
Both plans are closed to new members and future accrual. The plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and 
investment risk. Both plans are final salary defined benefit schemes and are administered by separate funds that are legally separate from the Group. 
Trustees include independent and company‑appointed individuals. The trustees of the plans are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan 
participants and are responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment) of the funds.
The Company is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the Funds following a valuation which must be carried out at least 
once every three years. The next valuation of the Fund is currently ongoing. In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected the Company 
may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the position is better than expected 
contributions may be reduced. The Company expects to pay contributions of £300,000 in respect of the Fund in the year to 31 December 2014. The weighted 
average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 16 years.

PSP
In September 2005 the shareholders approved the PSP .
During the year an award under the PSP was made to the Executive Directors and senior managers, details of which are set out below. The award was 
split into two components, one of which was based on the EPS performance of the Group, and the other based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) performance.

23. Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring 
and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’ s risk management framework. The Group’ s risk policies 
are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews 
the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk
Trade and other receivables
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations by not paying the receivables due.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
Operationally the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Each new customer is analysed individually 
for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. 
The Group’s review includes external ratings when available and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are set for customers. Customers 
that do not meet the benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a pre‑payment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. Impairment losses 
are determined having taken into account special customer circumstances and financial position, together with Group information about general payment trends. 98      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount 
owing is possible; at that point the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against the financial asset directly.
Other non‑trade receivables of £0.8m (2012: £0.9m) are not past due and have no impairment.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income. The objective 
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk setting a proportion of any borrowings to a fixed rate basis. Historically interest rate 
swaps have been considered and entered into. At 31 December 2013, the Group has no borrowings other than a bank overdraft of £1.7m.
Foreign currency risk
Exposure to currency risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than each subsidiaries functional 
currency. The currencies giving rise to risk are primarily Euro and US Dollars.
Where possible the Group uses natural hedging within the Group to hedge the majority of its foreign currency risk. Natural hedging is the mechanism 
whereby the cash inflows in a particular currency are matched to the cash outflows in that currency at the same business or different group company. 
Foreign exchange contracts may be taken out to manage exposures that are not mitigated through natural hedging.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than UK Sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept 
to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short‑term imbalances. Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013     99

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash 
or another financial asset. The Group’ s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’ s reputation.
Exposure to liquidity risk
For non‑derivative financial liabilities the Group’s exposure relates principally to trade and other payables.
Trade and other payables arise in the normal course of business and there are no unusual or onerous terms and conditions.

Capital management 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development 
of the business. The Board considers consolidated total equity as capital. As at 31 December 2013 this totalled £66.7m (2012: £63.0m). The Board’s 
target is to generate a return on capital in excess of 25% excluding cash holdings. In 2013, the return was 20.0% compared to 40.8% in 2012. 
In respect of a dividend, the Board has a dividend policy and aims for three times cover. The result for 2013 was 1.7 times (2012: 3.2 times). 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short‑term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the longer 
term, however, permanent changes, in particular in foreign exchange rates, would have an impact on equity value and consolidation earnings.
At 31 December 2013 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in the value of the Euro and US Dollar against UK Sterling would have reduced the 
Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £0.2m), and would have reduced the Group’s equity 
by approximately £0.2m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £0.1m).

obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of Dialight Europe Limited, 
the principal employer, to make payments in the Scheme up to a maximum amount equal to the entire aggregate liability, on the date on which any liability 
under the Guarantee arises, of every employer (within the meaning set out in Section 318 of the Pensions Act 2004 and regulations made thereunder) 
in relation to the Scheme, were a debt under Section 75(2) of the Pensions Act 1995 to have become due on that date. No provision has been made 
in relation to this contingency.

Notes to the Company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2013
28. Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared under historic cost 
accounting rules and in accordance with UK GAAP .
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the financial statements.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt 
from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
No statement of total recognised gains and losses is required under 
UK GAAP as it is treated as related to the profit and loss account. 
Actuarial movements and related deferred tax will therefore only 
appear in the reserves note.
The Company is exempt from the requirement of FRS 1 “Cash Flow 
Statements” to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the 
Company is consolidated in the Group consolidated financial statements.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated net 
realisable value, of tangible fixed assets on a straight‑line basis over the 
expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal 
annual rates used for this purpose are:
Office equipment between 10% and 20%
Computer equipment  between 20% and 33.3%
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings  between 10% and 20%
Motor vehicles between 25% and 33.3%
Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account 
on a straight‑line basis over the period of the lease.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is 
covered by a forward exchange contract. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting in respect of all 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the 
balance sheet date.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provisions 
for impairment in value. Where the consideration for the acquisition of 
a subsidiary undertaking includes shares in the Company to which the 
provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 apply, the cost 
represents the nominal value of shares issued together with the fair 
value of any additional consideration given and costs.
Pension contributions
The Company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution 
plans. The assets of all the arrangements are held separately from the 
assets of the Company in independently administered funds. The amount 
charged against profits in respect of defined contribution arrangements are 
the contributions payable to those arrangements in the accounting period.
For the defined benefit arrangements the assets are measured at 
market values. The liabilities are measured using the projected unit 
method, discounting at the current rate of return of a high quality 
corporate bond of the appropriate term and currency to the liability, 
as required under FRS 17.
The defined benefit scheme surplus or deficit is recognised in full 
and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The movement in the deficit is split between operating charges, financing 
items and actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised gains 
and losses.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability 
at that date to the extent that they are appropriately recognised and are 
no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not 
meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet approximates 
to fair value.
Share‑based payments
The PSP allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair 
value of awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to receive the awards. The fair value of the awards 
granted is measured using a pricing model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the awards were granted. The amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share awards 
that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving 
the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants awards over its own shares to the employees 
of its subsidiaries, it recognised an increase in the cost of investment in its 
subsidiaries equivalent to the equity‑settled share‑based payment charge 
recognised in its subsidiary’s financial statements with the corresponding 
credit being recognised directly in equity. 104      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

During the year an award under the PSP was made to the Executive Directors and senior managers, details of which are set out below. The award 
was split into two components, one of which was based on the EPS performance of the Group, and the other based on the Group’s Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance.

The principal assumptions at the balance sheet date (expressed as weighted averages) are:
UK Scheme (% per annum)
2013 2012 2011
Discount rate at 31 December 4.40 4.40 4.70
Future salary increases n/a n/a n/a

Inflation – RPI 3.60 2.90 3.00
Inflation – CPI 2.80 2.40 2.20
Deferred revaluation 2.80 2.40 2.20
The expected long‑term rates of return were:

Equities n/a n/a n/a
Bonds 4.40 4.40 3.00
Cash 4.40 3.00 3.00
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2013, used SAPS mortality tables 
based on year of birth (as is published by the Institute of Actuaries). The UK mortality tables are based on the latest mortality investigations and reflect 
an industry‑wide recognition that life expectations have improved. The average life expectancy of an individual currently aged 45 years and retiring at age 
65 years is 24.10 years for males and 26.5 years for females. For individuals currently aged 65 years the average life expectancy is 22.2 years for males 
and 24.6 years for females.
The expected long‑term rate of return for investments is based on the portfolio as a whole and not on individual asset categories. The return is based 
exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments which are crossed checked against market expectations from external sources.
The Company expects that contributions to the defined benefit plan in 2014 will be at a similar level to contributions paid in 2013.
38. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions conferred by FRS 8 and has not disclosed transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries that 
are part of the Group or the investees of the Group.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions available under FRS 29 whereby parent companies are not required to apply the disclosure 
requirements of the standard in their own single entity financial statements, on the basis that the disclosures are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 112      Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2013

This photograph shows a microstructure of brazed titanium alloy and pure titanium. Brazing is a versatile metal joining method which is suitable for a range of alloys 
and can be carried out by various methods in order to create simple or complex components. Owing to titanium’s high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion-
resistance, it is used to make strong, lightweight alloys, usually by alloying with aluminium and vanadium, for use in aerospace and other critical applications.
Operating an international network of facilities, Bodycote is the world’s 
leading provider of thermal processing services.
Experienced in supporting large multi-national customers and their supply chains, 
as well as local niche specialists, Bodycote provides a vital link in the manufacturing 
process for virtually every market sector including aerospace and defence,

Business model
Provider of essential services to engineering manufacturers
Heat Treatment and Metal Joining 
  Heat treatments are controlled processes used 
to alter the microstructure of materials such as 
metals and alloys to impart properties which 
benefit the working life of a component.
  Metal joining includes specialised processes 
used to join and assemble parts, sometimes 
dissimilar in material.
Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP)
  HIP combines very high temperature with inert 
gas under very high pressure. HIP can be used to 
eliminate porosity in castings and manufacture 
specialist components with unique properties.
 
Surface Technology 
  Surface technologies are used extensively to 
prolong the working life of components and 
protect them from environmental factors such 
as corrosion and abrasion. 
The global leader
Value of the network
  Bodycote’s global network of over 170 facilities 
in 27 countries brings economies of scale – 
particularly for energy consumption and 
equipment utilisation. This makes Bodycote’s 
processing inherently more efficient than 
customers’ in-house operations and limits 
the ability of smaller thermal processing 
companies to compete. The capital intensive 
nature of Bodycote’s business also provides 
significant barriers to entry.
  The scope of Bodycote’s network enables 
Bodycote to specialise more effectively 
than competitors at individual locations and 
provides comprehensive service back-up 
for our customers.
Transferable know-how

opportunities for the transfer of knowledge 
and skills, and the transfer of technology.
  With some of the best metallurgists, engineers 
and technicians in the industry, Bodycote is 
ideally placed to provide solutions for customers, 
whatever their market or wherever in the world 
they may be.
 
Long-term agreements
  In many cases customer relationships lead to 
component and service-specific agreements 
which embody protection and freedom from 
risk for the customer and Bodycote. These are 
often exclusive in character and provide the 
basis for mutual business development, with 
both companies freed to concentrate capital 
and other resources on core competencies.
Strategic partnerships
  Strategic partnering is Bodycote’s win-win 
approach to improving the traditional subcontract 
processing method, achieved by ensuring 
processing is close to the customer, including 
where appropriate at greenfield facilities adjacent 
to their premises.
The partner of choice

  Bodycote has become the partner of choice 
for the world’s most respected and innovative 
engineering companies by providing highly 
efficient, cost-effective services to the highest 
quality standards through strategic investment 
in people and the latest technology, equipment 
and quality systems.
Quality
  Bodycote’s quality management systems, 
validated by major engineering OEMs, have 
been developed to meet the requirements 
of international and national accrediting bodies. 
All Bodycote facilities hold industry and customer 
approvals appropriate to the services they offer 
and the markets they serve.

mean that projects can extend beyond 
customers’ in-house capabilities, developing 
specific processes and equipment for a 
customer, where required, and finding solutions 
to meet needs.

Annual Report 2011
Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information
Bodycote provides thermal processing services which 
improve material properties such as strength, durability and 
corrosion resistance, enabling manufacturers’ components 
to work more efficiently with significantly extended 
operational lifetimes. Bodycote’s services consist of a 
number of core technologies: heat treatment and metal 
joining, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and surface technology.
Heat treatment and metal joining
Heat treatments are controlled processes used to alter the 
microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, to impart 
properties which benefit the working life of a component, for 
example: increased surface hardness, temperature resistance, 
ductility and strength. Metal joining includes specialised processes 
such as electron beam welding, vacuum and honeycomb brazing 
– complex operations requiring a fusion of expertise and 
technology.
Bodycote offers an extensive range of heat treatment services and 
specialist metal joining techniques from facilities around the world. 
With unmatched capacity and computerised systems, Bodycote 
facilities can process a wide range of component sizes to exacting 
standards with reliable, repeatable results.
Hot isostatic pressing (HIP)
HIP combines very high temperature (up to 2,000°C) with inert 
gas under very high pressure (up to 30,000 psi – equivalent to that 
found at an ocean depth of 11,000m such as at the bottom of the 
Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean). HIP can be used to eliminate 
porosity in castings and consolidate encapsulated powders to 
dense materials. Dissimilar materials can be bonded together to 
manufacture unique cost-effective components. Every week a 
typical Bodycote HIP plant will process many tons of titanium, 
aluminium, steel and super-alloy castings, removing porosity and 
improving the performance of parts such as turbine blades 
and oilfield components.
With the largest operational capacity in the world and a wide 
variety of sizes of equipment, Bodycote HIP is able to 
accommodate large volumes of small product as economically 
as large individual components.
Surface technology
Surface technologies are used extensively to prolong the working 
life of components and protect them from environmental factors 
such as corrosion and abrasion. The range of surface treatments 
available from Bodycote covers a wide variety of applications, 
providing manufacturers with solutions to meet requirements 
such as durability, wear resistance, improved hardness and 
electrical conductivity.
Bodycote is a provider of specialised plasma spray, high velocity 
oxy fuel (HVOF) and thermally formed ceramic treatments and 
is able to surface engineer components (including complex 
geometric shapes and internal bores) that are designed to 
operate in the most demanding of industrial applications.
Bodycote has become the partner of choice for the world’s 
most respected and innovative engineering companies by 
providing highly efficient, cost-effective services to the 
highest quality standards through strategic investment 
in people and the latest technology, equipment and 
quality systems.
By outsourcing non-core but vitally important thermal processing 
requirements to Bodycote, customers are able to concentrate their 
business resources where they are needed most. Bodycote’s 
services offer tangible benefits to customers such as reduced 
equipment maintenance, capital expenditure, energy costs, 
people costs and a major reduction in CO2 emissions.
Bodycote has a long history of successful outsourcing 
partnerships, from global to local manufacturers. In many cases, 
subcontracting relationships lead to component and service-
specific long-term agreements, or strategic partnering 
arrangements, which embody protection and freedom from risk 
for the customer and Bodycote. These are normally exclusive in 
character and provide the basis for mutual business development, 
with both companies freed to concentrate capital and other 
resources on core competencies.
Making innovations possible
Bodycote’s extensive facilities and expertise mean development 
projects can expand far beyond customers’ in-house capabilities, 
helping to realise goals more quickly and more cost-effectively.
Around the globe, Bodycote has dedicated teams working on a 
variety of projects. When required, this may include the 
development of specific processes and equipment for a customer 
or verification of materials or designs, prior to their application.

Chairman’s statement
Overview
In my 2010 statement I indicated that, following the significant 
restructuring undertaken by the Group, Bodycote should be 
capable of delivering improved through-cycle returns. The 2011 
results provide proof of this progress, despite the broad macro-
economic uncertainty which we encountered throughout the year.
Of particular relevance was the step change in basic headline EPS 
(+78.7%) which reflects the strategic changes to the business in 
the last three years. Just as satisfying was the increase in the 
return on capital employed to 16.9%, supported by a positive net 
cash position at the year end. The renewed vigour at all levels 
within the Group, linked to the revitalised Bodycote business 
model, underpins the Board’s confidence that further progress 
in all aspects of our operations can be achieved.
Dividend
Taking into consideration the ongoing improvement in the Group’s 
results and its strengthened financial position the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 7.3p per share payable in May 
2012 following shareholder approval at the AGM. Together with 
the interim dividend of 3.6p per share paid in November 2011, the 
total dividend for the year will amount to 10.9p costing £20.7m, 
which represents an increase of 25.3% when compared to the 
2010 amount. 
Governance
I recognise that one of the most important tasks as Chairman of 
the Board is to ensure that the Group at all times operates to the 
highest standards. By this I mean that the Board operates 
effectively, that there are proper procedures to identify and 
evaluate business risks and that we continue to embed an 
appropriate internal control culture across the Group. Achievement 
of these objectives will ensure that the whole business operates in 
an effective and ethical manner. This year we have taken steps to 
boost our employee training, health and safety procedures and 
sustainability reporting. Further details of progress in these areas 
are reported in the Governance section of the Annual Report. By 
operating effectively to the highest standards, while maintaining 
the drive at all levels continually to improve our business policies 
and procedures, I believe that the seeds of our future success 
are being sown. 
The renewed vigour at all levels 
within the Group, linked to the 
revitalised Bodycote business 
model, underpins the Board’s 
confidence that further progress 
in all aspects of our operations 
can be achieved.

Chairman Bodycote plc 11
Annual Report 2011
Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information
Board
The composition of the Board remained unchanged throughout 
2011. It is an effective Board which brings together a group of 
individuals with an appropriate combination of business skills, 
management experience and industry knowledge. The Bodycote 
Board is small by design and its members interact well, with each 
member contributing fully at our meetings. Every year I evaluate 
the effectiveness of the Board and its members following 
interviews with each of my colleagues and also with external 
advisers. At our November 2011 Nominations Committee meeting 
we identified that, while the Board was effective, there was a 
need to broaden the Board membership, particularly with respect 
to gender, ethnicity and age. We have engaged an international 
search firm to identify suitable candidates with relevant hands-on 
experience. I hope to be able to report on the successful outcome 
of this search in the coming months.
Summary
The successful restructuring of Bodycote over the last few years 
has resulted in encouraging levels of sales growth and an excellent 
profit and margin improvement. At the same time, strong cash 
flow focus and tight balance sheet controls have resulted in a 
positive net cash position. We have, therefore, increased the 
dividend by 25.3% in 2011.
These results have been attained through the efforts of Stephen 
Harris our CEO and his 5,500 colleagues across the globe who 
have worked tirelessly to achieve this improvement in the 
Company’s fortunes. On your behalf I would like to thank all of 
them, for their ongoing contribution to the success of your 
Company.
I said last year that Bodycote is a first class business with good 
prospects for the future. I remain firmly of that view.

Annual Report 2011
Chief Executive’s review
Trading overview
Bodycote delivered a strong financial result in 2011, moving the 
Group closer to achieving the kind of performance to which we 
aspire. Sales increased 14% to £570.7m, headline operating profit
1
 
was £85.5m, an increase of 64%
2
 and headline margins improved 
to 15%. Basic headline EPS grew to 32.7 pence, a major step 
forward from the EPS performance the Bodycote group has 
previously achieved.
In the early part of the year much of the growth in market demand 
was driven by the tail end of recovery in the early cycle markets 
such as automotive and a strengthening in a number of the 
general industrial segments. As the year progressed the expected 
ramp up in the later cycle markets of aerospace and energy started 
to feature more strongly. These ’secular growth‘ markets are now 
starting to move from slow recovery mode into an increasing rate 
of longer term underlying growth. While we have benefited from 
the cyclical recovery in many of our markets it is particularly 
pleasing to see that we continue to expand our market share and, 
as a consequence, are driving growth above the underlying rate 
of those markets.
Improved margins are being achieved in nearly every area of the 
Group. The improvement stems in part from higher volumes, but 
a significant amount comes from an improvement in mix as we 
focus on higher added-value opportunities. Improving efficiency 
continues to be a key focus for the Group; it is notable that while 
average headcount reduced by 1%, sales grew by 14%.
Net capital expenditure increased to £44.5m which was 0.9 times 
depreciation (0.8 times in 2010). Maintenance capital remained 
relatively unchanged at approximately 0.4 times depreciation.  
The increase in capital expenditure primarily reflects a higher level 
of expansion capital in the aerospace and energy markets, the 
emerging economies and specific chosen technologies.
Return on Capital Employed was 16.9% compared to 10.1% in 
2010. This is an important metric for the long term performance 
of the Group. The Headline operating cash flow, measured after 
capital spending, was £96.0m representing profit-to-cash 
conversion of 112%. Our free cash flow
1
 of £70.5m enabled 
the elimination of net debt by year end.
Strategic progress
Bodycote has continued to develop in line with the strategic 
direction that we outlined at the start of 2010. Our differentiated 
focus on each of Automotive & General Industrial and Aerospace 
& Energy is delivering results. Some of the evidence of this is the 
increased rate of securing larger long term contracts that has been 
a notable feature of the business in 2011. The new agreements 
with Rolls-Royce and Precision Castparts Corp reflect our strategic 
focus on the secular growth markets of aerospace and energy.
The agreement with automotive supplier, ZF Lenksysteme, in 
China is a good example of our ‘hub and spoke’ expansion strategy 
for the emerging markets, where we develop new work at a hub 
location and move out to a new greenfield facility once volumes 
justify. The business with this customer has been developed at 
our ‘hub’ site in Wuxi, China, and will now be transferred to a new 
greenfield site being built in Jinan, China. This will make way for 
further business development at Wuxi while at the same time 
helping the expansion of our services to other customers near 
the new plant in Jinan.
Bodycote’s strategy is aimed at 
growing the business above and 
beyond the background growth 
rate of the global economy 
while delivering consistently 
superior value. The pace of 
execution of this strategy is 
gaining momentum and we 
enter 2012 in good shape.

In general, the expansion strategy in our emerging markets has 
been going extremely well. Our business in China, Poland, the 
Czech Republic and Turkey has grown strongly as capacity has 
been added. The business in Romania is, as yet, still small but 
is doing well and has attractive prospects for the future. 
We converted our majority shareholding in this territory into a 
wholly owned venture in 2011. Revenues in the emerging 
markets, excluding Brazil, grew by 23%. The financial results 
in Brazil were the only disappointment in the year, with the 
losses virtually unchanged from 2010. This was largely driven 
by the restructuring induced dip in sales (down 27% on 2010).  
This programme has now been completed and operationally the 
Brazilian business is in good shape to deliver a high level of service 
to customers. We are cautiously optimistic that we can achieve 
substantial progress in the medium term, but experience has 
shown that this is likely to take longer in this territory than we 
have typically achieved in other parts of the Group.
Significant progress has been made on the development of the 
Group’s proprietary products business units.
  Speciality Stainless Steel Products (S³P) continues to exceed 
our expectations, with demand for these specialist processes 
continuing to outstrip supply. Sales grew by 21%, we added 
25% more capacity during the year and a further 50% capacity 
increase is under construction to meet the increasing 
opportunities we have.
  The Hot Isostatic Pressing Product Fabrication (HIP PF) 
business unit revenues grew by over 60%, with expansion of 
activity in all territories. The constraint to expansion of this 
business has, so far, largely been an issue of recruiting and 
training sales and operational resources at a sufficient rate.  
Much progress has been made during the year and the 
business now has significant strength and depth of expertise. 
HIP PF specific capital equipment requirements are relatively 
modest and expansion of this capacity is proceeding well.  
General HIP capacity is used both for HIP PF and HIP Services. 
Demand for HIP services from the aerospace and industrial gas 
turbine markets is buoyant and we expect further growth in this 
area for some considerable time. As a result of the HIP PF 
growth and the HIP Services growth trends, we are starting to 
see capacity constraints ahead. Our initial capacity pinch-point 
is in North America.  In response to this we have agreed to 
invest over $20m of expansion capital in this area which will be 
deployed over the next eighteen months.
Opportunities to expand the business continue to surface at a 
high rate in our more established markets in Europe and North 
America. A good proportion of these are as a result of technology 
changes driven by environmental factors such as elimination of 
chrome plating or the pursuit of lighter vehicles with better fuel 
efficiency and lower emissions. The services and processes we 
offer in these areas such as Corr-I-Dur
®
 and low pressure 
carburising provide our customers with a very high value 
proposition and consequently we are able to secure above 
average returns on investment.
The combination of the various elements of our strategy, in 
technology driven expansion, emerging markets expansion and 
specific secular growth market expansion, leads to a higher 
demand for capital investment. Returns on investment in these 
areas are all very attractive and we expect in the near term that 
the Group will invest in capital expenditure at a slightly higher  
level than the depreciation charge.
Bodycote is now debt free and has strong cash generation.  
These characteristics enable us to consider enhancing our 
potential for future profit growth by increased investment, both 
internally for organic growth and through selective acquisitions. 
We seek a balance between gaining immediate returns, longer 
term growth prospects and limitation of risk. Our acquisition focus 
is on achieving attractive returns on investment through ‘bolt-ons’  
to our existing business. 
Summary & outlook
2011 has been another year of improving operational and financial 
performance for the Group. The performance improvement and 
growth in the last few years has been continuous and the Group 
is starting to march to a drumbeat, notwithstanding the hesitation 
that occurred in the global economic recovery in the second half  
of 2011.
Bodycote's strategy is aimed at growing the business above and 
beyond the background growth rate of the global economy while 
delivering consistently superior value. The pace of execution of 
this strategy is gaining momentum and we enter 2012 in good 
shape.
The macroeconomic environment may continue to be challenging, 
but with nearly half of the Group’s activity in areas which have  
long term growth drivers that are less likely to be impacted by 
economic headwinds we believe there is a good prospect that 
the business will continue to move forward in the coming year.

Injecting better performance – a component journey
 To obtain the correct core 
structure prior to nitriding, 
the part is hardened and 
tempered, to provide the 
necessary toughness and 
impact resistant properties.
 The part is thermal deburred
to remove any burrs in the 
passageways and to activate 
the surface by neutralising 
the chromium, which helps 
accelerate the diffusion of 
nitrogen into the surface during 
the nitriding cycle, ensuring 
a uniform case depth.
  Controlled gas nitriding
gives the part very high 
surface hardness with 
minimum distortion, 
providing excellent wear 
and corrosion resistance.
Due to the nitriding process, minimal finishing 
operations are needed. The part undergoes 
finish grinding and lapping to its final size.

Safety critical service – a component journey
Rough machining is 
carried out, usually to 
within 1/16th inch of 
the final part size.
 The shaft is stabilised at approximately 
50°C below the final tempering temperature 
to remove any machining stresses
 Areas that do not require surface hardening are masked using bronze,
tin or copper plating and the shaft is then gas nitrided at a temperature 
not exceeding the stabilising temperature. This diffuses nitrogen into 
the surface to provide high hardness and excellent wear resistance.
 Post nitriding, the plating and the white layer

Markets
Aerospace, Defence & energy markets Automotive & General Industrial markets
Aerospace and defence revenues improved in 2011 by 12.1% 
due to a combination of new contract gains and market demand. 
New build sales improved as both Boeing and Airbus increased 
production rates and a recovery in passenger numbers 
resulted in an increase in aircraft flying hours which led to an 
increase in sales to the maintenance segment.
Power generation sales were flat for the Group as a whole in 2011 
compared to 2010. This sector was the last to see the impact 
of the 2008/9 recession and is proving the last to recover. 
However, revenues improved during the year in North America 
but were offset by the continuing softness in the requirements 
for European OEMs and their supply chains. 
Sales from oil & gas customers increased by 27.3%. 
North American oil & gas production and exploration has been 
good and shale gas fracking activity has been strong. Oil & gas 
revenues have continued to be robust although there was 
evidence of some inventory correction in the final quarter of 2011.
In automotive, the Group built on the gains achieved in 2010 by 
offering the broad range of new and traditional processes the 
sector requires, along with the reliability of service and supply 
that the extensive network of facilities allows. Sales to the car and 
light truck sector grew by 5.2% and to heavy truck by 30.9%.
General industrial revenues enjoyed a broad based continued 
recovery throughout 2011 and sales increased in the year 
by 17.6%.
In North America, automotive revenues improved throughout 2011 
and for the year as a whole were ahead of 2010 by 9.0%. Car and 
light truck sales increased by 4.0% and heavy truck increased by 
43.8%. General industrial sales grew steadily throughout the 
year and revenues were ahead 8.8% compared to 2010.
In Western Europe sales growth in the automotive sector was 
strong in the first half but the rate of improvement slowed in the 
second half against more difficult comparables. Nevertheless 
revenue growth for the whole year was 15.0%, with 8.0% to the 
car and light truck sector and 42.4% to the heavy truck sector. 
Revenues in Germany and its key trading partners (Netherlands 
and Czech Republic) remained robust through year end although 
there was some softening in the final quarter in France and 
Sweden. General industrial sales were robust in all territories in 
Western Europe with revenues up by 21.4% year on year.
The Group’s business in emerging markets fared very well again in 
2011 in all territories except Brazil. Excluding Brazil, revenues grew 
by 23.3%. The Brazilian business has been the subject of major 
restructuring, which has included reducing the workforce by a 
further 31% in 2011. The closure of the largest facility was 
completed and a new greenfield location started trading, benefiting 
from the Group’s European know-how, and expanded capacity. 
The dislocation caused by these changes, along with the exit from 
low value added work, resulted in revenues falling by 27.5%. 
The business has a much reduced cost base and improved process 
capability and now has the right platform to benefit from the 
growth that we expect in Latin America. 18 Bodycote plc

Turbine blades and vanes
Turbine blades and vanes, whether from an aircraft or land-based gas 
turbine engine, must withstand extreme temperatures in operation. 
These materials frequently operate at temperatures approaching their 
melting point - heat treatment, HIP and the use of surface technology 
allow these blades to operate reliably at these high temperatures for 
extended periods of time. Bodycote operates an international network

Revenues for the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) divisions 
were £233.5m in 2011 compared to £202.1m in 2010, an increase 
of 15.5% (17.0% in constant currencies). This growth reflects a 
continuation of the strong growth in revenue to oil & gas 
customers and increasing activity in the aerospace sector, both 
for new build and maintenance requirements. Industrial gas 
turbine (IGT) demand remained weak in Europe but improved in 
North America. Sales from the Group's proprietary HIP product 
fabrication (HIP PF) technology grew by over 60%.
Headline operating profit
1
 for ADE was £51.1m (2010: £33.9m). 
The headline operating profit margin improved from 16.8% to 
21.9% reflecting the divisions’ lower cost base and higher 
capacity utilisation.
During 2011, heat treatment capacity has been added in southern 
USA as the Group’s revenues from conventional drilling for oil and 
hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for gas have increased. The Group’s 
aerospace capability has been enhanced in California and the 
greenfield site in Empalme, Mexico was completed. In the coming 
year, it is expected that capital expenditure will be slightly above 
depreciation as we support increasing customer requirements in a 
number of countries stemming from strong anticipated demand in 
the aerospace and energy markets. Net capital expenditure in 
2011 was £15.2m (2010: £9.9m) which represents 0.8 times 
depreciation (2010: 0.6 times depreciation).
Capital employed in ADE in 2011 was £219.2m (2010: £230.1m). 
The reduction reflects continuing management focus on 
improving return on capital. Return on capital employed in 2011 
was 23.3% (2010: 14.7%).
Achievements in 2011
The heat treatment business gained additional approvals from 
Boeing for titanium processing and concluded several important 
new or extended long-term agreements. A number of major 
suppliers in the oil & gas sector have chosen to use our proprietary 
HIP PF technology for the first time. A new long term agreement 
for HIP Services was signed with PCC Structurals, a subsidiary of 
Precision Castparts Corp and the Group committed to additional 
large HIP capacity to support this contract and the ongoing growth 
in HIP Product Fabrication.
Organisation and people
Overall headcount at 31 December 2011 was 1,983 
(2010: 1,926), an increase of 3.0% compared to revenue growth 
in ADE of 15.5%.
Looking ahead
With exceptionally strong order books at the aircraft OEMs, no sign 
of weakness in oil prices and with the strength of our offering in 
heat treatment, surface technology and HIP, the ADE business is 
expected to build on the success seen in 2011 in the coming year. 
The business will be maintaining its clear focus on customer 
service and flexibility as it strives to stay ahead of the growing 
customer requirements for Bodycote’s services.

Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) revenues were £337.2m in 
2011, compared to £297.7m in 2010, an increase of 13.3% (11.5% 
in constant currencies). This growth reflects a widespread 
improvement in demand along with market share gains, 
particularly with general industrial customers. The rate of sales 
growth was good across all of the automotive and general 
industrial sectors in the first half of 2011 building on the 
improvements seen in 2010. In the second half, the year on year 
growth slowed due to the substantial strengthening in the second 
half of 2010 but progress remained sound. Sales of the Group’s 
proprietary Speciality Stainless Steel Processes (S
3
P) grew by 
over 20%. 
Headline operating profit
1
 in AGI was £44.7m compared 
to £25.6m in 2010. Headline margins improved markedly, from 
8.6% to 13.3% reflecting the divisions’ lower cost base and 
higher capacity utilisation. 
Net capital expenditure in 2011 was £27.0m (2010: £24.3m), 
which represents 0.9 times depreciation (2010: 0.8 times 
depreciation). Assuming no material change in demand in 2012 
we expect that capital expenditure will be just above depreciation 
in 2012 as we take advantage of numerous incremental sales 
opportunities across the network. Return on capital employed in 
2011 was 15.6% (2010: 8.8%). The increase reflects continuing 
focus on improving capital returns by increasingly targeting higher 
added-value activities. On average, capital employed in 2011 
was £286.2m (2010: £289.4m). 
Achievements in 2011
The focus in 2011 has been to build on the foundation established 
by the major restructuring programme of 2008 and 2009. The exit 
from loss making facilities and cessation of much low added value 
processing has seen a significant improvement in the profitability 
and return on capital in the AGI business. The Group has increased 
its capacity for S
3
P by 25% in 2011. New outsourcing contracts 
have been won in all geographies. The minority partner in the 
increasingly successful Romanian business was bought out.
Organisation and people
In July 2008, prior to the global economic downturn, the AGI 
business employed 5,201 people. Notwithstanding revenues in 
AGI increasing by 13.3%, headcount has declined, from 3,456 
at the end of 2010, to 3,423 at 31 December 2011, clearly 
demonstrating success in keeping costs under control and 
driving productivity.
Looking ahead
Expansion of the footprint in the emerging markets and a focus 
on technology change driven growth (particularly with processes 
such as Corr-I-Dur
®
 and low pressure carburising), will continue 
to be the priorities for the AGI business. With restructuring 
completed in Brazil, we have a revitalised platform that should 
enable growth to start to mirror the levels of achievement that 
are being obtained in the rest of the emerging markets.

Group revenues for 2011 increased by 14.2% from £499.8m to 
£570.7m. In constant currencies the annual increase was 13.7% 
(£68.4m). 
Headline operating profit for the year increased from £52.1m to 
£85.5m, and headline operating margin was 15.0% (2010: 10.4%). 
Operating profit was £80.4m (2010: £51.2m) after charging £0.9m 
(2010: £0.9m) in respect of the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and £4.2m (2010: £nil) in respect of the impairment of 
goodwill and other intangible assets.
Headline operating cash flow
1
 for the Group was £96.0m 
(2010: £77.3m). This was 112.3% of headline operating profit 
(2010: 148.4%). Capital expenditure was again below depreciation 
at 0.9 times (2010: 0.8 times) as the Group continued to focus on 
increasing the utilisation of existing equipment. Working capital 
increased in line with activity levels, with increases in inventory 
and receivables largely offset by a corresponding increase in 
the level of payables.
After deducting interest and tax, the Group recorded positive 
free cash flow of £70.5m (2010: £57.2m).
exceptional costs
Total exceptional costs charged to the income statement 
amounted to £5.1m (2010: £0.9m). The amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets arises from acquisitions in prior years and the 
level of the charge remains constant at £0.9m (2010: £0.9m).
The charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
of £4.2m (2010: £nil) relates to the Group’s South American 
operations and reflects low current profitability in that region, as a 
consequence of the benefits of reorganisation taking longer to be 
realised than expected and the reduced size of the business 
following restructuring. No goodwill remains on the Group's 
balance sheet in respect of these businesses. The Board has 
concluded that no other impairment charge is required in 2011.
Except for the finalisation of work in France and Italy, which will be 
completed in 2012, restructuring actions are now complete. Net 
cash expenditure in 2011 as a result of the programme was £5.7m 
(2010: £9.2m). As the restructuring programme is now essentially 
complete, further savings will be modest. 
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2011 total 
£15.5m. Of the remaining costs, £8.8m is expected to be spent in 
2012 and £6.7m in 2013 and later. All expenditure after the end of 
2012 will relate to ongoing environmental remediation, primarily 
in the USA.

(which are generally not allowable for tax purposes).
Subject to any future tax legislation changes, the headline tax rate 
is expected to remain below the current UK statutory tax rate of 
26% in the medium term.

Net assets as at 
31 December 2010 771 .2 (320.4) 450.8
Net assets increased by £31.8m (7.1%) to £482.6m (2010: 
£450.8m). The major movements compared to 31 December 
2010 were a significant reduction in net debt of £51.4m, a 
decrease in property, plant and equipment of £14.1m, a reduction 
of goodwill and intangible assets of £6.6m, an increase in 
retirement benefit obligations of £1.9m, together with a decrease 
in net current liabilities of £5.0m and an increase in net deferred 
tax liabilities of £2.4m.
The decrease in property, plant and equipment was due to net 
capital expenditure of £44.5m being exceeded by depreciation 
of £48.2m, with foreign exchange variances increasing the net 
reduction to £14.1m.
Net deferred tax liabilities increased by £2.4m as a result of 
the use of tax losses reducing deferred tax assets, and an  
increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from capital 
investments. Restructuring provisions reduced by £4.7m,  
as Group restructuring activities proceeded as planned. 
Retirement benefit obligations increased by £1.9m during the 
year, primarily as a result of a change in discount rates reflecting 
lower corporate bond rates.
n et cash / (debt)
Group net cash at 31 December 2011 was £0.1m (2010: net debt 
£51.3m). During the year, loans of £58.5m under committed 
facilities were repaid. The Group continues to be able to borrow 
at competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be the 
most effective means of funding. 24 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
Cash flow
The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was £7.7m (2010: 
increase of £0.5m), made up of net cash from operating activities 
of £119.8m (2010: £95.6m), less investing activities of £45.9m 
(2010: £36.6m) and less cash used in financing activities of 
£81.6m (2010: £58.5m).
The increase in net cash flow from operating activities from 
£95.6m to £119.8m is driven primarily by the increase in headline 
EBITDA
1
 from £104.4m to £142.3m. Working capital increased in 
line with activity levels with increases in inventory and receivables 
largely offset by a corresponding increase in the level of payables. 
The net effect was an increase in the level of working capital 
of £1.8m (2010: decrease of £8.7m).
Net cash outflows from investing activities increased from 
£36.6m to £45.9m, as the levels of net capital expenditure in 2011 
at £44.5m (2010: £35.8m), although higher than in the prior year, 
remained below historical levels, reflecting continued tight 
management control. 
Net cash outflows used in financing activities increased from 
£58.5m to £81.6m. 2010 saw the repayment of £34.0m of loans, 
while 2011 saw a further repayment of loans of £59.3m, together 
with payment of dividends totalling £17.4m (2010: £20.9m).
There has been a continued focus on cash collection with debtor 
days at 31 December 2011 remaining constant at 59 days. 
Net interest payments for the year were £4.5m (2010: £5.5m) 
and tax payments were £15.3m (2010: £5.4m) as a result of 
the significant increase in profits.
Capital expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £44.5m (2010: £35.8m).  
The multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was  
0.9 times (2010: 0.8 times), which reflects the Group’s continued 
careful management of its capital expenditure programme. As at 
31 December 2011 the Group had capital expenditure creditors of 
£13.1m (2010: £6.9m). Major capital projects that were in progress 
during 2011 include additional investment in our HIP and S
3
P 
businesses, establishment of our new aerospace facility in 
Mexico, purchase and installation of new equipment in Poland, 
and expansion of our geographic footprint in China.
Borrowing facilities
During 2011, the £110m and US$20m revolving credit facilities were 
refinanced with a committed facility for £125m with a maturity date 
of 31 August 2016. The new facility has lower costs and improved 
terms compared to those it replaced. Total funding now available to 
Bodycote under its committed facilities is £236.4m (2010: £230.9m), 
expiring between July 2013 and August 2016.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had the following committed

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising the 
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
capital, reserves and retained earnings. 
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Board 
of Directors. The Group’s policy is to maintain gearing, determined 
as the proportion of net debt to total capital, within defined 
parameters, allowing movement in the capital structure appropriate 
to the business cycle and corporate activity. The gearing ratio at 
31 December 2011 has fallen to zero (2010: 11%) as a result of the 
year end net cash position and the increased profit in the period.
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the 
UK, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, USA and Brazil and 
cash lump sum obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the entire 
liabilities for which are reflected in the Group balance sheet. 
The net deficits in these arrangements are as follows:

Turkey are open to new members. All other arrangements are 
closed to new entrants.

The changes in accounting policies are detailed in the Accounting 
Policies on page 55 of this report. The adoption of new accounting

Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report, 
the Directors have considered the Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, as set out in this Group Review. 
This includes an overview of the Group’s financial position,  
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through 
a combination of committed and uncommitted facilities and 
overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are 
repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due for 
renewal as set out below. There is sufficient headroom in the 
committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities 
can be operated as contracted for the foreseeable future. 
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2011 were 
as follows:
  €125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 July 2013
  £125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
  $10m Letter of Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonable potential changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its 
current committed facilities.
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group's ability 
to access further funding. The Directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the Directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Annual Report 2011
Effective management of risks is essential to the delivery of the 
Group’s objectives. Under the leadership of the Vice-President 
(Risk and Business Processes), the Group is continuing to develop 
its risk management framework. The approach taken has been 
to identify and evaluate the business critical risks for each 
sub-division, and to determine measures in place to manage 
and mitigate each risk. In 2012 development of the risk 
management framework will focus on assurance that mitigation 
activities are effective. This work will be undertaken by Ernst & 
Young LLP as part of their new outsourced Internal Audit contract 
for the Group. Ernst & Young LLP have leading internal audit 
advisory and risk capability and they will help the Group 
develop its assurance framework.
The principal risks described below represent the most significant 
areas which the Board believes have a higher probability of 
impacting the Group’s financial performance and position, 
together with the actions initiated to mitigate the consequences.
Market and Customer r isks
Markets
Bodycote’s presence in 27 countries and in a wide variety of end 
markets acts as a natural hedge to balance out localised economic 
volatility. Nevertheless, the Group is continuously working to 
improve its responsiveness to changes in demand by keeping the 
cost base flexible without impacting customer service levels.  
The Board is mindful of the potential for volatility in demand for the 
Group's services while the Eurozone debt problems continue. 
Significant efforts have been made to strengthen Bodycote’s 
sales capability which includes maintaining close contact with 
customers to provide management with market intelligence. 
Furthermore the business uses analytical tools to track changes 
in demand and detailed plans document the measures to 
respond rapidly to a fall in sales.
Loss of key customers
The Group benefits from many long-term and partnership 
agreements with key customers. Damage to, or loss of, any of 
these relationships may be detrimental to Group results, although 
the Board believes this is highly unlikely as Bodycote has excellent 
long-term relationships with its major customers and the Group’s 
network of strategically located facilities ensures that it is the 
supplier of choice to these major manufacturers. Furthermore 
there is no significant customer dependency, with the Group’s 
top ten customers accounting for less than 13% of sales and 
the balance made up by many thousands of customers.
Corporate and Community r isks
Human r esources
Bodycote is reliant on its ability to recruit, develop and retain staff 
to meet future growth plans. Competition for resources is high and 
there is a risk that Bodycote may not be able to attract or to retain 
skilled individuals. As the market leader, Bodycote is seen as a 
source of talent by competitors, while the Group competes with 
employers from a wide range of sectors to attract staff into the 
business. The Group continued to invest in the implementation of 
its Human Resources Strategy, which covers succession planning, 
staff development, performance management, recruitment and 
the remuneration strategy. This was supported by the 
recruitment of a Group Learning & Development Manager and 
through the roll-out of HR software, such as SuccessFactors, 
on an enterprise level.
Safety & Health
Bodycote is committed to providing the highest level of protection 
in its work environment and to protecting the safety of its 
employees. The Group’s work environment presents a number of 
risks which require management. Shortcomings in health and 
safety arrangements can have a significant effect on individual 
employees, cause disruption to business and lead to financial 
penalties and loss of reputation. Safety and Health (S&H) policies 
are set by the Chief Executive Officer, supported by the newly 
appointed Group Head of Safety, Health and Environment and all 
facilities are required to operate in accordance with these policies. 
Responsibility for implementation of S&H policies lies with 
divisional management and each division has a professionally 
competent S&H manager in place. All facilities are subject to 
safety audits at least once a year, following standard audit 
programmes, and findings are reported to divisional and 
corporate management. 
environment
Bodycote is committed to providing the highest level of protection 
to the environment. Environmental policy is set by the Chief 
Executive Officer, supported by the newly appointed Group Head of  
Safety, Health and Environment. Historical use of solvents and other 
hazardous chemicals could have led to ground contamination. 
The environmental laws of the various jurisdictions impose actual 
and potential obligations on Bodycote to remediate contaminated 
sites, both those currently in use and, in some cases, those which 
have been sold. Bodycote incurs costs annually in meeting its 
obligations and maintains a provision of £15.8m to meet these 
liabilities. If this existing provision is inadequate to meet costs arising 
from environmental obligations, then this could impact the Group’s 
results. Some of the Group’s heat treatment plants continue to use 
solvents and other hazardous chemicals in small quantities but the 
risk of future contamination is managed by stringent procedures, 
typically under the requirements of the ISO 14001 environmental 
standard.
Operational r isks
Service quality
The Bodycote brand is reliant on the repeatable delivery of parts to 
agreed specification to an agreed time. Deterioration in quality or 
service levels can have serious long term consequences financially 
and to Bodycote’s reputation. Work that is released into use which 
is not in compliance with specification could arise as a result of 
system or human failure. Bodycote has stringent quality systems 
in place managed by qualified staff. Where necessary plants have 
relevant accreditations, such as ISO 9001, Nadcap and TS 16949. 
All facilities are subject to internal audits, external audits by 
accreditors or customer inspections at least once a year.
r egulatory r isks
r egulatory and legislative compliance
Bodycote operates in 27 countries which all have unique legislative 
and regulatory requirements, including tax regulations. In some 
countries regulations can vary from state to state. Non-compliance 
could lead to penalties, disruption to business, and diversion of 
management time and loss of reputation. To mitigate this risk 
Bodycote engages specialists with expertise in the local legislative 
and regulatory landscape to perform compliance activity or to 
advise local management.
Financial r isks
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the 
Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management 
and counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of 
minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a 
framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed 
periodically by the Board. Further details on the Group’s financial 
risks and risk management policies are provided in note 20 to the 
financial statements.

r isk Description Impact Mitigation
Market and Customer r isks
Markets A substantial proportion of Bodycote’s 
sales are closely linked to the economic 
cycle, 39% of Group sales are in 
Eurozone countries. Sales in the 
markets served by the AGI businesses 
(67% of the total Group) tend to 
develop in line with or ahead of the 
economic cycle, whereas aerospace 
and defence sales (20%) tend to track 
behind the economic cycle. Sales to the 
energy sectors (13%) are closely linked 
to energy prices, which in turn can be 
affected by general economic activity. 
Short order visibility means that 
accurately forecasting demand 
remains difficult.
As a low proportion of the Group’s 
costs are variable (approx 20%), a fall in 
sales will have a significant impact on 
profitability. 
p  Engage in continuous dialogue with customers 
and monitor macro-economic forecasts which 
should alert the Group to likely changes in 
demand.
p  Maintain flexibility of cost base e.g. by ensuring 
that a proportion of the workforce is employed 
on temporary contracts.
p  Respond quickly to changes in customer 
demand on a local or a Group-wide level. 
Loss of key 
customers
Damage to the relationship with key

Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers and to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations 
are sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one of 
the key challenges for management is to ensure availability of 
appropriately qualified people to support its continued growth. 
Bodycote is fortunate to have a competent and committed 
international team that is well respected in technical and business 
circles. Most acquisitions have been based on historical 
relationships with Bodycote personnel, which reflects the integrity 
of the Group’s people. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people 
both at local and group level. At local level the Company is 
committed to providing the appropriate skills and technical training 
which will allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in 
their roles and deliver excellent customer service. At group level a 
number of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive 
excellence in management.
An initiative to build further understanding and skill in the area of 
performance management is underway and being cascaded 
globally through the management population. Through 
communication of clear messages coupled with skill development, 
the organisation aims to raise the capability of its management 
population in driving performance. This initiative is backed by a 
new performance management IS system which supports the 
process.
Bodycote’s employment policies are non-discriminatory, 
complying with all current legislation to engender equal 
opportunity irrespective of race, gender, religion, disability, 
sexual orientation or nationality. Harassment is not tolerated.
Customers and suppliers
Bodycote has no significant suppliers who are wholly dependent 
upon the Group’s business. Suppliers are paid in line with 
contractual and legal obligations. 
We endeavour to respond quickly to changing customer demand, 
to identify emerging needs and to improve service availability and 
quality. We stay close to our current and potential customers 
building long-term relationships.
Community
During 2011 Bodycote launched a campaign to raise funds for the 
Japanese Red Cross, following the devastating earthquake and 
tsunami which hit the country. We encouraged our staff to make 
a donation, which the Group matched. The funds were donated 
directly to the Japanese Red Cross to assist those working to 
rebuild homes and communities.

r esponsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical 
standard, consistent with an international UK-listed company. 
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their 
personal interests do not at any time conflict with those of 
Bodycote. Shareholder employees are advised of and comply 
with share dealing codes.
Bodycote has systems in place designed to ensure compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations and conformity with all 
relevant codes of business practice. Further, Bodycote does 
not make political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ 
unfair trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within 
the requirements of the applicable laws. Employees are prohibited 
from either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern orally or in writing and in confidence to an independent 
third party provider to ensure anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Vice President Risk and Business Processes, 
who then passes the matter to the appropriate individual in 
the business to address.
A Bribery Training site has been put in place, translated into 
the major languages used throughout the Group, and relevant 
employees (approximately 15% of our workforce) have completed 
the interactive course. We have also reviewed our Competition 
Law training and are in the process of putting a similar training 
site in place.
Operational SHe performance
Bodycote is committed to building and maintaining a high reliability 
organisation; one that delivers consistently high performance 
across all aspects of safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
management. Its objective is to be known for the excellence of 
its SHE performance in all of its business activities and at all 
of its sites.
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
regularly exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of a robust safety management system, 
which includes appropriate policies and procedures.
KPI – accident frequency (lost-time injury rate)
Although Bodycote has reduced its lost-time accident rate by 
30% over the past five years, it recognises the need to improve. 
A revitalised global improvement strategy has been initiated, 
which will focus on all aspects of the safety management system, 
whilst developing cultural maturity. An important element of this 
is the role of leadership, including the active engagement of 
managers at all levels in managing safety, whilst recognising that 
all employees have responsibilities for their own safety and the 
safety of others.
environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption and re-use energy. The continuing focus on 
lessening its impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
advancing towards ISO 14001 accreditation at all of its facilities, 
with most of the Group having already achieved this standard.
Further efficiencies are always being sought, and to this end a 
global project is underway to implement an active energy 
management system within Bodycote globally. Through metering 
individual processes and equipment, it will be possible to compare 
similar processes at different sites and to identify opportunities 
to reduce energy use.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to lessen the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of our 
customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, 
which is operated around the clock so as to optimise thermal 
processing cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be 
using older technology in-house and running their equipment at 
reduced capacity, both of which are a drain on energy resources. 
Working with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more 
easily to carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of its customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in 
the reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering 
a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to 
manufacture new replacement parts, and treated parts often 
last up to twenty times longer than the original.
So, whilst thermal processing is an energy intensive business, 
it is a vital part of the manufacturing chain and its use saves 
the energy it consumes many times over.
KPI – ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is 
taken very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 
14001 helps to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects 
at Bodycote’s locations. At the end of 2011, 81% of our plants had 
achieved ISO 14001 accreditation – 139 plants out of a total of 171.
Carbon footprint and water consumption
Total CO2e emissions per £m sales decreased by 9% in 2011 and 
water usage per £m sales decreased by 2%. The Group’s total 
CO2 emission data is based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
as defined by the UK Government’s Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs, and data relating to this has been 
calculated to include country-specific electricity conversion 
factors.
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
facilities have been introduced. In 2011 the overall solvent use 
decreased by 16% compared with the previous year, including 
the complete cessation of methylene chloride use. 32 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
A greener, cleaner environment
Reducing any detrimental impact on the environment has become 
a growing focus of industry worldwide and Bodycote can assist 
with the drive towards carbon reduction and environmentally 
friendly approaches in a number of ways.
For example, certain heat treatment and thermally sprayed surface 
treatments are leading the way in the replacement of older, less 
environmentally friendly processes such as chrome plating.
Future restrictions that will be placed on chrome plating due to 
health and environmental issues have led many businesses, 
including the major aerospace companies, to embark on initiatives 
to replace it. These companies have identified thermal spray 
coatings as the preferred replacement for chrome plating.
Bodycote has been involved in a number of initiatives to 
replace chrome plate and results have shown that, in addition 
to the environmental benefits, thermally sprayed tungsten 
carbide outperforms hard chrome plate for both wear and 
corrosion protection.
Modern thermal processing techniques have allowed designers 
and manufacturers to use much lighter materials, such as 
aluminium and titanium, and have significantly prolonged 
component lifetimes. Through the effective use of thermal 
processing, parts can now be lighter and overall component 
weight reduced, leading to improved efficiency and reduced 
fuel consumption of products in service. Bodycote plc 33

The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Finance Director’s report, and all the information contained on pages  
4 to 48 together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Principal activities
The Company is a holding company with subsidiaries carrying on business in the provision of thermal processing services. The activities 
and locations of the principal subsidiary undertakings are set out on pages 97 and 98.
Group review
The Group review, which encompasses: 
  Strategy and objectives; 
  Measuring our progress;
  Chairman’s statement;
  Chief Executive’s review; 
  Business performance;
  Markets; 
  Business overview;
  Business review;
  Finance Director’s report; and
  Corporate responsibility and sustainability
is provided on pages 4 to 32 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the businesses of the Group, the financial 
performance during the year ended 31 December 2011, key performance indicators, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group and information about the use of financial instruments. The Group review has been prepared solely to assist the 
shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other party for 
any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have been made by the Directors in good faith using information available up to the date 
of this report and such statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and 
business risks. Since the end of the financial year no important events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 7.3p per ordinary share making a total for the year of 10.9p per share (2010: 8.7p). The 
final dividend, if approved, will be paid on 4 May 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 10 April 2012.
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2011 was £33.0m and during the year was increased by the issue of 
1,381,750 ordinary shares between 7 February and 21 December 2011 for a total consideration of £238,666, in connection with the 
Company’s executive share incentive schemes. At the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2011 the shareholders authorised the 
Company to purchase up to 18,988,191 of its own shares. This authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 25 April 2012, at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders. 
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 25. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be 
amended by a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the Directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on 
page 37. Under the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,011,049. 
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a 
whole, and the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.

Directors
The current Directors and their biographical details are listed on page 33 and all served throughout the year. Under the Articles of 
Association of the Company each Director must retire from office and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every third 
annual general meeting in order to continue to serve as a Director. However in view of the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further 
increase accountability, all Directors retired at the Annual General Meeting in 2011 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going 
forward all Directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting and will stand for re-election by the shareholder, if they wish to continue to 
serve as Directors of the Company. Accordingly, those Directors retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2012 Annual 
General Meeting are Messrs A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F. Landless, J. Vogelsang, J.A. Biles and Dr K. Rajagopal. The service 
agreements for Messrs Harris and Landless are terminable by 12 months’ notice. The remaining Directors do not have a service 
agreement with the Company and their appointments are terminable by six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and details of the Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 43 to 48. No Director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2011. Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) 
has remained in force for the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2011 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the 
benefit of the current Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the 
course of their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the Directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation 
to the Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.
Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a Company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not 
only had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or 
potential. Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a 
‘Situational Conflict’) which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one Company. In order to ensure 
that each Director was complying with the new duties, each Director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what 
Situational Conflicts affected him. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict 
until September 2012 and permitted each affected Director to attend and vote at Bodycote Directors’ meetings, on the basis that each 
such Director continued to keep Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate 
and in the interests of shareholders. Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, 
the Chairman or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment 
of employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation in strategy, production, 
safety and health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution 
to the Group made by their site and are advised of safety and health issues. The Group publishes in 11 languages, via the Group intranet, 
an electronic magazine for all staff detailing the Group’s activities, performance and some of its personalities. The Group’s Open Door 
Policy has been relaunched as the Group’s Open Door Line under which employee concerns can be voiced over the phone on an 
anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 1,600 Bodycote employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, which 
improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination. It is the Group’s policy to give 
full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, 
and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an 
employee become disabled the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the employment and arrange appropriate training. 
An equal opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Research and development
Product development and quality improvement at all Group companies is a continuous process. The Group has a policy of deploying the 
best technology available and actively seeking improvements. It also conducts research programmes with its customers.
Donations
Charitable donations during the year net of income tax amounted to £9,000 (2010: £6,000). There were no political contributions in 2010 
or 2011.
Creditors policy
Group operating companies are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which business transactions are conducted. It is 
Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with the terms agreed, provided that these suppliers have also 
complied with applicable terms and conditions. Creditor days at the year end for the Group were 46 days (2010: 46 days).  36 Bodycote plc

Auditor
In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as

Annual Report confirms that:
  so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and 
  each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Chairman’s message
As Chairman I have taken a leading role in shaping the governance agenda at Bodycote and wanted to take this opportunity to address 
shareholders on what I believe are the important governance developments at Bodycote over the last year.
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles of corporate governance contained in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code by promoting wide discussions on topics to which Board members contribute and demonstrate 
mutual engagement.
We strive to maintain best practice and continually seek to improve our practices for the benefit of our shareholders.
Alan Thomson
Chairman
Governance reporting
Board diversity
Following the publication of the Davies Report on the representation of women on plc boards, our Nominations Committee discussed its 
recommendation.
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 27 countries and therefore diversity generally is an integral part of how we 
do business. The Nominations Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant 
skills, experience, knowledge, personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our 
overriding aim in any new appointments must always be to select the best candidate. As, over time, we recruit new members we 
would expect to address the issue of gender and ethnicity but do not propose to set targets for the percentage of women on our Board 
in future years.
Female representation on our Executive Committee is currently 20%. We will increase female representation on the Board if appropriate 
candidates are available when Board vacancies arise. Females represent about 20% of our employees.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. The 
plans are regularly reviewed by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.
A clear road map for non-executive refreshment has been developed in 2011 and external consultants were appointed.
Board evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted an evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors. The 
process involved the completion by each Director of a confidential questionnaire in a form consistent with previous years, and including 
amongst other areas: remit and objectives, Board composition, training and resources, governance, stakeholder engagement, Board 
procedures and overall effectiveness.
The respective Chairmen analysed the completed questionnaires and summarised the findings in a report for the respective Committee 
and Board. The Chairman subsequently conducted one-to-one discussions with each of the Board members after which he reported 
back to the whole Board on the evaluation process. The responses to the questionnaires demonstrated a high degree of consistency and 
the evaluation process affirmed the Board’s confidence in the Group’s system of corporate governance. Board members work well 
together with open discussions being a feature of all debates. Arising from the exercise, the Board has concluded that the focus should 
be placed on divisional growth strategies, technology development, Safety & Health and sustainability as well as continued training.
Messrs S.C. Harris and D.F. Landless were appraised internally in January and February 2012. The Remuneration and Audit 
Committees reviewed their own performance in December 2011 and the Nomination Committee reviewed its performance in 
November 2011.
Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the Directors have carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in 
November 2011.
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2011 Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in June 2010 (the ‘New Code’).
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2011 Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the 2010 Code, with the exception of 
provision E1.1. The Board has taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director to 
manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss overall strategy, governance 
and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of communication have failed would the Board 
expect the Senior Independent or other Non-Executive Directors to become involved, notwithstanding that the 2010 Code specifies 
attendance of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at meetings with major shareholders. Regular feedback by the Company’s 
advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all Directors.
Apart from this distinct area, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the 2010 Code throughout 2011.
Operation of the code
Taken together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the Board report on remuneration presented on 
pages 37 to 48, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied the principles of good corporate governance set out in the 2010 Code.
Corporate governance statement 38 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
Leadership
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Company’s strategic objectives, values and 
standards and ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on nine occasions during 2011, including a specific meeting to review and update the Company’s long-term strategy. 
The Board of Directors comprises six members, of whom four are Non-Executive Directors and two are Executive Directors led by the 
Company’s part-time Non-Executive Chairman, Mr A.M. Thomson, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive is Mr 
S.C. Harris and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Mr J. Vogelsang, who also chairs the Remuneration Committee. The Audit 
Committee is chaired by Mr J.A. Biles. Brief biographical details of all Directors are given on page 33. The Board makes visits to UK and 
overseas facilities. Certain defined powers and issues are reserved for the Board to decide, inter alia:
  Strategy;
  Approval of financial statements and circulars;
  Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
  Annual budgets;
  Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and succession planning;
  Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and environment, donations;
  Committees’ terms of reference;
  Board and committee chairmen and membership;
  Investments;
  Equity and bank financing;
  Internal control and risk management;
  Corporate governance;
  Key external and internal appointments; and
  Employee share incentives and pension arrangements.
In advance of Board meetings Directors are supplied with up-to-date information about the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year, budgets and forecasts. They are 
also supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and details of the 
safety and health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work.
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Company. All Directors 
have access to the Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. In 
accordance with the Articles of Association, all newly appointed Directors and any who have not stood for re-election at the two previous 
Annual General Meetings, if eligible, must submit themselves for re-election. However, this has been superseded by the Directors’ 
decision to stand for yearly re-election. Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding 
three years from the date of first election by shareholders, after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A 
statement of the Directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 49. The Board also operates four committees. These are the Nomination 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
So that the necessary actions can be taken promptly, a Finance Committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing him any other Non-
Executive Director), the Chief Executive and the Finance Director operates between the dates of scheduled Board meetings and is 
authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, tax or investment matters.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers that Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang and Dr K. Rajagopal are all independent for the purposes of the Code.

All Directors attended the maximum number of scheduled Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committee meetings that they were 
scheduled to attend. All Directors attended the maximum number of scheduled Board meetings. In addition by invitation Messrs 
Thomson, Harris and Landless attended the whole or part of all the meetings of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Proposals for re-election
The Board decided, in line with the New Code, that all Directors will retire annually and, other than in the case of any Director who has 
decided to stand down from the Board, will offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Accordingly Messrs A.M. 
Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F. Landless, J. Vogelsang, J.A. Biles and Dr K. Rajagopal will stand for re-election and the Board recommends 
to shareholders that they re-elect all the Directors.
The performance of each Director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social engagement. The Board 
continuously and regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of 2000 to the date of approval of this report and 
which is in accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published in September 1999 and with revised 
guidance on internal control published October 2005. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management and from internal audit to 
consider whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Audit 
Committee assists the Board in discharging these review responsibilities.
The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix 
clearly sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
The Internal Audit department monitors the Group’s internal financial control system and its reviews are conducted on the basis of plans 
approved by the Audit Committee, to which Internal Audit reports are submitted on a regular basis.
Each Division provides assurance on specified financial and non-financial controls and these are reported twice-yearly to the Audit 
Committee.
During 2011, in compliance with provision C.2.1, management performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this annual report. 
Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included a review of all Group and 
operational risks (by means of workshops and interviews) and the risks identified (both before and after mitigating actions) were 
assessed using conventional impact and likelihood scoring, and further assessment, monitoring and review work was scheduled for 
2012. The Group’s risk management framework is progressively being embedded throughout the Group. The principal risks and 
uncertainties affecting the Group are shown in the Finance Director’s report on page 26. No significant previously unidentified risks were 
uncovered as part of this process, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or 
weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.
Investor relations
The Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively, and this has 
enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy.  In November 2011 the Group held a Capital Markets 
day, informing analysts and major shareholders of the Group's strategy and progress. The business of the Annual General Meeting comprises 
a review of the Group’s operations for the benefit of shareholders attending. In addition, internet users are able to view up-to-date news on 
the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users of the website can access recent announcements and 
copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a regular basis, Bodycote’s financial advisers, corporate brokers 
and financial public relations consultants provide the Directors with opinion surveys from analysts and investing institutions following visits 
and meetings with the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are available to 
discuss any issues not resolved by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. On specific issues, such as the introduction of long-term 
incentive and share matching schemes in 2006 and changes thereto in 2009 and 2010, the Company has sought and will continue to seek 
the views of leading investors.

Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose purpose is to advise the Board on the appointment and, 
if necessary, dismissal of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The full terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are provided 
on the Company’s website.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises all the independent Non-Executive Directors together with the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be an independent Non-Executive Director.
The Chairman acts as the Chairman of the Committee, although the Chairman may not chair the Committee when it is dealing with the 
matter of succession to the Chairmanship of the Company. Only members of the Committee have the right to attend the Committee 
meetings. However, other individuals and external advisers may be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when 
appropriate.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that is required from any officer or employee of the Company or its 
subsidiaries. In connection with its duties, the Committee is authorised by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or 
other professional advice, at the Company’s expense) as it considers necessary, including requests for information from, or 
commissioning investigations, by external advisers.
Main activities of the Nomination Committee
Mr A.M. Thomson chairs the Nomination Committee which also comprises Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang, S.C. Harris and 
Dr K. Rajagopal. 
In 2011 the Committee discussed succession planning, board diversity and assessment of the Chief Executive and other senior 
executives. In particular, the need to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed and we 
have engaged an international search firm to identify suitable candidates with relevant experience. The Committee considered and 
authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might arise where a Director has fiduciary responsibilities in respect of other 
organisations. The committee understands that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee also assigned the Chairman 
to review and agree with the Chief Executive the Group’s objectives for the forthcoming year. 
In November 2011 the Nomination Committee, with both Executive Directors in attendance, carried out a formal evaluation of the 
Board’s performance, and reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of and process for Board and committee meetings, 
and best practice for the handling of a number of Board issues including the review of strategy, letters of appointment and Directors’ 
training.

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main role is to encourage and safeguard the highest standards of integrity, 
financial reporting, risk management and internal controls. 
The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in written terms of reference which include all matters indicated by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Code, which are available for inspection on the Company’s website, and include reviewing the form and 
content of interim and year end accounts and results announcements, risk management and internal financial controls, monitoring 
internal audit, considering the appointment of the external auditor and agreeing the nature and scope of their work and monitoring and 
reviewing their independence, objectivity and effectiveness.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang and Dr K. Rajagopal who are all independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Their biographical details are set out on page 33 and their remuneration is shown on page 47. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
since 16 August 2007 has been Mr J.A. Biles, who was appointed a Director on that date, following a recommendation from the 
Nomination Committee. The Audit Committee Chairman is considered to have recent and relevant financial experience. Mr Biles is a 
chartered accountant, who served as a plc finance director (FKI plc from 1998 to 2004 and Chubb Security plc from 1991 to 1997) and 
until its takeover in January 2012 was also the Chairman of the Audit Committee of Charter International plc (2005). The Company 
Secretary is secretary to the Audit Committee. The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, Senior Internal Auditor, Group Financial 
Controller, Vice-President (Risk and Business Processes), Group Treasurer, Head of Tax, other senior finance personnel and external 
auditors attend Audit Committee meetings as appropriate by invitation.
Main activities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met four times during 2011, and in February 2012 to consider this financial report and all Committee members 
attended the maximum number of meetings they were scheduled to attend. The Committee also meets separately with the Vice-
President (Risk and Business Processes) and with the external auditor, without management being present, after the end of most formal 
meetings.
In addition, the Committee Chairman has preparatory meetings with the external auditor and, where necessary, with Group senior 
management, prior to committee meetings. At their meetings, the Audit Committee considers an agenda of items including the minutes 
of the last meeting and a list of action points from previous meetings, to ensure that these are progressed. In addition, a number of 
specific items were reviewed:
  At their February and July meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed respectively the preliminary and interim announcements of 
results and the draft reports and accounts for the financial year and the half year. On these occasions the Committee reviewed 
reports from the external auditor, identifying any accounting or judgemental items requiring its attention (including approval of the 
processes, assumptions and outcomes to assess fair values and impairments) and commenting on risk management and control 
matters. Specific areas of judgement discussed and challenged by the committee, included:
  Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible fixed assets, including an assessment of the discount rates used, and the 
appropriateness of specific risk factors applied to cash generating units and the adequacy of sensitivities applied
  Environmental costs, including the adequacy of the Group’s provisions
  Remaining restructuring actions, and the appropriateness of outstanding provisions
  Claims provisions and litigation, including the adequacy and valuation of provisions
  Accounting for employee share schemes
  Adequacy of revenue recognition policies
  Accounting for taxation
  Validity of the Going Concern assumption used in preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts
  A quarterly report on internal audit from the Vice-President (Risk and Business Processes) was presented at each meeting and the 
findings discussed. During the year the plan for the ensuing year’s work was considered.
  The external auditor also presented, for the year end statutory audit and interim review engagements respectively, their audit plans at 
the December and April meetings covering scope of work to be done and during the year there was a detailed review of their 
management letter covering the Auditor’s findings in respect of 2010 external auditor also presented, for the year end statutory audit 
and interim review engagements respectively, their audit plans at the December and April meetings covering scope of work to be 
done and during the year there was a detailed review of their management letter covering the Auditor’s findings in respect of 2010.
  The Audit Committee is also presented with an update on any material litigation in which the Group may be involved.
  At each meeting an update is presented of any new accounting developments and requirements and any changes in corporate 
governance arrangements that may affect the Group.
  On a regular basis, the Committee reviewed papers on liquidity, banking arrangements and the appropriateness of the going concern 
assumption for preparation of the financial statements. The Committee’s activities supported the Directors in their assessment of the 
going concern position of the Group, which is set out on page 25.
The Vice-President (Risk and Business Processes) has responsibility for developing the Group’s risk management framework and 
enhancing the Group’s risk assessment and mitigation activities. This action demonstrates the Board’s continued commitment to 
maintain sound risk management and internal control systems. During 2011 the Audit Committee also:
  Assessed and confirmed the independence of the external auditor;
  Having reviewed the effectiveness of the audit, the performance and capabilities of the external auditors and having taken into 
account their tenure of office from 2002 and whether the position should be formally tendered, recommended to the Board that the 
auditor be reappointed and agreed their fees;
  Approved the Group’s accounting policies; 42 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
  Approved the management representations to the external auditor;
  Reviewed arrangements for reporting and investigating fraud and employee concerns; normal internal audit activity and operation of 
the Group’s ‘Open Door’ policy uncovered a small number of potentially fraudulent incidents which were all fully investigated. None 
had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and procedures were amended to minimise the risk 
of recurrence;
  Reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management processes and recommended certain changes; 
  Reviewed the terms of reference for the Audit Committee; and
  Assessed the Committee’s own effectiveness.
Training
The Committee receives regular technical updates as part of the agenda of each Committee meeting as well as specific or personal 
training as required. A training session was held during October 2011, where Deloitte updated the committee on a number of relevant 
accounting matters and discussed latest developments in Corporate and Social Responsibility reporting and changes to UK corporate 
governance practice.
Independence of external auditor
The Audit Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the independence of the audit is not compromised. In this respect, the 
Audit Committee reviewed:
  the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory auditor, who signs the audit report and who, in 
accordance with the professional rules, has not held office for more than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
  the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship; and
  the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor as specified below. Related and non-audit fees paid to the 
auditor are available in note 3 on page 67. There has been no significant non-audit engagement.
The policy in respect of services provided by the external auditor is as follows:
  audit-related services. The external auditor is invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to 
undertake the work. This includes reporting and certification connected with borrowings, shareholders and circulars, regulatory 
requirements and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals;
  in the case of other services no contracts in excess of £20,000 in value can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval 
from the Chairman of the Audit Committee;
  tax and general consulting work. In general and where conflict could arise, the work is not awarded to the external auditor and is put 
out to tender; and
  there are no contractual restrictions on who the Audit Committee can choose as external auditor.
Internal audit
Internal Audit independently reviews the risk and control processes operated by management. It carries out independent audits in 
accordance with an internal audit plan which is agreed with the Audit Committee before the start of the financial year. This plan takes 
account of the risk management framework surrounding major business risks in each operation and provides a high degree of financial 
and geographical coverage. Where appropriate, either because of language, geographical remoteness or where technical expertise is 
required, the Internal Audit Department engages third party specialists to conduct Internal Audits. Internal Audit reports include 
recommendations to improve internal controls together with agreed managerial action plans to resolve issues raised. Internal audit 
follows up the implementation of recommendations and reports progress to senior management and the Audit Committee. The 
Committee noted that the 2011 Internal Audit programme was successfully completed with sites representing approximately 70% of 
Group revenue being the subject of internal audit reports. At the same time there was a declining trend in the requirement for corrective 
actions. The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function is reviewed and discussed on an annual basis with the Vice President (Risk and 
Business Processes) and Senior Internal Auditor.
Following a review of the Group’s internal audit processes and capabilities a decision was taken by the Committee to outsource internal 
audit. The Group went out to tender to three major accounting firms and after receiving presentations from them, the contract for 
services was awarded to Ernst & Young LLP, who will commence their work in April 2012.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference 
and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.

When the package is reviewed this is done in the context of individual and Company performance, internal relativities, criticality of the 
individual to the business, experience and the scarcity or otherwise of talent with the relevant skill set. Currently reward for the Executive 
Directors is structured as follows:
Element of pay Component Purpose / details
Fixed p  Base salary p  To ensure competitiveness, attracting and retaining talent
p  To reflect individual skills and experience 
p  Benefits p  In line with market practice 
p  Provision of Company car (or allowance in lieu of), private medical insurance and long-term

p  Pension p  In line with market practice
p  To ensure competitiveness, attracting and retaining talent
Variable p  Annual bonus p  To incentivise delivery of corporate objectives and strategy
p  To provide opportunity for enhanced reward in return for challenging performance targets
p  Bodycote Incentive Plan p  To incentivise delivery of long-term shareholder value and provide opportunity for enhanced 
reward for superior performance 
p  Bodycote Co-Investment Plan p  To align Executive Directors with shareholders, demonstrate individual commitment and 
satisfy minimum shareholding requirements
Each of the above components is discussed in greater detail in the following sections of this report. The sections dealing with Directors’ 
emoluments paid, pensions and incentives have been audited. 
Fixed elements of pay 
Base salary
The Committee reviews base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives annually taking into account the responsibilities 
and performance of the individual, current market practice, pay in similar engineering businesses and companies of a comparable size 
and scale of operations. The Committee was also mindful of pay levels amongst the employee population.
The salaries of the Executive Directors during 2011 are as follows:
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2011
S.C. Harris Chief Executive Officer £436,000
D.F . Landless Finance Director £278,500
Pension
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with 
those provided by other similar companies.
Mr Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 22% of basic salary, of which £72,000 was waived from April 
2011. In addition, in the event of death, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable. 
During 2011 the pension for Mr Landless was provided partly under the Group’s UK contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which 
is closed to new members with increases in pensionable salary capped at 3% per annum, and partly through a defined contribution 
arrangement. The Group’s contribution to Mr Landless’ defined contribution arrangement in the period January to March 2011 was 16% 
of basic salary above the defined benefit scheme cap.
The defined benefit scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary. 
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless under the defined benefit pension scheme during 2011 is given on 
page 48.
Variable elements of pay 
Annual bonuses
The annual bonus provides the Executive Directors and other senior executives with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus wholly 
payable in cash based on achievement of certain performance targets. In 2011 the annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors was 
structured as follows:

Business review Governance	 Financial statements Additional information
The Committee also has discretion to reduce the awards by up to 10% if the safety performance is less than targeted. 
For 2012 the Committee has determined that the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be 
contingent on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. No bonus will be paid for 
the cash management element unless the level of operating profit achieved is at least 95% of target.
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) 
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares 
up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (“ROCE”) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an 
earnings per share (“EPS”) performance condition.
ROCE EPS
Award year Threshold performance Maximum performance Threshold performance Maximum performance
2009 10% 14.6% 16.0p 28.0p
2010 11 .1% 16% 19.8p 31 .0p
2011 14.6% 20% 28.3p 39.8p
2012 18.7% 23% 36.2p 62.15p
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. Regardless of 
ROCE performance, should EPS at the end of the performance period be below 16p for any BIP awards made between 2009 and 2011 
and below 31.1p for awards made in 2012, then no award shall vest. 
The Committee intends to use the ROCE and EPS measures in combination for BIP Awards made in 2012. Details of the awards made 
under the BIP are provided on page 47. Following completion of the performance period on 31 December 2011, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that 175% of the BIP awards made in 2009 shall vest (2008: nil). In reaching this conclusion, the 
Remuneration Committee took into account specific audit procedures carried out by the external auditors.
During the financial year the Remuneration Committee also approved the introduction of the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan which 
provided a long-term savings vehicle for senior executives which aids retention whilst recognising the needs for flexibility in long-term 
wealth planning. Company contributions are discretionary and vary year on year. Contributions for the Executive Directors are shown 
on page 47.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (‘CIP’) 
The CIP provides a link between the Company’s short and long-term incentive arrangements and permits executives to invest in shares 
up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an 
annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and 
matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR 
growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio 
of 1:2. 10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1.
Details of the awards under the CIP together with awards made under the legacy arrangement known as the Bodycote Share Match 
Plan (‘BSMP’) and the joining award made to Mr Harris in October 2008 are noted on page 48. Following completion of the performance 
period on 31 December 2011, the Remuneration Committee has determined that 100% of the matching awards made in 2009 under 
the BSMP and 100% of the joining award shall vest.
Advisers
During the year the Committee has taken independent advice from Ernst & Young LLP on remuneration together with legal advice from 
Eversheds. Fees relating to the Ernst & Young LLP services were £60,000, which included, amongst other things, benchmarking of 
executive salaries, advice on the impact of changes to the UK pensions regime, implementation of an approved French sub-plan, advice 
relating to the accounting costs of the Company’s share plans and the transfer of the Company’s employee benefit trust to a new 
trustee. Fees for Eversheds legal advice were £5,000 which related to the review of non-executive directors’ letters of appointment and 
claw back. 
Total Shareholder Return 
The graph on page 47 illustrates the Company’s TSR performance since 2006 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which 
the Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most appropriate comparator Group over the five-year period to 
December 2011. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided 
by Datastream. 46 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
Service contracts 
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have 
service agreements which are terminable by one year’s notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s remuneration 
in lieu of notice by the employer. With the exception of David Landless, the Executive Directors do not have a change of control clause. 
David Landless’ service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 
and provides for one year’s remuneration on a change of control if his employment is terminated. To the extent that executive contracts 
are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of best practice when entering into service 
contracts. In any case legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic 
salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than 
payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris’ service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr 
Landless’ contract is dated 26 September 2001.
Shareholding policy 
In 2005, the Committee introduced a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are 
expected, within five years of that date or commencement of employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect 
of Executive Directors the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. As at 31 December 2011 the Committee is satisfied that 
the Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors. Stephen Harris was the only Executive Director 
with such a position held at Mondi plc from 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of £59,035.
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for 
the Chairman is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
takes into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold 
letters of appointment which have been agreed in accordance with best practice which set out the terms of his appointment, including 
membership of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director. The letter also covers 
such matters as the confidentiality of information and Bodycote’s share dealing code. During the year letters of appointment for the 
Chairman and each Non-Executive Director were renewed, each for a period of no longer than three years. Each is terminable under the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the Act, by the Director’s resignation or otherwise on six months’ notice if termination occurs before 
expiry of the term. To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board takes into account the need to attract individuals 
of appropriate calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other companies of a similar size and scale of 
operations and the time commitment attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

Over the year to 31 December 2011, the Trustee of the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme has reviewed the basis on which transfer values are calculated to allow for 
the change of statutory indexation from RPI to CPI. The transfer value at 31 December 2011 incorporates these changes. The transfer value at 1 January 2011 does 
not include any allowance for CPI indexation. For information, had the Trustee reviewed the transfer value basis prior to 1 January 2011, the transfer value quoted 
at 1 January 2011 would have been £627,000. The inflation used above is a measure consistent with the CPI assumption used in the transfer value basis for the 
Scheme.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility of Directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Board report on remuneration and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
  properly select and apply accounting policies;
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
  the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report, the Finance Director’s report, all the information contained on pages 4 to 48 
together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2011. It includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 23 February 2012 and is signed on its behalf by:

Chief Executive Finance Director
23 February 2012  23 February 2012 Independent auditor’s report  
To the Members of Bodycote plc 
 
50 Bodycote plc 
We have audited the group financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2011, which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated cash flow 
statement, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Statement of group accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 30.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
 
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 
the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
 
the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 
the Directors’ statement contained within the Group Review in relation to going concern; 
 
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and 
 
certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on directors remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Year ended 31 December 2011 
 
 
Bodycote plc 55 
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU. 
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC. 
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and are 
therefore subject to change. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.  The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below. 
Adoption of new and revised standards 
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but, with the exception of the amendment to IFRS 1, may impact 
the accounting or disclosure for future transactions and arrangements. 
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 
The Interpretation provides guidance on the accounting for ‘debt for equity swaps’ from the perspective of the borrower. 
The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRSs (2010): 
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
IFRS 3 has been amended such that only those non-controlling interests which are current ownership interests and which entitle their holders 
to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation can be measured at fair value or the proportionate share of net identifiable assets. 
Other non-controlling interests are measured at fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs. 
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
The amendment clarifies the required level of disclosure around credit risk and collateral held and provides relief from disclosure of 
renegotiated financial assets. The impact of this amendment has been to reduce the level of disclosure on collateral that the entity holds 
as security on financial assets that are past due or impaired. 
Amendment to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters 
The amendment provides a limited exemption for first-time adopters from providing comparative fair-value hierarchy disclosures 
under IFRS 7. 
IAS 24 (2009) Related Party Disclosures 
The revised Standard has a new, clearer definition of a related party, with inconsistencies under the previous definition having been removed. 
Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues 
Under the amendment, rights issues of instruments issued to acquire a fixed number of an entity’s own non-derivative equity instruments for 
a fixed amount in any currency and which otherwise meet the definition of equity are classified as equity. 
Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 
The amendments now enable recognition of an asset in the form of prepaid minimum funding contributions. 
Going concern 
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance director’s report on page 25. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.  All intra- group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
  Group accounting policies continued 
Year ended 31 December 2011 
 
56 Bodycote plc 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company. 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair 
value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as 
would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities are disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the 
date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.  
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition. 
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to acquired intangibles, followed by the other tangible assets 
of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised on the completion of 
services rendered. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established. 
The Group as lessee 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Group as lessor 
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and 
losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for: 
 
Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments / hedge 
accounting); and 
 
Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready 
for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. 
Government grants 
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over 
the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the post-
tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items consist of amortisation of acquired intangibles, impairment charges, and other one off items which the Group considers 
significant for separate disclosure. 
Discontinued operations 
In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, the Group has separately disclosed the results of 
the Testing division as discontinued following the disposal of the business in October 2008, and subsequent provision adjustment during 
2010.

Year ended 31 December 2011 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to  
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under 
the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are 
recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted 
for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited 
to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, over 
their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: 
Freehold buildings 2% 
Leasehold property over the period of the lease 
Fixtures and fittings 
Plant and machinery 5% – 20% 
Motor vehicles 20% – 33% 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation 
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
  
10% – 20% 
Additional infor
 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any interest and are 
stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash 
flows of the investment have been impacted. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include: 
 
significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or 
 
default or delinquency in payments. 
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

Bodycote plc 59 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any interest and are 
stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash 
flows of the investment have been impacted. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include: 
 
significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or 
 
default or delinquency in payments. 
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss. 
   Group accounting policies continued 
Year ended 31 December 2011 
 
60 Bodycote plc 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, to 
manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes in the 
fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 are recognised immediately in 
the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. 
Hedge accounting 
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements. 
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges. 
Note 20 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. 
Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.  The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedge 
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance with 
the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period. 
Net investment hedge 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses. 
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. 
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those 
affected by it. 
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts 
that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. 
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled 
employee benefits reserve.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors have  made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are 
dealt with below). 
Provisions for environmental liabilities 
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other 
circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. The provision is reviewed annually. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets 
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.  The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet 
date was £102.6m, after an impairment loss of £3.7m was recognised in 2011.  Further details are provided in note 11. 
Retirement benefit schemes 
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial 
assumptions, which are set out in note 30. 
Taxation 
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax provision, 
deferred tax provisions and income statement in the period in which such determination is made.

IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests Bodycote plc has in other entities; 
 
IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures; and 
 
IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension 
obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement of expected returns on 
plan assets with a net finance cost in the income statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other 
comprehensive income increased. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.

2. Business and geographical segments 
 
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The Group’s reportable segments have been determined in accordance with the activity of the Group, focusing on key market sectors. 
Principally, this splits the Group into two business areas being: 
 
Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE); and 
 
Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) 
This initial split is determined following consideration of factors including the different customer sets, differing service requirements 
and different characteristics of business activity. A further split is then made for the geographical divisions of the Group being: 
 
Western Europe 
 
North America; and 
 
Emerging Markets.

It is considered by the Group that the cost of producing a geographical analysis of non-current assets other than financial instruments, 
deferred tax assets and post-employment benefit assets would outweigh the benefits. The Group reviews business assets by business 
segment rather than geographically.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to cash generating units. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units is 9.5% (2010: 9.5%). This rate 
is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate. A risk premium of 20% has been applied to 
the South American operations, and a risk premium of 10% has been applied to the far eastern operations. The recoverable amount is the 
sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period, being management's expectation of the useful life of the existing asset base.  
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years. The expected sales reflect management's 
expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected profit margin reflects management's experience of 
each cash generating unit's profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where 
appropriate. Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.2% (2010: 3.2%), being the historical weighted average 
growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant 
markets. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cash generating unit's carrying value. A cut in the sales growth 
rate by 18.9% would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its carrying value. 
The charge for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets relates to the Group’s South American operations. Trading activity 
has lagged expectations, which together with an increase in the perceived risk-adjusted discount rate, has led to an impairment of goodwill 
and acquired intangible fixed assets. With improved market conditions the Board has concluded that no other impairment charge is required 
in 2011.

The carrying amount of leased assets is £0.7m (2010: £2.1m). 
The Group has pledged land and buildings having a carrying amount of approximately £0.6m (2010: £0.4m) to secure banking facilities granted 
to the Group. 
At 31 December 2011 the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting 
to £4.6m (2010: £2.5m). 
In addition to the above, property, plant and equipment amounting to £5.3m (2010: £6.2m) has been classified as held for sale. 
During the year, the Group acquired the French Heat Treatment business of Oerlikon Balzers for a total consideration of £0.5m. Total net 
assets acquired (including acquired intangible fixed assets) were £1.1m, resulting in negative goodwill of £0.6m being credited to the income 
statement, along with charges for costs to re-organise the operations of £0.5m, and acquisition costs of £0.1m. On the basis of materiality no 
further disclosures have been included.

The average credit period given to customers for the supply of services as at 31 December 2011 is 59 days (2010: 59 days). An allowance 
has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of £6.2m (2010: £6.9m). This allowance has been 
determined by reference to past default experience. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables. 
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high  
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. Further 
reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 20. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £17.7m (2010: £16.7m) which are past due at the

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date 
credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and 
unrelated. Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £8.9m (2010: £8.6m). The 
impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the 
expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows: 
(i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. No overdrafts are secured. 
(ii) The Group has two principal borrowing facilities which are secured by upstream guarantees provided by subsidiaries: 
(a) Drawings of £Nil (2010: £Nil) under a Revolving Credit Facility of £125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 27 July 2011 and 
matures on 31 August 2016. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1.15% and 2.00% above 
LIBOR (the margin at 31 December 2011 was 1.15%). 
(b) Drawings of £6.0m (2010: £64.4m) under a Revolving Credit Facility of €125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 2006 for 
a period of seven years. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 1.10% above 
LIBOR (the margin at 31 December 2011 was 0.80%). 
At 31 December 2011 the Group had available £223.9m (2010: £160.9m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. 
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group's 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2011 or 2010. 
In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be 
classified as level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the 
contracts. 
The Group's interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow risk). 
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group 
policy. However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

20. Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
Financial risk management 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.  
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel. 
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the 
Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no significant change during the 
financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. Liquidity 
risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a centralised basis 
through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a 
quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt / cash is measured against the 
liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt / cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term loans in excess of one year) to 
exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £100m). 
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had revolving credit committed facilities of £229.9m (2010: £230.9m) which exceeded net cash of 
£0.1m (2010: net debt of £51.3m) by £230.0m (2010: £179.6m or 350%). The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to 
manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group manages longer-term liquidity 
through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets. Following the completion of the 5 year £125m 
Revolving Credit and $10m Letter of Credit facilities on 27 July 2011, the Group’s principal committed bank facilities have the following

In addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 2011, the 
Group had gross cash of £18.1m (2010: £23.5m). 
Interest rate risk  
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. Changes in 
interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest rate management 
policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of 
fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in 
the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Group’s reported financial performance 
is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating 
rates. 
As at 31 December 2011, 8% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2010: 2% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash). The 
average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.6 years (2010: 5.2 years). 
Currency risk  
Bodycote has operations in 27 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of 
these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts. 
Over 89% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 38%, USD 27% and SEK 8%). Cumulatively over the year, sterling 
rates moved such that the sales for the year were £2.6m better than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2010. 
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits. 
The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group will still 
match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US Dollar, 
Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity 
for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies 
when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though approximately 89% of the Group’s 
sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and, other than 
interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group. 
Market risk sensitivity analysis  
The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 
(100 basis points) in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable 
rates as at 31 December 2011, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes 
only. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.

20. Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
Interest rate sensitivity  
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
 
changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments; 
 
changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if 
these are recognised at their fair value; and 
 
changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments. 
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net 
cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2011 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.1m (2010: £0.5m). There is no 
significant impact on equity. 
Currency sensitivity  
Taking the 2011 sales by currency, a 10% weakening / strengthening in the 2011 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling 
would have given rise to a +£56.8m / -£46.5m movement in sales respectively. The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix 
of losses and profits in the various currencies. However, taking the 2011 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening / strengthening in 2011 
cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£9.9m / -£8.1m movement in headline operating profit. 
Counterparty risk  
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time 
deposits and money market funds. The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where applicable) and 
through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Group policy is to 
enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A- / A3 or better. However, acquired businesses 
occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in particular 
in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £183.1m (2010: £208.0m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of £96.3m (2010: £101.0m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable 
profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the 
remaining £86.8m (2010: £107.0m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability. 
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

ended 31 December 2011, the average effective borrowing rate was 7.8% (2010: 7.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All 
leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair value of the 
Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount. 
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

The restructuring provision relates to the remaining costs associated with the closure of various Heat Treatment sites. Further details are 
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other 
circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into Restructuring 
Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising 
in the ordinary course of business. 
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives. In addition income of 
£0.1m was recognised following the disposal of non core assets associated with the restructuring plans. The reversal of certain asset 
impairments of £0.6m was also recognised in relation to the ongoing restructuring. 
Cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within 5 years.  
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The table has been drawn up based on the 
contained in the Finance Director’s Report.

life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations. 
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)  
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up 
to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period. 
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (“ROCE”) performance condition and fifty per cent of the award is 
subject to an earnings per share (“EPS”) performance condition. 
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. 
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (“CIP”)  
The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of awards of 
matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. Deferred 
shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) target. The threshold 
target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index 
(CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2 . 10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting 
matching ratio of 1:1.

UK Scheme 
The Company sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees. The 
preliminary actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2011 and was updated on an 
approximate basis to 31 December 2011. 
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £1.1m, comprising £0.7m in respect of benefit accrual and £0.4m 
in respect of ongoing expense. This level of contribution is currently under review following the 6 April 2011 triennial valuation of the Scheme. 
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss account and 
in other comprehensive income.

Expected long-term rates of return 
The expected long-term return on cash is equal to bank base rate at the balance sheet date. The expected return on bonds is determined by 
reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date. The expected rates of return on equities and property have been 
determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt / bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.

  Independent auditor’s report 
To the Members of Bodycote plc 
 
90 Bodycote plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2011, which comprise the 
Parent Company Balance Sheet, the Company Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 11. The financial reporting framework that  
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
 
give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011; 
 
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
 
the parent company financial statements to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 and the information in 
the Board Report on Remuneration that is described as having been audited.

Directors  Company accounting policies 
 
 
92 Bodycote plc 
Accounting convention 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
accounting standards. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements. In accordance 
with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been 
presented. 
Going concern 
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s Report on page 25. 
Investments 
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and 
losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Pension costs 
For defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the 
contributions payable in the year. For further details see note 10. 
Leases 
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements of 
future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the 
lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt with 
similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
The Company as lessor 
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a  
straight-line basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates: 
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20% 
Software   20% to 33% 
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition. 
Taxation 
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements. 
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on 
a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated 
that the underlying timing differences will reverse. The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be obtained on 
government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.   
 
 
Bodycote plc 93 
Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ not to disclose transactions or balances 
with wholly-owned entities of the Group. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve.   94 Bodycote plc

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Company for its land and buildings. 
10. Pension commitments 
The Company participates in a group defined benefit scheme, the details of which are disclosed in note 30 to the consolidated financial 
statements. However, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities and has therefore accounted for the 
scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Full disclosures concerning the scheme as required by IAS 19 are set out in note 30 to 
the consolidated financial statements. These also satisfy the requirements of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. 
The contributions made by the Company over the financial year to both the defined contribution and the defined benefit schemes amounted 
to £0.4m (2010: £0.4m) and £0.1m (2010: £0.1m) respectively. 
11. Related party transactions

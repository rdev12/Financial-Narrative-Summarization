Our Core Values
“Wood Group’s Core Values deﬁne who we are, how we 
work, what we believe in and what we stand for. They set 
out how we act and expect to be treated as part of  
Wood Group and provide a sound basis on which to 
make decisions. Our Core Values strip was inspired by 
DNA ﬁngerprinting – our seven Core Values represent 
our very own DNA ﬁngerprint and make us who we are. 
Each of the bars in the strip has a different colour to help 
people remember them and identify them – so every time 
we talk about our Social Responsibility Value we use 
green for instance. At either end are Safety & Assurance 
and Integrity – the Core Values that hold them all together 
– and right in the middle, in the heart of our business is 
the gold one: our People Core Value. 
Last year we launched our Living our Values Awards 
programme which recognises our people from around 
the world. Throughout this report you will see featured 
the stories behind the awards ﬁnalists who bring our Core 
Values to life and demonstrate that they are at the very 
heart of our business.”

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
Our results and how we measure our performance
Revenue 
Revenue earned from continuing 
operations is derived from the 
price and volume of services 
and products we provide to 
customers.
Earnings before interest, tax and  
amortisation (EBITA) 
EBITA is a key proﬁt measure and 
excludes exceptional items.
EBITA margin 
EBITA margin demonstrates  
our ability to convert revenue  
into proﬁt.
Adjusted diluted EPS (AEPS)
Earnings before exceptional  
items and amortisation, net of 
tax, divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the year. AEPS 
demonstrates the value we create 
on a per share basis.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
EBITA divided by average  
capital employed measures our 
ability to generate proﬁts relative to 
the capital required to support our 
business.
Progress in the year 
Revenue increased in all three 
divisions in 2012, leading to 
growth in revenue from continuing 
operations of 20%.
Growth in 2012 includes a full 
year contribution from the PSN 
business acquired in 2011. EBITA 
increased in all three divisions.
EBITA margin increased  
by 0.8% points in 2012.  
Margin increased in  
Wood Group Engineering and 
Wood Group PSN, and remained 
ﬂat in Wood Group GTS.
The increase in AEPS for 2012 
reﬂects the increase in underlying 
proﬁtability and a reduction in the 
average number of fully diluted 
shares in the period subsequent to 
our return of capital in 2011.
The increase in ROCE reﬂects 
an increase in Wood Group 
Engineering due to higher 
proﬁtability, offset to some  
extent by lower ROCE in  
Wood Group PSN, which in 2012 
included the full year impact of 
higher goodwill and intangible 
assets arising on acquisition.

Operating capital employed to revenue 
(OCER) 
Average operating capital 
employed divided by revenue 
measures the efﬁciency of our 
operating capital relative to our 
revenue. 
Dividend per ordinary share 
The share of AEPS distributed to 
shareholders.
Cash generated from  
operations
Cash inﬂows which we use to 
maintain and grow our operations.
Total recordable case frequency 
We aim to deliver the highest 
standards of health and safety. 
Total recordable case frequency 
is the total of lost work cases, 
restricted work cases and medical 
treatment cases, per million man 
hours.
People 
Attracting and retaining people 
helps support our continued 
growth.
Progress in the year 
OCER worsened in 2012 due 
principally to an increase in 
average receivable days in  
Wood Group Engineering.
The Group adopts a progressive 
dividend policy taking into account 
its capital requirements, cash 
ﬂows and earnings. Dividend 
per share has increased by a 
compound annual growth rate  
of 19% between 2002 and 2012.
Cash generated from operations 
increased mainly due to higher 
EBITA in the period.
Over many years we have reduced 
the recordable injury rates to 
our people whilst growing our 
workforce. This continued in 2012 
with a 12.5% reduction in TRCF.
Headcount increased signiﬁcantly 
in both Wood Group Engineering 
and Wood Group PSN during the 
period due to higher activity levels.

Chairman’s statement
“In November, Sir Ian Wood retired as Chairman  
and from the Board. Sir Ian has been an extraordinary 
leader, guiding Wood Group from its roots in the  
North Sea to its position today as a major global  
oil & gas services business. The Group and its 
shareholders owe a huge debt to him.”
Introduction 
The Group delivered strong growth in 2012 
and we completed a number of changes in 
the executive leadership team. In November, 
Sir Ian Wood retired as Chairman and from the 
Board. Sir Ian has been an extraordinary leader, 
guiding Wood Group from its roots in the North 
Sea to its position today as a major global oil 
& gas services business. The Group and its 
shareholders owe a huge debt to him.
On 1 November, I succeeded Sir Ian as 
Chairman and Bob Keiller became Group CEO. 
Bob has taken over a strong business in good 
long-term growth markets and is supported by 
an excellent management team.
Markets
During the period we beneﬁted from an 
increase in global E&P spend, estimated by 
commentators to have been around 9%. 
Looking forward, conditions in our end markets 
are anticipated to remain favourable. We 
continue to see strong longer-term energy 
fundamentals, supported on the demand side 
by developing economies, and on the supply 
side by increasingly complex ﬁeld developments 
and the shale-led pick-up in oil & gas and 
industrial activity in the USA. The Group is well 
positioned in end markets with a balance of 
opex and capex related activities across key 
geographical areas of industry growth and we 
have a robust balance sheet.
Financial results 
The Group’s results reﬂected growth in all three 
divisions. Revenue from continuing operations 
increased by 20% and EBITA from continuing 
operations was up 35%.  EBITA margin 
increased from 6.0% to 6.8%. Adjusted diluted 
EPS increased by 42% to 85.2 cents.
Dividends
Reﬂecting our conﬁdence in the longer-term 
outlook for the Group, we are declaring a ﬁnal 
dividend of 11.3 cents which will bring the full 
year dividend to 17.0 cents, in line with our 
stated intention at the half year, and up 26% on 
2011.
Board changes 
In June, Les Thomas, Group Director of Health 
and Safety, and Mark Papworth, Chief Executive 
of Wood Group GTS, stepped down from the 
Board and depart with our best wishes for the 
future. Robin Watson, Chief Executive of Wood 
Group PSN, and Mark Dobler, Chief Executive 
of Wood Group GTS, were appointed to the 
Board in January 2013. The Board will beneﬁt 
from their signiﬁcant operational experience and 
leadership.  
As announced last year, two of our longer- 
serving non-executive directors, John Morgan 
and Dr Christopher Masters, retired at the 
2012 AGM and we thank them both for their 
considerable contribution. Mary Shafer-Malicki 
and Thomas Botts joined the Board as non-
executive directors in June 2012 and January 
2013 respectively. 
Wood Group is well placed to further develop 
our leading positions across engineering, 
production support and gas turbine services 
and I look forward to the Group’s continued 
success under Bob’s leadership and direction.

Bob Keiller answers questions on the 
Group’s performance in 2012, his role 
as incoming CEO and thoughts on  
strategy for the future:
Q: It’s been a year of good growth 
across the Group. What are the 
highlights?
Our 2012 ﬁnancial results represent another 
year of strong growth with EBITA up 35%, a 
ﬁtting tribute to Sir Ian and Allister’s leadership 
and the focus and hard work of our people 
around the world.
Wood Group Engineering delivered very strong 
growth. Revenue increased by 23% and 
EBITA increased by 36%, principally reﬂecting 
increased activity in upstream and subsea & 
pipelines. In Wood Group PSN, revenue and 
EBITA growth of 23% and 34% beneﬁted from 
good performance in the North Sea, strong 
growth in North America, and the full 12 month 
contribution from the PSN business acquired 
in April 2011. In GTS, revenue and EBITA 
increased by 12% reﬂecting growth in both 
Maintenance and Power Solutions.
Q: What are your priorities as CEO? 
Firstly, I am looking to build on what Sir Ian 
and Allister have created; a Group which has 
achieved signiﬁcant growth both organically 
and by acquisition over many years, and I am 
pleased that Allister will be able to support 
me from his new position as Chairman. Wood 
Group is a great company, one I have known 
as a customer, a competitor, a divisional CEO 
and now as a leader. And, based on what I’ve 
seen since joining the Group, I believe we can 
be even better.
I believe that the Group can be stronger if we 
harness our collective strengths more effectively 
and operate in a more joined-up manner. There 
are further opportunities for cross-selling and 
pull-through, making better use of the depth 
of resources we have. The component parts 
of the Group have cultures that foster pride 
and entrepreneurship and my task is to protect 
that while increasing collaboration. We have 
signiﬁcantly ramped up internal communication 
across the Group. This includes regular 
messages from the Executive Committee that 
now represents all key areas of the business. 
I’m looking to continue to build the business 
based around our Core Values which unite 
the Group. These Core Values – Safety & 
Assurance, Relationships, Social Responsibility, 
People, Innovation, Financial Responsibility and 
Integrity – deﬁne who we are, what we believe 
in, set out how we act and how we expect to be 
treated, and provide a sound basis on which to 
make decisions.
I will also be working with my teams to further 
develop the combined Group strategy. This will 
drive our tactical choices in terms of the range 
of services we provide and the markets and 
customers that we provide them to.
Q: Strategically, what progress did 
the Group make this year? 
We continued to pursue long-term and 
sustainable growth, retaining a balance 
across opex and capex driven markets in oil 
& gas and power. Looking at some of the 
operational highlights, we made good progress 
in broadening our international footprint in 
“Our 2012 ﬁnancial results represent another year of 
strong growth with EBITA up 35%. Wood Group is a 
great company and I believe we can be even better if 
we harness our collective strengths more effectively 
and operate in a more joined-up manner. 
We are set to make progress in all divisions in 2013, 
and I look forward to leading our further development 
in good long-term growth markets.”

John Wood Group PLC  Annual Report 2012
Wood Group Engineering in Saudi Arabia and 
the Far East, and developing relationships with 
a number of customers including IOCs and 
EPC contractors. In Wood Group PSN we 
have been focusing on expansion in the oil-rich 
shale regions both organically and through the 
acquisitions of Mitchell’s and Duval. In Wood

improved margins in Maintenance and delivering 
returns in Power Solutions. I am keen to ensure 
that all parts of the business contribute to the 
Group’s longer-term growth ambitions and 
beneﬁt from being part of the Group. 
Q: What about safety performance  
in 2012? 
We don’t want anyone suffering injury or ill 
health when they work for us or if they are 
affected by the work we do. It could be 
tempting to cite improvements we have made in 
many areas but the stark fact is that one of our 
team died in 2012 in a vehicle incident. We are 
not complacent and are working hard to ensure 
the safety of our people. 
Safety & Assurance is our top priority and ﬁrst 
Core Value. In our 2011 Annual Report, we 
talked about lessons learned from incidents 
and actions taken to improve risk management 
as a result. Our Safety Leadership programme 
was launched at the end of 2011 with the aim 
of raising leaders’ awareness of the role that 
they play in delivering and improving the safety 
performance of the Group and encouraging 
them to demonstrate their commitment to safety 
in real and tangible ways. The programme has 
been led by the Board and has been rolled out 
to around 1,200 managers to date. We are 
continuing to develop the programme further 
and to extend it deeper into the organisation. 
We recognise that often ‘near misses’ can 
provide extremely valuable lessons even if no 
physical harm was suffered. In 2013, we will be 
trying even harder to recognise events that have 
a high loss potential and to ensure that we learn 
from them.  Over many years we have reduced 
the recordable injury rates to our people whilst 
growing our workforce signiﬁcantly.  
Q: Any change in the Group’s 
approach to and appetite for risk?
Taking account of our skills, our customer 
base and our markets, it is clear to me that 
we need to remain a lower-risk, predominantly 
reimbursable business. 
I do, however, want to tighten up our controls 
around contracts that contain ﬁxed-price 
elements to ensure that we keep our overall risk 
proﬁle well within our comfort levels. Typically, 
these contracts together represent less than 
10% of revenues. I commissioned a team of 
senior operations and commercial managers 
from across the Group to analyse, deﬁne and 
categorise different types of contracts with 
ﬁxed-price elements. We have deﬁned ﬁve 
discrete categories, some being relatively low 
risk where we have control over every element 
of the contract delivery, and others such as 
EPC contracts that include site works and third 
parties for instance, which represent a higher 
risk. We are updating our review and control 
requirements and have deﬁned contract-size 
thresholds for each category. 
Q: What’s the outlook for the Group?
Overall, we anticipate progress in all divisions 
in 2013.
In 2012, Wood Group Engineering delivered a 
second consecutive year of over 30% EBITA 
growth as the division recovered from the trough 
in 2010. Looking ahead to 2013, we anticipate 
revenue growth and margin improvement to 
lead to EBITA growth of around 15%.  This is 
supported by our current order book, prospects 
in a number of key regions, including the Gulf 
of Mexico, the Middle East, the Norwegian 
North Sea and Asia Paciﬁc, and our view on 
the overall market which should beneﬁt from 
the forecast increase in E&P capex in 2013 of 
around 7%.
Wood Group PSN is well placed to deliver a 
strong performance in 2013. In 2012 we signed 
new contracts and renewals worth around 
$3.6bn in revenue, which position us well for the 
future. Looking ahead, the North Sea should 
beneﬁt from spending on integrity management, 
operational assurance and production initiatives. 
In North America we expect further growth 
from our US shale activities, and in international 
markets we expect to see a signiﬁcant 
improvement from the progress we are making 
in Oman. 
Bob Keiller, CEO
In GTS we anticipate continued improvement 
in Maintenance in 2013, principally due to 
operational improvement initiatives. The 
European power-related Maintenance market is 
expected to remain soft but we believe that we 
will see some improvement in the US. In Power 
Solutions, we remain on course to complete 
the Dorad contract in 2013 together with the 
smaller contracts awarded in 2012. We are 
pursuing a number of good near term Power 
Solutions opportunities in the Americas and 
elsewhere, although these are smaller in scale. 
Having experienced delays in project awards, 
we anticipate a lower contribution from Power 
Solutions in 2013.
As I said earlier, Wood Group is a great 
company and I believe we can be even better. 
We have a strong business set to make 
progress in all divisions in 2013, and I look 
forward to leading our further development in 
good long-term growth markets.

People 10,200 9,100 12%
Wood Group Engineering delivered very 
strong growth. Revenue increased by 23% 
and EBITA increased by 36%, principally 
reﬂecting increased activity in upstream and 
subsea & pipelines.  EBITA margin increased 
from 11.1% to 12.3%, largely as a result of 
higher volumes and improvement in pricing 
in some areas.
Headcount increased by 12% from 9,100 to 
10,200. The increase was heavily weighted 
to the ﬁrst half of the year, reﬂecting the 
timing of signiﬁcant contract awards in 
upstream. 
Our upstream business accounted for just 
under 40% of divisional revenue. Detailed 
engineering work continues on the Ichthys 
and Mafumeira Sul projects in Australia and 
Angola, which are scheduled to complete in 
the second half of 2013. Strength in the Gulf 
of Mexico was driven by FEED and detailed 
engineering work on projects including 
Anadarko Lucius, Exxon Hadrian, Chevron 
Jack & St Malo and Williams Partners 
Tubular Bells. We have visibility on prospects 
including detailed engineering following from 
ongoing and executed FEEDs, along with 
additional projects with existing customers. 
In Canada we have seen good growth 
over the last two years, but experienced a 
slowdown in activity in the last quarter which 
is continuing in 2013.
Our subsea & pipeline business accounted 
for almost 45% of revenue. Our subsea 
activities remained strong in the North Sea 
and Australia where we continue to work on 
projects including BP Quad 204 and Chevron 
Gorgon. Elsewhere, we continue to work on 
the next phase of ACG in the Caspian and 
on Block 18 in Angola, and have recently 
been awarded the subsea FEED work on 
the Abadi FLNG project in Indonesia for 
Inpex. Our onshore pipelines business has 
performed well in the USA, beneﬁting from 
the award of the Shell pipeline and terminals 
EPCM contract and general activity levels in 
the shale regions. 
Downstream, process & industrial activities 
accounted for just over 15% of revenue. 
Performance in the second half improved, 
although the market remains highly 
competitive.
Outlook
In 2012, Wood Group Engineering delivered 
a second consecutive year of over 30% 
EBITA growth as the division recovered 
from the trough in 2010. Looking ahead to 
2013, we anticipate revenue growth and 
margin improvement to lead to EBITA growth 
of around 15%.  This is supported by our

In Wood Group PSN, revenue and EBITA 
growth of 23% and 34% respectively, 
include a full 12 month contribution from the 
PSN business acquired in April 2011. 
Headcount increased by 11% from 26,200 to 
29,200 due to increases in Oman, the North 
Sea and the USA, together with the impact 
of acquisitions. 
We saw a good performance in the North 
Sea, which accounted for around 40% of 
Wood Group PSN revenue.  Activity on our 
operations & maintenance and brownﬁeld 
engineering scopes on longer-term 
contracts, including with BP , Shell, Talisman 
and TAQA, contributed to growth in 2012. 
During the year we negotiated contract 
renewals and extensions worth over 
$800 million. We were also awarded the 
operations & maintenance contract for 
Premier Oil’s Balmoral FPV, the brownﬁeld 
engineering work on Total’s Franklin ﬁeld 
and the hook-up and commissioning scope 
for Nexen’s Golden Eagle project.
The Americas accounted for around 30% 
of revenue. Growth in North America was 
strong, particularly in the US shale regions 
where we saw good organic growth and 
beneﬁted towards the end of the year from 
the Duval and Mitchell’s acquisitions in 
the oil-rich Eagle Ford and Bakken regions 
respectively. Our offshore activities in the 
Gulf of Mexico also performed well. 
International markets, outside the North 
Sea and the Americas, represent around 
30% of revenue. In Oman, the loss for 
the year was around $20 million. Despite 
this poor performance, we made good 
progress on a number of matters and are 
increasingly conﬁdent of seeing a signiﬁcant 
improvement in 2013, and that 2014 will 
be proﬁtable. Elsewhere in the Middle East 
we announced our ﬁrst contract award in 
Kurdistan with DNO for engineering and 
support services on the Tawke ﬁeld. In 
Australia, we were awarded signiﬁcant 
new maintenance work in Melbourne and 
continue to work for clients including Exxon 
Mobil and Woodside. In Africa, we remain 
active in Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria 
and Angola. In the Caspian, we are providing 
facilities engineering and commissioning 
services to customers including 
Tengizchevroil and Agip KCO.
Outlook
Wood Group PSN is well placed to deliver 
a strong performance in 2013. In 2012 
we signed new contracts and renewals 
worth around $3.6 billion in revenue, which 
positions us well for the future. Looking 
ahead, the North Sea should beneﬁt 
from spending on integrity management, 
operational assurance and production 
initiatives. In North America we expect 
further growth from our US shale activities, 
and in international markets we expect to

Maintenance revenues were up on 2011

aero derivative joint ventures, which are 
predominantly oil & gas related, made 
a strong contribution. EBITA margins 
improved, largely due to our increased focus

were also awarded multi-year maintenance 
contracts covering Sakhalin island for SEIC, 
the Brent assets in the North Sea for Shell

the changing geographic mix of our business. 
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 increased by 
42% to 85.2 cents per share (2011: 60.2 cents),

The increase in net current assets since

and inventory, partly offset by lower net cash.
The increase in non-current liabilities is primarily

Capital efﬁciency
The continuing Group’s pre tax Return on 
average Capital Employed

 (ROCE) increased 
from 18.4% to 19.3%. This reﬂects an increase 
in ROCE in Wood Group Engineering following 
higher proﬁtability in the period, offset to some 
extent by lower ROCE in Wood Group PSN 
which in 2012 has had the full year impact of 
higher goodwill and intangible assets arising on 
acquisition.   
The continuing Group’s ratio of average 
Operating Capital Employed to Revenue
7
 
(OCER) worsened from 10.6% to 12.5%.

Cash generated from operations pre-working 
capital increased by $49.0 million to $520.6 
million and post-working capital increased by 
$43.2 million to $327.7 million. The working 
capital outﬂow of $192.9m relates primarily to 
higher trade receivables as a result of increased 
activity in the period, along with higher inventory 
in GTS and the timing of payments and 
customer receipts on Power Solutions EPC 
contracts.
Cash paid in relation to acquisitions totalled 
$158.3 million (2011: $964.8 million), deferred 
consideration paid in respect of prior period 
acquisitions amounted to $30.4 million (2011: 
$14.6 million) and payments for capex and 
intangible assets increased to $127.2 million 
(2011: $104.4 million). We anticipate spend on 
capex and intangible assets to be in the region 
of $120 million to $140 million in 2013.   
The increase in tax paid in the year was 
due to higher proﬁtability in the period and 
tax payments arising from the Well Support 
disposal in 2011. 
The reduction in interest, dividend and other 
largely relates to the 2011 purchase of shares 
for the employee beneﬁts trust and 2011 
expenses relating to the return of cash to 
shareholders. 
In February 2013, the Group renewed and 
extended its bilateral borrowing facilities from 
$800 million to $950 million with the maturity 
date being extended to February 2018.

Foreign exchange and constant  
currency reporting
The Group’s revenue and EBITA can be 
impacted by movements in foreign exchange 
rates, including the effect of retranslating the 
results of subsidiaries with various functional 
currencies into US dollars at different exchange 
rates. Given there were no signiﬁcant 
movements in the average US dollar to other 
major currencies in which we operate between 
2011 and 2012, our results in constant 
currency terms are materially the same as those 
presented on the preceding page.     
Pensions
The majority of the Group’s pension 
arrangements are on a deﬁned contribution 
basis. The Group operates one UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme which had 258 active members 
and 933 deferred, pensionable deferred or 
pensionable members at 31 December 2012. 
At 31 December 2012 the scheme had a deﬁcit 
of $55.0 million (2011: $45.8 million) before 
recognition of a deferred tax asset of $12.7 
million (2010: $11.5 million). In assessing the 
potential liabilities, judgement is required to 
determine the assumptions around future salary 
and pension increases, inﬂation, investment 
returns and member longevity. The increase 
in the deﬁcit from 2011 was due primarily to a 
reduction in the discount rate used, which is 
based on corporate bond yields.  
The scheme is closed to new members and 
future beneﬁts under the scheme are provided 
on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) 
basis. 
Full details of pension assets and liabilities 
are provided in note 29 to the Group ﬁnancial 
statements. 
Acquisitions
During the year the Group completed the 
acquisitions of Mitchell’s and Duval which are 
providers of maintenance, installation and 
fabrication services to the Bakken and Eagle 
Ford shale regions respectively. The total initial 
consideration for these acquisitions was $158.3 
million, net of cash and borrowings acquired. 
Both these acquisitions now form part of the 
Wood Group PSN division and will signiﬁcantly 
strengthen our position in those regions.   
Footnotes
1. EBITA from continuing operations represents operating proﬁt from continuing 
operations pre-exceptional items of $375.6 million (2011: $262.9 million) before the 
deduction of amortisation of $85.5 million (2011: $78.7 million) and is provided as it is 
a key unit of measurement used by the Group in the management of its business.
2. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings before 
exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax, by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding shares held by the Group’s 
employee ownership trusts and adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares.
3. Number of people includes both employees and contractors at 31 December 2012.
4. Interest cover is EBITA from continuing operations divided by the net ﬁnance charge.  
5. Dividend cover is AEPS divided by the total dividend per ordinary share for the period.  
6. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is EBITA divided by average capital employed.   
7. Operating Capital Employed to Revenue (OCER) is the average operating capital 
employed (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding intangibles 
recognised on acquisition), inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and 
other payables) divided by revenue.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
Principal risks and uncertainties
Wood Group’s Values provide a sound basis on which to make decisions and assist us in 
considering the broad spectrum of risks and uncertainties that can impact operational and ﬁnancial 
performance across the Group. The risks below were included in the Board review process carried 
out in accordance with the guidance on internal controls published by the Turnbull Review Group.
Safety and assurance Operations Financial Environmental
Failure to deliver safety 
excellence and process 
assurance could harm people, 
and damage assets and result 
in customers no longer selecting 
the Group as a supplier of 
services.
Failure to deliver expected 
operational performance could 
lead to a requirement for 
work to be repeated, loss of 
work through damage to our 
reputation, or liability claims.
An internal or external event 
could cause a breakdown in our 
ﬁnancial controls, hampering 
management’s ability to make 
effective decisions and to report 
on our ﬁnancial position. Inability 
to obtain funding could impact 
our ability to pursue commercial 
opportunities.
An environmental incident could 
lead to legislative or regulatory 
action, harm to the environment 
and associated reputational 
damage.

certiﬁcation.
Our safety leadership programme 
has been extensively deployed 
across the Group.
We have a review and approval 
process for new work aligned to 
formal delegations of authority.
We have start-up and execution 
plans for key projects supported 
by monitoring and reporting.
We seek to deliver high-
quality project execution and 
operational performance.
We have Group-wide accounting, 
treasury and tax policies that 
underpin our approach to 
managing ﬁnancial risk.
We execute a regular budgeting, 
forecasting and monitoring 
process.
We carry out a review and 
approval process in relation 
to capital commitments, 
acquisitions and disposals.
We have internal audit, quarterly 
self-certiﬁcation and annual 
ﬁnancial risk self-assessment 
processes embedded across  
the Group.
We have longer-term banking 
facilities, with appropriate 
headroom. 
We seek to deliver high-quality 
project execution and operational 
performance.
A large number of our business 
units have ISO 14001 certiﬁed 
or equivalent environmental 
management systems.
We drive heightened 
environmental awareness 
through HSE alerts and 
environment initiatives.
2012 Update 2012 Update 2012 Update 2012 Update
We strengthened our safety 
management team. We also 
continued to develop integrity 
management controls. Over 
1,200 senior managers have now 
attended our safety leadership 
programme.
We are investing in the 
development of new business 
management systems and 
also began to further develop 
business continuity plans.
In February 2013, the Group 
renewed and extended its 
bilateral borrowing facilities from 
$800 million to $950 million, with 
the maturity date being extended 
to February 2018. 
Our integrity management focus

Commitment to business ethics
Wood Group’s Business Ethics 
Policy recognises and reinforces the 
importance of conducting business 
ethically and legally throughout our 
worldwide organisation.
http://www.woodgroup.com/about-us/doing-
business-with-us/pages/default.aspx
Commercial Compliance People Markets and 
relationships
Inappropriate pricing, contract 
terms, or failure to comply with 
contract terms could lead to 
unacceptable risk, reputational 
damage, or poor ﬁnancial 
performance. 
A substantial ethical breach or 
non-compliance with laws could 
lead to reputational damage, 
associated regulatory or 
legislative action, loss of business 
and claims for compensation.
The availability of appropriately 
skilled personnel remains a 
challenge for our industry. Failure 
to attract or retain key personnel 
could lead to a lack of necessary 
expertise or continuity.
A cyclical downturn or 
prolonged recession could 
lead to uncertainty, impacting 
customers’ spending plans, 
leading to a decline in demand 
for our services. Over-exposure 
to any one customer, geographic 
market or loss of a signiﬁcant 
business partner could impact 
our performance.

Living our Values
“Our Core Values are at the heart of our business because they deﬁne who we are, how we 
work, what we believe in and what we stand for. They set out how we act and how we expect 
to be treated as part of Wood Group and provide a sound basis on which to make decisions.
Last year we launched the Living our Values Awards programme which recognises  
Wood Group’s people around the world who bring our Core Values to life and actively 
demonstrate that they are at the very heart of our business.”
Safety & Assurance
Safety & Assurance is our top priority 
because lives depend on it. We 
passionately care about the safety of our 
people and behave as safety leaders. We 
are committed to preventing injuries and 
ill health to our people and everyone we 
work with. We provide our people with the 
training, knowledge and tools to work safely 
and prevent accidents. We are focused on 
assuring the safety of everything we design, 
construct, operate and maintain. As a world-
leading services provider to the oil & gas 
and power industries, safety is vital to our 
business. It is not optional: it is absolutely 
integral to everything that we do.    
For many years we have striven to be leaders 
in safety performance, and this has been 
recognised with awards and recognition from 
clients, regulators and peers around the world. 
However, we are not complacent and we know 
that we need to keep working at this. We aim 
for the highest standards and are committed to 
driving continuous improvement.

construction team in Australia has sustained 
ﬁve years and more than 1.5 million man hours 
without a recordable injury during a period 
when the workforce increased from 80 to 200

risks to new personnel, which contributed to 
the team’s recognition as leaders in their ﬁeld.

TRCF is the frequency of all reportable injuries, including medical treatment cases. LWCF is the frequency of all injuries 
resulting in lost time away from work. Both frequencies are measured per million man hours worked. 
It is essential that we focus on the safety 
associated with process design and operation, 
as well as personal safety due to slips, trips 
and falls and we have developed KPIs in our 
businesses to allow performance in each of 
these areas to be tracked.
Initiatives 
Our Safety Leadership programme was 
launched at the end of 2011 with the aim of 
raising senior leaders’ awareness of the role that 
they play in delivering and improving our safety 
performance and encouraging/requiring them to 
demonstrate their commitment to safety in real 
and tangible ways. The programme has been 
led by the Board and has been rolled out to key 
senior managers. At the end of 2012 we had 
reached 1,200 people. We are continuing to 
develop it further to extend it much deeper into 
the organisation.

Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
Driving remains the biggest contributor to 
fatalities in the organisation; we have worked 
to embed our driving policy, which was rolled 
out across the Group in November 2011, to 
reinforce the expectation of safe driving by all 
employees at all times. We are focused on 
reducing the risks associated with distractions, 
such as a complete ban on the use of mobile 
phones whilst driving on company business 
and reinforcing the need to wear seat belts at 
all times.
To assist in delivering continuous improvement, 
the incident reporting systems used within 
the Group were reviewed and upgraded. This 
provides a consistent approach to reporting 
all safety incidents, ensures they are being 
assessed in a consistent manner and attract 
appropriate focus to drive improvements. 
Performance and initiatives
During 2012 the frequency of recordable injuries 
continued to decrease in line with long-term 
trends. However, we saw one driving fatality 
at the start of the year in Algeria when no seat 
belt was worn. This continues to remind us that 
driving remains a high-risk activity and that we 
can never be complacent.
We have continued to implement programmes 
promoting and enhancing the health and well-
being of our employees, their families and the 
communities in which we work. We provide 
guidance, tools and support to develop health 
programmes tailored and managed by our 
local businesses. We operate in areas where 
malaria is a concern and recorded three cases 
of malaria in 2012. We continue to be members 
of the Corporate Alliance on Malaria in Africa 
(CAMA) whose goal is “to maximise malaria 
intervention beneﬁts through the optimisation of 
in-country co-operation, information sharing and 
private sector advocacy.”
Over 600 employees completed the Global 
Corporate Challenge (GCC). The teams walked, 
swam and cycled to create a step count and 
complete a virtual walk around the world. 
Through the 16 weeks of the programme, the 
teams walked 822 million steps, the equivalent 
of walking round the world 13 times.
Recognising success
In 2012 many Wood Group individuals 
and businesses were recognised for their 
contribution to safety by industry bodies and 
you will ﬁnd examples of our Safety & Assurance 
Core Value award winners throughout this 
report.
Relationships
Our business depends on healthy 
relationships with customers, business 
partners and suppliers. We build and 
nurture strong relationships that are mutually 
beneﬁcial, making sure that we deeply 
understand the people we deal with, so that 
we can anticipate their needs and always aim 
to exceed their expectations. Everyone in our 
organisation contributes to the quality of the 
relationships we build and we actively seek 
feedback. 
We listen to our customers and the 
organisations that we work with – to understand 
and satisfy their needs. Often that can involve 
fostering better relationships within the Group, 
across our divisions. As a Group we perform 
better by being more joined-up, collaborating 
more and selling our collective capabilities. For 
example, this year we combined the best in 
class offerings of our businesses in a range of 
locations, including Newfoundland, Kazakhstan 
and Sakhalin Island.
We expect everyone in our organisation to 
contribute to the quality of relationships that we 
build and our people are given responsibility for 
their performance and decisions. We need to be 
ﬂexible and take action to address challenges 
and deliver high-value solutions to customers. 
Our commitment to our Relationships Core 
Value helps us to overcome challenges and 
break down barriers to change. Brought in to 
drive changes to culture and behaviours with 
Caltex in Australia, we didn’t want to convey a 
‘we know best’ attitude, but by forming a strong 
relationship with our customer and taking the 
time to develop a deep understanding of their 
needs, we were able to apply Wood Group PSN 
best practices and deliver a number of tangible 
maintenance improvements over the course of 
the contract.
We have several joint ventures across the 
Group. In Wood Group GTS, we continue 
to work well with our partners in Rolls Wood 
Group, Wood Group Pratt & Whitney and 
TransCanada Turbines. The success of these 
long-term relationships is a testimony to our 
alignment and focus on communication, and 
our ability to work well with partners. 
We also work closely with government and 
industry bodies, including health and safety 
and governmental departments of trade and 
industry. Our employees and businesses are 
actively involved in supporting groups which 
contribute to knowledge sharing and co-
operation across industry sectors. 
We have a number of relationships with 
educational institutions throughout the 
world, including the University of Aberdeen, 
the Kazakh-British Technical University in 
Kazakhstan, Heriot-Watt University in Dubai, the 
University of Western Australia and the Memorial 
University of Newfoundland in Canada. All these 
relationships are helping us to develop the 
next generation of engineers for the oil & gas 
industry.

needs, was invited to join the business 
development team. She has developed key

Social Responsibility 
Being socially responsible is integral to 
what we do. We aim to make a positive 
difference to the communities where we 
operate and seek ways to assist them. 
We prioritise the hiring and development 
of local people and work with local supply 
chains where we can. We are committed 
to minimising the impact of our activities on 
the environment by conserving resources, 
reducing waste and emissions, and 
preventing environmental pollution and we 
work with our customers to provide the best 
environmental solutions. 
We support a range of charities and causes 
spanning health, education, the arts, medical 
research and the prevention and reduction of 
poverty. We have well-established employee-
giving funds to support the causes that our 
people care passionately about. During 2012 
we have supported the K’NEX Young Engineers 
Challenge, the Aberdeen International Youth 
Festival, Glencraft and the Maggie’s Centres 
Appeal in the UK. In the USA we supported a 
number of initiatives including the Alley Theater 
schools project, the Texas Children’s Hospital 
and the MS150 bike ride for multiple sclerosis. 
We have been successful with initiatives to 
encourage the employment of female engineers 
in Saudi Arabia, and in Angola we have 
established university positions to develop the 
local workforce.
Our environmental strategy has three key 
elements. Firstly we develop and implement 
sound management systems. We have 
enhanced the use of management systems 
aligned to ISO 14001 and ensure compliance 
with the CTC Energy Efﬁciency Scheme 
reporting requirements. We identify and monitor 
environmental impacts of our main areas of 
environmental risk; this includes platforms 
where we are the duty holder; where we 
operate power plants and facilities, and the 
design and integrity of topside facilities.
Secondly, we seek to reduce the environmental 
impact of our operations. Our main CO
2
 
emissions come from energy use in our 
buildings and business travel by employees and 
we are committed to improving performance 
in both these areas. Our Carbon Footprint 
programme has now been extended across 
all of Wood Group Engineering and Wood 
Group GTS, and UK-based Wood Group PSN 
businesses and will continue to be rolled out 
across the Group. We continue to participate 
in the independent Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) for Carbon Emission reporting and 
we were ranked 97th in the FTSE 350.  We 
also participate in the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment, a UK Government scheme to 
incentivise carbon emissions reduction and 
have improved performance in 2012.
Thirdly, and most importantly, we use our 
expertise to provide solutions to customers 
which reduce their environmental impacts and 
help develop renewable energy solutions. It 
is in this area that we can make the biggest 
contribution to the environmental objectives of 
our Social Responsibility Value. 
We aim to directly and positively impact the 
environmental performance of our customers 
by designing processes and facilities which 
monitor and limit emissions, use fewer 
materials in fabrication and contribute to more 
efﬁcient operation. We are also focused on 
industry-speciﬁc initiatives. We have worked 
on well containment projects for not-for-proﬁt 
industry bodies and IOCs aimed at establishing 
containment and control systems in the event 
of well control accidents. Elsewhere, we were 
awarded work for a number of windfarms.
In 2012 we also staged our third annual global 
Environment Day during which employees were 
encouraged to organise a wide range of events 
to continue to raise awareness and focus on 
how we can continue to make a difference 
to the environment through our work for 
customers. 
Social Responsibility 
Wood Group PSN’s socio-
economic committee, Chad
Wood Group PSN’s socio-economic 
committee in Chad, has helped support a local 
orphanage in the city of Doba, leading to the 
number of children being cared for increasing 
from 55 to over 250. Wood Group PSN 
was credited with helping to enable this and 
improve the life, care and wellbeing of these 
children.

People
People are the heart of our business.   
We are professional, high-performing 
team players focused on delivering and 
drawing on our global expertise. We 
aim to attract, develop and retain the best 
people, treating each other with honesty, 
compassion and respect. We create a 
stimulating, fun and open work culture that 
promotes personal development and work/
life balance, rewards competitively and 
celebrates success.
When we state in our Core Values that “people 
are the heart of our business” it’s not just a 
hollow corporate strapline. With around 43,000 
employees working in over 50 countries 
worldwide, our competitive edge is delivered 
through the quality of our people. We pride 
ourselves on the character, energy and diversity 
of our employees and we work hard to attract 
and retain the best. This means that everyone is 
treated fairly, honestly and individual differences 
are respected.  
We aim to attract, retain and mobilise the right 
people to the right place at the right time. This 
involves a continuous and strategic focus on 
resourcing, succession planning and making 
sure we have the right balance of new entrants, 
graduates and apprentices entering our 
business.
To operate at the highest levels we know that 
we need to develop our talent and invest in our 
people regardless of career stage, location and 
role. Our extensive training and development 
portfolio covers the whole organisation and 
provides blended development opportunities 
designed to equip all levels of the organisation 
with new skills as well as reﬁne and update 
existing ones.  
Our successful Design Academy, 
apprenticeships, traineeships and industry-
leading graduate development programmes  
are an investment in the future of the Group  
with over 170 recruited into these schemes  
in 2012. We feed the industry with new  
highly skilled workers to lead the business  
into the future.
We recognise the inﬂuence highly skilled 
managers have on others so our leadership, 
management and supervisory development 
programmes support their own skills 
development and career progression. In addition 
to Group-led programmes, there are a range of 
courses provided locally to focus on personal 
development, speciﬁc job-related skills and 
vocational and professional qualiﬁcations.
In 2012 we were again recognised by the 
Corporate Research Foundation as one of 
Britain’s Top Employers based on a broad 
assessment of rewards, development, working 
conditions and culture. We attach huge 
importance to employee communication and 
engagement and continue to strive to improve 
our communication channels.   
We recognise the signiﬁcant advantage 
in working together across divisions and 
geographies to harness our collective strengths. 
We work in an industry that plays a vital role in 
the world economy, creating and maintaining 
essential installations from pipelines and 
platforms to power plants.  
Ours is an exciting business that offers a 
diverse mix of career development opportunities 
around the world to our people. We encourage 
innovation and fresh thinking that embraces 
our cultural diversity and encourages the kind 
of effective teamwork that results in tailored 
solutions to client problems across different 
environments.
Innovation
Innovation gives us competitive 
advantage. We promote collaboration and 
sharing of ideas across our business. We 
have a structured approach to recognising 
innovations, rapidly testing ideas and sharing 
learnings. We encourage our people to 
challenge established practices and achieve 
continuous improvement. We are committed 
to delivering thorough and sound solutions to 
every challenge. 
Innovation has helped us to respond 
successfully to the developing and changing 
needs of our customers. We strive to be 
innovative in all our operations. We promote 
collaboration across the Group and learning 
from each other. We encourage our people to 
question established practices and achieve 
continuous improvement. 
Our culture is to encourage innovation in 
everything we do. This includes how we 
operate, the application of the most appropriate 
technology and our commercial approach. In 
addition to providing our customers with ﬁt-for-
purpose solutions, innovation also motivates 
our people to reach the best of their potential. 
We therefore actively encourage new ideas to 
challenge and exceed existing methodologies.
One of the ways this is achieved is through joint 
industry projects (JIPs), including Wood Group 
Kenny’s collaborations for subsea, umbilical, 
riser and ﬂowline integrity management (SURF 
IM) and Slug Loading and Response in Pipelines 
(SLARP). Our employees also regularly publish 
in industry magazines or present papers at 
technical conferences.   24
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
Living our Values continued
For the most part we are technology neutral 
and our focus is on the application of the 
most suitable technology. However, we do 
invest in selective R&D where we see a real 
business need. The establishment of the Wood 
Group Chair in Arctic & Harsh Environments 
Engineering at Memorial University in 
Newfoundland is a good example of this. 
Currently the Chair is supporting a series of 
proposals submitted to the Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) 
and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency 
(ACOA) Atlantic Innovation Fund (AIF) which 
address two main technical issues including: 
the effects of large deformation geohazards 
on buried pipelines and qualiﬁcation of pipeline 
mechanical integrity.  
As well as seeking opportunities to acquire 
new skills and expertise in specialist and niche 
markets, we invest in a range of operational 
and engineering excellence initiatives to deliver 
continuous improvement. For example, our 
specialist renewable consultancy, SgurrEnergy, 
has deployed its Galion Lidar Wind Proﬁler 
device to measure wind direction and speed. 
This technology represents an advancement in 
the technical capabilities of capturing wind data 
and offers beneﬁts compared to other devices.
Financial Responsibility 
We expect to receive fair reward for 
our business performance. We are cost 
aware and carefully manage our own and our 
customers’ costs. We manage ﬁnancial risk 
systematically and communicate our ﬁnancial 
performance in a clear, concise manner. 
Our ability to generate fair reward is inﬂuenced 
by the markets we operate in, the value we 
provide, our systematic management of 
exposure to ﬁnancial, commercial and other 
risks, the capital we employ and the quality of 
the provision of our services. 
The fair rewards and proﬁts that are generated 
allow us to invest in the future of Wood Group, 
and to reward our shareholders for their 
conﬁdence in us. Our shareholders require an 
appropriate return for their investment, and 
achieving this return leads to a strong share 
price performance and our ability to access 
capital markets in order to support our future 
growth. Achieving fair reward for our services 
also allows us to fairly compensate our people, 
and to invest in their training and development. 
Another important aspect of ﬁnancial 
responsibility is our management of costs, 
where we have an obligation to carefully 
manage our own costs and those of our 
customers to allow us to generate an 
appropriate level of proﬁt which reﬂects the 
quality of our services. 
As an employer and public company we 
believe that we must communicate our ﬁnancial 
performance and future expectations in a clear 
and concise manner. This allows our people to 
understand their contribution to our success, 
and our shareholders and lending banks to 
understand our business and strategy over the 
longer term. 
We recognise the importance of maintaining 
relationships with investors and lenders and 
understanding their priorities. We seek investor 
feedback throughout the year, both informally 
through our investor relations team and through 
investor roadshows and one-to-one sessions 
involving the CEO and the CFO. In 2012, we 
held a capital markets day covering our Wood 
Group Engineering division which provided 
valuable insight for lenders, investors and 
analysts and allowed them to hear directly 
from operational management to gain a better 
understanding of our business. We held two 
major roadshows, attended a number of 
investment bank conferences and over the 
course of the year held a number of other 
meetings. Overall, we held approaching 200 
investor meetings. The Chairman and senior 
independent director also met with some of our 
leading shareholders through the consultation 
process around the CEO and Chairman 
appointments and made themselves available 
throughout the year for other meetings. 
In 2012 we also started to provide analyst 
consensus forecasts on our website, in line with 
investor relations best practice, and this has 
been well received.
The AGM provides another valuable opportunity 
for face-to-face contact with the Board, allowing 
shareholders to raise any questions they may 
have. The next AGM will be on 15 May 2013. 
We will continue to publish six formal updates 
during the course of the year – ﬁnal and interim 
results, two interim management statements 
and two trading updates – in order to provide 
regular updates on the Group’s performance 
and outlook, and we will discuss these updates 
with the investor community.

Integrity
We are proud of our reputation, built 
over many years, which depends on 
us doing the right thing. Integrity is our 
cornerstone and character is as important as 
ability. We build trust and act with honesty. 
We comply with our Business Ethics Policy, 
management system and all local rules 
and regulations. We foster a culture of 
transparency and responsibility.  
We investigate all violations and complaints 
and take appropriate action. 
The Board, via the Group Excom, tasks the 
Business Ethics Committee with monitoring 
the operation of the Business Ethics Policy 
and working on ways to best promote ethical 
conduct across the Group. Following on 
from the leadership of Alan Semple (CFO), 
the chair of the Business Ethics Committee, 
which comprises senior managers from across 
the Group, was taken up by Robbie Brown, 
Company Secretary. The Committee members 
appoint the Group’s Responsible Ofﬁcers who, 
liaising with a number of designated Country 
Ofﬁcers, are responsible for driving engagement 
across all the businesses and locations in their 
area of responsibility.   
Our Business Ethics Policy sets the high ethical 
standards that we expect of our business 
operations, our people and every company 
that we work with. Our Policy sets out the 
importance of conducting business ethically 
and legally throughout our global organisation. 
The Business Ethics Policy is available in nine 
languages and is widely communicated to our 
people. In 2012 around 5,000 (2011: around 
3,000) business ethics personnel were required 
to undergo bespoke training and conﬁrm 
their continued compliance. Business ethics 
personnel are identiﬁed based on a range of 
roles and responsibilities, including those that 
liaise with customers and third parties. 
The Business Ethics Helpline, where 
concerns can be raised conﬁdentially, is used 
to encourage the reporting of suspected 
violations of the Business Ethics Policy as 
well as operating as a forum for employees 
to ask questions. We investigate violations or 
complaints and take the necessary action. 
A register of ethics matters is maintained 
by the Group’s Chief Compliance Ofﬁcer 
and the Board receives regular reports and 
updates on business ethics as well as on the 
implementation of the Policy. 
During 2012, a number of internal investigations 
were undertaken into allegations of unethical 
behaviour. Appropriate disciplinary action was 
taken based on the facts and circumstances 
and this included two terminations for behaviour 
or actions that violated the Business Ethics 
Policy. We will continue to take prompt action to 
deal with any known violations. 
We foster a culture of transparency and 
responsibility. We must consistently apply moral 
and principled behaviour in all our transactions, 
which builds trust and honesty. We are law 
abiding, wherever we are in the world, and 
adhere to all organisational policies. We must all 
be accountable to each other, our customers, 
shareholders, and partners, by honouring our 
commitments, delivering results, and striving 
to provide the highest quality service. In spite 
of this, we know that errors of judgement can 
happen and therefore we are never complacent 
and are relentlessly focused on adhering to our 
Core Values.   26

Governance
“The Board came to the unanimous decision that Allister is 
the outstanding candidate to succeed Sir Ian as Chairman 
and is the right person to lead the Board as Bob and the 
operational management team take the Group through the 
next stage of its development. In reaching this decision, 
the Board has considered carefully the UK Corporate 
Governance Code recommendation that a chief executive 
should not normally go on to be chairman of the same 
company and we have thus consulted with representatives 
of our major shareholders holding in excess of 40% of 
the equity in the Company. They recognised that Allister 
has been with the Group for over 20 years, has been a 
successful CEO and provides the necessary continuity at 
the top level for our people and customers and, in these 
circumstances, they unanimously supported the Board 
changes.’’

Letter from the Chairman of the Board
“I have enjoyed taking on the Chairman’s role and working 
closely with Bob Keiller. Bob has taken over the leadership of 
a strong business, with an excellent management team and an 
established strategy. Under his leadership and direction I am 
conﬁdent that the Group will continue its successful growth.”
Dear Shareholder
In my ﬁrst Chairman’s letter, I want to take the 
opportunity to give you some background to 
the Wood Group Board changes and how this 
will contribute to continued challenge, debate 
and effective decision-making in the long-term 
interests of the Group. These changes were 
heavily inﬂuenced by the recognition of our 
customers’ and employees’ need for continuity 
in a leadership team that has been one of 
the most stable in the industry, together with 
the Board’s careful consideration of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the results of 
an extensive consultation with shareholders. 
In November, Sir Ian Wood retired as Chairman 
and from the Board. Sir Ian has been an 
extraordinary leader for the Group, guiding 
the company from its roots in the North Sea 
to its position today as a major global oil & 
gas services company. The Group and its 
shareholders owe a huge debt to him and to 
the executives who have worked so closely with 
him over the years.
The Board reached the unanimous decision that 
I should succeed Sir Ian as Chairman and that 
Bob Keiller should take over as Group CEO, 
effective 1 November 2012. The succession 
plan had the full support of the Nomination 
Committee, who recognised both the need for 
continuity and Bob’s signiﬁcant prior experience 
as CEO of PSN and his leadership of the Wood 
Group PSN division since acquisition. A clear 
separation of my own role in running the Board 
and Bob Keiller’s executive responsibility for the 
running of the Company’s business has been 
established. These responsibilities have been 
agreed by the Board and are available on our 
website.
In reaching its decision, the Board remained 
fully cognisant of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code recommendation that a chief executive 
should not normally go on to be chairman of 
the same company. Ian Marchant, the senior 
independent director, led a consultation process 
with representatives of our major shareholders 
holding in excess of 40% of the equity who 
unanimously supported the Board changes. 
Ian Marchant will continue to play a vital role 
in ensuring that division of CEO and Chairman 
responsibilities remains upheld.
The Board plays a key role in shaping the 
strategy of the Group and it is expected that 
everyone brings a strong voice and fresh, 
challenging views to the Board table. The 
appointment to the Board of Robin Watson, 
Chief Executive of Wood Group PSN and Mark 
Dobler, Chief Executive of Wood Group GTS 
on 1 January 2013, following the departure 
of Les Thomas and Mark Papworth, will help 
ensure that this remains the case and the Board 
will beneﬁt from their signiﬁcant operational 
experience and leadership. Two of our longer-
serving non-executive directors, John Morgan 
and Dr Christopher Masters, retired from the 
Board at the 2012 AGM. Both sat on a number 
of committees and contributed signiﬁcantly 
to important Board discussion around the 
Group’s expansion strategy and in doing so 
added signiﬁcant value; their contribution will 
be missed. 
David Woodward has taken over John’s role 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
During the year, we welcomed Mary Shafer-
Malicki to the Board as a non-executive director 
and we are already beneﬁting from Mary’s 
positive contribution. In January 2013, we also 
appointed Thomas Botts as a non-executive 
director who will lead a new Safety & Assurance 
Committee to be established in 2013. Following 
these changes, I am conﬁdent that the Board 
has maintained the appropriate balance of 
skills, diversity, experience and personalities 
required to ensure the long-term interests of the 
Company are met. I also place considerable 
trust in the various Board committees bringing 
appropriate insight to the Board’s deliberations.
To lead the Board and ensure its effectiveness 
presents me with an exciting new challenge 
and I look forward to supporting the Group’s 
continued success under Bob’s leadership.

Corporate governance
Statement of Compliance
The Board remains fully committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance 
and believes that this is key to overall performance and integrity. The following section explains 
how the Company has applied the main principles of Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, 
Remuneration and Relations with Shareholders outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Governance Code). A copy of the Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. Save 
as set out in the Chairman’s letter on page 27, the directors consider that the Company has 
fully complied with the provisions of the Governance Code during the year ended 31 December 
2012. The Board also believes that good corporate governance extends beyond regulatory 
compliance and consistently monitors developments in best practice, including guidance 
published by investor groups.
How does the Board manage risk?
Effective risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management which is 
fundamental to the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. Clear risk management 
is required in all aspects of our activities as 
outlined and represented below.
Our Core Values
The effective management of risk is necessary 
across all aspects of our business model and 
our Core Values provide our people, customers 
and suppliers with a clear view on how we 
operate which helps frame the risk culture 
across the Group. 
Operations
Our people across our business operations are 
at the forefront of effective risk management. 
The risk proﬁle across each of our divisions 
varies through the nature of our activities, 
speciﬁc customer contracts and geographic 
spread, and each division operates under an 
established policy and procedural framework 
which supports our corporate attitude to risk. 
Oversight
The Board formally reviews risk management 
arrangements twice a year, usually in February 
and August, and through the course of the year 
the Board will consider current and emerging 
risks facing the Group. In addition, the Board 
monitors the Group’s attitude to risk.
Our leadership teams provide oversight through 
speciﬁc mechanisms designed to monitor key 
risks in such areas. This is an ongoing and 
evolutionary process and we are continually 
seeking to enhance our risk monitoring and 
reporting tools. 
Assurance 
Various assurance mechanisms are utilised 
across the Group such as peer reviews on 
certain signiﬁcant or higher risk contracts, audits 
performed by the Group Internal Audit function 
and contracts audits undertaken by Group 
Legal. This work complements business speciﬁc 
activity in areas such as Safety, HR, and Quality. 
We continue to review our approach to risk 
management and seek to continuously improve 
associated internal control processes. Some 
of the more recent developments introduced in 
2012 include:
• a speciﬁc exercise to consider information 
security risks across the Group 
commenced during Q4. The output from 
this exercise will help inform any necessary 
changes to IT security policies and 
associated processes and controls
• a two-day workshop involving participants 
from across the Group was held to review 
current Joint Venture processes and 
associated risks
• further development of our commercial 
contract risk management system
• increasing emphasis on a ‘bottom up’ 
approach to risk identiﬁcation to improve 
the consistency of risk information 
reported across the Group

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
What is the role of the Board?
The Board has a schedule of matters speciﬁcally 
reserved for its consideration and approval. 
These include responsibility for Group strategy, 
the annual budget, signiﬁcant acquisitions, risk 
management and the overall system of internal 
control. Executive management is responsible 
for the implementation of Board decisions in 
these areas and all other aspects of managing 
the business. A typical Board agenda is set out 
below.
What is the composition of the Board?
The Board comprised between 10 and 14 
directors during the year. Other than during 
the period 11 May to 30 June (pending the 
previously announced resignations of L J 
Thomas and M H Papworth), the non-executive 
directors comprised a majority of the Board 
(excluding the Chairman) as recommended by 
the Governance Code. 
J C Morgan and C Masters resigned as a non-
executive directors at the 2012 AGM after 14 
and 10 years on the Board, respectively. M L 
Shafer-Malicki was appointed as a new non- 
executive director on 1 June 2012.
On 1 January 2013, M S Dobler and R Watson 
joined the Board as executive directors. T M 
Botts joined the Board as a non-executive on  
8 January 2013. 
A clear separation of the roles of the Chairman 
and the CEO has been agreed by the Board, 
in compliance with the Governance Code. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board. He chairs the Board 
meetings, ensures the agendas are appropriate 
and is responsible for facilitating that all directors 
actively contribute to the determination of the 
Group’s strategy. The CEO is responsible for 
the day-to-day management of the Group and 
implementation of the Group strategy, develops 
proposals for Board approval, and ensures 
that a regular dialogue with shareholders is 
maintained. Executive Board Members report 
directly to the CEO.
Are the Board members independent? 
After careful consideration, the Board 
considers all of its non-executive directors to 
be independent in character and judgement 
and, other than set out below, that there are 
no relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their 
judgement. Brief biographies of the directors 
appear on pages 28 and 29. 
J R Wilson is Vice Chairman of the Energy 
Group at J.P . Morgan where he advises oil & 
gas operators, principally the major international 
and national oil companies. The Company has a 
material business relationship with J.P . Morgan 
Cazenove, who act as joint corporate broker, 
adviser and lender to the Company. The Board 
has considered whether his role at J.P . Morgan 
could affect his judgement as a director of 
the Company. J R Wilson does not advise the 
Group and no part of his remuneration at  
J.P . Morgan is linked to their relationship with 
the Group or advisory services provided to 
the Group’s energy service company peers. 
The Board believes that he is independent in 
character and judgement and, accordingly, 
has determined that he is an independent 
non-executive director for the purposes of the 
Governance Code.
Are Board members standing  
for re-election? 
All directors will seek election or re-election at 
the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
Reports covered at each meeting
Safety & Assurance report, CEO’s report, Divisional updates, HR report, Audit Committee report, Financial updates (including tax & treasury and investor 
relations).The Board also receives a series of management presentations and has the opportunity for site visits through the year.

Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
How does the Board discharge its 
responsibilities?
There were six scheduled Board meetings 
during 2012 as well as four additional meetings 
convened to consider transactional activity 
and Board appointments. Four of the meetings 
were scheduled as two-day sessions and 
were held in Aberdeen and Houston. Safety & 
Assurance is always the ﬁrst item on the agenda 
at Board meetings. The Board received detailed 
presentations from senior management within 
the Group’s businesses during the year, each 
including updates on Safety & Assurance.
The executive directors, excluding the 
Chairman, attended 11 Group Executive 
Committee meetings throughout the year which 
include reports and discussions on Safety & 
Assurance, operational issues, ﬁnance, legal & 
ethics, investor relations and human resources 
matters. In addition, divisional directors 
conduct Quarterly Review Meetings with senior 
managers of all businesses within their division. 
These meetings are also normally attended by 
the CEO and the CFO.
In addition to Board meetings, the Board 
receives a monthly report which gives a 
summary of safety, ﬁnancial and operational 
matters.
The directors have access, via a secure intranet 
site, to presentations from the Group’s brokers 
which contain investors’ feedback, copies 
of relevant regulations, analyst research and 
appropriate administrative information.
What training do the Board members 
receive? 
The training needs of directors are periodically 
discussed at Board meetings and brieﬁngs 
arranged on issues relating to corporate 
governance. Arrangements are in place for 
newly appointed directors to undertake an 
induction process designed to develop their 
knowledge and understanding of the Group’s 
business. This includes brieﬁng sessions 
during regular Board meetings, visits to Group 
operating sites and discussion of relevant 
business issues. Upon their appointment, 
directors are advised of their legal and other 
duties and their obligations as directors of a 
listed company and under the Companies Act 
2006.
All directors are encouraged to attend relevant 
external seminars. There is a procedure for 
any director to take independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense and all directors 
have access to the services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that 
the Board’s procedures are followed.
How is the Board’s performance  
evaluated? 
The Board completed a formal evaluation of 
its own performance and of its committees, 
individual directors, and of the Chairman during 
the year. This involved directors completing 
detailed questionnaires, the results of which 
were analysed by the Company Secretary and 
presented for discussion both at a full Board 
meeting and separate meetings between each 
director and the Chairman. The non-executive 
directors, led by the senior independent director, 
are responsible for the performance evaluation 
of the Chairman, taking into account the views 
of the executive directors. An independent 
consultant has been retained to facilitate the 
evaluation of the Board in 2013. 
How are conﬂicts of interest dealt with? 
The Board requires directors to declare any 
appointments or other situations which would 
amount to a possible conﬂict of interest. The 
Board has procedures in place to deal with and, 
if necessary, approve any such conﬂicts.
Stewardship – how do you engage with 
your shareholders? 
Our investor relations activities are led by 
the Group’s CEO and CFO, supported by 
the investor relations team. We arrange for 
signiﬁcant shareholders to meet with the CEO 
and CFO twice a year around the interim and 
ﬁnal results announcements. Our investor 
relations team organises ad-hoc meetings with 
management, manages capital markets day 
presentations for investors and analysts and 
maintains an ongoing dialogue with the ﬁnancial 
community through analyst relationships. 
Further details can be found in the Financial 
Responsibility section of the Living Our Values 
section of this report on page 24.
The Chairman and the senior independent 
director are also available to shareholders on 
request.

Committees of the Board
The Board has delegated some of its 
responsibilities to committees – the Nomination 
Committee, the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. A summary of the 
work of the Nomination Committee and the 
Audit Committee is set out below and the report 
of the Remuneration Committee is included in 
the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 
38-48.
The Committees’ terms of reference are 
available on the Group’s website.
Attendance by directors at the meetings of the 
Board and its committees is summarised here.
The dates of future Board meetings have now 
been agreed until the end of 2014.
Corporate governance continued
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for recommending 
candidates to the Board and 
ensuring succession plans 
are in place. The Nomination 
Committee aims to promote 
high standards of corporate 
governance by ensuring the 
balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience of the Board 
both now and in the future.
Who is on the Nomination Committee?
The Nomination Committee comprised the 
Chairman and all of the independent non-
executive directors. T M Botts was appointed 
to the Committee following the year end, on

Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
The Audit Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal ﬁnancial controls, 
monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial statements 
and internal and external 
audit functions. The Audit 
Committee aims to promote 
high standards of corporate 
governance by ensuring 
robust and effective ﬁnancial 
and audit controls.
Who is on the Audit Committee?
The Audit Committee comprises the pictured 
Board members above. During the period,  
J C Morgan and Dr C Masters also served 
until their resignation at the 2012 AGM. The 
Committee has written terms of reference 
setting out its roles and responsibilities, 
including:
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial controls
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial statements and its interim and 
preliminary announcements
• monitoring and assessing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function
• reviewing the terms of engagement and 
independence of the external auditors
• assessing the audit process and the 
effectiveness of the external auditors to 
supply non-audit services, in accordance 
with Group policy
• reporting to the Board, identifying any 
matters in respect of which it considers 
that action or other improvement is 
needed and making recommendations as 
to the steps to be taken
How does the Committee discharge its 
responsibilities?
The Committee met four times in 2012. 
Attendance at Committee meetings is at the 
invitation of the Chairman of the Committee; 
and the CFO, Group Financial Controller, Head 
of Internal Audit and the external auditors are 
generally invited to attend. The Head of Internal 
Audit and the external auditors have the right of 
direct access to the Chairman of the Committee 
at all times and to meet the Committee without 
management present.
During 2012 the Committee:
• reviewed the annual report for 2011 and 
the interim report for 2012
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal ﬁnancial controls
• discussed with management and the 
external auditors signiﬁcant issues 
and areas of ﬁnancial risk, accounting 
principles, practices and judgements
• considered with the external auditors the 
signiﬁcant matters arising from the annual 
external audit
• reviewed reports prepared by the internal 
audit function together with management’s 
response and the actions taken
• focused on complex or unusual 
transactions and judgemental areas
Re-appointment of external auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) have been 
the Group’s external auditors since the Group 
became a publicly listed company in 2002.
The ongoing effectiveness of the external 
auditors is considered by the Audit Committee 
on an annual basis as described below.
Notwithstanding the length of their tenure, to 
date the Committee has been satisﬁed with 
the effectiveness of the external auditors and 
have not considered it necessary to require 
PwC to tender for the external audit work. 
The re-appointment of the external auditors 
is submitted for approval by the shareholders 
annually at the Annual General Meeting.
To assess the effectiveness of the external 
auditors, the Committee has reviewed the 
standing, experience and tenure of the external 
audit lead partner, the arrangements for 
ensuring the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors, the nature and level of 
services provided, including the robustness 
of the external auditors’ handling of key 
judgemental areas and the quality of the 
external auditors’ interaction with, and reporting 
to, the Committee.
There are no contractual obligations that restrict 
the Group’s choice of external auditors.
External auditor independence and  
non-audit services
The Committee has overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity is not 
compromised.
During the year we received conﬁrmation 
from the external auditors regarding their 
independence. In accordance with UK 
regulations and to help ensure independence, 
our auditors adhere to a rotation policy based 
on best practice accounting standards. 
Accordingly, there will be a change of audit 
partner for the 2013 audit. One of the key 
risks to external auditor independence is the 
provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor. The Committee considers and approves 
fees in respect of non-audit services provided 
by the external auditors in accordance with the 
Group’s policy in this area, which is set out in 
the Audit Committee’s terms of reference. The 
cost of non-audit services provided in 2012 is 
reported in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements. In 
the opinion of the Committee, the provision of 
these non-audit services did not impair PwC’s 
independence.

Corporate governance continued
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has established an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group that has 
been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of this annual report. 
The process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and is in accordance with the revised guidance 
on internal controls published by the Turnbull 
Review Group. The Group, for the purposes of 
applying the Turnbull Review Group guidance 
referred to above, comprises John Wood Group 
PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Any system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the ongoing procedures 
which the directors have established to review 
the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control on an annual basis are listed to the right.
As a result of these ongoing procedures the 
Board’s assessment was that the internal 
control environment was operating effectively.
Ongoing procedures
Overall control environment: The Group has a 
clear organisational structure for the control and 
monitoring of its businesses, including deﬁned 
lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. 
The Group has issued policies which deﬁne 
the standards of business conduct and include 
Accounting Policies, Contract Risk Management 
and Review; Health, Safety and Environment; 
and Business Ethics. The Group Ethics helpline 
has been established to enable staff and third 
parties to raise ethical concerns in conﬁdence.
For further details please refer to the Financial 
Responsibility and Integrity sections of Core 
Values on pages 24 and 25.
Risk identiﬁcation and management: The 
process for risk identiﬁcation and management 
is outlined on page 31.
For further details please refer to Principal risks 
and uncertainties on pages 18 and 19.
Monitoring of the internal control systems: The 
Board has agreed certain reporting procedures 
to monitor key risk areas on an ongoing basis, 
including safety, legal and ﬁnancial matters. 
The Audit Committee has been delegated the 
responsibility to review the effectiveness of the 
internal ﬁnancial control systems implemented 
by management. It is assisted by the internal 
auditors and, where appropriate, the external 
auditors. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
regularly reports to the Board on their 
discussions.
Information and communication: The Group 
has a comprehensive system for reporting 
performance to the Board. This includes 
monthly and quarterly reports. The quarterly 
reports include a detailed ﬁnancial review 
against budgets and, at least twice a year, 
revised forecasts. The executive directors also 
receive detailed monthly ﬁnancial reports and 
meet on a monthly basis to discuss ﬁnancial 
performance and other operational matters. In 
addition, each division holds Quarterly Review 
Meetings (QRMs) involving discussions with 
senior managers and certain of the executive 
directors. The CEO and the CFO normally 
attend the QRMs.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Operational review on pages 11 to 13. The 
ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on pages 
14 to 17. In addition, note 17 to the ﬁnancial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, 
details of its ﬁnancial instruments and hedging 
activities, and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial resources 
together with the cash inﬂows generated from 
its existing activities as set out in notes 13, 
15 and 26 to the ﬁnancial statements. As a 
consequence, the directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Having made the appropriate 
enquiries including a review of cash ﬂow 
projections and key sensitivities, the directors 
consider, in accordance with the Governance 
Code, that the business is a going concern. 
Adequate resources exist for the Group to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements. 37
Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report, the Directors’ remuneration report 
and the Group and the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. 
Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the parent company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice). The Group and parent company 
ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the 
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
• state that the Group ﬁnancial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and with regard to the 
parent company ﬁnancial statements that 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and the Group and 
to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on page 28 and 29, conﬁrms 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the Group, 
and
• the directors’ report on page 30 includes 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces
So far as the directors are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware. Relevant 
information is deﬁned as ‘information needed 
by the company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report’. Each director has taken 
all the steps that he ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information. 38

Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
I assumed Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee in May 2012, 
following the retirement of John Morgan who had chaired the Committee 
very effectively for many years.
Our objective continues to be the provision of a remuneration package 
to attract and retain executive directors and senior management of the 
necessary calibre to support the future growth of the business. We do this 
through a balance of ﬁxed and variable pay, which we intend will result in 
total remuneration around the market median for target performance and 
approaching top quartile for exceptional performance. After consideration 
of both the external market and salary increases across the wider 
workforce, the Remuneration Committee has determined increases of 3% 
to base salary for existing executive directors for 2013. 
Over the ﬁrst three cycles of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  Wood 
Group has ranked 7th out of 21 (2008 – 2010), 5th out of 21 (2009 – 2011) 
and 2nd out of 21 (2010 – 2012) in TSR performance against selected 
peer companies, with strong adjusted earnings per share (AEPS) growth 
for the second and third cycles. Bonus awards for 2012 reﬂect good 
Group performance during the year and are differentiated as appropriate 
for divisional and personal performance. 
The existing LTIP and Long-Term Retention Plan (LTRP) were both 
approved through to 2012 and will be replaced in 2013. During 2012, 
we have developed proposals for a single replacement plan – Long-Term 
Plan (LTP). Two distinct awards will be made under the LTP covering 
both incentive and retention awards. In developing this new plan we 
have endeavoured to build on the successful elements of the previous 
plans while simplifying our arrangements and incorporating current best 
practice to develop a framework which we believe will continue to support 
achievement of the Group’s strategic goals.  
The LTP will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2013 AGM and is 
described in further detail in this report as well as in the explanatory note to 
AGM business. Overall the new LTP will not materially impact the total cost 
of the long-term incentives. It is intended that awards of a similar nature 
to those made under the old LTIP, LTCIP and LTRP will be made under 
the LTP in 2013. For executive directors and senior executives long-term 
incentives will continue to vest subject to stretching targets in relation to 
TSR, AEPS and EBITA performance.  39
Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
We are also proposing to have the ﬂexibility to allocate up to 25% of 
the maximum award to be based upon clearly deﬁned and measurable 
strategic key performance indicators (KPIs), although it is not our current 
intention to use the strategic KPIs with the ﬁrst cycle under the LTP. 
The Committee is conﬁdent that these measures are an appropriate 
reﬂection of the long-term performance of Wood Group. TSR, in particular, 
helps to ensure that participants are well aligned to the interests of our 
shareholders. The Committee is mindful of the need to ensure growth is 
sustainable. In 2013, a portion of awards under the new plan will continue 
to be restricted for a further two years ensuring executives are ﬁrmly 
aligned to the longer-term interests of the Group. 
Provisions in the new plan will allow unpaid or unvested awards to be 
reduced or cancelled in the event of material misstatement of ﬁnancial 
results, material failure of risk management or HSE controls, serious 
reputational damage or misconduct or fraud.
During the year, Deloitte LLP have been retained as remuneration 
consultant to provide advice to the Committee going forward and ensure 
current best practice has been adopted in the design of the LTP. 
As part of the review of remuneration during 2012, the Committee 
decided to introduce shareholding requirements for executive directors to 
further strengthen the alignment between the executive directors and the 
long-term interests of the Company’s shareholders. More details of this 
requirement are in this report. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee considered in particular the 
compensation packages for Allister Langlands, Bob Keiller, and for Robin 
Watson and Mark Dobler on their appointments as Chairman, CEO and 
executive directors respectively. The Committee carefully considered the 
transition arrangements in Allister Langlands’ move from Chief Executive 
to Chairman. In 2013 he retains an executive package but his package in 
2014 will reﬂect his planned role as part-time Chairman. The Committee 
also reviewed the exit packages for Les Thomas and Mark Papworth as 
they left the Group.  More details are contained in this report. 
The existing long-term plans together with the other elements of the 
compensation package, which overall provide a balance of ﬁxed and 
variable pay, a focus on performance incentives, transparency of 
objective setting and appropriate deferral mechanisms have provided a 
remuneration framework which has supported delivery of the Group’s 
business objectives. 
David K Woodward
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Part 1 Executive directors’ remuneration
1a) Remuneration Committee
The Committee advises the Board on executive remuneration and sets the 
remuneration packages of each of the executive directors.
The Committee is comprised solely of independent non-executive 
directors. During the year, the members were:
• J C Morgan – resigned as Chairman May 2012
• D K Woodward – appointed as Chairman May 2012
• M Contie
• N H Smith
• J R Wilson – appointed August 2012
The Committee has a written charter which is publicly available on the 
Group’s website.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Group Chairman 
and CEO attended meetings in 2012, except when their own remuneration 
was being discussed, to provide advice on setting remuneration for other 
executive directors. The Group Head of Human Resources also attended 
and, in December 2012, the Company Secretary was appointed as 
Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee have appointed independent remuneration consultants 
(Deloitte LLP) and has taken advice during the year from them in relation 
to certain executive remuneration matters. Deloitte LLP is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under 
the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the 
UK. During the course of the year Deloitte LLP provided external advice 
particularly on matters concerning the design and structure of the Group’s 
long-term incentive plans. 
The aim of the Committee is to establish an overall remuneration structure 
which will:
• attract, retain and motivate executives
• reﬂect the size and complexity of the Group’s business
• take account of executives’ individual responsibilities and 
geographical location
• clearly align remuneration with the Group’s long-term strategy in the 
pursuit of maximising shareholder value
• consider executive remuneration within the broader setting of pay 
conditions elsewhere within Wood Group
In setting remuneration policy the Committee gives full consideration to 
the relevant provisions of the Governance Code and relevant regulations 
enforced under the Companies Act 2006.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Committee met four 
times to discuss the remuneration issues arising and the operation of the 
remuneration policy. The following table sets out what the Committee 
covered at each of the meetings over the course of the year.

1b) Remuneration policy 
Each year, the Committee reviews the remuneration policy for executive directors and other senior executives, taking into account both the external market 
and the Company’s strategic objectives over the short and the medium term. The Committee considers the level of rewards that are offered by other 
companies, including those within comparable sectors, size and geography. Remuneration packages comprise ﬁxed and variable performance related 
elements and are aligned with maximising shareholder value and achieving the long-term strategy of the Group.
The Committee monitors the participation of senior executives in the Group’s short-term and long-term incentive arrangements and reviews the levels of 
compensation for internal equity and external competitiveness.

iii) Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives play an important role in the motivation and retention of executive directors and senior executives, consistent with our goal of 
maximising shareholder value. In this respect the Group has in place a number of long-term incentive plans. Details of the current plans are set out below 
in section 3c, and the table below provides a summary:
Long-term

Description Participants
Cumulative 
number of 
participants
LTIP Introduced in 2007 eligibility is restricted to executive directors and other senior executives. The LTIP was 
designed to provide incentives for three-year rolling performance cycles. The last cycle under the existing 
plan was for the three years from January 2012 to December 2014. 
Executive directors  
and around 30 senior 
executives
30 – 40
LTCIP Introduced in 2011 for senior managers, the LTCIP was designed to provide incentives for three-year rolling 
performance cycles with all awards paid in cash. The last cycle under the existing plan was for the three 
years from January 2012 to December 2014.  
Around 80  
senior managers
110 – 120
LTRP Introduced in 2003, the LTRP was designed to create a bonus pool based on ﬁnancial performance.   
2012 was the last year in which a pool will be created for LTRP awards under the existing plan (with these 
awards being made in 2013). 
Around 250 senior 
managers
360 – 370
ESOS Established in 2002 and renewed at the May 2012 Annual General Meeting for a further ten-year period, 
the ESOS provides for the grant of options to participants at market value. In 2012 grants were made 
under the ESOS scheme to 557 managers. No grants have been made to executive directors since 2005. 
Around 550  
managers
910 – 920 
The Group is seeking shareholder approval at the 2013 AGM for a new long-term plan (the LTP). See section 3c (v) for further details.
iv)  Pensions and life cover (audited)
Pension beneﬁts to UK executive directors
The John Wood Group PLC Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme (JWG RBS) is a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme which closed to new entrants in 2006. None of 
the current executive directors are active members of this scheme.
A G Langlands is provided with pension beneﬁts by way of a combination of deferred beneﬁts from the JWG RBS and an unfunded, unapproved 
arrangement. Final pensionable salary for A G Langlands is capped from 6 April 2012 at £501,315 per annum increasing at RPI plus 1.25%. No further 
pension accrual is currently anticipated beyond 31 December 2013. A G Langlands is provided with life assurance cover of four times base salary up to a 
maximum of £2,500,000.
R Keiller is provided with pension beneﬁts via the Wood Group Group Personal Pension Plan (WG GPP) on a non-contributory basis. During the year the 
Group’s contribution on his behalf to the WG GPP amounted to £53,080. R Keiller also receives a cash contribution in lieu of pension contribution where 
the Company contribution is over the current annual allowance. He is also provided with life assurance cover of eight times basic salary up to a maximum 
of £2,500,000.
R Watson is provided with pension beneﬁts via the Wood Group Group Personal Pension Plan (WG GPP) on a contributory basis, subject to a maximum 
Company contribution of 10% of base salary per annum (with an overall cap at £50,000 per year). R Watson is provided with life assurance cover of four 
times basic salary up to a maximum of £1,500,000.
M Straughen receives a cash payment of 10% of base salary in lieu of pension provision. M Straughen is provided with life assurance cover of four times 
basic salary.

Pension beneﬁts to US-based executive directors
US-based executive directors are entitled to participate in the Wood Group 401k plan which is a deﬁned contribution scheme. In addition they are entitled 
to participate in a Non-Qualiﬁed Deferred Compensation Plan which provides a company contribution based upon the level of employee deferrals.
A G Semple is provided with a pension arrangement of a deﬁned beneﬁt nature, providing an equivalent level of beneﬁts to that provided in the JWG RBS. 
If he dies in pensionable service, his surviving spouse or dependants are entitled to a pension of half of the pension that would have been received at 
normal retirement date based on the ﬁnal pensionable salary at the date of death. Final pensionable salary is capped from 6 April 2012 at $640,599 per 
annum, increasing at RPI plus 1.25%. A G Semple is provided with life assurance cover of approximately four times basic salary.
A G Semple had the following accrued entitlements:

The signiﬁcant increase in the transfer values for AG Langlands and AG Semple are primarily driven by the very low bond yields prevailing at the year end 
which are a major factor in the calculation of the transfer values.

M Straughen 23 April 2007 6 months

M S Dobler 1 January 2013 12 months
The Committee approved the extension of R Keiller’s contractual notice 
period to 12 months from 6 months to reﬂect his appointment as CEO.
It is the Committee’s view that these contractual notice periods 
continue to be appropriate. None of the service contracts provide for 
predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination.
On termination of service contracts by the Group, in certain circumstances 
executive directors are entitled to the payment of their salary and beneﬁts 
in kind provided that they will be subject to a general duty to mitigate their 
loss. Equity awards on termination are treated in accordance with the 
plan rules. Within contractual constraints, the Committee will endeavour 
to ensure that executive directors do not receive such payments if they 
believe that their performance has had a detrimental effect on shareholder 
value.
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships or 
other signiﬁcant appointments without the CEO’s prior consent and, in the 
case of the CEO, the Chairman’s consent. No executive directors hold any 
directorships in any other listed companies.
1e) Matters relating to Board changes during the year
During the year under review, Allister Langlands succeeded Sir Ian Wood 
as Chairman, and will transition to a non-executive Chairman remuneration 
package from 2014 onwards. His remuneration arrangements for 
2013 reﬂect his signiﬁcant time commitment to the Group in providing 
necessary continuity at the top level. He will be paid a salary of £400,000 
for 2013 and be eligible to receive a bonus of up to 125% of salary, in line 
with other executive directors. The bonus will be determined based on 
measures of Company and personal performance, similar to prior years. 
Half of his bonus will be subject to mandatory deferral for two years. He 
will continue to be eligible for pension until 31 December 2013 when all 
accruals will cease. He will not participate in the new LTP arrangements 
being proposed at the AGM. He will continue to accrue beneﬁts under 
existing LTIP arrangements up to 31 December 2013, in line with his 
executive responsibilities and these will be paid in line with normal scheme 
timings, including deferral periods. From January 2014, he will cease to 
participate in any short or long-term incentives and will cease to accrue 
pension beneﬁts. From 2014, the Chairman’s fee will be in line with 
comparable part-time non-executive Chairman roles. 
Les Thomas and Mark Papworth left the Group on 29 June 2012 and 
received salary and beneﬁts up to that point. Each will also receive a 
ﬁxed bonus of £150,000 in relation to 2012, which represents 46% 
of maximum, half of which is payable in April 2013 and the remainder 
of which in March 2015 in line with other employees. Mark’s and Les’ 
outstanding deferred bonus awards are payable in April 2013 and 2014. 
A pro rata LTIP and LTRP will be provided to their date of leaving and 
these will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the end 
of the period. In addition, Les Thomas received a contractual payment 
of £250,000 for loss of ofﬁce and in lieu of unexpired notice, £50,000 of 
which was paid in June 2012 and the remainder is payable in April 2013. 
Part 2 Non-executive directors’ remuneration
2a) Remuneration policy
Non-executive directors are paid directors’ fees, which reﬂect the 
commitment expected of them and their level of expertise, and are 
reimbursed all necessary and reasonable expenses in the performance 
of their duties. Additional fees are paid in respect of attendance at each 
Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee meeting and an annual 
fee is paid for Nomination Committee membership. Non-executive 
directors do not participate in the Group’s incentive or pension plans. The 
non-executive directors have each entered into letters of engagement 
addressing remuneration, services to be provided, conﬂicts of interest and 
conﬁdentiality. The letters of engagement do not have ﬁxed terms and are 
terminable with up to 90 days’ written notice.
2b) Annual fee structure
Annual director’s fee £40,000
Committee attendance fee per meeting £1,000 
Nomination committee attendance fee per annum £1,000
Non-executive directors can elect to be paid in either pounds sterling or in 
US dollars at the applicable exchange rate at the time of payment. 
There were no changes to the structure or level of non-executive directors’ 
fees for 2012. Fees have been unchanged since 2008 and will be 
reviewed during 2013.

3c) Long-term incentives (audited)
All shares and options issued under the following long-term incentives 
operate, in aggregate, within the ABI dilution limits in terms of the issue of 
new shares.
(i) LTIP
The original LTIP was approved by the shareholders at the 2007 AGM for 
a period of ﬁve years. No further awards will be made under the existing 
LTIP from 2013. The LTIP is based on three-year rolling performance 
cycles.
• The ﬁrst cycle began on 1 January 2008 and ended on  
31 December 2010 ‘the 2008 – 2010 cycle’
• The second cycle began on 1 January 2009 and ended on  
31 December 2011 ‘the 2009 – 2011 cycle’
• The third cycle began on 1 January 2010 and ended on  
31 December 2012 ‘the 2010 – 2012 cycle’
• The fourth cycle began on 1 January 2011 and ends on  
31 December 2013 ‘the 2011 – 2013 cycle’
• The ﬁfth cycle began on 1 January 2012 and ends on  
31 December 2014 ‘the 2012 – 2014 cycle’
Participation
Participation in the LTIP is limited to executive directors and senior 
executives who, in the opinion of the Committee, are able to materially 
inﬂuence the achievement of the Group’s long-term business goals. 
Awards
Each cycle awards executive directors a combination of shares and 
restricted shares up to a maximum of 125% of base salary at the start of 
the cycle. The number of shares awarded is calculated using the share 
price and exchange rate at the start of the cycle. 20% of any award 
earned is made in forfeitable restricted shares and deferred for two years.

Performance measures
The performance measures have been chosen in light of their 
appropriateness to the objectives of the Group, and targets are set against 
these measures at the commencement of each performance cycle. During 
the course of a performance cycle, the Committee has the discretion 
to adjust the achievement levels, but only so that the new levels are 
considered as demanding as those ﬁrst set.
The measurement criteria are:

Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The TSR of the Group for the ﬁrst three cycles is compared to a peer 
group comprising Aker Kvaerner, AMEC, Baker Hughes, Cameron 
International, Fluor, FMC, Foster Wheeler, Halliburton, Jacobs Engineering, 
KBR, National Oilwell Varco, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, 
Schlumberger, Sulzer, Technip, Weatherford International, The Weir Group 
and Worley Parsons.
Following the sale of the Well Support division, the Committee amended 
the peer group for cycles four and ﬁve and the peer group now comprises 
the following engineering & construction and support services companies 
– Aker Kvaerner, AMEC, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Foster 
Wheeler, Halliburton, Jacobs Engineering, KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, 
Saipem, SBM Offshore, Sulzer, Technip, The Weir Group, Worley Parsons 
and WS Atkins plc. The Committee has no current intention to change the 
peer group. 
In all cycles no awards will be made for less than the ‘threshold’ 
performance for AEPS, or 50th percentile for TSR. On reaching 
the ‘threshold’ or 50th percentile, one-third of the AEPS or TSR-
related element will become payable and on reaching the ‘maximum’ 
performance, or 75th percentile, 100% of the AEPS or TSR element 
will become payable. For achievement level between ‘threshold’ and 
‘maximum’ or between the 50th and 75th percentile performance the 
allocation will be on a straight line basis.
The 2008-2010 cycle
For the ﬁrst cycle the Group was ranked 7th out of 21 (towards the top 
of the second quartile) companies for TSR purposes, but did not achieve 
threshold AEPS, resulting in a partial award for all participants. The share 
price at the date of award was £4.12 and at vesting was £6.38.

Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
(ii) LTCIP
The LTCIP was introduced in 2011 for senior managers and is based on 
three-year rolling performance cycles. Awards were made in cash following 
the end of the performance cycle with 20% of any award earned over the 
performance cycle deferred for a further two years. Awards are set at a 
maximum of 50% or 75% of base salary at the start of the performance 
period, adjusted for the effect of share price growth (or decline) over the 
performance cycle.
Executive directors were not eligible to participate in the LTCIP . Final 
awards under the LTCIP were made in 2012.
(iii) LTRP
The LTRP and the proposed parameters of its operation was approved 
by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and has remained unchanged from 
previous years. There are currently approximately 400 participants across 
the Group. Awards are made wholly in shares by way of par value options 
which are exercisable between the fourth and ﬁfth anniversary of grant and 
which lapse under certain circumstances. The level of share awards to an 
individual is limited other than for exceptional circumstances to a maximum 
of one year’s salary although it is the Committee’s intention that individual 
awards would not normally be more than 50% of annual salary.
The basis of the LTRP is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually 
based on growth in the Group’s AEPS in the prior year. There is no bonus 
pool if the prior year AEPS growth was under the threshold of RPI plus 
3%, with the maximum bonus pool paid, at an equivalent value to 5% of 
EBTA (earnings before tax, amortisation and non-recurring items) if the 
AEPS meets or exceeds RPI plus 10% in the prior year.
No grants were made to executive directors under the LTRP in 2010, 2011 
or 2012. 
No further awards will be made from the LTRP after 2013. 
(iv) ESOS
The Group adopted the John Wood Group PLC Executive Share Option 
Schemes after approval by the shareholders on the listing of the Group in 
June 2002 and it was renewed at the 2012 AGM for a further 10 years. 
Options granted under the ESOS are exercisable between four and ten 
years from the grant date. There is no current intention for any awards to 
be made to executive directors. Any options granted to executive directors 
will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria. 
The operation of ESOS is subject to ongoing review by the Committee with 
regard to eligibility, level of allocation and frequency of issue, taking into 
account the practice of comparable companies.
No grants are currently in place for executive directors under the ESOS.
(v) Proposed changes to long-term incentives
The Group is seeking shareholder approval at the 2013 AGM for a new 
long-term plan (the LTP). The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
led a consultation process with representatives of major shareholders 
holding in excess of 30% of the equity and received a positive response 
to the proposals. This plan will simplify and replace the existing LTIP , 
LTCIP and LTRP from 2013. Two distinct awards will be made under LTP . 
Awards to c 140 – 160 former LTIP and LTCIP participants, which includes 
executive directors, senior executives and senior managers, will be made 
broadly on the same basis under LTP as historic awards were made under 
LTIP .  Awards to the c 250 managers will be made under the LTP on 
broadly the same basis as historic awards were made under LTRP .

Performance measures 
For executive directors, other senior executives and senior managers, the 
proposed performance measures would continue to be based on AEPS, 
TSR and divisional EBITA (where appropriate). Awards made to the CEO 
and the CFO would be based on TSR and AEPS only (25% and 75% 
respectively). Divisional directors will also be measured on Divisional EBITA, 
the split of measurement being TSR 25%, AEPS 37.5% and Divisional 
EBITA 37.5%. We are also proposing we have the right to allocate up to 
25% of the maximum award based upon clearly deﬁned and measureable 
strategic key performance indicators (KPIs), although it is not the Group’s 
current intention to use the strategic KPIs with the ﬁrst cycle award under 
the new LTP . It is the intention that, when utilised, the strategic KPIs will 
lead to a reduction in the weighting attributed to AEPS and Divisional 
EBITA. 
Performance will continue to be measured over three ﬁnancial years 
(the ﬁrst cycle being 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015). 20% of 
the award will continue to be deferred for two years, as a retention tool, 
and dividends during the performance period will be accrued and paid 
in shares proportionately according to the number of shares vesting. 
Whilst under the existing LTIP 33% of maximum award vests at threshold 
performance under the LTP this will be reduced to 25% of maximum.  
We propose that the AEPS target for the 2013–2015 cycle be set at 
110 cents at threshold and 130 cents at maximum. The divisional EBITA 
targets will be set consistently with the AEPS target. 
For managers (excluding executive directors and senior executives), as 
with the former LTRP , under LTP a bonus pool will be created annually 
based on growth in AEPS in the prior year and added to the overall pool. 
This overall bonus pool will then be used to fund awards to this participant 
group. No shares will be added to the bonus pool if the prior year AEPS 
growth does not meet the threshold of RPI plus 3%. The maximum bonus 
pool will be created if the AEPS growth meets or exceeds RPI plus 10%. 
Within LTP it is proposed that the maximum size of the bonus pool be 
reduced from 5% to 2.5% of Proﬁt Before Tax and Amortisation. 
Award sizes 
Executive directors, senior executives and senior managers will be eligible 
for awards of shares up to a plan maximum of 200% of base salary  
Proposed opportunity levels for the 2013–2015 cycle are summarised 
below:
Position Participation 
level (% of base 
salary)
CEO 150%
Executive directors 125%
Senior executives 100%
Senior managers 75% or 50%
For managers (excludes executive directors and senior executives) awards 
will continue to take the form of nil or par value options and typically be up 
to 25% of salary up to a maximum of 50% of salary. Awards will be made 
in nil cost or par value options which will become exercisable between the 
fourth and sixth anniversary of the grant subject to certain circumstances. 
This type of award has proved successful in attracting and retaining middle 
managers and high potential staff not eligible to receive awards in line with 
executive directors and senior executives.
Clawback provisions
The LTP will also include provisions to allow the Remuneration Committee, 
in its absolute discretion, to reduce or cancel unpaid or unvested 
awards or impose further conditions. Such circumstances include, but 
are not limited to, a material misstatement of the ﬁnancial results of the 
Company or any business unit; a material failure of risk management by 
the Company, any Group Member or a relevant business unit; a serious 
breach of health and safety standards; or serious reputational damage to 
the Company, any Group Member or a relevant business unit as a result of 
serious misconduct or fraud by the Participant. 48

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, the Consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the Accounting policies and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 37, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 
for the year to 31 December 2012
General information
John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, provide services to the oil and gas and power generation industries worldwide. Details of the 
Group’s activities during the year are detailed in the Operational Review. John Wood Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled 
in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union (EU) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement. 
Signiﬁcant accounting policies 
The Group’s signiﬁcant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements are the result of the consolidation of the ﬁnancial statements of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings from the date of 
acquisition or up until the date of divestment as appropriate. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The Group’s interests in joint ventures are 
accounted for using proportional consolidation. Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint venture’s income, expenses, assets, liabilities 
and cash ﬂows on a line by line basis in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Transactions between Group subsidiaries are eliminated and transactions 
between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. All Group companies apply the Group’s 
accounting policies and prepare ﬁnancial statements to 31 December.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. These estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have a 
signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be 
recoverable. In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment review. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount 
of goodwill is less than the carrying amount. The impairment tests are carried out by CGU (Cash Generating Unit) and reﬂect the latest Group 
budgets. The budgets are based on various assumptions relating to the Group’s businesses including assumptions relating to oil prices, resource 
utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract awards and contract margins. The outlook for the Group is discussed in the CEO’s Q&A section of 
the Annual Report. Pre-tax discount rates of between 11% and 13% have been used to discount the CGU cash ﬂows and a sensitivity analysis 
has also been performed (see note 8). 
(b) Revenue recognition
Revenue on lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and ﬁxed price long-term service agreements is recognised according 
to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs. 
Estimating the costs to completion and therefore the total contract costs is a key judgement in respect of the revenue recognition on these 
contracts.
(c) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁnal outcome of 
these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
(d) Retirement beneﬁt liabilities
The value of the Group’s retirement beneﬁt liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying value of the liability. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate to be used in the actuarial valuation 
at the end of each ﬁnancial year following consultation with the retirement beneﬁt scheme actuary. In determining the rate used, consideration is 
given to the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid and that have terms to maturity similar 
to those of the related retirement beneﬁt obligation. See note 29 for further details.
Functional currency
The Group’s earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of the 
Group. The Group’s ﬁnancial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:
2012 2011
Average rate £1 = $ 1.5845 1.6041
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.6255 1.5541 57
Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 
for the year to 31 December 2012
Accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the period and 
assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation 
of net assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of proﬁts and losses from 
average to year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve. 
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Where more than one exchange rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily realised and liabilities can be 
extinguished is used. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Any exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at 
the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate 
ruling on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s 
activities. Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with a transaction will ﬂow to the Group and the amount 
of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual 
rates per man hour in respect of multi-year service contracts. Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives. 
Revenue from product sales is recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally  
upon delivery of products and customer acceptance, if any. Revenue is stated net of sales taxes (such as VAT) and discounts. 
Revenue on lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and ﬁxed-price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage 
of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs. An estimate of the proﬁt 
attributable to work completed is recognised, on a basis that the directors consider to be prudent, once the outcome of the contract can be estimated 
reliably, which is when a contract is not less than 20% complete. Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable. The net amount 
of costs incurred to date plus recognised proﬁts less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed as trade receivables/trade payables.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those signiﬁcant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses on divestment of businesses, write downs 
or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation settlements, acquisition costs and one-off gains and losses arising 
from currency devaluations.
Finance expense/income
Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the period to which it relates. Arrangement fees in respect of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities are amortised over the period to which the facility relates. Interest relating to the discounting of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities is 
included in ﬁnance expense.
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recognised when paid.
Goodwill 
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the 
fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Acquisition costs are 
expensed in the income statement. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic 
beneﬁts attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identiﬁable and there is control over the use of the 
asset. Where the Group acquires a business, intangible assets on acquisition such as customer contracts are identiﬁed and evaluated to determine the 
carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Software and development costs  3 – 5 years
Intangible assets on acquisition  3 – 10 years 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. No depreciation is charged with respect to 
freehold land and assets in the course of construction. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25 – 50 years 
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease
Plant and equipment   3 – 10 years
When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity at which 
the assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments. Asset lives and residual values are assessed at each balance 
sheet date. 58
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment
The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised 
when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying 
amount. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit (CGU). The CGUs are aligned to the structure the 
Group uses to manage its business. Cash ﬂows are discounted in determining the value in use.
Inventories
Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and ﬁnished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Service based companies’ inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables. Serialised parts are costed using the speciﬁc identiﬁcation method 
and other materials are generally costed using the ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out method. Product-based companies determine cost by weighted average cost methods 
using standard costing to gather material, labour and overhead costs. These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard 
costs to the actual costs incurred based on variance analysis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling 
expenses. Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included 
within borrowings in current liabilities. Where the Group uses pooling arrangements with a right of set-off, overdrafts and cash are netted and included in 
the appropriate category depending on the net position of the pool.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for 
impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The provision is determined by reference to previous experience 
of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred and contingent consideration 
Where it is probable that deferred or contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn-out arrangement, an estimate 
of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reﬂected in 
the income statement. Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 are reﬂected in goodwill. Where 
deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Taxation
The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax currently payable is based on the taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable 
proﬁt differs from the proﬁt reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are 
taxable or deductible in a different period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried forward and, in 
relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base. Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at 
the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.

Accounting policies (continued)
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method 
of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being 
hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a ﬁrm commitment (fair value 
hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash ﬂow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment 
hedge).
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the 
transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both 
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in 
fair values or cash ﬂows of the hedged items. The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income 
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash ﬂow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in the hedging 
reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses or ﬁnance income/
expense in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item 
affects proﬁt or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to 
the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
(d) Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of any derivative 
instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash ﬂows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of all derivative ﬁnancial instruments are 
obtained from valuations provided by ﬁnancial institutions. 
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values. 
The fair value of ﬁnancial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ﬂows at the current market interest rate that is available to the 
Group for similar ﬁnancial instruments. 
Operating leases
As lessee
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Beneﬁts received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor
Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement beneﬁt liabilities
The Group operates a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and a number of deﬁned contribution schemes. The liability recognised in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets. The assets of this scheme are held in 
separate trustee-administered funds. 
The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme’s assets are measured using fair values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using 
the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. The 
increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to 
operating proﬁt. The expected return on the scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from 
the passage of time are included in ﬁnance income/expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full 
in the period in which they occur. The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme’s net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance 
sheet.
The Group’s contributions to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. 60

Provisions 
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience. 
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic beneﬁts 
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Where amounts provided are payable after more than one 
year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Share-based charges relating to employee share schemes
The Group has a number of employee share schemes:
(i) Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS) are granted at market value. A charge is booked to the income 
statement as an employee beneﬁt expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period.  
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
(ii) Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan (LTRP) are granted at par value. The charge to the income statement for 
LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be 
exercised is accrued over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
(iii) The Group has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for executive directors and certain senior executives. Participants are awarded shares 
dependent on the achievement of performance targets. The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under the LTIP is based on 
the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. For 
those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model.
(iv) The Group has a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (LTCIP) for senior management. Participants are paid a cash bonus dependent on 
the achievement of performance targets. The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards and is linked to 
movements in the Group’s share price. The charge is spread over the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in 
liabilities.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital
John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classiﬁed as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability 
or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders. 
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the 
ﬁnancial statements of the Group. Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost. The cost of shares held by the 
employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
Segmental reporting
The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), the 
Group’s CEO. The Group’s reportable segments are Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS. 
The CODM measures the operating performance of these segments using EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation). Operating segments are 
reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reports provided to the CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments.
Wood Group Engineering offers a wide range of engineering services to the upstream, subsea and pipelines, downstream and industrial, and clean energy 
sectors. These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management (EPCM) and control system upgrades. Wood Group PSN 
offers life of ﬁeld support to producing assets through brownﬁeld engineering and modiﬁcations, production enhancement, operations and management, 
training, maintenance management and abandonment services. Wood Group GTS is an independent provider of rotating equipment services and 
solutions for clients in the power and oil & gas markets. These services include power plant engineering, procurement and construction; facility  
operations and maintenance; and repair, overhaul, optimisation and upgrades of gas and steam turbines, pumps, compressors and other high-speed 
rotating equipment.  61

Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards
(a) Amended standards and interpretations not relevant to the Group
The following revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory as of 1 January 2012 but are currently not relevant to the Group 
and have no impact to the Group’s ﬁnancial statements:
 (b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following relevant standards and amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
 The Group currently accounts for its interests in joint ventures using proportional consolidation. Under IFRS 11, proportional consolidation will not 
be permitted and therefore from 1 January 2014 the Group will account for its interests in joint ventures using equity accounting. The use of equity 
accounting will have no impact on Group proﬁt for the year or earnings per share, but will impact the presentation of the Group’s interests in joint ventures 
in the income statement and in the balance sheet. 
The revision to IAS 19 will not have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements although it is expected that the net ﬁnance cost in the income statement 
will increase in future periods (see note 29 for further details).
The Group has yet to assess the full impact of the other new standards and amendments but does not expect them to have a material impact on the 
ﬁnancial statements. 62

and restructuring charges of $84.2m, relating mainly to the PSN integration and the decision to exit from certain markets, were expensed in 2011.
Goodwill of $1.9m was impaired during the year as a result of the decision to exit from certain markets referred to above. Goodwill of $46.2m, mainly 
relating to a Wood Group GTS power related business, was impaired in 2011. 
A net bad debt write-off of $10.0m was recorded in 2012. A charge of $16.8m was recorded in respect of engineering work carried out for ATP Oil and 
Gas Corporation (ATP). ATP ﬁled a voluntary petition for reorganisation under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in August 2012. This write-off was 
partly offset by a credit of $6.8m in respect of cash recovered against the overdue Libyan receivables provision made in 2011 following political disruption 
in the country. 
Acquisition costs of $12.0m and bank facility fees of $3.8m, relating mainly to the purchase of PSN were expensed in 2011.
The gain on divestment of Well Support arose primarily from the disposal of the Group’s interest in a Middle Eastern business. There was no gain nor loss 
on the divestment of the Group’s aero engine overhaul business, the assets having been written down in 2011. 
In 2011 the gain on divestment of Well Support amounted to $2,305.7m, and a charge of $12.0m was made in relation to the write-down of the assets of 
the Group’s aero engine overhaul business. 
A tax credit of $4.1m (2011: $26.7m) was recorded in 2012 in relation to exceptional items on continuing operations. A tax charge of $4.2m (2011: 
$73.6m) was recorded in relation to the net gain on discontinued exceptional items.

Tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The expected rate is the weighted average rate taking 
into account the Group’s proﬁts in these jurisdictions. The expected rate has decreased in 2012 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates. The tax charge for the year is higher (2011: higher) than the expected tax charge due to the following factors:

Basic discontinued earnings per share for the year is 6.1 cents (2011: 520.0 cents) and diluted discontinued earnings per share is 5.9 cents (2011: 502.7 
cents).
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Group’s employee share trusts. For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has two types 
of dilutive ordinary shares – share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long-Term Retention Plan; and shares 
issuable under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are disclosed to show the results excluding 
the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax.

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, goodwill was tested for impairment during the year. The impairment tests were carried out against the 
Group’s Cash Generating Units (CGU), being the key Strategic Business Units (SBUs) within the three operating divisions, which are aligned with how the 
Group manages and monitors performance.

8 Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)
Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash ﬂow projections included in the ﬁnancial budgets approved by management 
for 2013/2014. Cash ﬂows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three-year period. A terminal value is 
applied thereafter in order to calculate long-term estimated cash ﬂows using the same anticipated long-term growth rate of 3% across all CGUs. The 
growth rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The cash ﬂows have been discounted 
using pre-tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

Details of the key assumptions underlying the cash ﬂows are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the Accounting Policies on  
page 56.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU. $1.9m of goodwill, which relates to a market from which the Group is exiting, 
has been written off during the year. $46.2m of goodwill was impaired during 2011. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than 
those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review. This analysis did not identify 
any further impairment.
In 2011, the goodwill impairment test was performed using budgeted and extrapolated cash ﬂows for a 20-year period. In addition, the 2011 impairment 
test utilised a single discount rate of 10% for all CGUs. 
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations. 
Development costs with a net book value of $20.8m (2011: $22.9m) are internally generated intangible assets.

days calculation of 51 indicates that closing trade receivables represent the most recent 51 days of revenue. A provision for the impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the original 
receivables.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
17 Financial instruments
The Group’s activities give rise to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact 
on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies. Group Treasury, together with the Group’s 
business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge ﬁnancial risks. The Group’s Treasury policies cover speciﬁc areas, such as foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Group’s proﬁts and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is signiﬁcant geo-political 
uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue 
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Where practical, the Group hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar 
subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans. Other strategies, including the payment of dividends, are used to minimise the amount of net assets 
exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the revenues of the Group’s businesses are to customers in overseas locations. Where possible, the Group’s policy is to eliminate all signiﬁcant 
currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using ﬁnancial instruments such as forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward 
contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded 
in equity.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise 
any foreign currency exposure. 
The Group’s main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate. Movements in the sterling/US dollar rate impact the 
translation of sterling proﬁt earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling/US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2012 (2011:10%), post-tax proﬁt for the year would have been $10.6m higher 
or lower (2011: $10.6m). If the closing sterling/US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2012 (2011:10%), exchange differences in equity 
would have been $48.0m (2011: $28.8m) higher or lower respectively. 10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible 
change in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at ﬂoating 
rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into ﬁxed rates to generate the desired interest proﬁle and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest 
rate ﬂuctuations. At 31 December 2012, 19% (2011: 47%) of the Group’s borrowings were at ﬁxed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring 
that cash is deposited with a ﬁnancial institution with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better, where possible. If average interest rates had been 1% higher or 
lower during 2012 (2011: 1%), post-tax proﬁt for the year would have been $1.9m higher or lower respectively (2011: $1.3m). 1% has been used in this 
calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to any signiﬁcant price risk in relation to its ﬁnancial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables. The Group’s operations comprise three divisions, Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group 
PSN and Wood Group GTS each made up of a number of businesses. Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support 
being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency. Where required, appropriate trade ﬁnance instruments such as letters 
of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk. 
The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Where a 
customer does not have sufﬁciently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade ﬁnance instruments referred to above may be 
obtained. The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for 
impairment of trade receivables. 
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements

17 Financial instruments (continued)
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance. There is signiﬁcant management 
focus on receivables that are overdue. A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12. Receivable days 
calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric. 
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better 
where possible. 100% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2012 (2011: 74%) was held with such institutions.
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s main priority is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2012, 96% (2011: 91%) of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities (excluding joint ventures) were due to mature in more than one year. Based on the current outlook the Group has sufﬁcient funding in place to 
meet its future obligations.
In February 2013, the Group increased its bilateral facilities from $800m to $950m, with the maturity date being extended to February 2018.
(d) Capital risk
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and 
when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent. Gearing at 31 December 2012 was 6.9% (2011: 0.2%).
Interest cover is calculated by dividing EBITA from continuing operations by net ﬁnance expense from continuing operations before exceptional items. 
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2012 was 35.7 times (2011: 38.8 times).
The ratio of net debt to continuing EBITDA at 31 December 2012 was 0.31 (2011: 0.01).
The table below analyses the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the 
contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows. Draw-downs under long-term bank facilities

Fair value of non-derivative ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand 
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments. Draw-downs under long-term bank 
facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative ﬁnancial instruments are not disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements as they are not material.

Warranty provisions
These provisions are recognised in respect of guarantees provided in the normal course of business relating to contract performance. They are based on 
previous claims history and it is expected that most of the costs in respect of these provisions will be incurred over the next two years.
Other provisions
At 31 December 2012, other provisions of $65.0m (2011: $75.6m) have been recognised. This amount includes provisions for future losses on onerous 
contracts, a provision for non-recoverable indirect taxes and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses. It is expected that any payment required 
in respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years.
19 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate applicable to the territory in which the asset or 
liability has arisen. Deferred tax in relation to UK companies is provided at 23% (2011: 25%).

19 Deferred tax (continued)
There is no deferred tax relating to discontinued activities included within the credit to the income statement shown in the above table (2011: credit 
$4.2m).
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As these earnings are continually reinvested by the 
Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $192.7m (2011: $147.6m) to carry forward against future taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

20 Share-based charges
The Group currently has four share schemes that give rise to share-based charges. These are the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the Long-
Term Retention Plan (LTRP), the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan (LTCIP). Further details of these schemes is 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The charge to operating proﬁt in 2012 for these schemes amounted to $26.2m (2011: $19.2m). $19.6m (2011: $16.0m) of the total charge is credited to 
retained earnings and $6.6m (2011: $3.2m), relating to the LTCIP, is included in other non-current liabilities as the LTCIP is a cash settled scheme. 
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below:
ESOS and LTRP
Around 1,200 employees participate in these schemes. For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing 
model has been used. Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise 
date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%. The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-
40% is based on the actual volatility of the Group’s shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies. The risk-free rate of return is based on the 
implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant. The rate used ranges 
from 0.5% to 4.4%. A dividend yield of between 1.0% and 2.0% has been used in the calculations. 
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year was £2.09 (2011: £1.62). The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the 
year was £6.43 (2011: £4.94 to £6.38). The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2012 is 5.6 years (2011: 5.7 
years).
LTIP
The share-based charge for the LTIP was calculated using a fair value of £4.12 for the ﬁrst cycle, £1.81 for the second cycle, £3.01 for the third cycle, 
£5.10 for the fourth cycle and £6.18 for the ﬁfth cycle. The charge for market-related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of 
the award.

for the year to 31 December 2012 82
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012
20 Share-based charges (continued)
LTCIP
The share-based charge for the LTCIP was calculated using a fair value of £7.01 (2011: £6.18). The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option 
pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above. Payments under the LTCIP are linked to movements in the Group’s 
share price.

Details of the Group’s Executive Share Option Schemes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Share options are granted at an exercise price 
equal to the average mid-market price of the shares on the three days prior to the date of grant.
687,486 options (2011: 989,244) were exercisable at 31 December 2012. 1,964,000 options were granted during the year, 1,438,477 options were 
exercised during the year and 588,451 options lapsed during the year. The weighted average share price for ESOS options exercised during the year was 
£7.59 (2011: £6.49).
Options granted to directors under the executive share option scheme are subject to performance criteria as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. No options have been granted to executive directors since 2009. There are no performance criteria under this scheme for options granted to 
employees.

20 Share-based charges (continued)
Options are granted under the Group’s LTRP at par value. The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on 
performance criteria that consider the growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share in the prior year. There are no performance criteria attached to 
the exercise of options under the LTRP. 145,000 options (2011: 106,500) were exercisable at 31 December 2012. 928,500 LTRP options were granted 
during the year, 1,279,681 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 325,604 LTRP options lapsed during the year. The weighted average share 
price for LTRP options exercised during the year was £7.51 (2011: £6.52). Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) has been in place since 2008. Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives are 
awarded shares dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for 
the LTIP are EBITA, OCER (ratio of operating capital employed to revenue), total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The LTIP 
awards are in the form of shares and forfeitable restricted shares. 20% of any award earned over the three year performance cycle are deferred for a 
further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares. At 31 December 2012, 4,448,914 shares were potentially issuable under this scheme. Further 
details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

During 2012, the parent company received $43.5m (2011: $6.0m) of proceeds from Group companies relating to the exercise of employee share options 
under the share symmetry scheme. This amount was credited to share premium in the parent company and an equivalent amount deducted from retained 
earnings on consolidation.
In 2011, the return of cash to shareholders via the purchase and redemption of shares and a deferred share dividend resulted in a deduction of 
$1,758.5m from retained earnings. Full details are provided in the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts.
Retained earnings are stated after deducting the investment in own shares held by employee share trusts. Investment in own shares represents the cost 
of 11,599,912 (2011: 14,696,669) of the Company’s ordinary shares totalling $112.7m (2011: $111.0m). No options have been granted over shares held 
by the employee share trusts (2011: nil).
Shares acquired by the employee share trusts are purchased in the open market using funds provided by John Wood Group PLC to meet obligations 
under the Employee Share Option Schemes, the LTRP and the LTIP. During 2012, 1,900,000 new shares were allocated to the employee share trust at a 
value of $3.2m. 2,718,158 shares were issued during the year to satisfy the exercise of share options at a value of $6.5m. 2,278,599 shares were issued 
during the year to satisfy share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Exchange adjustments of $5.0m (2011: $1.4m) arose during the year relating to the retranslation of the investment in own shares from sterling to US 
dollars. The costs of funding and administering the trusts are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate. The market value of the 
shares at 31 December 2012 was $137.0m (2011: $146.4m) based on the closing share price of £7.27 (2011: £6.41). The employee share trusts have 
waived their rights to receipt of dividends on ordinary shares.

200.5
The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchases and, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill arising on 
consolidation of $156.7m has been capitalised. 
During the year the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Mitchell’s Oilﬁeld Services Inc (Mitchell’s) and 100% of the share capital of Duval.  
The acquisitions are not considered to be material to the Group on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated in the table above. 
The acquisitions of Mitchell’s and Duval provide the Group with access to the oil-rich Eagle Ford and Bakken shale regions in the USA, strengthening the 
Group’s capabilities in the US onshore market. The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Group’s wider client base and use the Group’s 
resources to further grow and develop their businesses. These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions. 
Provisional fair value adjustments of $57.6m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in 
the year.
Adjustments of $7.6m have been made in respect of the provisional fair value adjustments recorded in 2011 and consequently goodwill has increased by 
this amount. These adjustments made are not considered material to the ﬁnancial statements and the comparative balance sheet has therefore not been 
restated.

On 4 April 2012, the Group divested its aero engine overhaul business and in May 2012, the Group completed the disposal of a Well Support business 
in the Middle East, the sale of which was agreed at the time of the Well Support divestment in April 2011. In total, proceeds of $43.0m were received for 
these two businesses.
The assets and liabilities disposed of were reclassiﬁed as gross assets and liabilities held for sale in the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2011. 
Property, plant and equipment with a book value of $1.3m that was part of one of these divestments was not reclassiﬁed as held for sale at that time as it 
was anticipated that the Group would retain ownership of those assets.
Details of the assets and liabilities divested were as follows:

29 Retirement beneﬁt liabilities
One of the Group’s pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme, is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, which is 
contracted out of the State Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment 
companies in trustee administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2010 by a professionally qualiﬁed actuary. 
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were:
2012 2011
% %
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.00 4.90
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00 2.90
Discount rate 4.50 4.80
Expected return on scheme assets 6.27 7.00
The expected return on scheme assets for 2012 is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the beneﬁt 
obligation. From 1 January 2013, the expected return on scheme assets will be set at a rate equivalent to the discount rate. The impact of this change will 
be to reduce the expected return and thus increase the net ﬁnance cost in the income statement in future periods. The impact in 2013 is estimated to be 
$2.4m.
At 31 December 2012 the actuary has determined pension liabilities by reference to a standard actuarial mortality table which considered UK-wide 
mortality data relevant to the Group’s pension scheme. Those observed mortality rates have been projected to improve at a speciﬁc rate into the future 
to allow for established trends and expectations in line with normal actuarial practice. Speciﬁcally, the actuarial table used was PXA00 and improvements 
were in line with the long cohort approach with an annual underpin of 1% p.a.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:
2012 2011
$m $m
Present value of funded obligations (246.1) (206.7)

At the balance sheet date the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries. 
In February 2010, the Group and several other parties were notiﬁed of a legal claim from a customer in respect of work carried out in 2008. Management 
believe that the Group is in a strong position to defend the claim. In addition, the Group is currently cooperating with an investigation in relation to a facility 
where it previously provided services. Management do not believe that it is probable that a material liability will arise from either of these matters. There 
has been no material change to the position on these matters during the year.

Accounting policies
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting 
Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the principal accounting policies which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
Reporting currency
The Company’s transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:
2012 2011
Average rate £1 = $ 1.5845 1.6041
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.6255 1.5541
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of ﬁxed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s net 
realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have been 
arranged, at the contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet dates or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences are taken to the proﬁt and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling-denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate 
ruling on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments
The accounting policy for ﬁnancial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group ﬁnancial statements 
with the exception of the policy on net investment hedges which does not apply to the Company. The Company’s ﬁnancial risk management policy is 
consistent with the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policy outlined in note 17 to the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Use of estimates
The preparation of these ﬁnancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share trusts
The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts. They have therefore been included in the 
ﬁnancial statements of the Company. Under UITF 38 the cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from shareholders’ funds.

Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based charges
The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and note 20 to the Group ﬁnancial statements. Details relating 
to the calculation of share-based charges are provided in note 20 to the Group ﬁnancial statements. In respect of the Company, the charge is shown as 
an increase in the Company’s investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary companies.
Taxation
The current tax charge is based on the taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁts differ from the proﬁt reported in the proﬁt and loss account due to 
timing differences and other items that require adjustment as set out in legislation. The Company’s liability for tax is calculated using rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. The deferred tax position is calculated using the rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax losses are surrendered or claimed in the form of group relief with consideration being received or paid accordingly. The group relief amount is 
recorded separately within the debtors and creditors amounts in the balance sheet, as applicable, and is calculated by applying the tax rate enacted or 
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date to the loss amount. 
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Dividend income is 
credited to the proﬁt and loss account when the dividend has been approved by the Board of directors of the subsidiary company making the payment.

6 Financial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s activities give rise to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk), credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse 
impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies which are approved by the Board of 
directors. Group Treasury identify, evaluate and where appropriate hedge ﬁnancial risks. The Group Treasury policies cover speciﬁc areas, such as foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments and investment of excess cash.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Company hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar 
subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Where possible the Company’s policy is to eliminate all signiﬁcant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using ﬁnancial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the proﬁt and loss account.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank borrowings. The Company borrows in the desired currencies at 
ﬂoating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash ﬂow hedges to generate the desired interest proﬁle and to manage the Company’s 
exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations. At 31 December 2012, approximately 22% (2011: 64%) of the Company’s borrowings were at ﬁxed rates after 
taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst 
ensuring that cash is deposited with a ﬁnancial institution with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better, where possible.
(iii) Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any signiﬁcant price risk in relation to its ﬁnancial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company receivables. Management believe that no further risk provision is 
required in excess of the current provision for impairment.
The Company also has credit risk in relation to cash balances or cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with an ‘A’ 
rating or better where possible. There was no cash held on deposit at 31 December 2012.

Payment of dividends
The Company declares its dividends in US dollars. As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in sterling, but if you 
would like to receive your dividend in US dollars please contact the Registrars at the address below. All shareholders will receive dividends in sterling 
unless requested. If you are a UK based shareholder, the Company encourages you to have your dividends paid through the BACS (Bankers’ Automated 
Clearing Services) system. The beneﬁt of the BACS payment method is that the Registrars post the tax vouchers directly to the shareholders, whilst the 
dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholder’s Bank or Building Society account. UK shareholders who have not yet arranged for their 
dividends to be paid direct to their Bank or Building Society account and wish to beneﬁt from this service should contact the Registrars at the address 
below. Sterling dividends will be translated at the closing mid-point spot rate on 19 April 2013 as published in the Financial Times on 20 April 2013.

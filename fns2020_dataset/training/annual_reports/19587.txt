GROUP
REVENUE
NON-RESIDENTIAL SECTOR
The non-residential market accounts 
for 46% of Group sales and includes 
expenditure on:
 Æ Commercial buildings
 Æ Retail developments and 
warehouses
 Æ Education, hospitals and leisure 
complexes
u nited Kingdom
in 2015 the non-residential sector in 
the UK was broadly flat compared to 
prior year, mainly due to weakness in 
the retail and entertainment sectors. 
Growth is expected to return in 2016, 
driven by stronger output in the new 
build commercial market, the largest 
component of the non-residential 
sector. For example, office vacancy 
rates in London are now at a 14 year 
low. 
For 2016 the Construction Products 
Association (“CPA”) is forecasting 
growth at a rate of 4.2% in the 
commercial sector and 3.2% for the 
UK non-residential market in total.
Mainland europe
The non-residential sector in SiG’s 
major markets of operation in 
Mainland Europe performed poorly 
in 2015, particularly in Germany 
where the market declined by 1.8% 
according to Euroconstruct. 
This impacted the performance of the 
Group’s German business, which has 
a high degree of exposure to the non-
residential sector, with 60% of sales 
being derived from this market.
The outlook for 2016 is more positive, 
with Euroconstruct forecasting growth 
rates of 3.2% in France and 1.2% in 
Germany. This is based on improved 
macroeconomic lead indicators and 
a reduction in government austerity 
measures.
RESIDENTIAL SECTOR
The residential market accounts for 
43% of Group sales and includes 
private and public sector expenditure 
on houses and apartments.
u nited Kingdom
The UK new build residential sector 
performed well during 2015, led by 
strong growth in the private housing 
market, which increased by 7% 
compared to prior year. 
This was driven by growth in the 
wider economy and government 
policies such as Help to Buy. in 
contrast, output in the public sector 
declined by 10% as activity was 
constrained by reduced grant funding 
and near-term uncertainty over 
the implementation of government 
housing policies. 
The UK RMi market was weaker 
than anticipated, particularly in the 
third quarter, most probably due to 
a lagged effect from a slowdown 
in mortgage lending and property 
transactions in the second half of 
2014. 
in 2016 the Group expects the private 
new build housing market to continue 
to exhibit strong growth, albeit likely 
at a lower rate than in 2015. 
RMi housing expenditure is expected 
to pick up later in 2016 as an 
improvement in lead indicators feeds 
through to higher activity in the 
sector.
Mainland europe
The residential construction market in 
France was challenging in 2015.
This weakness affected the 
performance of the Group’s French 
business, which has a high degree

of exposure to the residential sector, 
with 61% of sales being derived from 
this market. 
The German residential market 
performed better, and was up by 
2.0% in 2015, although this only 
accounts for around a quarter of the 
Group’s sales in this country. 
For 2016 Euroconstruct are 
forecasting a recovery in the French 
housing market as housing permits 
have stabilised and government 
measures such as the extension of 
zero-interest loans and continued 
“Pinel” programme for rental 
investments boost growth.
INDUSTRIAL
This market accounts for 11% of 
Group sales and typically includes 
products such as technical insulation 
which are supplied to the industrial 
sector; for example, power stations or 
petrochemical works, where heat is 
an important part of the process.
The industrial sector performed well 
in the UK in 2015, growing by 11.5% 
according to the CPA*, as it continued 
to recover from a historical low in 
2013. The CPA expects growth of 
7.8% in 2016. 
in France the industrial sector is 
expected to recover during 2016 as 
the combined effect of a decrease in 
oil prices and weakening of the Euro 
stimulate demand. 
The outlook in Germany is less 
positive due to lower corporate 
investment.
MARKET DRIVERS
Economic growth is an important 
demand driver in all of SiG’s markets 
as it stimulates building activity and 
industrial output. 
in addition, the following specific 
factors are also relevant to each 
segment of the Group’s business: 
Insulation and energy 
Management 
 Æ Recognising that 40% of energy 
consumed relates to buildings, 
the European Union enacted the 
Energy Performance of Buildings 
Directive in 2003; 
 Æ This Directive requires all EU 
countries to improve energy 
efficiency and in the UK is covered 
under Part L of the Building 
Regulations; in France by the 
Réglementation Thermique (“RT”) 
and in Germany by the Energy 
Saving Ordinance (“EnEV”); 
 Æ These standards are typically 
tightened every three to four 
years, usually leading to increased 
use of insulation to cut energy 
consumption; and
 Æ Furthermore, demand for offsite 
panelised systems and modular 
housing such as insulshell 
is expanding significantly as 
customers increasingly desire 
complete managed solutions, 
which reduce build time, lower risk 
and help address skills shortages 
in the sector.
exteriors 
 Æ Replacement of old/damaged 
roofs gives rise to a core demand 
for RMi expenditure. in the UK, 
for example, around two-thirds of 
the housing stock is more than 40 
years old; 
 Æ Product innovation to reduce 
construction and exterior 
maintenance costs;  
 Æ Growth of specialist distribution as 
the main supply route to market, 
gaining market share from the 
generalists and manufacturers; and 
 Æ increasing demand for offsite 
roofing systems such as 
RoofSpace, which designs, 
manufactures and installs rooms-
in-roofs in residential properties. 
Similarly to insulshell, this solution 
reduces cost, build time and risk 
for contractors.
Interiors 
 Æ increasingly stringent regulation, 
for example with regard to fire 
and acoustics. As well as driving 
demand for new products, 
this also benefits the specialist 
who can provide the necessary 
technical expertise; 
 Æ increased demand for integrated, 
manufactured offsite solutions; and 
 Æ Demand for higher standards of 
internal fit outs.

Chairman’s Statement
While 2015 was a challenging year for the Group, we 
made good progress on the Strategic initiatives and our 
infill acquisition programme.  
Going forward we are determined to get performance 
back on track by refocusing on sales, reducing our cost 
base and growing our value added businesses.
STRATEGY
Our goal is to be the leading specialist solutions provider 
to the construction industry. To achieve this we are 
focused on three key strategic priorities.
First, we are seeking to continuously improve our 
procurement function. The Group has made excellent 
progress over the last two years, but there is much more 
to do. This initiative is also gathering additional impetus 
through the appointment of our new Group Procurement 
Director, Ruxandra ispas, who is providing fresh thinking.
Second, we are reshaping our supply chain by adopting 
a two-step change strategy, with an ultimate goal of 
reducing our cost to serve by £50m. 
Finally, we are continuing to grow our value added 
sales, which currently account for 18% of sales. Offsite 
Construction and Air Handling will be important growth 
drivers of this category.
GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
As Chairman i am responsible for ensuring good corporate 
governance and that we continually aspire to meet the 
highest standards possible at SiG. Further details can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 59 
to 71.
Following the appointment of Andrea Abt as a Non-
Executive Director on 12 March 2015, i am pleased to 
report that we achieved our aim to reach 25% female 
representation among the Board’s membership.
As part of the Board succession plan, the Nominations 
Committee has reviewed the positions of Chris 
Geoghegan and Jonathan Nicholls.  
Having noted their significant experience and 
contributions to the Board, the Committee concluded that 
they be invited to serve for a further term of office until the 
May 2017 AGM, prior to which a search for new Non-
Executive Directors will take place.
OUR PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board and Shareholders i would like to 
thank our employees for their dedication and continued 
hard work during the year.
i would also like to welcome Christian Horn to SiG as its 
new Group Operations Director, a role which sits on the 
Group’s Executive Committee. Christian joined SiG in 
December 2015 and was previously Senior Vice President 
for Staples Europe.
DIVIDEND
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.91p per 
ordinary share. Taken together with the interim dividend 
of 1.69p per ordinary share, this provides a total dividend 
of 4.60p per ordinary share for the year (2014: 4.40p), an 
increase of 4.5%.
Going forward the Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy while maintaining a dividend 
cover of 2-3x on an underlying basis over the medium-
term.

Chief Executive’s Statement
2015 PERFORMANCE
Having been adversely affected by weak trading 
conditions in Mainland Europe and the UK RMi market,  
together with a significant deterioration in the Euro, we 
were disappointed in the Group’s 2015 performance.
Group sales from continuing operations increased by 
3.7% in constant currency but were down 1.4% in 
Sterling. With acquisitions contributing 3.4% to revenue 
growth, on a like-for-like (“LFL”) basis, sales were 
marginally ahead, by 0.3%.
Underlying profit before tax decreased by 11.8% to 
£87.4m (2014: £99.1m), although on a constant currency 
basis was only down by 7.0%. 
We continue to make good progress on our Strategic 
initiatives to improve business performance, delivering 
an incremental net benefit after costs of £12.6m in 2015, 
mainly sourced from procurement. 
SiG’s post-tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”), our 
key financial metric, decreased by 110bps to 9.3% (2014: 
10.4%) in 2015 mainly due to weaker trading conditions. 
Going forward SiG remains committed to increasing 
its returns on capital. As well as taking a disciplined 
approach to its capital management, SiG seeks to achieve 
this target through further improvements in its gross and 
operating margins.
STRONGER TOGETHER
Historically SiG’s businesses have tended to operate 
independently of one another, like a loose federation. in 
addition, following a period of underspend during the 
economic downturn, we also needed to reinvest in our 
asset base and people.
To address these challenges, and improve the way we 
work, two years ago the Group launched its Stronger 
Together culture change programme with the aim of  
making SiG’s whole greater than the sum of the parts. 
This programme also underpins the delivery of our Strategic 
initiatives to improve business performance where we have 
targeted £30m of net savings to be achieved by 2016. 
By working together more and better leveraging our 
buying power and Group synergies, we have delivered a 
total cumulative net saving of £22.7m from the Strategic 
initiatives since the programme began, and are well ahead 
of our original schedule. 
However, there is more to do and we are targeting to 
achieve at least another £10m incremental net benefit 
from the Strategic initiatives in 2016.
OUTLOOK
This year the Group continues to expect good growth in 
the UK new build construction market, primarily driven 
by the residential segment. Lead indicators also suggest 
that demand should pick up in the UK RMi sector as 2016 
progresses.   
in Mainland Europe, while the trajectory of any recovery at 
this stage remains uncertain, trading conditions in France 
have improved, with the housing market stabilising and a 
return to growth for SiG in Q4 2015.   
Following an encouraging start to the year, with positive 
LFLs in both the UK & ireland and Mainland Europe, the 
scope for further cost savings and growth opportunities 
within the Group mean that it expects to make progress in 
2016.

The Group’s position as a specialist means it is able to provide 
customers with a more comprehensive product range than a 
typical general builders’ merchant. Furthermore, with environmental 
regulations becoming more complex and onerous, customers 
are increasingly reliant upon the expert advice only a specialist 
distributor such as SiG can provide.
Value added sales
in addition to growing its core distribution 
businesses, SiG is increasingly focusing on 
developing its value added sales offering, 
which it defines as products that are own label 
or where SiG controls the design, fabrication 
or component assembly. These products are 
typically higher margin and are increasingly 
being demanded by customers, as they save 
them time, money and reduce risk. Value added 
sales now account for 18% of Group revenues, 
and are growing rapidly, up from 14% in 2014.

This meant that SiG was not fully 
leveraging its size in the marketplace 
and had a long tail of suppliers. 
PROGRESS
SiG has transformed its procurement 
function by increasing co-ordination 
across the Group and investing in 
people, training and resources. 
Category management is now fully 
embedded in the Group and is 
business as usual. Purchasing is now 
the responsibility of procurement 
professionals and is conducted 
through six international category 
forums covering roofing, ceilings, 
technical insulation, structural 
insulation, air handling and dry lining. 
This has enabled SiG to consolidate 
volumes and better leverage its size. 
BENEFITS
SiG has delivered a net cumulative 
saving of £22.7m from its Strategic 
initiatives over the last two years, 
mainly sourced from procurement. 
The Group has also reduced its 
supplier numbers by 48% since 
2013, meaning that the Group 
has exceeded its target of a 33% 
reduction by the end of 2015. 
SiG is also making good progress 
towards its target of growing sales 
of its own label products by 50% by 
the end of 2016, having increased its 
own-label sales by 42% since 2013. 
TARGETED SAVINGS
The Group is seeking an additional 
£10m net savings in 2016, with 
further efficiencies thereafter.

Supply Chain
HISTORICAL POSITION
SiG’s supply chain is reflective of the 
way it has historically operated as a 
loose federation of businesses, with 
responsibility for logistics and stock 
being held at a local level.
While this approach has served SiG 
well in the past, and met the majority 
of its customers’ needs, the Group’s 
operating practices are expensive 
and have become outdated. 
Taking an ‘all in cost’, SiG spends 
around 11% of its sales on property, 
delivery, labour and warehousing.
Furthermore, the Group also needs 
to address changing demands of 
its customers, who are increasingly 
asking for a broader product range, 
often requiring deliveries from 
multiple locations.
PROGRESS SO FAR
SiG has conducted a thorough review 
of its supply chain, concluding that 
its model would see a shift towards 
Regional Distribution Centres 
(“RDCs”).  
RDCs would manage the inbound 
supply of products and take 
ownership for co-ordinating the 
majority of our customer deliveries 
direct to site. 
The role of the branch would change 
and become more focused on serving 
collect customers.
However, before moving to this model 
the Group needs to take into account 
the practical considerations of its 
existing network, such as existing 
property leases, and the availability 
and investment requirements of new 
RDCs. 
Moving to a fully integrated RDC 
model requires careful planning and 
execution.
Therefore, SiG has decided to adopt 
a two-step supply chain strategy. 
This will maximise returns whilst 
minimising risk.
The first step is centred around 
utilising the Group’s existing network 
and moving towards a hub and 
spoke model. The role of SiG’s larger 
branches will be expanded, with  
logistics professionals co-ordinating 
stock and deliveries for the region.
The second step involves trialling 
RDCs in its main markets. This will 
enable the Group to get a better 
understanding of the key capabilities 
essential to underpinning its future 
supply chain.
TARGETED SAVINGS
The Group is targeting annual savings 
of at least £20m from this first step of 
the programme by 2018.
Assuming the RDC trials are 
successful, SiG believes it could 
secure an additional £30m in savings 
from step two of this strategy.
SiG HAS BEEN WORKiNG 
ON PLANS TO iMPROVE 
iTS SUPPLY CHAiN OVER 
THE PAST 12 MONTHS, 
HAViNG iDENTiFiED 
iT AS THE NEXT AREA 
OF FOCUS AFTER 
PROCUREMENT. 
TIl BURG
SiG has successfully been operating an RDC 
in Tilburg, The Netherlands for the last three 
years.
Suppliers deliver into this one location and 
customer deliveries are planned and executed 
using outsourced third-party hauliers. 
Local branches therefore do not have to 
worry about checking that they have enough 
stock, transport or drivers to meet delivery 
requirements. 
instead they are able to focus on understanding 
their customers’ needs and selling products. 
This gives customers better service and a more 
consistent and reliable delivery experience.
in addition, this has enabled the Group to 
reduce its cost to serve by 2% and stock days 
by a third in The Netherlands.
The next step is to trial this model in the 
Group’s larger markets.

Value Added Sales
Air handling
Air Handling covers the Ventilation section of the Heating, 
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (“HVAC”) market. 
it is an attractive market which suits specialist distribution, 
is worth an estimated €6–8bn and is growing at c.3-5% 
per annum, outperforming the general construction sector. 
There are strong demand drivers which are similar to the 
Group’s insulation and Energy Management business 
such as energy efficiency and legislation, leading to higher 
value products and systems, increasing focus on indoor 
air quality to improve comfort and health, and better fire 
protection and smoke control.
There is also a trend towards the design and supply of 
complete system solutions, which a specialist like SiG 
is well positioned to fulfil, particularly through its recent 
acquisition of HC Groep.
There are three elements to SiG’s air handling proposition:
Distribution, where SiG is a ‘one stop shop’ for the 
specialist contractor, with a broad product range and the 
provision of technical advice;
Projects, where SiG designs and delivers complete 
system solutions based on customer specifications, taking 
into account the latest environmental regulations; and 
Services, which is the smallest of the three strands and 
is related to Projects. Following the commissioning of the 
installed equipment, SiG will provide maintenance and 
repair services. 
SiG Air Handling has grown rapidly over recent years and 
on a pro forma basis including full year contributions from 
recently acquired businesses, now has sales of c.€250m.
SiG iS FOCUSED ON GROWiNG iTS VALUE ADDED SALES 
OFFERiNG. THiS iS DEFiNED AS PRODUCTS WHiCH ARE 
OWN LABEL OR WHERE SiG CONTROLS THE DESiGN, 
FABRiCATiON OR COMPONENT ASSEMBLY.
They are higher margin than the Group’s distribution businesses and are products that are 
increasingly being demanded by customers, as they save them time, money and reduce their 
risk. Value added sales now account for 18% of Group revenues, and are growing rapidly, up 
from 14% in 2014.
Air Handling and Offsite Construction are two examples of businesses that sell a high 
proportion of value added sales.
Value Added Sales
To support this strategy, in September 2015, SiG 
acquired the HC Groep B.V., a specialist Air Handling 
systems provider based in The Netherlands with annual 
revenues of c.€45m. This acquisition will enhance SiG’s 
customer proposition by extending its product and 
system offering, including climate ceilings, car park and 
tunnel ventilation, plus adding new service capabilities. 
hC GROEP CASE STUDy
The Group’s vision for its  
Air handling business is: 
 1  to build a leading position in Europe by 
growing organically and by consolidating a 
fragmented market;
 2  to achieve €400m of sales by 2018, increasing 
project offering and own-label sales 
components; and
 3  to further increase current operating  
margin of 7-8%.

16 Offsite Construction
Offsite Construction is the pre-assembly of building 
products in a factory environment for onsite installation. it 
is generally a faster, cheaper and lower risk alternative to 
traditional building methods.
This market is rapidly growing in response to customer 
demand, with a compound annual growth rate of 16% per 
annum since 2008.
SiG has three businesses which together provide a single 
offsite construction proposition. They are:
 Æ Insulshell, which designs, assembles and installs 
insulated panels and, increasingly, complete modular 
units; 
 Æ RoofSpace, which designs, assembles and installs 
panelised roofing systems for residential properties; 
and 
 Æ Metechno*, which designs and assembles modular 
and flat-pack washroom solutions.
Offsite Construction shares a common customer base and 
end markets with the Group’s distribution businesses, and 
uses products that are supplied by other SiG businesses.
*acquired in 2016
To be successful in this market, businesses need to be 
able to provide a full service offering and have strong 
customer relationships, all of which SiG already has in 
place. 
it also requires significant technological and design 
expertise, in which each of SiG’s offsite businesses have 
invested heavily.
Offsite Construction enhances the Group’s value added 
proposition and provides the Group with a higher margin 
and return on capital than its distribution businesses.
SiG has set demanding goals for this business and is 
targeting to grow sales to at least £150m by 2018, and 
beyond that in future years.

Although the Strategic initiatives added 50bps 
to SiG’s gross margin in 2015, weak trading 
conditions, which particularly impacted the 
Group’s higher margin UK Exteriors business, 
changes in product mix and competitive 
pressures offset this improvement, resulting in 
the Group’s gross margin declining by 10bps to 
26.8% (2014: 26.9%).
Despite the protective measures undertaken, 
gross margin being 10bps lower than the 
prior year fell slightly short of the continuous 
improvement target set for 2015.
The operating margin for the Group decreased 
by 50bps when compared to the prior year. 
This was due to an 11.2% decline in operating 
profit as a result of the weak trading conditions 
and the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate 
movements.
in order to provide the required infrastructure 
to support the continued organic growth of the 
business, the Group has invested in a number 
of initiatives and new branch openings, which 
increased the Group’s operating costs by £5.0m 
year-on-year.
On a statutory basis, the Group’s operating 
margin increased by 60bps to 2.6% (2014: 
2.0%).

2015:
73%
The Group recorded a working capital to sales 
ratio of 9.1% in 2015 (2014: 8.0%). The ratio was 
slightly in excess of the target of no more than 
9% due to the lower overall sales volumes in the 
third quarter combined with a relatively strong 
final quarter.
The Group recorded a post-tax ROCE of 9.3% 
in 2015, 110bps below prior year (10.4%) and 
170bps below the 2015 target (11.0%) but 
220bps above WACC (7.1%). 
Assuming a full year contribution from 
acquisitions completed in the year, ROCE would 
have been 40bps higher.
Going forward SiG is committed to increasing 
ROCE. SiG seeks to achieve this by taking a 
disciplined approach to capital management and 
by further improvements in gross and operating 
margins.
SiG performed its second Group-wide employee 
engagement survey during 2015. Overall, 78% of 
employees took part in the survey (81% in 2014), 
with 76% participation in UK & ireland and 80% in 
Mainland Europe. 
Of the responses, 73% of all employees reported as 
“being engaged” (2014: 74%), which aligns to industry 
benchmarks, although slightly below the prior year target 
of maintaining the overall level of engagement. in a year 
of significant change for SiG, this is a positive result. 
Following the survey, working groups have been 
established at Group and local level. Group-wide 
actions are focusing on the key areas of connecting 
our people with the Group’s strategy and goals, and 
communicating successes as part of recognising 
people’s achievements. Local teams are acting to 
improve employee engagement within their respective 
branches and departments by responding to local 
drivers of engagement.

Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties
Risk management involves the identification and evaluation of risks and is the responsibility of the Group Board. The 
Group’s ability to manage risk is continually improving through the focus on risk management capability to ensure that it 
remains robust and that emerging risks are identified, assessed and managed effectively. 
The risk management process incorporates both top-down and bottom-up elements to the identification, evaluation 
and management of risks, and all risks evaluated are referenced to the achievement of the Group’s Strategic 
initiatives. Risks are continually evaluated using consistent measurement criteria. Mitigating controls are identified and 
opportunities for the enhancement of the Group’s control environment are implemented. 
Further information on the Group’s risk management procedures is included in the Corporate Governance section on 
pages 64 to 66. 
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on SiG’s long-term 
performance. The risk identification, monitoring and reporting framework together with the key risks and uncertainties 
identified as part of the Group’s risk management process are as follows: 
2015 DEVELOPMENTS

integrated approach to its risk and assurance activities. 
Specifically, the following improvements have been 
implemented: 
 Æ continued review of the internal control and risk 
framework; 
 Æ review of risk management software to help improve 
risk identification and drive consistency;
 Æ external review of fraud risk management framework 
including fraud awareness policies and controls;
 Æ delivery of risk management and fraud awareness 
training across the Group to help confirm a consistent 
approach in embedding risk and fraud awareness

Our performance
STUART MITChEll Chief Executive
Revenues from continuing operations decreased 1.4% 
to £2,566.4m (2014: £2,602.9m), having been adversely 
affected by foreign exchange translation, with the average 
Euro to Sterling exchange rate depreciating by 10.9% 
to €1.383 in 2015 from €1.247 in 2014. Group sales 
increased 3.7% in constant currency and were ahead 
by 0.3% on a like-for-like (“LFL”) basis, with acquisitions 
contributing 3.4% to revenue growth.
SiG experienced product price inflation of 0.5% and a 
0.2% volume decrease in 2015. SiG estimates that its 
overall market, weighted according to the sectors in which 
it operates, declined by 1.3% in the period, corresponding 
to an outperformance of 1.6% by the Group.
in UK & ireland revenues from continuing operations 
increased 5.7% to £1,412.9m (2014: £1,336.2m), and 
were up 1.5% on a LFL basis, with the UK up 0.8% and 
ireland ahead by 12.7%.   
Sales in Mainland Europe from continuing operations 
decreased 8.9% to £1,153.5m (2014: £1,266.7m), mainly 
due to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a LFL 
basis sales in Mainland Europe fell by 0.9% for the year, 
but showed an improved performance in Q4, increasing 
by 1.8%.
The Group continues to make good progress on its 
Strategic initiatives to improve business performance, 
delivering an incremental net benefit of £12.6m in 2015. 
This gives a total cumulative net saving of £22.7m since 
the programme began, mainly sourced from procurement, 
and is ahead of schedule. SiG continues to expect to 
achieve at least another £10m incremental net benefit in 
2016.
Although the Strategic initiatives added 50bps to 
SiG’s gross margin in 2015, weak trading conditions, 
which particularly impacted the Group’s higher margin 
UK Exteriors business, changes in product mix and 
competitive pressures offset this improvement, resulting 
in the Group’s gross margin declining by 10bps to 26.8% 
(2014: 26.9%).   
Underlying operating profit declined 11.2% to £98.7m 
(2014: £111.2m) having been impacted by movements 
in foreign exchange rates and weak trading conditions, 
with underlying operating margin declining 50bps to 3.8% 
(2014: 4.3%). Underlying net finance costs decreased 
slightly to £11.3m (2014: £12.1m), which together with 
the decline in operating profit resulted in underlying profit 
before tax decreasing 11.8% to £87.4m (2014: £99.1m). 
Despite benefiting from a lower tax rate underlying basic 
earnings per share from continuing operations declined by 
6.7% to 11.2p (2014: 12.0p). 
On a statutory basis profit before tax increased 31.5% 
to £51.3m (2014: £39.0m) mainly due to a reduction in 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, and the prior year 
including costs associated with the sale of businesses, 
offset by business termination costs. Basic earnings per 
share increased 8.9% to 6.1p (2014: 5.6p).
Net debt at 31 December 2015 increased to £235.9m 
(31 December 2014: £126.9m) following net acquisition 
expenditure of £75.3m (2014: £21.0m) and net capital 
expenditure (excluding one-off sale of land) of £46.3m 
(2014: £36.6m). Net capital expenditure was 1.8x 
depreciation of £26.0m (2014: £24.0m), as the Group 
reinvested in the business, particularly iT and fleet.  
       The Group continues to 
make good progress on its 
Strategic Initiatives to improve 
business performance.

Our performance CONTiNUED
ACq UISITIONS 
in 2015 SiG acquired 12 infill businesses for a gross 
cash consideration of £78.1m, together with a contingent 
consideration of up to £14.2m providing future 
performance enhances Group returns.
Five of the acquisitions were regional infills in the UK 
roofing sector and one was a specialist in the UK technical 
insulation market. Five acquisitions were geographic and 
product infills in Mainland Europe, with activities in the air 
handling, interiors and insulation sectors. The Group also 
acquired an interiors business in the Middle East.
To date in 2016 SiG has acquired a further five infill 
businesses for a gross cash consideration of £14.6m in 
the air handling, exteriors and interiors sectors.
As previously stated going forward SiG is aiming to return 
leverage to c.1.5x in the medium-term by slowing the 
pace of acquisitions and moderating capital expenditure.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Post-tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) is the 
key metric for the Group and is calculated as underlying 
operating profit less tax, divided by average net assets 
plus average net debt.   
in 2015 SiG’s ROCE decreased by 110bps to 9.3% 
(2014: 10.4%) mainly due to weaker trading conditions. 
Assuming a full year contribution from acquisitions 
completed in the year, ROCE would have been 40bps 
higher.
Going forward SiG remains committed to increasing 
ROCE. As well as taking a disciplined approach to its 
capital management, SiG seeks to achieve this through 
further improvements in its gross and operating margins.
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 
SiG continues to make good progress on its Strategic 
initiatives to improve business performance, delivering 
gross cumulative savings of £33.6m in 2015, of which 
£18.8m was in the UK & ireland and £14.8m was in 
Mainland Europe. These savings were almost all sourced 
from its procurement initiative and are ahead of the 
Group’s original schedule.   
The net cumulative benefit to the Group, after costs of 
£10.9m to deliver the programme, was £22.7m. Following 
a net benefit of £10.1m in 2014, the net incremental 
benefit to the Group of the Strategic initiatives in 2015 
was £12.6m. in constant currency the net benefit was 
£14.1m. SiG continues to expect to achieve at least 
another £10m incremental net benefit in 2016.
SUPPLY CHAIN
One of the key themes of the Group’s Capital Markets 
Day in November 2015 was the reshaping of SiG’s supply 
chain by centralising supplier and customer deliveries to 
larger branches or Regional Distribution Centres (“RDCs”).  
in order to maximise returns whilst minimising risk to 
the business, SiG set out a two-step strategy to achieve 
these savings, with the first step involving a move to 
regional hubs utilising the Group’s existing network where 
possible. SiG is targeting £20m savings from this first 
step, with a resulting exceptional charge of c.£10m.
in the UK, the Group’s Exteriors business is currently 
rolling out its hub and spoke model with a target 
completion date of the end of Q2 2016. SiG Distribution 
is finalising plans to deliver the cultural and behavioural 
change programme that underpins its change plan and 
is rolling out improved functionality of the new K8 ERP 
system in forecasting, replenishment and warehouse 
management.
A Group-wide review of transport planning has also 
commenced to secure savings through improved vehicle 
scheduling and routing.
The second step of the Group’s supply chain strategy is 
to trial RDCs, potentially working with third-party logistics 
providers. SiG is on track to open three new RDCs this 
year in the UK, France and ireland.

AIR HANDLING
The Group’s first significant move into air handling came 
through the acquisition of Air Trade Centre in 2007, with 
the rationale being that this is an adjacent specialist 
distribution market, with similar environmental drivers as 
SiG’s insulation and energy management business.  
The business has grown rapidly over recent years, and 
increased sales by 17% in 2015 to €214m. On a pro 
forma basis, including full year contributions from the infill 
acquisitions the Group made in H2 2015 and January 
2016, sales in this division would be c.€250m.
SiG is targeting sales of at least €400m by 2018, mainly 
through organic growth, with an operating margin in the 
range of 7-8%. in doing so the Group is aiming to increase 
its project offering of designing and delivering complete 
system solutions to customers.
OFFSITE CONSTRUCTION
The Group has three businesses, insulshell, RoofSpace 
and Metechno (acquired 2016), which together provide a 
compelling single offsite construction proposition.  
The segment of the offsite market which SiG is targeting 
is already worth over £1bn and is fast growing, having 
increased at a compound annual rate of 16% since 
2008. This is due to strong customer demand drivers 
as traditional construction methods are displaced. 
Furthermore, it has the same customer base and end-
markets as SiG’s distribution businesses, and uses 
products that are supplied from the rest of the Group.  
The Group is aiming to increase sales to at least £150m 
by 2018, with a double-digit operating margin, and is 
targeting a number one position in each of its markets.

Sales from continuing operations in the UK increased

of revenues in the period. Excluding acquisitions, on a LFL 
basis sales were ahead 0.8%.
The private new build residential sector was the strongest 
segment of the UK construction market in 2015, up 7.0% 
compared to prior year according to the Construction 
Products Association (“CPA”). SiG continues to expect 
robust growth in this sector in 2016, although the rate of 
expansion is likely to slow somewhat compared to 2015, 
with the CPA forecasting a growth rate of 5.0%.
in contrast the UK Repairs, Maintenance and 
improvement (“RMi”) residential sector was challenging 
during 2015, particularly in the second half of the year. 
This adversely affected the Group’s Exteriors business, 
which has a relatively high exposure to this segment of the 
market, recording a LFL sales decline of 2.9% in the year, 
and down by 4.3% in H2 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT
27 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
Our performance CONTiNUED
SiG believes that the weakness in the UK RMi market is 
correlated, with a time lag, with housing transactions and 
mortgage approvals, which declined during 2014 and 
into the first quarter of 2015. Since then transactions and 
approval rates have begun to recover, suggesting that the 
UK RMi market is likely to pick up as 2016 progresses.
SiGD’s LFL sales were up 2.1% despite increased 
competition in the UK insulation and interiors market 
during 2015, particularly in more commoditised product 
areas. in order to improve performance in this market the 
Group has taken a number of actions aimed at further 
increasing its customer focus, and is already benefiting 
from these changes.
The Group’s outlook for the UK market in 2016 is positive, 
with growth expected to continue to be driven by the 
residential sector, particularly in new build. While trading 
conditions in the non-residential sector are improving, SiG 
has not yet benefited from this growth mainly due to its 
later cycle exposure. Assuming this continues, the Group 
anticipates that this should start to feed through into its 
sales performance during 2016. The CPA is forecasting an 
increase in UK building output of 2.9% in 2016.
SiG recorded a very strong performance in ireland in 2015 
with LFL sales up 12.7% and gross margin ahead by 
150bps. However, having been adversely affected by the 
weakening Euro, sales in Sterling were only up 1.5%. The 
Group’s growth was driven by a recovering irish residential 
market, along with some more limited recovery in activity 
in the non-residential sector. Euroconstruct expects this 
strong recovery to continue in 2016.

France
Although sales in France decreased by 2.8% on a LFL 
basis, and were down by 11.7% in Sterling due to 
movements in foreign exchange, SiG outperformed the 
market by 2.1%. 
The French construction market remained challenging 
during 2015, with the residential market, to which the 
Group has a high exposure, accounting for 61% of 
revenues, particularly weak. Activity in the non-residential 
sector also continued to decline, although not to the same 
degree as the housing market.  
There were signs that French market conditions were 
beginning to improve towards the end of 2015, with SiG 
recording LFL sales growth of 2.5% in Q4. This was the 
Group’s first positive LFL quarterly performance in France 
since Q1 2014. Furthermore, new housing starts have 
stabilised at around 350,000 on a rolling twelve month 
basis, following double-digit declines earlier in the year.
Given the improving housing data and a return to growth 
for SiG, the outlook for France is more positive although 
the trajectory of any recovery remains uncertain at this 
early stage. Euroconstruct is forecasting a strong bounce 
back in the French construction market in 2016, with total 
building output expected to increase by 5.2%.

Germany & austria
Sales in Germany & Austria decreased by 2.3% on a LFL 
basis and were down 10.7% in Sterling.  
While the new build residential sector was the strongest 
performing market in Germany, increasing by 5.5%, this 
sector only accounts for 13% of SiG’s sales in the country.
SiG has a high exposure to the weaker non-residential 
and industrial sectors in Germany, which account for 
76% of revenues. in particular SiG’s technical insulation 
business, VTi, was adversely affected by the challenging 
trading conditions in the industrial sector, with LFL sales 
declining by 7.8%.  
LFL sales in WeGo, the Group’s interior and structural 
insulation business, decreased 1.5% in the year. This 
compares to a 1.8% decline in the non-residential market, 
according to Euroconstruct.
Looking ahead to 2016, Euroconstruct is forecasting a 
1.9% increase in building output in Germany, with the 
residential sector (up 2.3%) again outperforming the non-
residential market (up 1.2%).
Benelux
Sales in Benelux (which includes Air Trade Centre) were up 
5.1% and by 7.8% on a LFL basis. While the construction 
market in Belgium remains challenging in both the 
residential and non-residential sectors, The Netherlands 
continued to improve. This was led by growth in the 
residential sector, with the non-residential market, which 
had been in decline for a number of years, now stable.   
For 2016 Euroconstruct is forecasting continued good 
growth in The Netherlands, with building output up by 
4.8%, but Belgium continuing to be relatively weak, with 
output increasing by only 0.6%.
poland
in Poland, following a challenging 2014, when LFL sales 
decreased 5.7%, the construction market recovered in 
2015, with SiG recording a LFL sales growth of 2.3% and 
by 4.2% in the second half of the year. However, following 
a 160bps improvement last year, gross margin fell back by 
30bps mainly due to changes in sales mix.
Euroconstruct expect the recovery in the Polish market to 
continue in 2016 and is forecasting a growth rate of 3.6%.
GROUP OUTLOOK
This year the Group continues to expect good growth in 
the UK new build construction market, primarily driven 
by the residential segment. Lead indicators also suggest 
that demand should pick up in the UK RMi sector as 2016 
progresses.   
in Mainland Europe, while the trajectory of any recovery at 
this stage remains uncertain, trading conditions in France 
have improved, with the housing market stabilising and a 
return to growth for SiG in Q4 2015.   
Following an encouraging start to the year, with positive 
LFLs in both the UK & ireland and Mainland Europe, the 
scope for further cost savings and growth opportunities 
within the Group mean that it expects to make progress in 
2016.

OVERVIEW
The Group has made good progress in the delivery of its 
Strategic initiatives despite difficult market conditions, 
and has continued to successfully implement its infill 
acquisition programme. The Group has exceeded its 
stated objective of delivering a cumulative net benefit of 
£20m through its Strategic initiatives programme in 2015, 
and acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 added an additional 
£8.8m of operating profit compared to 2014.
in a year that saw challenging market conditions, 
particularly in the second half, a ROCE of 9.3% (2014: 
10.4%) falls some way short of SiG’s target, which was for 
ROCE to exceed 11% in 2015. However, ROCE remains 
comfortably ahead of SiG’s Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (“WACC”), which for the year ended 31 December 
2015 was 7.1%, and therefore creates economic profit for 
Shareholders.
REVENUE 
Group sales from continuing operations fell in Sterling by 
1.4%, but increased 3.7% on a constant currency basis. 
The incremental impact of acquisitions made in the current 
and prior year contributed 3.4% of this sales growth in the 
year; excluding 2015 and 2014 acquisitions the Group’s 
sales on a constant currency basis were up 0.3%. 
The weighted number of trading days in the year ended 31 
December 2015 had no impact compared to the prior year. 
Total Group sales in Sterling fell by 2.6% to £2,566.4m 
(2014: £2,633.9m).

SiG estimates that overall its markets contracted by 
c.1.3% in 2015. Given that the Group achieved a like-
for-like constant currency sales growth of 0.3%, this 
equates to a market outperformance of c.1.6%. This has 
been achieved against a backdrop of strong competition 
in SiG’s core markets in 2015. in delivering this 
outperformance, the Group has opened a further seven 
branches in high-potential locations (2014: nine openings), 
three in the UK & ireland, two in Germany and one each in 
France and Belgium. As part of its Supply Chain initiative, 
the Group also closed 16 branches in 2015, ten in the UK, 
four in Germany and two in Poland.

The Group’s underlying gross profit margin at 26.8% was 
down 10bps on the prior year (2014: 26.9%), with the UK 
& ireland down 10bps and Mainland Europe marginally 
ahead of prior year. The Group’s Procurement Strategic 
initiative delivered significant benefit in the year and was 
instrumental in protecting gross margins against strong 
pricing competition in many of SiG’s core markets. 
Maximising returns remains a fundamental component 
of SiG’s strategy. SiG intends to continue to target gross 
margin improvement through further development of its 
Procurement initiative, reshaping of its Supply Chain and 
greater focus on value added sales.

Underlying operating costs increased by £0.3m (0.1%) in 
2015; on a constant currency basis, underlying operating 
costs increased by £31.0m (5.3%).
The biggest impact on operating costs in the year has 
come from the movement in foreign exchange rates, 
which have reduced costs in Sterling by £30.7m. During 
the year SiG has continued to invest in its branch network 
and other local initiatives (£5.0m), acquisitions (£14.3m) 
and Strategic initiatives (£2.1m). The Group’s incentive 
charge has fallen by £10.6m in 2015. The lower sales 
volumes experienced in 2015 have also reduced variable 
costs by £4.7m.
The Group has continued to review its operational 
efficiency in 2015, including a comprehensive review 
of its Supply Chain in the United Kingdom, France and 
Germany, and has initiated actions which are expected to 
deliver annualised cost savings of c.£5.4m with associated 
restructuring costs of £8.3m. Approximately £4.3m of 
these savings are expected to be realised in 2016. 
The Group’s bad debt charge on an underlying basis 
(being both bad debts written off and the movement 
in the allowance for bad and doubtful debts) was 
maintained at 0.3% of sales (2014: 0.3% of sales), an 
exceptional performance in difficult trading conditions. 
This is testament to the quality and strength of our credit 
control teams and the Group’s credit control policies and 
procedures, supported by credit insurance policies where 
appropriate.
Taking into account the factors noted above, the Group 
experienced operating cost inflation in the year of 2.1%. 
OTHER ITEMS 
in order to provide an indication of its continuing earnings, 
the Group separately identifies “Other items” on the face 
of its Consolidated income Statement. These items are

Financial Review CONTiNUED
Amounts reported in the “Other items” column of the 
Consolidated income Statement, which in total amounted 
to a loss before tax of £36.1m (2014: £60.1m), are as 
follows: 
 Æ Amortisation of acquired intangibles – £10.3m 
(2014: £19.6m). intangible amortisation is expected 
to vary significantly over time, and is dependent upon 
the number and value of acquisitions made by the 
Company over time. The Statement of Significant 
Accounting Policies section on page 108 and Note 12 
to the Accounts on page 129 provide details of what is 
included within intangible assets and over what periods 
the assets are amortised; 
 Æ Profits and losses on sale of businesses and 
associated impairment charges – £nil (2014: £14.0m). 
The non-recurring charge in 2014 was recognised 
in respect of the divestment of the Group’s German 
Roofing, Miller Pattison and ice Energy operating 
businesses;
 Æ Net operating losses attributable to businesses 
divested in 2014 – £nil (2014: £6.7m). The 2014 results 
of German Roofing, Miller Pattison and ice Energy were 
reported as “Other items” on the basis of their non-
recurring nature; 
 Æ Acquisition expenses (£1.9m) and contingent 
consideration (£12.4m) - £14.3m (2014: £3.9m). 
Acquisition expenses and contingent consideration 
linked to employment contracts vary depending on the 
number, size and future profitability of acquisitions;
 Æ Restructuring costs – £8.3m (2014: £9.2m). The 
Group has taken a number of actions during the year 
to improve the efficiency of its fixed cost base. These 
one-off actions have resulted in redundancy costs of 
£0.9m (2014: £3.9m), property closure costs of £4.6m 
(2014: £3.1m), rebranding of £0.2m (2014: £2.2m) and 
supply chain consultancy costs of £2.6m (2014: £nil);
 Æ Other one-off items – credit of £0.1m (2014: charge 
of £4.6m). Other one-off items include operating 
losses and closure costs associated with the Group’s 
operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of £3.6m 
(2014: £1.0m), fair value losses on fuel hedging 
contracts of £0.4m (2014: £nil), and income from the 
sale of land of £1.1m (following the related impairment 
charge in 2014 of £6.1m). They also include credits 
arising on the discounting of provisions of £nil (2014: 
£0.5m), the reversal of property provisions of £2.4m 
(2014: £1.6m) previously provided through “Other 
items” whereby the Group has negotiated the surrender 
of the leases in 2015, and other one-off credits of 
£0.6m (2014: £0.4m); and 
 Æ Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial 
instruments and unwinding of provision discounting 
– £3.3m (2014: £2.1m). The finance costs section below 
explains these items in more detail.

On an underlying basis, operating profit decreased by 
£12.5m (11.2%) to £98.7m (2014: £111.2m). Foreign 
exchange rate movements decreased the Group’s 
operating profit by £5.1m year-on-year. Therefore, on 
a constant currency basis underlying operating profit 
decreased by £7.4m.
Acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2014 made 
a contribution of £10.4m to operating profit in the year 
(2014: £1.6m).

Overall, the Group’s underlying operating profit margin at 
3.8% was 50bps lower than the prior year (2014: 4.3%). 
Given the operational gearing of the business, with the 
majority of operating costs being fixed, it is envisaged that 
operating margins will improve as the Group’s sales grow. 
The Group recorded a statutory operating profit of £65.9m 
(2014: £53.2m) after recognising a number of “Other 
items” that are described above.
FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs on a statutory basis increased by £0.4m 
to £14.6m in 2015 (2014: £14.2m).
Net finance costs included in the “Other items” column of 
the Consolidated income Statement amounted to £3.3m 
(2014: £2.1m).

32 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
Following the Group’s equity issuance in H1 2009 and 
the subsequent reduction in the Group’s level of net debt, 
SiG cancelled certain interest rate derivative contracts at 
a cash cost of £32.2m. This termination payment did not 
increase the Group’s overall level of debt as this payment 
cancelled the mark-to-market liability already included in 
the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amounts 
previously recorded in reserves are being amortised 
through the Consolidated income Statement over the life 
of the associated debt to 2018 in line with the relevant 
accounting standards. The amortisation included within 
the “Other items” column amounted to £1.9m (2014: 
£2.0m). The remaining balance recorded in reserves 
in relation to the settlement of interest rate derivative 
contracts, which is to be amortised in the Consolidated 
income Statement over a period of three years, is £3.6m 
(2014: £5.5m). 
in February 2014 the Group cancelled a further two 
interest rate derivative contracts that swapped floating 
rate debt into fixed rate debt at a cash cost of £2.0m. 
The amounts previously recorded in reserves are being 
amortised through the Consolidated income Statement 
as an underlying item over the life of the associated 
debt to 2018 as this cancellation reflects the ongoing 
management of the Group’s interest rate hedging policy. 
The amount amortised in 2015 was £0.4m (2014: £0.3m).
Also included within finance costs is a credit of less than 
£0.1m (2014: £0.1m) relating to hedge ineffectiveness 
incurred on the Group’s financial instruments and a charge 
of £1.5m in respect of unwinding of provision discounting 
(2014: £0.2m). £1.4m of the unwinding of provision 
discounting has been included within “Other items” 
to reflect the fact that the related provisions are non-
underlying in their nature.
Net finance costs before gains and losses on derivative 
financial instruments, unwinding of provision discounting 
and financing items relating to defined benefit pension 
schemes (i.e. net borrowing costs) decreased by £1.1m to 
£10.1m in 2015 (2014: £11.2m).
Further details of SiG’s interest rate policies are provided 
in the interest rate risk section on page 37.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Underlying profit before tax decreased by £11.7m, or 
11.8%, to £87.4m (2014: £99.1m). On a constant currency 
basis, underlying profit before tax decreased by £6.9m to 
£92.2m. 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax increased by £12.3m 
to £51.3m (2014: £39.0m).
TAXATION
The Group’s approach to tax matters is to comply with all 
relevant tax laws and regulations, wherever it operates, 
while managing its overall tax burden. The Group seeks 
to pay the correct amount of taxes due, both direct and 
indirect, in accordance with the laws of the territories in 
which it operates.
The Group takes appropriate advice from reputable 
professional advisers to ensure compliance with 
applicable rules and regulations, and to consider potential 
mitigating actions in order to manage tax risks. The Group 
seeks to be transparent in its dealings with local tax 
authorities; where differences of opinion do arise, these 
are dealt with in a professional, co-operative manner. 
The Board has overall responsibility for managing and 
controlling risk, including tax risk, within the Group. The 
Group has a Tax and Treasury Committee that provides 
regular updates to the Board, and this enables the Board 
to consider the tax implications of significant strategic 
decisions on a timely basis.
The Group recorded an income tax charge on underlying 
profits from continuing operations amounting to £21.0m 
(2014: £27.8m), which represents an underlying effective 
rate of 24.0% (2014: 28.1%). Excluding the effect of prior 
year credits, the effective tax rate was 24.8%. On the 
statutory profit before tax of £51.3m (2014: £39.0m), the 
income tax charge of £15.0m (2014: £4.5m) represents an 
effective rate of 29.2% (2014: 11.5%). These differences 
arise as a result of amounts included in “Other items” in 
the year. 
Cash tax payments amounted to £11.1m, £9.9m below 
the £21.0m income tax charge on underlying profits, 
primarily as a result of the restructuring costs incurred 
in the year included within “Other items” and also the 
utilisation of the Group’s brought forward UK non-trading 
losses (c.£27m gross utilised in the year). The Group’s 
underlying effective tax rate in 2016 will be determined 
by the mix of profits from different jurisdictions. it is 
anticipated that the underlying effective tax rate in 2016 
(excluding any prior year effects) will be c.24%, due to 
the full year impact of the reduction in the UK domestic 
corporation tax headline rate to 20% from April 2015, 
and the removal of the surcharge applied to the French 
domestic corporation tax rate.

DIVIDENDS
The Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy 
while maintaining a dividend cover of 2x–3x (on an 
underlying basis) over the medium term. SiG continued 
to increase its dividend payments in 2015 with an 
interim dividend of 1.69p per share (2014: 1.42p). SiG 
has proposed a final dividend of 2.91p per share (2014: 
2.98p), taking the 2015 full year dividend to 4.60p per 
share (2014: 4.40p), representing a 4.5% increase in total 
dividend year on year. A total dividend of 4.60p represents 
a dividend cover of 2.43x in 2015 on an underlying basis. 
The Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay 
dividends for a number of years, and when required the 
Company can receive dividends from its subsidiaries to 
further increase distributable reserves.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Shareholders’ funds decreased by £15.0m to £648.7m

currency basis for continuing operations) at 31 December 
2015 was 9.1% (2014: 8.0%), 10bps above the Group’s 
target. Working capital days increased by two days to 
52 days (2014: 50 days). in part, this increase arises as a 
result of a stronger sales performance in the final quarter 
compared to the prior year.
Fixed assets
Net capital expenditure (including computer software) 
increased in the year by £16.7m to £45.2m (2014: 
£28.5m), representing a capex to depreciation ratio of 
1.74x (2014: 1.19x). Capital expenditure includes new 
vehicles, new brownfield sites, investment in plant and 
machinery and in the new UK iT platform. 
it is anticipated that the level of capital expenditure will 
be in the region of 1.0x-1.5x of depreciation in 2016, 
reflecting the Group’s continuing investment in the 
business.

As demonstrated above, fluctuations in exchange rates 
give rise to translation differences on overseas earnings 
streams when translated into Sterling. Further details of 
SiG’s foreign exchange policies are detailed in the foreign 
currency risk section on pages 37 and 38.
PENSION SCHEMES
in total, the Group operates six (2014: six) defined benefit 
pension schemes, the largest of which is a funded scheme 
held in the UK. The remaining five defined benefit pension 
schemes are unfunded book reserve schemes held in 
the Group’s Mainland European businesses. Together 
the UK defined benefit scheme and the five book reserve 
schemes are referred to as “defined benefit pension 
schemes”.
The overall gross defined benefit pension schemes’ 
liability decreased during the year by £4.9m to £23.8m 
(31 December 2014: £28.7m). This can be broken down 
as follows:

ACq UISITIONS
Acquisitions are a key component of SiG’s growth 
strategy, supplementing organic growth. A total of 
twelve acquisitions were completed in the year for a net 
consideration of £68.5m. Six of those acquisitions were 
in the United Kingdom, two were in The Netherlands 
and there were also acquisitions in France, Germany, 
Switzerland and Qatar. Consideration of £4.1m was paid 
during the year in respect of prior period acquisitions.
Contingent and deferred consideration relating to the 
2015 acquisitions not specific to employment criteria of 
£8.9m has been recognised and included within goodwill. 
Contingent consideration of £12.4m, which is in part 
conditional on the continued employment of specific 
individuals, has not been recognised as an investment 
cost but instead is accounted for as an employment cost 
in the Consolidated income Statement as earned. 
Acquisitions remain subject to strict financial return 
criteria, with all acquisitions required to achieve a post-
tax ROCE of at least 300 basis points in excess of the 
Group’s WACC in the first full year of ownership. Recently 
acquired infill businesses are performing well and meeting 
their targets, and collectively are delivering returns that are 
higher than the Group’s ROCE.
Further details of the Group’s acquisitions can be found in 
Note 13 to the Accounts on pages 130 to 132.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that 
entities in the Group will be able to continue as going 
concerns while maximising the return to Shareholders 
through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The main measure used to assess the appropriateness 
of the Group’s capital structure is its net debt to EBiTDA 
ratio (i.e. leverage), thus ensuring that the Group’s capital 
structure is aligned to the Group’s debt covenants. The 
Group’s long term target is to manage its leverage ratio 
within the range of 1.0x–1.5x. The Group’s leverage 
position at 31 December 2015 was 1.78x (31 December 
2014: 0.98x). Gearing, being net debt divided by net 
assets, increased during the year from 19.1% to 36.3%.
As at 8 March 2016, SiG’s share price closed at 
144.7p per share, representing a market capitalisation 
of £855.7m at that date. SiG monitors relative Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for assessing relative financial 
performance. This has been detailed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 96.
OUTLOOK
The Directors’ view of the outlook and prospects for the 
Group is set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement on

Treasury risk management
TREASURY RISK – INTRODUCTION
SiG’s Finance and Treasury Policies set out the Group’s 
approach to managing treasury risk. These policies are 
reviewed and approved by the Group Board on a regular 
basis. it is Group policy that no trading in financial 
instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken. 
FUNDING OF OPERATIONS
SiG finances its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits, Shareholders’ equity, bank funding, private 
placement and other borrowings. A small proportion of SiG’s 
assets are funded using fixed rate finance lease contracts. 
The Group’s net debt is made up of the 
following categories:

Obligations under finance lease 
contracts 10.0 10.5

Details of derivative financial instruments are shown in 
Note 18 to the Accounts on pages 136 to 139.
MANAGEMENT OF TREASURY RISKS
Treasury risk management incorporates liquidity risk, 
interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity 
risk, counterparty credit risk and the risk of breaching 
debt covenants. These specific risks, and the Group’s 
management of them, are detailed below.
Liquidity risk and debt facilities
Liquidity risk is the risk that SiG is unable to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due. 
in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to meet 
its financial obligations, SiG seeks a balance between 
certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective 
borrowing structure, using a mixture of sources of funding 
in order to prevent over-reliance on any single provider. 
The key sources of finance are private placement note 
investors, being mainly US-based funds, and principal 
bank debt. 
The maturity profile of the Group’s debt facilities at 31 
December 2015 is as follows:
Facility

The Group has in place a £250m committed Revolving 
Credit Facility (“RCF”) provided by its five key relationship 
banks, which matures in October 2019. This facility was 
just over one-third drawn at 31 December 2015 and 
represents the committed funding headroom of the Group. 
Maturing in November 2016 is c.£130.6m of the private 
placement notes. The Group considers it has a number of 
options with regard to the refinancing of these notes, and 
is confident that this will be achieved on similar terms to 
existing facilities.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest costs in respect of its borrowings 
will increase in the event of rising interest rates. To reduce 
this risk the Group monitors its mix of fixed and floating 
rate debt and enters into derivative financial instruments 
to manage this mix where appropriate. SiG has a policy 
of aiming to fix between 50% and 75% of its average net 
debt over the medium-term. 
in order to manage its interest exposure within this policy, 
£30m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps were entered 
into in August 2015. The percentage of net debt at fixed 
rates of interest at 31 December 2015 is 57% (2014: 72%) 
and on a gross debt basis is 55% (2014: 64%), which is 
within the Group’s targeted medium-term range. 
Foreign currency risk
income Statement
SiG has a number of overseas businesses whose 
revenues and costs are denominated in the currencies of 
the countries in which the operations are located. 48% 
of SiG’s 2015 continuing revenues (2014: 51%) were in 
foreign currencies, being primarily Euros and Polish Zloty.

Treasury risk management CONTiNUED
Less than 2% of SiG’s sales and purchases are cross-
currency. When cross-currency transactions occur, it is 
SiG’s policy to eliminate currency exposure at that time 
through forward currency contracts, if the exposure is 
considered to be material. 
SiG faces a translation risk in respect of the local 
currencies of its primary foreign operations, principally 
being Euro and Polish Zloty sales and profits. SiG does 
not hedge the income statement translational risk arising 
from these income streams. 
SiG also faces a translation risk from the US Dollar in 
respect of interest on its private placement borrowings. 
This risk has been eliminated through the use of cross 
currency swaps, which swap the US dollar private 
placement debt into Sterling. 
Balance Sheet
The Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Group is inherently 
at risk from movements in the Sterling value of its net 
investments in foreign businesses and the Sterling value 
of its foreign currency net debt. 
For currencies where the Group has significant balance 
sheet translational risk, SiG seeks to mitigate this risk 
by holding financial liabilities and derivatives in the same 
currency to partially hedge the net investment values. 
The Group’s policy is that for currencies where a material 
balance sheet translational exposure exists, the Group 
will hold financial liabilities in that particular currency in 
proportion to the overall Group ratio of net debt to capital 
employed. 
SiG had the following net debt denominated in foreign 
currencies, held partially to hedge the assets of overseas 
businesses (including cash and cash equivalents):

impact of foreign currency movements in 2015
The overall impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
on the Group’s Consolidated income Statement and 
Consolidated Balance Sheet is disclosed on page 35 
of this Strategic Report.
c ommodity risk
The nature of the Group’s operations creates an ongoing 
demand for fuel and therefore the Group is exposed to 
movements in market fuel prices. The Group enters into 
commodity derivative instruments to hedge such exposure 
where it makes commercial and economic sense to do so. 
in Q1 2015 the Group entered into four commodity 
derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the UK, 
Polish and French fuel requirements for 2015 and 2016. 
At 31 December 2015 two of these commodity derivative 
instruments had matured and two remain outstanding, 
hedging c.59% of the Group’s 2016 anticipated variable 
fuel cost. There were no commodity instruments 
outstanding at 31 December 2014.
c ounterparty credit risk
SiG holds significant investment assets, being principally 
cash deposits and derivative assets. Strict policies are 
in place in order to minimise counterparty credit risk 
associated with these assets.
A list of approved deposit counterparties is maintained. 
Counterparty credit limits, based on published credit 
ratings and CDS spreads, are in place. These limits, and the 
position against these limits, are reviewed and reported on 
a monthly basis. 
Sovereign credit ratings are also monitored, and country 
limits for investment assets are in place. if necessary, funds 
are repatriated to the UK.
debt covenants 
The Company’s debt facilities in place at 31 December 
2015 contained a number of covenants to which the Group 
must adhere. The Group’s debt covenants are tested at 30 
June and 31 December each year, with the key financial 
covenants being leverage and interest cover. 
The ratio for each of the debt covenants is set out below:
Requirement
year ended 
31 December
2015
Year ended 
31 December
2014
interest cover 
ratio* >3.0x 8.1x 8.9x
Leverage ratio^ <3.0x 1.78x 0.98x
*  Covenant interest cover is the ratio of the previous twelve months’ 
underlying operating profit (including the trading losses and profits 
associated with divested businesses) to net financing costs (excluding 
pension scheme finance income and finance costs).
^  Covenant leverage is the ratio of closing net debt (at average exchange 
rates) to the underlying operating profit before depreciation, adjusted 
if applicable for the impact of acquisitions and disposals during the 
previous twelve months (“EBiTDA”).
As can be seen in the table above, the Group is in 
compliance with its financial covenants and is forecast to 
maintain a comfortable headroom. 
The 2015 year-end leverage ratio has increased following 
net acquisition expenditure of £75.3m and as a result of 
the weaker than anticipated trading conditions during the 
year. Excluding acquisitions, leverage would have been 
less than 1.5x. Going forward SiG is aiming to return 
leverage to its target range of 1.0-1.5× by slowing the 
pace of its acquisition expenditure and moderating capital 
expenditure.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
in accordance with the requirements of the 2014 
amendments to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”), the Directors have performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. Details of the 
risk identification and management processes and a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group are included in this Strategic Report on pages 
20 to 23. The Group’s control processes are included in 
the Corporate Governance report on pages 64 to 66.
While the Board has no reason to believe the Group will 
not be viable over a longer period, it has determined 
that the three years to 31 December 2018 is the most 
appropriate time period for its viability review. This period 
reflects the forecast period for the Group’s strategic plans 
and industry forecasts. This gives the Board sufficient 
visibility of the future to make a realistic and reasonable 
assessment of longer-term viability. 
As part of the Group’s strategic planning process a three 
year business model was produced covering the period 
to December 2018. in order to assess the resilience of 
the Group to risks in severe but plausible scenarios, 
the model was subject to thorough multi-variant stress 
and sensitivity analysis, together with an assessment of 
potential mitigating actions. The resulting impact on key 
metrics, such as debt headroom and covenants, was 
considered. 
in making this statement the Directors have also made the 
following key assumptions:
 Æ The Group will be required to refinance at least a 
portion of the c.£130m of private placement notes 
that mature in November 2016, in order to provide 
the appropriate funding headroom. The Directors 
have concluded that they will be able to successfully 
refinance, on the basis of recent successful refinancing 
processes and the current and forecast position of 
bank debt and debt capital markets in 2016;
 Æ There will be no severe prolonged downturn in the 
markets in which the Group operates; and
 Æ in the event that the UK votes to leave the European 
Union, given the nature of SiG’s operations, it would 
not be expected to have a direct, material adverse 
effect on performance.
After conducting their viability review, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their 
assessment to December 2018.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
in determining whether the Group’s 2015 Annual 
Report and Accounts can be prepared on a going 
concern basis, the Directors have considered 
all factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and financial position, including cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and 
the risks and uncertainties relating to its business 
activities. These are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 1 to 40 and in the Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The key factors considered by the Directors were as 
follows:
 Æ the implications of the challenging economic 
environment and the continuing weak levels of 
market demand in the building and construction 
markets on the Group’s revenues and profits; 
 Æ projections of working capital requirements;
 Æ the impact of the competitive environment within 
which the Group’s businesses operate;
 Æ the availability and market prices of the goods that 
the Group sells;
 Æ the credit risk associated with the Group’s trade 
receivable balances;
 Æ the potential actions that could be taken in the 
event that revenues are worse than expected, to 
ensure that operating profit and cash flows are 
protected; and 
 Æ the committed finance facilities available to the 
Group and the ability of the Group to refinance the 
c.£130m of maturing private placement notes, as 
set out in the Viability Statement.
Having considered all the factors above, including 
downside sensitivities, the Directors are satisfied that 
the Group will be able to operate within the terms 
and conditions of the Group’s financing facilities, and 
have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Group continues to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Group’s 2015 Annual Report and 
Accounts.

Corporate Responsibility
The Group implements policies that include social and 
environmental issues in our decision-making process, and 
is investing in the development and wellbeing of its people 
and communities. SiG believes this approach supports the 
Group in achieving its business goals as well as growing 
shareholder value. As a constituent of the FTSE4Good 
index of socially responsible companies, SiG is pleased 
to inform stakeholders of the measures it is taking to 
continually develop its approach to CR, including how it 
monitors and improves performance reporting.
BUSINESS PRINCIPLES AND CODE  
OF ETHICS
The Group has in place Group-wide Ethics, Anti-Bribery & 
Corruption and Ethical Trading & Human Rights policies. 
These policies, which are regularly reviewed, underpin the 
Group’s CR programme and support its business integrity. 
ethics policy
SiG issues to all employees a Group-wide Ethics Policy 
which sets out the standards and behaviours that are 
expected throughout the Group’s operations. The policy 
is designed to ensure that the business conforms to the 
highest ethical standards. The policy can be viewed on 
the Company’s website (www.sigplc.com).
The policy sets out the following key principles:
 Æ To abide by the laws applicable to each country of 
operation;
 Æ Not to tolerate any kind of discrimination or 
harassment;
 Æ To be a responsible partner within local communities;
 Æ To take into account the legal and moral rights of others 
in business transactions;
 Æ To maintain a safe and healthy working environment;
 Æ To be proactive in managing responsibilities to the 
environment;
 Æ Not to knowingly make misrepresentations;
 Æ Not to make political donations;
 Æ Not to give or receive bribes;
 Æ To avoid, and in all cases report conflicts of interest; 
and
 Æ Encourage employees to report any suspected 
wrongdoing.
A confidential and independent hotline service is available 
to all employees so that they can raise any concerns they 
have about how the Group conducts its business. SiG 
believes this is an important resource which supports a 
culture of openness throughout the Group. The service 
is provided by an independent third party with a full 
investigation being carried out on all matters raised and a 
report prepared for feedback to the concerned party.
ethical t rading & Human r ights policy
The Ethical Trading & Human Rights Policy covers 
the main issues that may be encountered in relation 
to product sourcing and sets out the standards of 
professionalism and integrity which should be maintained 
by employees in all Group operations worldwide.
The policy expresses the standards concerning: safe 
and fair working conditions for employees; responsible 
management of social and environmental issues within the 
Group; and the international supply chain.
SiG promotes human rights through its employment 
policies and practices, through its supply chain and 
through the responsible use of its products and services.
There is no separate policy in place which deals 
specifically with human rights; however, SiG will keep 
under review the need for a specific human rights policy 
over and above its existing policies.
anti-Bribery & c orruption policy
SiG has a number of fundamental principles and values 
that it believes are the foundation of sound and fair 
business practice, one of which is a zero tolerance 
position on bribery and corruption. The Group’s Anti-
Bribery & Corruption Policy clearly sets out the ethical 
values required to ensure compliance with legal 
requirements within countries in which SiG and its 
subsidiary companies operate.
Anti-bribery and corruption training is provided across 
the Group to all senior management through to branch 
managers and external salespeople. This training is 
provided via our online training resource, and also 
includes modules on competition law. 
SiG values its reputation for ethical behaviour, financial 
probity and reliability. it recognises that over and above 
the commission of any crime, any involvement in bribery 
will also reflect adversely on its image and reputation.

its aim therefore is to limit its exposure to bribery and 
corruption by: 
 Æ Setting out a clear policy on anti-bribery and 
corruption; 
 Æ Training all employees so that they can recognise and 
avoid the use of bribery by themselves and others;
 Æ Encouraging employees to be vigilant and to report 
any suspicion of bribery, providing them with suitable

Modern slavery act 2015
The Modern Slavery Act came into force in 2015 and the 
requirement to publish an anti-slavery statement applies 
to companies with financial years ending on or after 31 
March 2016. SiG plc is subject to these new disclosure 
requirements for its 2016 financial year end and will 
therefore publish its anti-slavery statement in respect of 
2016 on its website (www.sigplc.com) within six months 
of the year ending 31 December 2016.
ENVIRONMENT
environmental management
SiG’s Environmental Policy and management system is 
combined with the Health and Safety management system 
to maximise the opportunities for continual improvement 
that an integrated system provides. The programme 
optimises resources to ensure that communication and 
auditing programmes are focused and targeted to support 
the business. 
The Chief Executive is the Board Director responsible for 
implementation of the Policy and is the signatory on the 
Group’s Health, Safety & Environment Policy, which is 
displayed at each location throughout the Group in the 
local language.
SiG’s management system is in its tenth year of 
accreditation with the international environment standard 
iSO14001 within SiG’s UK operations. Registration to 
the standard was successfully renewed in 2015. Having 
an externally verified management system provides 
the Group with a continuous programme of review and 
improvement for its businesses with a roll-out programme 
for new business within three months of acquisition and a 
target of full accreditation within twelve months. 
The key elements of the management system standard 
are at the heart of SiG’s approach to its Group-wide 
strategy for environmental matters which demonstrates 
the Group’s commitment to environmental management 
and best practice.
SiG maintains its Environmental Aspects and impacts 
Register and Corporate Environmental Risk Assessment 
to record and assess the principal environmental hazards 
within the Group. These evaluations formed part of the 
2015 Management Review process for each business.
The Group has continued its excellent record of legal 
compliance and environmentally sound operations 
throughout 2015 with no prosecutions or actions from the 
authorities.
The emphasis for the Group’s environmental objectives 
for 2015 are derived from its Low Carbon Business Policy, 
which sets out its aim to reduce the amount of fuel, energy 
and water consumption as well as reduce the waste it 
produces. The progress made by the business is covered 
in this report.
c arbon management
The Chief Executive is responsible for the Group’s 
environmental performance and for the Group’s Low 
Carbon Policy.
SiG’s carbon footprint accounting process has been 
verified since 2009 through the achievement of the Carbon 
Trust Standard (“CTS”) and independent auditing on 
behalf of the Environment Agency for the CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”). SiG is no longer included 
in the CRC and made its final submission in 2014. The 
Group however continues to publish its carbon footprint 
through the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”).
in order to broaden the scope of its verification to all 
Group activities, SiG set an objective for 2015 to achieve 
an internationally recognised verification standard. The 
Group’s partnership with Carbon Credentials culminated in 
the achievement of “limited verification” to iSO 14064-3. 
This accreditation has been achieved through a detailed 
assessment, both qualitative and quantitative, of the 
Group’s Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions assertions. 
SiG is committed to maintaining the iSO standard and as 
such the Carbon Trust Standard accreditation was allowed 
to lapse at the end of 2015.
Adoption of this standard has provided the Group with a 
renewed framework for its energy reduction programme. 
The achievement and the continuous strive towards 
www.sigplc.com Stock code: ShI
42 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
improving carbon emissions has resulted in a significant 
improvement in the business’ standing in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project from 73 and “C” in 2014 to 95 and 
“C” in 2015. SiG also discloses its Carbon Footprint and 
emissions annually in this report.
The continued reduction in the Group’s GHG emissions 
has been brought about by investment in energy efficient 
technology installations across the property portfolio, 
including refurbishment of existing buildings along with 
the fit-out of new sites. This has been supplemented with 
the continued consolidation and upgrade of the Group’s 
road vehicle fleet.
ROAD RISK POLICY
SiG recognises that driving is among the most hazardous 
tasks performed by its employees and that its vehicles 
and drivers represent SiG and its values whilst they are on 
the road. The Group also recognises the potential impact 
that driving has on the local and global environment. 
Because of this, SiG has worked hard to drive the 
Occupational Road Risk Policy across the Group, with 
strong local focus on key elements of the Policy.
This process resulted in SiG being “Highly Commended” 
in the Safe Vehicles Award section at the Brake Fleet 
Safety Awards in 2015.
The Occupational Road Risk Policy is a key element 
of the accident review process across the Group, with 
Accident Review Panels (“ARPs”) meeting regularly 
throughout the year in each country. in the UK this is 
carried out in partnership with the Group’s insurers and 
brokers. The purpose of the ARPs is to reduce the risk of 
accidents and minimise the cost to the business. This is 
achieved by: raising awareness across the Group of the 
outcomes of accidents; targeting improvements in the 
speed of reporting; improving the quality of investigations 
to identify the causes of specific accidents or trends; 
and recommending action and further training where 
appropriate.
The Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (“FORS”) is an 
over-arching scheme that encompasses all aspects of 
safety, fuel efficiency, economical operations and vehicle 
emissions. FORS is a voluntary scheme for commercial 
vehicle operators, which is designed to help improve 
operators’ performance in each of these areas. SiG has 
adopted the scheme across its UK businesses. in 2015, 
SiG was awarded Whole Fleet Accreditation status, one 
of the first large fleets in the UK to do so. The branch 
network has a combination of Gold, Silver and Bronze 
accreditation statuses nationwide for sites operating 
commercial vehicles.
Work continued in 2015 to minimise the risk to vulnerable 
road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. SiG are 
active champions of the Construction Logistics and 
Cyclist Safety (“CLOCS”) group. SiG also initiated an 
“Exchanging Places” campaign in which employees 
exhibited a commercial vehicle at various cycling events 
and invited cyclists and other members of the public to 
sit in the vehicle to gain an understanding of the driver’s 
field of vision. The work in this field led to SiG being part 
of Transport for London’s finalised bid in the Partnership 
Award at the Motor Transport Awards in 2015.
Continuing this work on safety with vulnerable roads users 
in mind, SiG has designed a new Urban Delivery Vehicle 
with features designed to greatly enhance the driver’s 
primary vision of critical areas of the vehicle and to reduce 
blind spots. The vehicle was launched at the CLOCS 
progress event in February 2015 and is believed to be the 
first of its kind in its sector. Following the success of the 
first vehicle, a second Urban Delivery Vehicle went into 
operation at one of SiG’s London locations in November 
2015.
The work carried out on these vehicles resulted in SiG 
winning the Fleet innovation Award at the Brake Fleet 
Safety Awards in 2015.
TRANSPORT
Along with electricity, road vehicle fuel consumption 
makes up 89.8% of the Group’s total carbon footprint 
emissions (2014: 90.5%). SiG has targeted an absolute 
reduction year-on-year in fuel consumption since the base 
year of 2010. Due to the growth of the business through 
acquisition, the number of vehicles and delivery miles 
has increased in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 
business has maintained an overall reduction in its fuel 
consumption against the base year of 2010 of 16.5%.

Corporate Responsibility CONTiNUED
Early gains were made largely through: greater efficiency 
in journey planning and the replacement of older vehicles 
with new vehicles; the introduction of vehicles fitted with 
energy reducing features; the introduction of the driver eco 
training programmes; and accurate efficiency measurement 
through the Masternaught telematics programme. These 
have enabled the business to maintain the downward trend 
during a period of expansion.
SiG continued in 2015 to measure absolute consumption 
and target reductions across the core business. This was 
achieved through further consolidation of its branches and 
sharing of its fleet, whilst targeting efficiencies across the 
broader business in terms of improved km per litre ratios 
to take account of the impact of SiG’s plans for business 
growth.
The Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (“CPC”) 
training programme continued in 2015 across the UK & 
ireland and similar programmes are in place across the 
Mainland European businesses in compliance with EU 
Legislation. The Group maintains its policy to purchase 
commercial vehicles to the latest Euro standard, and 
low emissions vehicles to facilitate deliveries into “Low 
Emission” zones across Europe.
in order to further improve the efficiency of vehicle 
routing, fuel consumption and enable accurate mileage 
measurement, the programme to install Telematics in 
commercial vehicles has now been completed in all 
commercial vehicles under operational control across the 
Group.
SiG is keen to promote driver efficiency and driver safety 
across its fleet. in support of its EKO efficient driving 
programme, SiG Poland has continued to deliver its 
comprehensive in-vehicle driver training programme 
for both commercial and business drivers. SiG France 
delivered a “Twelve Actions in Twelve Months” information 
and instruction programme over 2015, including 
topics such as Access to Vehicle, Load Security and 
Tachographs.
SiG UK continued to deliver the CPC training programme 
to its workforce in partnership with Mercedes and 
bolstered its support for drivers with an auditing and advice 
programme through its Fleet Management Trainers. The 
highlight of this year’s programme was the Driver of the 
Year competition which reached its conclusion in June 
2015. Awards were issued in several categories and the 
overall winner was Michal Paszt from SiGD Croydon.
ENERGY
Emissions from electricity consumption account for 14.7% 
of the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2014: 14.8%). 
SiG is committed to taking action to improve the efficiency 
of its properties through the capital projects scheme for 
replacing inefficient lighting with energy efficient daylight 
and movement sensored systems. SiG has invested over 
£750,000 in capital projects since the base year of 2010. 
This has not only improved the efficiency of the building 
stock, but has also provided a safer working environment.
A key element of the Group’s compliance with the Energy 
Saving Opportunities Scheme (“ESOS”) scheme in 2015 
was the reintroduction of the buildings energy audit, which 
has identified a range of opportunities to improve energy 
efficiency which will feed into the objectives for 2016 and 
beyond. These initiatives along with the earlier “Switch 
Off” campaigns and printer/copier/fax consolidation have 
enabled the Group to achieve a further absolute reduction 
of 4.4% in 2015. 
The projects completed under the Low Carbon Policy since 
the base year of 2010 have generated annual savings in 
excess of 1.85 million kWh of electricity, and 850 tonnes 
of CO
2
 emissions, with a payback period for the capital 
projects of less than four years. 
in 2016 the business will continue with its programme 
for replacing inefficient lighting with low energy systems, 
installing energy efficient hand dryers and providing water 
heaters to replace inefficient kettles. 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
SiG is committed to providing full and accurate data for its 
carbon footprint across all of its operational businesses. 
SiG reports on all emission sources as required under 
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 
August 2013. The achievement and maintenance of this 
objective is evident by the achievement of the iSO 14064-3 
standard in 2015.
SiG uses the emission factors from the UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014 to 
calculate its GHG disclosures.
in order to provide for auditing and assessment of the 
Group’s carbon footprint accounting process, SiG has used 
a period non-coterminous with the Group’s financial year, 
with current year data reflecting the year to 30 September 
2015. The adoption of this process enables more accurate 
carbon reporting, enabling actual data to be used as 
opposed to estimates. in 2015, 95.2% of calculations are 
based on actual data. Estimates are prepared on the basis 
of applying equivalent emission rates to the remainder of 
the Group’s footprint.
The comparatives prior to 2013 are also for a twelve month 
period, but are based on the calendar year. However, 
the method of collecting data on CO
2
 emissions has not 
changed; therefore the prior year numbers have been 
included within this report as the Group feels that they 
provide meaningful comparison. The method of collection 
for each component of CO
2
 emissions has been disclosed 
in the footnotes to each table.
The Group’s carbon footprint includes Scope 1 CO
2
 
emissions, for which businesses are directly responsible, 
and Scope 2 CO
2
 emissions from the generation of 
electricity by a third party resulting in indirect emissions. 
The Group has also disclosed Scope 3 CO
2
 emissions over 
which the business has limited control, being third party air 
and rail transportation.

in 2015 the processes and procedures used in the UK 
have been audited and assessed by Carbon Credentials 
who have provided a “limited verification” to iSO 14064-
3. Previously the accounting process was audited by the 
Carbon Trust with the achievement of the Carbon Trust 
Standard for the UK element only. The achievement of the 
iSO standard is for the full Group footprint.
As a result, the Group’s carbon footprint for the year ended 
30 September 2015 has been externally audited by Carbon 
Credentials, to iSO 14064-3 at a level of limited assurance. 
This process has highlighted the continuous improvement 
in systems and procedures related to carbon management 
and reporting along with identifying areas where further 
improvements can be made.
SiG is a participant in the statutory ESOS, which is the UK 
Government’s approach to implementing Article 8 of the 
EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU). Through its 
work to gain iSO 14064-3 verification and its energy audit 
process, SiG achieved full compliance with ESOS ahead 
of the December deadline. This achievement is testimony 
to the Group’s self-auditing programme and Low Carbon 
Policy.
The Group achieved an absolute reduction of 3.5% in 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined year-on-year, with 
an overall reduction of 16.7% compared to the base year 
(2010).
The overall footprint of the business for Scope 1, 2 and 
3 emissions improved, with a reduction of 3.6% year-on-
year. The figures represent an overall reduction of 1.7% in 
emissions per £m of revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 as 
a result of the measures taken to reduce road vehicle fuel 
and energy consumption.

WATER CONSUMPTION
The Group uses an estimated 1% of its water 
consumption for manufacturing processes with the 
remainder used for welfare purposes. However, SiG 
does recognise that potable water is a precious resource 
and continues to maintain its water recycling and reuse 
practices for the processes in Southport (UK) and Alizay 
(France).
SiG continues to identify significant opportunities for 
water consumption efficiencies through the branch 
audit and bill validation process. Water efficiency is a 
key element of the specification for new and refurbished 
properties and facilities. All Group companies now report 
their water consumption.

WASTE MANAGEMENT
The Group continues its programme to reduce the 
amount of waste generated, with the introduction of 
paperless delivery processes, online activity reports and 
the consolidation of photocopying facilities. However, 
SiG’s key measurement of performance for waste 
management is the percentage of waste diverted from 
landfill. Each business within the Group partners with a 
waste management provider to provide waste segregation 
and recycling facilities. These are monitored centrally 
and through the health, safety and environmental audit 
and inspections process. To maximise opportunities and 
minimise storage and welfare risks, waste bailers and 
compactors are provided where practicable.
SiG has partnered with its suppliers to provide for waste 
take-back schemes for its customers for materials 
including: plasterboard and plaster products, uPVC 
windows, fibre ceiling tiles, vinyl floor covering materials 
and batteries. This enables the business to comply with 
their Producer Responsibility Obligations under waste 
management legislation. 
As a break bulk supplier of products, the greatest 
potential for waste production is packaging materials. By 
re-using opened packaging products, purchasing second-
hand pallets and bearers, and the operation of packaging 
return schemes for items like pallets and bearers, 
branches actively minimise their backdoor waste.
Given the difficulty in measuring the amount of waste 
produced, SiG ensures wherever possible that the data is 
accurate by working with its waste management recycling 
provider in order to produce its best estimates.
SiG is a member of the Valpak compliance scheme and 
continues to comply with its commitments under the 
Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) 
Regulations.

HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
The Chief Executive is the Board member responsible for 
health and safety and is signatory to the Group’s Health, 
Safety and Environmental Policy, which is displayed in the 
local language at each operating branch.
The Zero Harm health and safety programme, which was 
launched in 2014 and headed by the Chief Executive, is 
now fully embedded in the business’ structure. The initial 
aim of the programme was to provide management with 
a renewed understanding of the programme and their 
responsibilities, and to provide them with the tools to 
enable them to achieve the objective of the programme, 
being “the health, safety and wellbeing of employees 
and others is the primary consideration for management 
at all levels in the development, growth and day-to-day 
operation of the business, products and services.”
www.sigplc.com Stock code: ShI
46 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
The aim was re-emphasised at the 2015 Annual Senior 
Leadership Conference, where the Chief Executive gave 
a clear instruction that the Zero Harm message must be 
cascaded to all employees and that managers must take 
personal ownership and accountability for health and 
safety and in creating a safe working environment.
The success of Zero Harm is endorsed by SiG’s 
achievement for the first time of the Gold RoSPA 
Occupational Health & Safety award in 2015. The award 
recognises SiG’s ongoing commitment to raising the 
standards for health and safety management across 
the Group. Despite this being a UK award scheme, the 
submission represents the Group’s Health & Safety 
programme and the achievement reflects on the hard 
work and dedication of the Health & Safety Team across 
the Group as well as the leadership of management at all 
levels in taking ownership of health and safety and driving 
the key initiatives.
The “Safety Walks” programme for 2015 continued with 
Senior Leaders led by the Chief Executive carrying out 
420 formal branch inspections and support visits with 
branch managers. This initiative supported the cascade 
and accountability element of Zero Harm. The programme 
will continue in 2016 with a move away from the check-
list, tick-box process to an emphasis on engagement 
with operational personnel to support the drive for a safe 
culture. 
in recognition of the level of risk posed by road travel 
and deliveries, the Safety Walk programme in 2015 was 
broadened to include the accompanying of commercial 
vehicle drivers on scheduled delivery runs.
A range of local initiatives were delivered in 2015 in 
support of the Zero Harm programme, including: 
 Æ Branch Safety Days including interactive toolbox talks 
and “listening” programmes delivered by Regional 
management in the UK and “Safety Walls” which were 
Zero Harm branded focal points for Health & Safety 
information and advice. 
 Æ Safety information, Personal Protective Equipment 
dispenser and restricted access stations made from 
stock products in SiG France along with a Twelve 
Actions in Twelve Months programme dedicated to 
improving safety on “Loading and Deliveries”.
 Æ A Safety Week in SiG Poland in collaboration with 
the construction industry’s “Agreement for Safety in 
Construction” project and a “Perfect Warehouse” safety 
performance competition with the award presented by 
the business’ Managing Director. 
 Æ SiG Germany & Austria’s targeted actions to improve 
access onto vehicles to reduce the accident rate for 
drivers. 
The RoSPA accredited SiG Certificate in Health, Safety 
and Environmental Management programme continues 
to be delivered across the business, with regionally 
based training events provided across the UK in 2015 
including managers new to the business. The Zero Harm 
programme is managed and supported by the Group 
HS&E Manager and a team of directly employed Health, 
Safety and Environment professionals in each part of the 
Group. The Group’s Health & Safety management system 
is modelled on the internationally recognised Health & 
Safety Standard BS-OHSAS 18001:2007, with the SiG 
UK businesses enjoying their tenth year of certification 
following a three year renewal by its partner intertek in 
2015.
The provision of dedicated HS&E professionals enables 
the implementation of a robust Risk Assessment and 
Management Review process through which the key 
health and safety risks have been identified. The Risk 
Profile of the Group is reviewed annually to inform the 
Group’s Health & Safety Plan. For 2016 the principal 
risk areas in terms of numbers of incidents and potential 
severity of the risk remain: Occupational Road Risk, 
Traffic Management, Loading and Unloading and Storage 
Operations. 
Although an area for growth, manufacturing sites make 
up less than 5% of the business’ locations. However, SiG 
recognises the potential for serious harm and a suitably 
qualified dedicated Health & Safety Manager remains a 
key post to provide advice and support to the businesses 
and to manage the plan for continuous improvement.
SiG’s offsite activities continued to expand in 2015 and 
were successfully supported by the existing HS&E Team. 
This included the achievement of industry accreditations 
to: Achilles, CHAS, and BOPAS and SiG’s offsite business, 
RoofSpace receiving the Health & Safety achievement 
award from housebuilding contractor Barratt Homes at 
their Partners Awards Event.

There continues to be significant improvement in the 
Accident incident Rate for SiG in both major accidents 
and lost time accidents (both “over three day” accidents 
and RiDDOR (or equivalent)). Unfortunately, there was an 
increase in the UK & ireland’s “over three day” accident 
incident rate. This increase was due to an unusually high 
number of incidents occurring in December 2015. Some 
caution is advised when comparing RiDDOR rates as the 
data for 2012 has not been adjusted for the revised “over 
seven day incapacity” definition.
The Group has a Zero Tolerance to any employee being 
unfit for work due to drugs or alcohol. in 2015 the UK & 
ireland business revised its Alcohol & Substance Misuse 
Policy. Although the Company already had in place a 
procedure for “for cause” testing, the revised policy  
now provided for random testing of employees and 
sub-contractors engaged in safety critical roles. The 
purpose of the policy is to minimise the risk of injury due 
to alcohol and substance misuse. in order to support this, 
an information and education programme was cascaded 
to all employees in the second half of the year and the 
random testing programme commenced in January 2016. 
A number of tests have already been carried out.

qUALITY ASSURANCE AND MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEMS
The Group’s management systems are maintained 
to a high standard through management review and 
internal auditing. A supplier audit programme is in place, 
conducted by way of a questionnaire, and includes 
questions regarding the health, safety and environmental 
credentials of the supplier. Where it is commercially 
advantageous the quality and chain of custody 
management systems are externally certificated to iSO 
9001, with Sitaco Poland and certificated branches in the 
UK achieving continued certification in 2015.
COMMUNITY
As a large organisation employing thousands of people 
across hundreds of local communities, we recognise that 
we have a duty to actively support those communities.
in Poland, for example, SiG colleagues took part in the 
Topacz Kids City project, which helps educate children 
at risk of social exclusion about how to function in a 
community and be a good citizen. Working closely 
with Caparol, a leading producer of building paints, our 
volunteers taught the children how to be “professional” 
painters so they could earn virtual money to spend in the 
city shop.
in the UK, we facilitate our community work through our 
membership of Business in the Community (“BiTC”). We 
have worked with BiTC for a number of years and the 
partnership enables us to ensure we are adopting best 
practice in all our community interactions. 
Through BiTC, we partner with Fir Vale School in Sheffield. 
During the 2014/15 academic year, we delivered 310 
volunteer hours that reached a total of nearly 700 pupils 
through a variety of activities, providing them with vital 
business skills for life beyond school. As a result, over 
80% of the students involved said they understood more 
about the subjects and skills needed to follow different 
career paths and were better equipped to complete an 
application form or write a CV.
Also in 2015, one of our Roofing and Roofline businesses 
took part in the well-known UK TV programme DiY SOS: 
The Big Build. The one hour programme sees the DiY SOS 
team enlist the help of local tradesmen, suppliers and 
the wider community to support deserving families. One 
episode featured a family living with the consequences of 
a stroke, and we helped by providing roofing products for 
a much needed extension to the family’s home.
CHARITABLE DONATIONS 
SiG employees take part in a wide range of charitable 
activities to support both local communities and national 
charities. During the year, employees across the Group 
raised more than £45,000 through a wide range of events, 
from bake sales to cycle rides across Europe. Particularly 
notable examples include: an employee in the UK who ran 
13 marathons and raised over £3,000 for a local hospice; 
colleagues in France who took part in the Odyssea race, 
www.sigplc.com Stock code: ShI
48 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
raising money for leading cancer research organisation 
institut Gustave Roussy; and two of our senior leaders in 
Germany who dyed their beards to raise almost €5,000 for 
a Hamburg Children’s Hospice. As a Group, we operate a 
matched funding scheme, which matches up to £500 (or 
equivalent) raised by employees through charitable efforts 
like these. We also support our people in their activities in 
other ways, like hosting charity dress-down days at work 
or helping to publicise employee’s fundraising through 
notice boards. 
We also make charitable donations as an organisation. 
in Poland, as well as our people giving their time to the 
Topacz Kids City project, we donated 5,000 PLN to the 
cause (see the “Community” section for more information 
about this project). At a Group level, meanwhile, we 
continued with an initiative we started last year, donating 
either £1 or €1 to the British Red Cross and UNiCEF for 
every completed response to our employee engagement 
survey, SiG Listens. Our 78% response rate meant that, in 
October, we were able to donate £6,222 to the charities. 
in light of the crisis in Syria, we decided to add a further 
£10,000 to this amount, requesting that the two charities 
put the total funds towards their Syrian refugee appeals.
in 2015, the Group made total charitable donations of 
£99,451 (2014: £111,000), including through our matched 
funding scheme.
it is the Group’s policy not to make political donations and 
no such donations were made in the year (2014: £nil).
Employees in the UK can also make charitable donations 
through our payroll giving scheme.
OUR PEOPLE
One of the key strategic areas of focus across SiG is 
improving the performance, engagement and well-being 
of all our people.
SIG VALUES
Our values are: Trust, Respect, integrity, Commitment, 
Teamwork and Fun.
These values were developed by our people and are the 
guiding principles by which we work with our customers, 
our suppliers, our communities and each other. They are 
the bedrock of our Stronger Together vision and we bring 
them to life in everything we do.
DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE
The skill and expertise of our people is one of our key 
differentiators in the marketplace; developing employees 
is therefore a core part of our strategy.
We want our new joiners to learn as much about SiG as 
possible from the moment they arrive. This year, we have 
created a Group induction Programme that will give new 
employees a consistent view of our values, our business 
and our strategy, regardless of where in the world they 
are based. it is part of embedding our Stronger Together 
ethos across the Group.
Throughout people’s careers, the Performance 
Development Review (“PDR”) process, launched in 2013, 
ensures all managers and employees know what is 
expected of them in their roles and that performance is 
measured and managed. it also provides an opportunity 
for employees to discuss their career aspirations with their 
manager, set development plans and take action on those 
plans during the year. in 2015, we trained almost 450 
managers in how to run effective performance reviews, 
and 79% of our people had a PDR discussion (compared 
to 65% in 2014). Our goal is to make sure all employees 
have this opportunity.
We recognise that developing our leaders is important, 
too. Throughout 2015, our Senior Leadership Team (“SLT”) 
participated in the “Raising the Bar” programme. The 
programme addresses key topics, and, through facilitated 
training sessions, enables our leaders to learn, share 
knowledge and shape action-planning. Topics covered to 
date include PDRs, Maximising Finance Performance and 
Leading Change.
Some development initiatives are locally focused. in the 
UK, for example, our partnership with Sheffield Hallam 
University continues to give our leaders the opportunity 
to develop their management skills while also gaining 
an academic accreditation, either at advanced Diploma 
or Bachelor Degree level. in Poland, courses to grow 
managers’ coaching capability have been developed, as 
has training to improve knowledge-sharing. in Germany, 
a programme of leadership and management training 
is ongoing, with modules including leading self, leading 
others and leading change. in France, the introduction 
of a new Learning Management System as part of the 
Group-wide training and development strategy is helping 
employees to manage their development and grow in their 
career. Similarly, the Learning Management System in the 
UK & ireland has been updated, giving people access 
to more training and introducing self-enrolment so that 
people have more control of their personal development.

Developing high-potential individuals for succession 
planning purposes is vital to our future growth. Early in 
2015, we conducted a review of successors for Executive 
and Senior Leader levels across the business. A further 
review, started later in 2015, is helping to identify high-
potential people at other levels. From the reviews 
conducted, new development programmes have been 
designed and new talent pipeline programmes – including 
Graduates and Apprentices – have been implemented. 
Through these programmes, we will not only be able 
to create a recruitment pipeline of talented individuals 
entering the business, but we will also be able to 
accelerate the development and progression of those 
already with us.
RECOGNISING OUTSTANDING 
PERFORMANCE
We remain committed to recognising excellent 
performance and celebrating the success of our people. 
One way we do this is through the annual, Group-wide 
SiG Awards. These awards give our leaders the chance 
to nominate employees at all levels for ideas, actions 
and behaviours that help us live our values as well as 
delivering financial results. Shortlisted nominees attend 
an awards dinner at the Senior Leadership Conference. 
During the ceremony, awards are presented in several 
categories, and a special Chief Executive’s Award for 
Excellence is given to one outstanding individual who 
embodies our values, has shown consistently excellent 
personal performance and has had a transformational 
effect on their business area or function.
ENGAGED EMPLOYEES
During September 2015, we ran our employee 
engagement survey, SiG Listens, for the second time (the 
first was in March 2014). The survey gives our people the 
chance to tell us what we are doing well and how we can 
improve to make SiG a great place to work.
78% of employees responded and our overall engagement 
score, at 73%, remained stable compared with the 2014 
survey. it was also in line with the global benchmark for 
private enterprises.
This year saw a marked rise in scores across a number of 
areas. These increases show that our people are feeling 
even more positive about:
 Æ the importance we place on health and safety (up four 
percentage-points)
 Æ our approach to caring for their well-being (up five 
percentage-points)
 Æ receiving regular and constructive feedback on their 
performance (up seven percentage-points)
 Æ how fairly their performance is reviewed (up five 
percentage-points)
This improvement is testament to the actions we have 
taken since the last survey, particularly in relation to our 
Zero Harm initiatives for health and safety and the training 
we have given to managers about running effective 
Performance Development Reviews (see the section 
“Developing our people” for more about these reviews). 
We are also delighted to see a three percentage-point 
rise in the “management index”. This a measure of the 
way our people view the effectiveness of their managers 
in areas like delivering feedback, recognising good work, 
encouraging innovation and handling poor performance.
Of course, there are areas for improvement. The results 
show that we need to do more to convince our employees 
that we will act on their feedback from the survey. Our 
aim, therefore, is to make sure that all our managers share 
the results of the survey with their teams and that action 
planning and implementation at a Group and local level 
continues throughout the year. The results also indicate 
that we need to: provide greater clarity on our vision and 
strategy; keep helping our people to develop and progress 
in their careers; maintain focus on customer service; and 
improve the way we recognise our people’s performance 
and celebrate success. You can read about how we are 
addressing these needs in the “internal communications”, 
“Developing our people” and “Recognising outstanding 
performance” sections of this report.
INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS
Communicating with our people is a key priority for us. We 
want to make sure everyone understands our vision for 
SiG and our strategy for realising that vision. We are also 
keen for our people to share their views and opinions, so 
two-way communication is very important.
Our communications normally start with our senior 
leaders. Our channels for reaching them currently include 
email bulletins, web broadcasts, conference calls and 
face-to-face briefings. Often, we then ask our leaders to 
cascade the messages to their teams via emails and team 
meetings. To support this cascade, we provide briefing 
packs for leaders and managers, which help them share 
news and also gather feedback. Where appropriate, we 
also use intranet articles and updates, posters and desk 
drops to keep employees informed.
As our organisation develops, we are continually 
evaluating our communications and looking for more 
innovative ways to reach our people. We are currently 
exploring new electronic channels, such as instant 
messenger, internal social media and other collaboration 
tools. We are also increasing face-to-face contact 
between our operational employees and our leaders 
through “Meet the COMEX” events and our annual 
programme of roadshows. in addition, we have introduced 
new communication guidelines that will help bring 
consistency to the way our communications look, read 
and sound. This is part of how we are helping employees 
to feel stronger together, wherever they are.

Finally, our employee engagement survey and our 
performance review process for employees both facilitate 
meaningful two-way communication between us and our 
people. There is more information about both of these 
elsewhere in this report (see “Developing our people” and 
“Engaged employees”).
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
We aim to attract and retain the best talent with a fair and 
consistent approach to both fixed and variable pay, which 
is regularly benchmarked, both externally and internally. 
Reward and benefits play a key role in supporting 
employee engagement and performance. 
Our bonus schemes are designed to reward exceptional 
performance. For our Senior Leadership population, 
the bonus operates to an aligned framework across the 
Group, specifically focusing on Group-wide deliverables 
and outcomes. Bonus awards are also made in the local 
operating businesses aligned to local performance results. 
These are key in driving and rewarding performance at 
this level.
We also encourage our employees to become 
Shareholders in the Company. At the senior level, we 
operate a Long Term incentive Plan for our leaders and 
across our whole business we operate a Share incentive 
Plan (SiP). This gives one matching share for each share 
purchased by the employee up to a maximum of £20 
per month. As at 31 December 2015, there were 971 
employees participating in the SiP .
SiG will implement the UK Government’s National 
Living Wage from 1 April 2016, going beyond the legal 
requirement and adopting the rate for all employees 
from age 21 to enhance our Employee Value Proposition. 
in SiG, we feel that it is important to properly reward 
our people for helping to support our customers and 
ensuring the success of our business. Our decision to go 
beyond the legal requirement on the National Living Wage 
reinforces our commitment to do this.
GROWING OUR TALENT
The growth and development of talent is key to our 
future success. Throughout 2015, we have remained 
committed, across the Group, to recruiting and developing 
people who are starting their careers, whether they are 
apprentices or university graduates. 
apprenticeships
Our apprenticeship programmes are going from strength 
to strength. in Germany, 25 new apprentices joined us 
in 2015, across two of our Group companies. These 
high-calibre individuals were selected from around 
1,500 applicants. Fourteen of them are fulfilling roles as 
management assistants, while the rest are working as 
warehouse/logistics specialists. All receive advanced 
training, including a new eLearning module focusing on 
workplace safety training. 
As in previous years, we ran the annual Apprentice Forum 
in 2015. Attended by representatives from our industrial 
partner, Rockwool, the forum enabled all the apprentices 
in Germany to gather together for networking, knowledge 
sharing and technical presentations. 
We have also created a new training programme in the 
past year, entitled Handel Trifft Handwerk (“Retail Meets 
Trade”). it gives our apprentices the chance to spend 
two to four weeks at a construction site, learning about 
our products and the way they are used by our industrial 
partners and customers.
As well as investing in our apprentices, we have spent 
time developing our apprenticeship supervisors in 
Germany. The inaugural Apprenticeship Conference for 
Supervisors was held in 2015, with a range of workshops, 
presentations and discussion sessions focusing on 
how SiG, the apprentices and those supervising them 
can derive the most benefit from the apprenticeship 
programme.
in the UK, our apprenticeship offering has been running 
for three years and 2015 saw the continuation of the 
Apprenticeship Development Programme, which brings 
the apprentices together to develop their key skills and 
business understanding. Twenty-five new apprentices 
joined through the 2015 intake. Apprentices who have 
completed this programme in the past are now employed 
in various roles across our head office, central services 
and branch network.

Graduates
in 2015, we launched our new international Graduate 
Programme. While we continue to recruit graduates into 
specific functional areas on a country-by-country basis, 
the new programme provides successful applicants 
with insight and exposure across our UK, ireland and 
Mainland European businesses. As our first Group-wide 
talent initiative, the programme focuses on attracting, 
developing and deploying high-calibre people who are 
capable of developing into SiG’s future leaders. During 
the two-year programme, graduates will undertake 
four rotations of six months, and attend five extensive 
development modules. Each module will concentrate on 
different leadership attributes such as understanding self, 
emotional intelligence, understanding the business and 
key financial skills.
The first cohort of nine graduates joined us in September 
2015 through a re-designed recruitment and selection 
process. Application criteria included a requirement for 
a specific degree background, such as business studies 
or international business, and a second language. The 
selection process involved video interviews, psychometric 
assessments and an extensive assessment centre 
encompassing case studies, group presentations 
and competency-based interviews. Key stakeholders 
from across SiG internationally were invited to attend 
the assessment centres to help select the successful 
applicants. The programme’s next cohort is due to arrive 
in September 2016.
Alongside our internal work with graduates, we continue 
to support Enactus, as a Gold Sponsor. Enactus is a 
community of students, academics and business leaders 
that develops outreach projects to improve the lives of 
people across the world. in 2015, we were again involved 
in the judging process for the Enactus UK National 
Competition, with more representatives from SiG than 
ever before taking part in the judging. Furthermore, 
we have established a network of business advisors 
throughout SiG in the UK who support individual Enactus 
teams. These advisors act as mentors for the teams’ 
projects during the year. in 2016, we will continue to build 
our group of business advisors to support more Enactus 
university teams and, over time, we hope to establish 
relationships with the Enactus programme in other SiG 
countries.
We will also continue our support for the Association 
of Graduate Recruiters (“AGR”) in 2016, having been 
members for the last several years. in 2015, we were 
involved in sharing best practice ideas across the 
AGR membership, and we attended AGR events and 
discussion groups. A number of SiG representatives from 
the Talent and Resourcing teams were also invited to be 
part of the judging panel for the AGR Awards.
Eq UAL OPPORTUNITIES
Our policy is to provide equal opportunities to all existing 
and prospective employees. Across the Group, we 
recognise that our reputation is dependent upon fair and 
equitable treatment of all our employees and we prohibit 
discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, gender, 
disability, sexual orientation, age, nationality or ethnic 
origin. Employment opportunities are equally available to 
all. 
We value diversity of thinking and see this as critical in 
generating new ideas and innovative solutions for our 
customers. Employment opportunities are available to 
disabled persons in accordance with their abilities and 
aptitudes on equal terms with other employees. if an 
employee becomes disabled during employment, we 
at SiG make every effort to enable them to continue in 
employment by making reasonable adjustments in the 
workplace and providing retraining for alternative work 
where necessary.
GENDER DIVERSITY
At 31 December 2015, across the total workforce, 2,036 
(21%) of all employees are female and 7,787 (79%) are 
male. Two Board members (25%) are female and six 
(75%) Board members are male. Six senior managers 
(9%) are female and 63 senior managers (91%) are male.

highest standards of corporate 
governance.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
SiG is committed to business integrity, high ethical values 
and professionalism in all of its activities. At SiG, we 
believe that good governance comes from an effective 
Board which provides strong leadership to the Group and 
engages well with both management and stakeholders. As 
an essential part of this commitment, the Group supports 
the highest standards in corporate governance. This 
section of our report outlines how the Board ensures that 
high standards of corporate governance are maintained. 
c ompliance with the u K c orporate Governance 
c ode 
The Board considers that, throughout the year under 
review, the Company has complied with the governance 
rules and best practice provisions applying to UK listed 
companies as contained in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) of September 2014 issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (”FRC”).
The Code can be accessed at www.frc.org.uk.
Board evaluation
The Board is required, under the Code, to undertake 
a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors. in December 2015 the Board conducted an 
internally facilitated evaluation. Details of the process 
concerning this evaluation and its outcome are covered on 
page 64 of this Corporate Governance Report. 
Board diversity
The Board of SiG acknowledges the importance of 
diversity in its broadest sense in the Boardroom as a 
driver of Board effectiveness. Diversity encompasses 
diversity of perspective, experience, background, 
psychological type and personal attributes. The Board 
recognises that gender diversity is a significant aspect 
of diversity and acknowledges the role that women with 
the right skills and experience can play in contributing 
to diversity of perspective in the Boardroom. The Board 
Diversity Policy is published on the Company’s website 
(www.sigplc.com). 
in last year’s Annual Report i reported that the Board had 
discussed in December 2013 the matter of women on 
Boards and had set out the aim of achieving at least 25% 
female representation among the Board’s membership by 
2015. i am pleased to be able to report that, following the 
appointment of Ms A. Abt on 12 March 2015, that female 
representation on the Board has risen to 25%. 
All appointments to the Board will continue to be made 
on merit, however, differences in background, skills, 
experience and other qualities as well as gender will be 
considered in determining the optimum composition of the 
Board and the aim will be to balance them appropriately. 
GOVERNANCE WITHIN SIG
As Chairman, i take responsibility for ensuring that good 
governance is operated at SiG in order that we can 
maintain the highest standards of corporate governance 
to which we continually aspire. The Board is accountable 
to the Company’s Shareholders for good governance and 
this Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
80 to 98, the Audit Committee Report on pages 72 to 77 
and the Nominations Committee Report on pages 78 to 
79 describe how the principles of good governance set 
out in the Code are applied within SiG.
The Company’s Auditor, Deloitte LLP , is required to review 
whether the above statement reflects the Company’s 
compliance with the ten provisions of the Code specified 
for their review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority and to report if it does not reflect such 
compliance. No such report has been made.

LEADERSHIP
t he Board
At 31 December 2015, the Board was made up of eight 
members comprising the Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and five Non-Executive Directors. The Directors 
who held office during the year were:
 
MR l . VAN DE wAll E Non-Executive Chairman 
MR S. R. MITChEll Chief Executive
MR D. G. ROBERTSON Group Finance Director 
MS A. ABT independent Non-Executive Director 
(appointed 12 March 2015)
MS J. E. AShDOwN independent Non-Executive Director 
MR M. EwEll independent Non-Executive Director 
MR C. V. GEOGhEGAN Senior independent Non-Executive 
Director
MR J. C. NIChOll S independent Non-Executive Director
Biographical details of the Directors holding office at the 
date of this report appear on pages 56 and 57. Details of 
Committee memberships are set out on page 63.
At 31 December 2015, SiG had two female Board 
members, equating to 25% female representation of its 
Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors are considered by the 
Board to be independent of management and free of 
any relationship which could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their independent judgment. The Board 
has satisfied itself that there is no compromise to 
the independence of those Directors who have other 
appointments in outside entities. The Board considers 
that each of the Non-Executive Directors bring their 
own senior level of experience and expertise and that 
the balance between Non-Executive and Executive 
representation encourages healthy independent challenge 
to the Executive Directors and senior management. 
The Non-Executive Directors have been appointed for 
their specific areas of expertise and knowledge. Their 
wide-ranging experience and backgrounds ensure that 
they can debate matters constructively in relation to both 
the development of strategy and performance of SiG 
against objectives set out by the Board. Biographical 
details of each of the Directors, which illustrate their range 
of experience, are set out on pages 56 and 57. 
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of 
appointment and remuneration of both the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors is detailed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 98.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
are separate and clearly defined. The division of 
responsibilities is set out in writing, reviewed by the 
Company Secretary and agreed by the Board on a regular 
basis. The Board approves any necessary changes to 
reflect changes in legislation, policy and practices. The 
Chairman leads the Board and sets its agenda, ensuring 
that all Directors, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, 
are able to make an effective contribution. He also 
ensures that there is a constructive relationship between 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive has responsibility for all operational matters 
which include the implementation of the Group’s Strategy 
and policies approved by the Board. 
The roles for the Chairman, Chief Executive and the 
Senior independent Director are agreed and set out 
in writing; a summary of their roles and division of 
responsibility is set out below:
c hairman
 Æ Responsible for overall leadership and governance 
of the Board (including induction, development and 
performance evaluation);
 Æ Ensures that the Directors have an understanding of 
the views of the Company’s major shareholders; and

the Code.

The Senior independent Director is Mr C. V. Geoghegan. 
There is no maximum number of Directors but there shall 
at no time be less than two. Directors may be appointed 
by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. 
A Director appointed by the Board shall hold office only 
until the next Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) and shall 
then be eligible for re-appointment by the Shareholders. 
The Board may, from time to time, appoint one or more 
Directors as Managing Director or to fulfil any other 
executive function within the Company for such term, 
remuneration and other conditions of appointment as 
it may determine, and it may revoke such appointment 
(subject to the provisions of the Companies Act).
ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION OF 
DIRECTORS
Under the Articles of Association, all Directors are 
subject to election at the AGM immediately following 
their appointment and to re-election every three years. 
However, in accordance with the Code, all Directors 
will seek election or re-election at the Company’s AGM 
each year. To enable Shareholders to make an informed 
decision, the 2016 Notice of AGM includes biographical 
details and a statement as to why the Company believes 
that the Directors should be re-elected. 
it is the view of the Board that each of the Non-Executive 
Directors standing for re-election brings considerable 
management experience and an independent perspective 
to the Board’s discussions and is considered to 
be independent of management and free from any 
relationship or circumstance that could affect, or appear 
to affect, the exercise of their independent judgment. 
The Chairman intends to confirm at the AGM that the 
performance of each individual continues to be effective 
and demonstrates commitment to the role.
The terms of the Directors’ service contracts are disclosed 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 85 to 
86. Full details of Directors’ remuneration, interests in 
the share capital of the Company and of share options 
held are set out on pages 90 to 98 in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and will be available at 
the AGM which is scheduled to take place on 12 May 2016.
BOARD PROCEDURES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as 
on an adhoc basis as required by time-critical business 
needs. The Board met formally on ten occasions during 
the year and individual attendance at those and the Board 
Committee meetings is set out in the table on page 62. All 
Board members are supplied with information in a form 
and of a quality appropriate to enable them to discharge 
their duties. Board and Committee papers are sent out 
seven days before meetings take place. The Directors 
are provided with opportunities for training to ensure that 
they are kept up-to-date on relevant new legislation and 
regulation changes, corporate governance developments 
and changing commercial risks. There is an agreed 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board for collective 
decision (which can be viewed on the Company’s website, 
www.sigplc.com). These matters include:
 Æ Determining the strategy and control of the Group;
 Æ Amendments to the structure and capital of the 
Company and Group;
 Æ Approval of financial reporting; 
 Æ Oversight of the Group’s internal controls;
 Æ Approval of capital and revenue expenditure of a 
significant size;
 Æ Board membership and appointments;
 Æ Acquisitions and disposals above a prescribed limit; 
 Æ Corporate governance matters; and
 Æ Approval of Group policies and risk management 
strategies.
The Board has formally delegated specific responsibilities 
to Board Committees, including the Nominations, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. The Board also 
appoints Committees to approve specific processes 
as deemed necessary. For example, during the year, 
Board Committees were established to approve bank 
documentation, share allotments, and the preliminary and 
interim results announcements.
The Terms of Reference for each of the Board Committees 
are available on request from the Company Secretary or 
on the SiG website (www.sigplc.com).
To enable the Board to perform its duties effectively, 
all Directors have full access to all relevant information 
and to the services of the Company Secretary, whose 
responsibility it is for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board. There is 
an agreed procedure whereby Directors wishing to take  24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

independent legal advice in the furtherance of their duties 
may do so at the Company’s expense. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed including the formal 
minuting of any unresolved concerns that any Director 
may have in connection with the operation of the 
Company. During the year there were no such unresolved 
issues. Further, on resignation, if a Non-Executive Director 
had any such concerns, the Chairman would invite him/
her to provide a written statement for circulation to the 
Board. 
All Board Committees are provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties. Appropriate training 
is available to all Directors on appointment and on an 
ongoing basis as required.
Following the implementation of BoardPad, a secure 
iPad paperless meeting system in 2012, its successful 
roll-out has progressively resulted in the replacement 
of hard copy packs with electronic versions. Paperless 
meetings are now the norm, not only for the Board but 
also its Committees and the Group Executive Committee. 
This supports our online drive across the Group and is 
consistent with reducing the impact of our operations on 
the environment.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
Each Director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 
(“CA 2006”) to avoid any situation where they have, or can 
have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the Company’s interests. This duty is in 
addition to the obligation that they owe to the Company 
to disclose to the Board any transaction or arrangement 
under consideration by the Company in which they have, 
or can have, a direct or indirect interest. Directors of 
public companies may authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts, where appropriate, if a company’s Articles of 
Association permit and Shareholders have approved 
appropriate amendments. 
Procedures have been put in place for the disclosure 
by Directors of any such conflicts and also for the 
consideration and authorisation of any conflicts by the 
Board. These procedures allow for the imposition of 
limits or conditions by the Board when authorising any 
conflict, if they think this is appropriate. These procedures 
have been applied during the year and are now included 
as a regular item for consideration by the Board at 
its meetings. The Board believes that the procedures 
established to deal with conflicts of interest are operating 
effectively. 
The Board is aware of the other commitments of its 
Directors and is satisfied that these do not conflict with 
their duties as Directors of the Company. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

2. There were two unscheduled Board meetings in 2015 relating to the consideration of acquisitions and consideration of trading conditions.
Of the ten Board meetings held in 2015, two were held by telephone conference call.
This table only shows those meetings which each Director attended as a member rather than as an invitee. Where “N/A” 
appears in the table the Director listed is not a member of the Committee. All of the Directors in office at the date of the 
AGM were in attendance at that meeting. Directors do not participate in meetings when matters relating to them are 
discussed.
The Chairman also holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present. The 
Senior independent Director also meets with the other independent Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman 
present. 
in general, the Board endeavours to hold at least two Board meetings each year at Group business locations both in 
the UK & ireland and Mainland Europe to help all Board members gain a deeper understanding of the business. This 
also provides senior managers from across the Group with the opportunity to present to the Board as well as to meet 
the Directors on more informal occasions. Board members also attend divisional and Group management conferences 
whenever possible.
All Directors attended the 2015 AGM and were available to answer any questions raised by the Shareholders. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

EFFECTIVENESS AND EVALUATION
Board effectiveness and performance evaluation
The effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is vital 
to the success of the Company. During the year the Board 
continued its ongoing evaluation process to assess its 
performance and that of its three principal Committees 
(Audit, Remuneration and Nominations).
in December 2014, as part of this programme, the Board 
commissioned Equity Communications Limited, an 
independent third party with no other connection to the 
Company, to prepare a tailored Board Evaluation process. 
This was facilitated by way of a questionnaire process 
with the emphasis, in addition to the evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and its Committees, being 
targeted at identifying the future needs of the Board, 
including Board succession planning and performance, 
strategy development and delivery, and Board skills and 
composition. Each Director completed their questionnaire 
and these were then evaluated by the independent 
facilitator who then prepared a report for the Chairman.
The Chairman and the facilitator presented the results of 
the evaluation to the Board, which discussed the results 
of the evaluation in detail at its January 2015 meeting. 
The discussions then focused on how the actions and 
improvements identified through the process should be 
implemented. The Board was satisfied that the evaluation 
of its performance was a worthwhile exercise and that the 
Directors had participated on an open and frank basis.
in December 2015, by way of follow up to the formal 
evaluation process completed in December 2014, an 
effectiveness survey of the Board and its Committees 
(Audit, Remuneration and Nominations) was undertaken. 
The surveys were internally facilitated and carried out by 
questionnaire. Each Director (including the Chairman) was 
asked to place a score against a variety of questions and 
to make additional comments where appropriate. The 
surveys also sought to identify the extent to which the 
issues raised in the previous evaluation process had been 
addressed. The summary report and response analysis for 
the December 2015 survey were presented to the Board in 
January 2016, with suggested improvement actions.
Whilst concluding that the Board and its Committees 
continue to improve their effectiveness and are perceived 
to be working well, the evaluation identified a number 
of areas for improvement in connection with Board 
succession planning and further sharing of best practices 
between the Directors. There is also scope to improve 
the monitoring, testing and adaptation of business 
performance and strategy implementation. With regard to 
markets, areas for improvement are to better understand 
the development of the market and benchmarking against 
key competitors, together with identification of market 
trends and forecasting.
The proposed Board priorities for 2016 will cover:
 Æ Closely monitoring performance and delivery 
against 2016 to 2018 targets and performance of its 
competitors;
 Æ Obtaining a better understanding and anticipating more 
actively the development of the market, customers and 
competitors;
 Æ improving cost management culture and driving the 
structural costs review;
 Æ Continuing focus and progress on the Company’s 
Health & Safety Zero Harm campaign; and
 Æ Progressing an enhanced people agenda, 
including succession planning, strengthening front 
line management and reviewing organisational 
effectiveness.
The Board notes that the Code requires FTSE 350 
companies to carry out an externally facilitated Board 
evaluation at least every three years. Having last 
conducted such an evaluation in December 2014, the 
Board intends to conduct a formal externally facilitated 
effectiveness and evaluation process in 2017. 
The Chairman regularly reviews and agrees with each 
Director their training and development needs. During 
the year a number of the Directors attended training 
courses and seminars on various subjects, including those 
that the Chairman had identified as being areas where 
training would increase the knowledge and effectiveness 
of the Director. The Board as a whole received training 
on Corporate Governance developments in relation to 
revisions to the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Longer-Term Viability Statement and Auditor reporting 
requirements. Further training is programmed for 2016.
The Non-Executive Directors, chaired by the Senior 
independent Director, meet once a year without the 
Chairman present to assess his performance, taking into 
account the views of the Executive Directors.
r isk management and internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. it is the role of management to implement 
the Board’s policies on risk and control through the design 
and operation of appropriate internal control systems. Such 
systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives and 
can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1
SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015

GOVERNANCE
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems, 
accounting policies and practices, standards of risk 
management and risk management procedures and 
compliance controls.
The key elements of the existing systems of internal 
control, which accord with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management and internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting (the “Risk Guidance”), are as 
follows:
Open culture
The Board considers that the Group operates a risk-
aware culture with an open style of communication. This 
facilitates the early identification of problems and issues, 
so that appropriate action is taken quickly to minimise any 
impact on the business.
Ongoing process for risk identification, evaluation and 
management
This process includes the following:
 Æ The Group Board maintains an overall corporate risk 
register, the content of which is determined by regular 
discussions between senior management, the Group 
Board and the Audit Committee. This is also formally 
reviewed twice yearly by the Audit Committee and 
discussed with the Board. The risk register contains 
the significant risks faced by the Group and identifies 
the potential impact and likelihood at both a gross level 
(before consideration of mitigating controls) and net 
level (after consideration of mitigating controls). This 
provides the Board with the opportunity to review the 
level of risk that the business is prepared to accept. 
The register also contains the assurance provided 
over current key mitigating controls. Where further 
actions have been identified to mitigate risks to a level 
deemed acceptable, these are agreed with specific 
timelines for delivery and are monitored closely until 
fully implemented. This is summarised in the Strategic 
Report on pages 20 to 23;
 Æ The risk management process is cascaded throughout 
the Group, with operating subsidiary boards 
responsible for maintaining their own risk registers and 
assessing their internal control systems;
 Æ A defined organisation structure with appropriate 
delegation of authority;
 Æ Formal authorisation procedures for all investments 
with clear guidelines on appraisal techniques and 
success criteria;
 Æ Clear responsibilities on the part of financial 
management for the maintenance of good financial 
controls and the production and review of detailed, 
accurate and timely financial management information;
 Æ A comprehensive system of financial reporting. An 
annual budget for each operating company is prepared 
in detail and approved by the Chief Executive. 
The Board approves the overall Group’s budget and 
plans. Monthly actual results are reported against 
budget and prior year and the forecast for the year 
is revised where necessary. Any significant changes 
and adverse variances are questioned by the Board 
with remedial action taken where appropriate. There is 
also regular cash and treasury reporting to the Group 
Finance Director and periodic reporting to the Board on 
the Group’s tax and treasury position;
 Æ Provision to management and the Board of relevant, 
accurate and timely information including relevant key 
performance indicators, based on reliable management 
information systems which are continually being 
improved and updated;
 Æ Monthly reports to the Board from the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director;
 Æ Regular business unit management board meetings 
(periodically attended by the Chief Executive or Group 
Finance Director), Executive Board meetings and the 
Company Board meetings at which existing, new 
and evolving operational, financial and other risks are 
discussed, and appropriate actions to manage these 
risks are agreed and followed up;
 Æ Discussion of any significant issues or control 
weaknesses identified and, if considered necessary, 
their inclusion in reports to the Executive Board and the 
Company Board;
 Æ Operating units, both trading sites and central 
functions, complete comprehensive Control Self 
Assessment (“CSA”) questionnaires every six months. 
These questionnaires require managers to respond to 
questions about procedures and controls in the unit 
for which they have responsibility. These are analysed 
by local and Group management and all potential risks 
or control failure issues which are raised by the CSA 
process are classed in terms of escalation levels with 
any significant Group level issues being reported to the 
Audit Committee; and 
 Æ A structured and approved programme of internal Audit 
visits with the implementation of recommendations 
made being monitored as part of a continuous 
programme of improvement. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

Financial reporting
in addition to the general internal controls and risk 
management processes described on pages 64 to 66, the 
Group also has specific systems and controls to govern 
the financial reporting process and preparation of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. These systems include clear 
policies and the procedures for ensuring that the Group’s 
financial reporting processes and the preparation of its 
Consolidated Accounts comply with all relevant regulatory 
reporting requirements. These are comprehensively 
detailed in the Group Finance Manual, which is used by 
the businesses in the preparation of their results. Financial 
control requirements are also set out in the Group Finance 
Manual.
Annual assessment of the effectiveness of systems of 
internal control
During 2015 the Board conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
This review covered all controls including operational, 
compliance and risk management procedures, as well as 
financial controls.
The Board and Audit Committee requested, received and 
reviewed reports from senior management, its advisers, 
the outsourced internal Audit function and our external 
Auditor in order to assist the Board with their annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control. Through the ongoing processes outlined 
on pages 64 to 66, improvements in internal controls 
are continuously identified and action plans are devised. 
Progress towards completion of actions is regularly 
monitored by management and the Board. The Board 
considers that none of the areas of improvement identified 
constitute a significant failing or weakness. The Board 
considers that the information that it receives is sufficient 
to enable it to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls in accordance with the internal control 
guidance for Directors on the Code issued by the FRC.
Whistleblowing
The Group has in place a Whistleblowing Policy under 
which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or 
other matters. A copy of this policy is available on the 
Company’s website (www.sigplc.com).
The Company also has in place a confidential hotline 
which is available to all of the Group’s employees 
and provides a facility for them to bring matters to 
management’s attention on a confidential basis. The 
hotline is provided by an independent third party. During 
2015 these systems were operational throughout the 
Group. A full investigation is carried out on all matters 
raised and a report is prepared for feedback to the 
complainant. 
The Company Secretary is required to report to the 
Audit Committee semi-annually on the integrity of these 
procedures, the state of ongoing investigations and 
conclusions reached. During 2015 Group employees used 
this system to raise concerns about a number of separate 
issues, all of which were appropriately responded to.
Overall assessment
The risk framework, as outlined above, gives reasonable 
assurance that the structure of controls in operation is 
appropriate to the Group’s situation and that there is an 
acceptable level of risk throughout the business.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group and that this has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company recognises the importance of 
communicating with its Shareholders, including its 
employee Shareholders, to ensure that its strategy and 
performance is understood. This is achieved principally 
through the Annual Report and Accounts and the AGM. 
The Group’s annual and interim results, as well as all 
announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange, 
are published on the Company’s website. The Company 
issues regular trading updates to the market and these, 
together with copies of the presentations made to 
analysts, can also be found on the Company’s website. 
in addition, a range of other corporate information is 
available to investors on the Company’s website (www.
sigplc.com).
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Head 
of investor Relations are primarily responsible for direct 
investor relations. The Board is kept informed of investors’ 
views through distribution and regular discussion of 
analysts’ and brokers’ briefings and a summary of investor 
opinion feedback. in addition, feedback from major 
Shareholders is reported to the Board by the Chairman 
and the Group Finance Director and discussed at its 
meetings. Formal presentations are made to institutional 
Shareholders following the announcement of the 
Company’s annual and interim results. 
The Company hosted a Capital Markets Day in London 
on 16 November 2015. The presentation can be viewed at 
www.sigplc.com.
Contact is also maintained, where appropriate, with 
Shareholders to discuss overall remuneration plans and 
policies. The Chairman and the Senior independent 
Director are available to discuss governance and strategy 
with major Shareholders if requested, and both are 
prepared to contact individual Shareholders should 
any specific areas of concern or enquiry be raised. The 
Chairman also offers to meet with major Shareholders 
each year. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

GOVERNANCE
Throughout the year, the Company responds to 
correspondence received from Shareholders on a wide 
range of issues and also participates in a number of 
surveys and questionnaires submitted by a variety 
of investor research bodies. Although the other Non-
Executive Directors are not at present asked to meet 
the Company’s Shareholders, they regularly review the 
presentations of the annual and interim results.
The Board recognises that the AGM is the principal 
forum for dialogue with private Shareholders and all 
Shareholders are invited to attend. All Directors attend 
the AGM and are available to answer any questions that 
Shareholders may wish to raise. 
The Notice of Meeting is sent to Shareholders at least 20 
working days before the meeting. The Company provides 
a facility for Shareholders to vote electronically and the 
Form of Proxy provides Shareholders with the option 
of withholding their vote on a resolution if they so wish. 
Shareholders vote on a show of hands, unless a poll 
is validly called and, after each such vote, the number 
of Proxy votes received for or against the resolution 
together with the number of abstentions is announced. 
The Company Secretary ensures that votes are properly 
received and recorded. Details of the Proxies lodged on 
all resolutions are published on the Company’s website 
immediately after the AGM.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
At the date of approval of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, the Company had received notification of the

share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which 
is divided into ordinary shares of 10p each. At 31 
December 2015, the Company had a called up share 
capital of 591,347,148 ordinary shares of 10p each (2014: 
591,137,803). 
During the year ended 31 December 2015, options 
were exercised pursuant to the Company’s share 
option schemes, resulting in the allotment of 209,345 
new ordinary shares. No new ordinary shares have 
been allotted under these schemes since the end of 
the financial year to the date of this Report. Details of 
outstanding options under the Group’s Employee and 
Executive Schemes are set out in Note 9 on pages 124 to 
126 which also contains details of options granted over 
unissued share capital.
r ights attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are defined 
in the Company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of 
Association may be changed by special resolution of the 
Company. A Shareholder whose name appears on the 
Company’s Register of Members can choose whether 
his shares are evidenced by share certificates (i.e. in 
certificated form) or held in electronic (i.e. uncertificated) 
form in CREST (the electronic settlement system in the 
UK).
Subject to any restrictions below, Shareholders may 
attend any general meeting of the Company and, on a 
show of hands, every Shareholder (or his representative) 
who is present at a general meeting has one vote on 
each resolution and, on a poll, every Shareholder (or 
his representative) who is present has one vote on each 
resolution for every ordinary share of which they are the 
registered Shareholder. 
A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting is 
decided on a show of hands unless before or on the 
declaration of the result of a vote on a show of hands, 
a poll is demanded by the Chairman of the meeting, or 
by at least five Shareholders (or their representatives) 
present in person and having the right to vote, or by 
any Shareholders (or their representatives) present in 
person having at least 10% of the total voting rights 
of all Shareholders, or by any Shareholders (or their 
representatives) present in person holding ordinary shares 
in which an aggregate sum has been paid up of at least 
one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all ordinary shares.
Shareholders can declare final dividends by passing an 
ordinary resolution but the amount of such dividends 
cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board. 
The Board can pay interim dividends on any class of 
shares of the amounts and on the dates and for the 
periods they decide provided the distributable profits of 
the Company justify such payment. The Board may, if 
authorised by an ordinary resolution of the Shareholders, 
offer any Shareholder the right to elect to receive new 
ordinary shares, which will be credited as fully paid, 
instead of their cash dividend.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for twelve years 
after it became due for payment will be forfeited and will 
then belong to the Company, unless the Directors decide 
otherwise.
if the Company is wound up, the liquidator can, with the 
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed by the 
Shareholders, divide among the Shareholders all or any part 
of the assets of the Company and he/she can value any 
assets and determine how the division shall be carried out 
as between the members or different classes of members. 
The liquidator can also transfer the whole or any part of 
the assets to trustees upon any trusts for the benefit of the 
members. No Shareholders can be compelled to accept 
any asset which would give them a liability.
Voting at general meetings
Any Form of Proxy sent by the Company to Shareholders 
in relation to any general meeting must be delivered to 
the Company, whether in written form or in electronic 
form, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for 
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the 
person named in the appointment proposes to vote.
The Board may determine that the Shareholder is not 
entitled to exercise any right conferred by being a 
Shareholder if he/she or any person with an interest in 
shares has been sent a Notice under Section 793 of 
the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he/she or any 
interested person failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after delivery of 
that Notice. The Board may also decide that no dividend 
is payable in respect of those default shares and that no 
transfer of any default shares shall be registered.
These restrictions end seven days after receipt by the 
Company of a Notice of an approved transfer of the 
shares or all the information required by the relevant 
Section 793 Notice, whichever is the earlier. 24298.02     30 March 2016 2:38 PM      PROOF1

t ransfer of shares
The Board may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does 
not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking 
place on an open and proper basis. The Board may also 
refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share unless: 
(i) the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly stamped (if 
stampable), at the registered office of the Company or 
any other place decided by the Board accompanied by a 
certificate for the share to which it relates and such other 
evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the 
right of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) is in respect 
of only one class of shares; and (iii) is in favour of not more 
than four transferees.
Transfer of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Board can refuse to register a transfer of 
an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST.
Variation of rights
if at any time the capital of the Company is divided into 
different classes of shares, the special rights attaching to 
any class may be varied or revoked either:
(i) with the written consent of the holders of at least 75% 
in nominal value of the issued shares of the class; or
(ii) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a separate general meeting of the holders 
of the shares of the class.
The Company can issue new shares and attach any 
rights to them. if there is no restriction by special rights 
attaching to existing shares, rights attaching to new 
shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, 
or the new shares and the existing shares are deemed 
to be varied (unless the rights expressly allow it) by a 
reduction of paid up capital, or if another share of that 
same class is issued and ranks in priority for payment of 
dividend, or in respect of capital or more favourable voting 
rights.
election and re-election of directors
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, of which 
special notice has been given in accordance with the 
Companies Act, remove any Director before the expiration 
of his/her period of office. The office of a Director shall be 
vacated if:
(i) 
He/she ceases to be a Director by virtue of any 
provision of law or is removed pursuant to the 
Company’s Articles of Association or he/she becomes 
prohibited by law from being a Director;
(ii)

of the Company that he/she remains a Director; or
(ix) 
The conduct of the Director is the subject of an 
investigation and the Directors resolve that it is 
undesirable in the interests of the Company that he/
she remains a Director.
agreements with employees and significant 
agreements (contracts of significance)
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, 
purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because 
of a takeover bid.

upon a change of control of the Company. Certain other 
indebtedness becomes repayable if a change of control 
leads to a downgrade in the credit rating of the Company.

difference between the book value and the current 
open market value of the Group’s interests in land and 
buildings.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
On behalf of the Board i am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee Report for 2015.
KPMG LLP was appointed as the Group’s outsourced 
internal Audit function with effect from 1 January 2014, 
and their work continues to provide a fresh focus to key 
areas of risk and control.
KPMG’s internal Control Review undertaken in December 
2014 supports the view that the Group has an effective 
system of internal financial control. Management actions 
continued to be taken to improve controls and bring 
efficiencies across the business in 2015. in 2014 KPMG 
performed an implementation review and there has 
been further focus this year on iT, in particular a post 
implementation review of the ERP system in the UK. 
Reviews were undertaken in iT performance management 
and Group iT strategy, to identify improvements to the 
control environment. As a result of the creation of the new 
role of Chief information Officer in 2014 (giving further 
focus to iT strategy and controls across the Group), iT and 
cyber security will continue to be a key area of focus in 
2016.
Although going concern is a matter for the whole Board 
(see page 39), a review is made by the Audit Committee of 
the Group’s headroom under its covenants and undrawn 
facilities in relation to the Group’s financial forecasts and 
sensitivity analyses.
The Committee has again considered the issue of external 
Auditor rotation and, although continuing to keep this 
under review, currently intends to next tender the Audit in 
2018. Further detail is provided in this Report.
The Company has complied during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2015 with the provisions of The 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014 that are applicable to it.

AUDIT COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
As at 31 December 2015, the Committee comprised 
the five independent Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company.
Chairman of the Committee Members
Mr J.C. Nicholls Ms J.E. Ashdown, Mr M. Ewell,  
Mr C.V. Geoghegan and Ms A. Abt
The Board considers that each member of the Committee 
is independent within the definition set out in the 
Code. The combined relevant commercial and financial 
knowledge and experience of the Committee members 
satisfies compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) provision C.3.1.
AUDIT COMMITTEE STRUCTURE
The Committee operates under Terms of Reference 
which can be found on the Company’s website. They 
are reviewed annually by the Committee, including 
comparison against the Code, and changes are 
recommended to the Board for approval.
The Committee has in its Terms of Reference the power 
to engage outside advisors and to obtain its own 
independent external advice at the Company’s expense, 
should it be deemed necessary. During 2015 no member 
of the Committee, nor the Committee collectively, found 
it necessary to obtain such separate advice beyond the 
advice that is directly provided to the Committee by the 
external Auditor, Deloitte LLP or from KPMG LLP , who 
operate the Group’s outsourced internal Audit function.
As part of Corporate Governance the Committee reviews 
its own performance annually and considers where 
improvements can be made. The Committee reviewed its 
own performance in December 2015 and the results of 
this review were reported to the Board. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the subsequent 
meeting of the Board on the key issues covered by the 
Committee, identifying any matters on which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed, and makes 
recommendations on the steps to be taken.
MEETINGS
The Committee meets regularly throughout the year, with 
five meetings being held during 2015. its agenda is linked 
to events in the Company’s financial calendar.
Attendance by individual members of the Committee 
is disclosed in the table on page 62. The Committee 
Chairman regularly invites senior Company executives to 
attend meetings of the Committee to discuss or present 
specific items, and in particular the Group Finance 
Director, Mr D.G. Robertson, attended all five of the 
meetings in 2015. The external Auditor attended meetings 
of the Committee on four occasions and has direct access 
to the Committee Chairman. The external Auditor meets 
periodically, and in between Committee meetings, with 
members of the Committee without the Chairman of the 
Board and the Executive Directors being present. KPMG 
LLP , who provides an outsourced internal Audit function 
for the Group, attends meetings to present its reports. The 
Committee also meets with KPMG without the Executive 
Directors being present, and the Committee Chairman 
meets regularly with KPMG outside of the formal 
meetings.

in place to ensure that the reporting, reviewing and 
accounting for supplier rebate income is properly 
managed and that supplier rebates are recognised 
appropriately in the Group financial statements.
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
The carrying value of goodwill is systematically reviewed 
at each mid-year point and at year end. A consistent 
methodology is applied to the individual cash generating 
units, taking account of market outlook, risk-adjusted 
discounted future cash flows, sensitivities, and other 
factors which may have a bearing on impairment 
considerations.
Disclosure of “Other items”
The Committee gave careful consideration to the 
judgments made in the separate disclosure of “Other 
items”. in particular, the Committee sought to ensure 
that the treatment followed consistent principles and that 
reporting in the Group financial statements is suitably 
clear and understandable.
Recognition and measurement of trade receivables
Methodologies and judgments applied in establishing 
provisions for trade receivables were examined to ensure 
consistent application and appropriateness to the trading 
position of the Group.
OVERSIGHT OF INTERNAL AUDIT
The internal Audit function provides independent 
assurance to senior management and the Board on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of SiG’s risk management 
framework. internal Audit forms an independent and 
objective assessment as to whether: risks have been 
adequately identified; adequate internal controls are 
in place to manage those risks; and those controls are 
working effectively. The results of all assignments have 
been reported to the Audit Committee during the year. 
Areas of weakness that were identified during the year 
prompted a detailed action plan and a follow-up audit 
check to establish that actions had been completed. No 
failings or weaknesses were identified during the year 
which had a material effect on the Company’s financial 
performance.
The Audit Committee notes that the Company operates a 
Control Self Assessment (“CSA”) internal control process 
to support the internal audit process. This process is 
summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 65 and 66. 
KPMG LLP was appointed on 1 January 2014 in place of 
EY LLP to provide the outsourced internal Audit function. 
The appointment followed a full review process which 
involved tenders being made by five accountancy firms 
leading to a shortlist of three firms from which a candidate 
was recommended. The process was carried out by 
the Group Finance Director and the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee who then recommended KPMG to the 
Audit Committee as the selected internal audit provider. 
Their appointment was then recommended by the Audit 
Committee to the Board, and was approved by the Board.

OVERSIGHT OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Board is aware of the need to maintain an appropriate 
degree of independence and objectivity on the part of the 
Group’s external Auditor. The external Auditor reports to 
the Committee on the actions taken to comply with both 
professional and regulatory requirements and with best 
practice designed to ensure its independence. 
The Group has an agreed policy with regard to the 
provision of audit and non-audit services by the external 
Auditor, which was operated throughout 2015. The policy 
is based on the principles that they should undertake non-
audit services only where they are the most appropriate 
and cost-effective provider of the service, and where the 
provision of non-audit services does not impair, or is not 
perceived to impair, the external Auditor’s independence 
and objectivity. it categorises such services as Auditor-
permitted services, Auditor-excluded services and 
Auditor-authorised services. The policy, which can be 
viewed on the Company’s website (www.sigplc.com), 
defines the types of services falling under each category 
and sets out the criteria to be met and the internal 
approvals required prior to the commencement of any 
Auditor-authorised services.
The external Auditor cannot be engaged to perform any 
assignment where the output is then subject to their 
review as external Auditor. The Committee regularly 
reviews an analysis of all services provided by the external 
Auditor. The policy and the external Auditor’s fees are 
reviewed and set annually by the Committee and are 
approved by the Board.
The total sum invoiced to the Group by its external Auditor 
for non-audit services in 2015 was £0.1m, primarily the 
interim Review (2014: £0.1m). The total sum invoiced by 
them for audit services in respect of the same period was 
£1.4m (2014: £1.3m). A full breakdown of Auditor fees 
are disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on page 120.
The external Auditor reports to the Committee each 
year on the actions taken to comply with professional 
and regulatory requirements and best practice designed 
to ensure its independence, including the rotation of 
key members of the external audit team. Deloitte LLP 
has formally confirmed its independence to the Board 
in respect of the period covered by these financial 
statements.
in August 2015, the Committee undertook its annual 
review of the effectiveness of the external Auditor 
and considered the reappointment of Deloitte LLP . A 
questionnaire was sent to the Finance Directors of each 
of the Group’s operating companies, which provided the 
Committee with an overall view across the Group. From 
this questionnaire and further discussions, the Committee 
is satisfied that Deloitte LLP continues to provide an 
effective audit service.
AUDIT TENDER
During the year, the Committee considered the Group’s 
position on its Auditor services, taking into account the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, together with the EU 
Audit Directive and Regulation and the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Having previously acted as Auditor to parts of the Group 
since 2003, Deloitte LLP was invited to tender for the 
entire Group audit in 2005 and this resulted in their 
appointment as the Group’s external Auditor.
As noted previously, the Committee continues to review 
the performance of the external Auditor and has been 
satisfied with the independence, objectivity, expertise, 
resources and general effectiveness of Deloitte LLP , and 
that the Group is subjected to a rigorous audit process. 
The Committee does not consider it necessary to conduct 
a tender process for the appointment of the Company’s 
Auditor at this time, although the Committee will continue 
to keep this under review. 
The current lead audit partner took over the audit for 
the year ended 31 December 2013. The Committee is 
currently of the view that it is potentially more effective to 
align the tender of the external Auditor with the rotation 
of the current lead audit partner, which is due in 2018, by 
making use of the transition arrangements outlined by 
the Financial Reporting Council in relation to the Code 
and retaining the Company’s existing audit firm until 
conclusion of the term of its current lead partner.
The Committee recommends, and the Board agrees, 
that a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
as Auditor of the Company for a further year will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The 
Committee intends that the audit contract will be put out 
to tender in 2017, in order that a decision can be taken 
and communicated to Shareholders at the 2018 AGM, 
with the new audit contract being effective for the 2018 
interim Review and final audit.

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
The Committee has reviewed the contents of this year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts and advised the Board that, 
in its view, the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the necessary information to enable Shareholders to 
assess the position and performance, strategy and 
business model of the Company.
in reaching this conclusion the Committee has considered 
the following:
 Æ The preparation of the Annual Report is a collaborative 
process between Finance, Legal, Human Resources, 
investor Relations and Communications functions 
within SiG, ensuring the appropriate professional 
input to each section. External guidance and advice is 
sought where appropriate;
 Æ The coordination and project management is 
undertaken by a central team to ensure consistency 
and completeness of the document;
 Æ An extensive review process is undertaken, both 
internally and through the use of external advisors; and
 Æ A final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee 
members prior to consideration by the Board.
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit 
Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance 
with its Terms of Reference and has ensured the 
independence and objectivity of the external Auditor.

Nominations Committee Report
PURPOSE AND AIM
The Nominations Committee has an important role to 
play in ensuring that the Board has the right balance of 
experience and skills to support the Group’s strategy. its 
principal duty is the nomination of suitable candidates 
for the approval of the Board to fill Executive and Non-
Executive vacancies on the Board. Members of the 
Committee are not involved in matters affecting their own 
positions.
The Committee keeps under review and evaluates the 
composition of the Board and its Committees to maintain 
the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and independence to ensure their continued effectiveness. 
Appropriate succession plans for the Non-Executive 
Directors, Executive Directors and the Group’s Senior 
Management are also kept under review.
MEETINGS AND MEMBERSHIP
During the year the Committee met on four occasions. A 
quorum is three members, the majority of whom shall be 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
operates under written Terms of Reference, which are 
consistent with current best practice and are available on 
the Company’s website (www.sigplc.com).
As at 31 December 2015, the Committee comprised the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive and the five independent 
Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
Chairman of the Committee Members
Mr L. Van de Walle Ms J.E. Ashdown, Mr M. Ewell,  
Mr C.V. Geoghegan, Mr J.C. Nicholls,  
Ms A. Abt and Mr S.R. Mitchell
RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACTIVITIES 
DURING THE YEAR
The Committee reviews the structure, size, diversity and 
composition of the Board and makes recommendations 
concerning the reappointment of any Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of their specified term of 
office and in the identification and nomination of new 
Directors. During the year, the Committee (in recognising 
the impact of the Davies Report) ensured that skills, 
experience, potential and overall balance of the Board, as 
well as diversity including gender, were fully considered 
in relation to the Board appointments made during the 
year. The Committee retains external search and selection 
consultants as appropriate. The Committee also advises 
the Board on succession planning for Executive Board 
appointments although the Board itself is responsible for 
succession generally. All appointments to the Board will 
continue to be made on merit, however differences in 
background, skills, experience and other qualities as well 
as gender are considered in determining the optimum 
composition of the Board, with the aim to balance them 
appropriately.
BOARD SUCCESSION PLANNING
in accordance with best practice and The Financial 
Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) discussion paper entitled ‘UK 
Board Succession Planning’, the Committee continues 
to review and monitor its Board succession planning 
process, in particular by rigorously reviewing and 
taking into account the need for progressive refreshing 
of the Board. The Committee carefully reviews and 
makes recommendations to the Board concerning the 
re-appointment of any Non-Executive Director at the 
conclusion of their specified terms of office.
The Committee considered the positions of Mr C.V. 
Geoghegan and Mr J.C. Nicholls, both of whom 
completed their second three year periods of office 
in July and November 2015 respectively, and both of 
whom were appointed to serve for a further term of office 
expiring at the May 2016 Annual General Meeting. it 
was the Committee’s view that, noting the experience 
and tenure of the Non-Executive Directors, together with 
the Company’s ongoing implementation of its strategic 
initiatives and the focus on achieving a strong recovery in 
2016, it would be in the best interests of the Company’s 
Shareholders, subject to careful and rigorous review, 
for Mr Geoghegan and Mr Nicholls to offer themselves 
for re-election at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. in 
the Committee’s view, Mr Geoghegan and Mr Nicholls 
bring considerable management experience and an 
independent perspective to the Board’s discussions and 
are considered to be independent of management and 
free from relationship or circumstance that could affect 
or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent 
judgment, thereby providing continued valuable support.
Therefore, Mr Geoghegan and Mr Nicholls have, subject 
to their re-election by Shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in May 2016, been invited to serve for a further 
term of office expiring at the May 2017 Annual General 
Meeting.
As part of the Board succession planning process, 
which was discussed at the Committee’s December 
2015 meeting, a search and selection procedure 
for independent Non-Executive Directors would be 
undertaken prior to the 2017 Annual General Meeting.

in June 2015, the Committee undertook a Talent & 
Succession Review which encompassed the Group’s 
senior management. This was undertaken in conjunction 
with the Group Human Resources Director and was 
intended to support the Group’s strategy and growth 
plans. The review covered: purpose and focus; bench 
strength and pipeline assessment; and workforce profile 
assessment and actions. This review forms part of the 
Committee’s annual agenda.
GENERAL
in general terms, when considering candidates 
for appointment as Directors of the Company, the 
Nominations Committee, in conjunction with the Board, 
drafts a detailed job specification and candidate profile. 
in drafting this, consideration would be given to the 
existing experience, knowledge and background of Board 
members as well as the strategic and business objectives 
of the Group.
Once a detailed specification has been agreed with 
the Board, the Committee would then work with an 
appropriate external search and selection agency to 
identify candidates of the appropriate calibre and with 
whom an initial candidate shortlist could be agreed. 
The consultants are required to work to a specification 
that includes the strong desirability of producing a 
full list of candidates who meet the essential criteria, 
whilst reflecting the benefits of diversity. The Board 
will only engage such consultants who are signed up 
to the voluntary code of conduct on gender diversity 
on corporate boards. The policy on Board Diversity is 
available on the Company’s website (www.sigplc.com). 
Shortlisted candidates would then be invited to interview 
with members of the Committee and, if recommended by 
the Committee, would be invited to meet the entire Board 
before any decision is taken relating to the appointment. 
During the year under review, in connection with the 
appointment of Ms A. Abt, the Committee used the 
services of Ridgeway Partners (who have no other 
connection with the Company).
This process was followed in respect of the appointment 
of Ms Abt as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 
12 March 2015. 
Following the appointment of a new Director, the 
Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, 
is responsible for ensuring that a full, formal and tailored 
induction to the Company is given. Although not an 
exhaustive list, the induction includes one-to-one 
meetings with key management (including HR, Finance, 
Risk, investor Relations and Corporate Development) 
and an overview of the Group’s structure and strategy 
(including site visits and an overview of operations).
The Committee also carefully reviews and makes 
recommendations concerning the reappointment of any 
Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of their specified 
terms of office. 
in December 2013, the Board had discussed the matter of 
women on boards, and had set out the aim of achieving 
at least 25% female representation among the Board’s 
membership by 2015. Following the appointment of Ms 
A. Abt on 12 March 2015, female representation on the 
Board has risen to 25%. The Committee will continue to 
consider gender diversity when recommending any future 
Board appointments. Final appointments will always be 
made on merit.
As part of corporate governance, the Committee reviews 
its own performance annually and considers where 
improvements can be made. The Committee reviewed its 
own performance in December 2015 and the results of 
this review were reported to the Board.
The proposed activities for the Committee in 2016 
will be to continue to monitor and assess the Board’s 
composition and diversity, longer-term succession 
planning and potential further recruitment of Non-
Executive Directors, in conjunction with The FRC’s 
discussion paper on UK Board Succession Planning.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Report – Annual Statement
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
On behalf of the Board, i am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee’s (“the Committee”) Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2015.
Similarly to last year, this report is split into three sections: 
the Annual Statement; the Directors’ Remuneration Policy; 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration (with the Annual 
Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration being 
subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM). 
Our Remuneration Policy, detailed on pages 81 to 88, 
remains consistent with that approved by Shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM, and is reproduced in full for both ease of 
reference and in order to provide context to the decisions 
taken by the Committee during the year.
SiG’s strategy over 2015 has been to focus on seeking 
to grow our three core markets of insulation and Energy 
Management, Exteriors and interiors by combining the 
reputational strengths of our local brands with the scale 
efficiencies and know-how of a multinational group. 
Moreover, with its focus on specialist expertise and 
high customer service levels, SiG aims to continue to 
outperform its markets and thereby generate sustainable 
long-term growth in Shareholder value. SiG’s goal is 
to be the leading specialist solutions provider to the 
construction industry.
KEY ACTIVITIES
The activities of the Committee and key decisions taken 
in 2015 are set out on page 89 and are summarised 
below. During the year, the Committee considered SiG’s 
Remuneration Policy and concluded that the current 
structure – made up of base salary and benefits, an 
annual bonus plan and a single long-term incentive plan – 
continues to be appropriate.
r eview of base salaries 
Towards the end of the year the Committee reviewed the 
salaries of our Executive Directors. This review took into 
account a number of factors including an assessment of 
individual experience and performance, pay conditions 
across the Group, economic factors and the Group’s 
environment. Following this review, the Committee agreed 
that base salaries for the Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and members of the Senior Leadership Team 
would not increase for 2016, whilst the average increase 
across the remainder of the Group, effective 1 January 
2016 was 1.5%.
annual bonus 
For the year ended 31 December 2015, underlying 
profit before tax (“PBT”) was £87.4m and Return on 
Capital Employed (“ROCE”) was 9.3%. The objective 
linked to savings from the Group Strategic initiatives 
was partially achieved and the Health & Safety target 
was achieved. The resulting annual bonus outcome was 
therefore 17.7%of salary for both the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director. However, in the context of 
the challenging operating conditions and the Group’s 
performance in 2015, both the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director have taken the decision to waive their 
entitlement to the 2015 annual bonuses. 
Following a review of the annual bonus in 2014, the 
Committee made an evolutionary change to the mix of 
performance measures to better support the Company 
ethos of “Stronger Together”, as reflected in the 2015 
bonus metrics. The metrics for the 2016 annual bonus 
will remain unchanged from 2015, and will be linked 55% 
to Group underlying PBT, 20% to ROCE, 15% to savings 
from the Group Strategic initiatives and 10% to Health & 
Safety.
Lt Ip
Awards granted in 2013 under the Long-Term incentive 
Plan (“LTiP”) will vest in early 2016 based on performance 
to 31 December 2015. These awards were based two-
thirds on ROCE and one-third on underlying earnings per 
share (“EPS”); the performance conditions were partially 
met to the extent that 19.5% of the awards will vest.
For 2016, the LTiP will continue to be linked to ROCE and 
EPS, have a three year performance period plus a two 
year holding period on vested shares, and remain subject 
to clawback and malus provisions.
Malus and clawback
Last year, the Committee noted the requirement for 
both malus and clawback provisions to be included in 
incentives under the updated UK Corporate Governance 
Code. i am pleased to report that the Committee 
took action in 2015 in order to implement clawback 
provisions in the Company’s incentive schemes. Malus 
and clawback provisions are in place for awards made 
in or after September 2015 in respect of the LTiP , and for 
awards made on or after 1 January 2016 in respect of the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) and annual bonus.
The Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy during 
the year, and determined that it remained appropriately 
aligned with strategy and fit for purpose. The policy will be 
reviewed comprehensively later in the year, ahead of the 
2017 AGM. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM. We continue 
to value any feedback from Shareholders and hope to 
receive your support at the AGM.

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
This report, prepared by the Committee on behalf of the 
Board, takes full account of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) and the latest ABi/PLSA guidelines 
and has been prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”), the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Act requires 
the Auditor to report to the Company’s Shareholders on 
the audited information within this report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have 
been prepared in accordance with the Act. The Auditor’s 
opinion is set out on pages 153 to 157 and those aspects 
of the report that have been subject to audit are clearly 
marked.
it is considered that throughout the year under review the 
Company has complied with the governance rules and 
best practice provisions applying to UK-listed companies.
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration 
Policy for Executive Directors in accordance with Section 
439A of the Act. The Remuneration Policy was approved 
by Shareholders at the AGM on 16 May 2014, and 
took effect from that date. The report that follows is as 
disclosed in the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report 
save a number of non-significant changes (as permitted 
by the terms of the Remuneration Policy approved by 
Shareholders) as follows:
 Æ References to financial years have been updated where 
appropriate;
 Æ Pay-for-performance scenario charts have been 
updated to reflect 2016 salaries;
 Æ Current Non-Executive Director appointment expiry 
dates have been updated; and
 Æ Malus provisions have been clarified with respect to 
incentives awarded in respect of 2015 and previous 
years, and clawback has been introduced, and was 
applied from 1 January 2016 in respect of the annual 
bonus and DSBP , and from September 2015 awards in 
respect of the LTiP .
CONSIDERATIONS OF CONDITIONS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee considers the pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining 
remuneration for Executive Directors, and the Company 
seeks to promote good relationships with employee 
representative bodies as part of its employee engagement 
strategy. However, the Committee does not currently 
consult specifically with employees on the Executive 
Remuneration Policy.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into 
account the guidelines of investor bodies and Shareholder 
views. The Committee is always open to feedback 
from Shareholders on the Remuneration Policy and 
arrangements, and commits to undertaking Shareholder 
consultation in advance of any significant changes to the 
Remuneration Policy. Further detail on the votes received 
on the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
Committee’s response are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company’s policy is to provide remuneration 
packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for 
the contribution they make to the business and that are 
appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right 
calibre. The policy is designed to align the Executive 
Directors’ interests with those of Shareholders, and to 
incentivise the Executive Directors to meet the Company’s 
financial and strategic objectives such that a significant 
proportion of remuneration is performance-related. The 
Group’s financial and strategic objectives are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 12 to 19. The Remuneration 
Policy for Executive Directors is summarised in the table 
overleaf:

significant change in responsibilities, 
taking into account the individual’s 
performance and experience, with 
reference to published remuneration 
information from similar sized 
companies (excluding financial 
services) and companies operating in 
a similar sector. The Committee also 
takes account of the annual salary 
review for the rest of the Group.
Base salary increases will 
be applied in line with the 
outcome of the review.
in respect of existing 
Executive Directors, it is 
anticipated that salary 
increases will be within 
the range of increases 
for the general employee 
population over the term 
of this policy. 
in exceptional 
circumstances (including, 
but not limited to, a 
significant increase in 
role size or complexity) 
the Committee has 
discretion to make 
appropriate adjustments 
to salary levels to ensure 
they remain market 
competitive.
Not applicable.
Benefits To provide 
benefits that are 
appropriately 
competitive 
within the 
relevant labour 
market.
Benefits include (but are not 
necessarily limited to) a company 
car, medical and permanent health 
insurance. Benefits are reviewed 
annually and their value is not 
pensionable.
Benefits may vary by role. 
it is not anticipated that 
the cost of benefits will 
exceed £35,000 per 
annum per Executive 
Director over the term of 
this policy.
The Committee 
retains the discretion 
to approve a higher 
cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. 
relocation) or in 
circumstances driven 
by factors outside the 
Company’s control (e.g. 
material increases in 
insurance premiums).
Not applicable.
Pension To provide 
retirement 
benefits that are 
appropriately 
competitive 
within the 
relevant labour 
market.
New joiners will participate in the 
Company’s defined contribution 
pension scheme (open to all UK-based 
employees of the Group) or receive a

The two current Executive Directors 
participate in the defined contribution 
pension scheme.
Defined contribution: SiG 
contributes 15% of base 
salary.

Incentive Plan 
(“SIP”)
To encourage 
share ownership 
across all 
UK-based 
employees 
using HMRC 
tax-advantaged 
schemes.
The SiP is an HMRC tax-advantaged 
arrangement which entitles all UK-
based employees to purchase shares 
and receive matching shares in a 
potentially tax-advantageous manner. 
The Company gives one matching 
share for each share purchased by the 
employee up to a maximum of £20 
each month.
Maximum opportunity is 
in line with HMRC limits. 
The SiP is an all-
employee scheme and 
Executive Directors 
participate on the 
same terms as other 
employees. The 
acquisition of shares is 
therefore not subject 
to the satisfaction of a 
performance target.

the financial 
year in line with 
the Group’s 
strategy.
The annual bonus is reviewed annually 
prior to the start of each financial 
year to ensure bonus opportunity, 
performance measures, targets 
and weightings are appropriate and 
continue to support the strategy.
Executive Directors are required to 
defer one-third of their bonus into an 
award over SiG shares for a period of 
three years under the DSBP .
Effective from the 2015 performance 
year (i.e. payments from 1 January 
2016), the bonus is subject to 
malus and clawback, i.e. forfeiture 
or reduction of the deferred portion 
or recovery of paid amounts, in 
exceptional circumstances. Such 
circumstances may include (but are 
not limited to) material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial results or 
gross misconduct. in respect of 
bonuses up to the 2014 performance 
year, only malus provisions apply.
Dividend equivalents are payable over 
the vesting period in respect of the 
awards which vest.
Maximum annual 
opportunity of up to 
100% of salary.
For entry level and target 
performance, the bonus 
earned is up to 30% and 
up to 65% of maximum 
respectively.
Performance is 
determined by 
the Committee on 
an annual basis 
by reference to 
Group financial 
measures, as well 
as the achievement 
of personal and/or 
strategic objectives.
The personal/strategic 
element will not be 
weighted more than 
30% of the total in any 
year.
When assessing 
financial performance, 
the Committee 
typically considers 
underlying PBT 
and Group working 
capital, as well as 
other indicators of 
performance defined 
at the start of the 
year. Performance 
targets are generally 
calibrated with 
reference to the 
Group’s budget for the 
year.
Details of the 
measures and 
weightings applicable 
for the financial 
year under review 
are provided in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
To reward and 
retain Executive 
Directors 
to deliver 
the Group’s 
long-term 
strategy whilst 
providing strong 
alignment with 
Shareholders.
Executive Directors are 
granted annual awards of nil-cost 
options or contingent rights to acquire 
shares for no cost as determined by 
the Committee, which vest based on 
performance over three years.
To encourage long-term decision 
making and further improve 
Shareholder alignment, the Committee 
introduced a two year holding period 
on vested LTiP awards for awards 
made in 2014 and subsequent years. 
Performance will continue to be 
measured over three years.
From 2015, awards are subject to 
malus and clawback, i.e. forfeiture 
or reduction of unvested awards 
or recovery of vested awards, in 
exceptional circumstances (e.g. 
material misstatement or gross 
misconduct)
Dividend equivalents are payable 
over the five year vesting and holding 
period in respect of the awards which 
vest.
Maximum annual award 
of up to 150% of salary.
in exceptional 
circumstances, such as to 
facilitate the recruitment 
of an external hire, the 
Committee may, in its 
absolute discretion, 
exceed this maximum 
annual opportunity, up to 
200% of salary.
Threshold performance 
will result in no more than 
25% vesting.
Vesting of LTiP awards 
is subject to the 
Group’s performance 
over a three year 
performance period. 
if no entitlement is 
earned at the end 
of the performance 
period, awards will 
lapse.
The performance 
measures and 
respective weightings 
may vary year-on-year 
to reflect strategic 
priorities, subject to 
retaining an element 
on underlying EPS 
growth and ROCE. 
Details of the 
measures, weightings 
and performance 
targets used for 
specific LTiP grants 
are included in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy 
on pages 81 to 88 is in the best interests of Shareholders 
and does not promote excessive risk-taking. The 
Committee will consider the Company’s performance 
on environmental, social and governance issues when 
determining the overall reward for the Executive Directors, 
and has discretion to make adjustments as appropriate. 
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-
significant changes to the policy without reverting to 
Shareholders.
NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY 
TABLE
payments from existing awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment under 
any award made prior to the approval and implementation 
of the Remuneration Policy including under the existing 
LTiP .
Lt Ip awards
Awards under the new LTiP may be structured in a manner 
which delivers tax advantages to the Executive Directors 
but the value delivered will be no greater than as set out in 
the table on page 83.
selection of performance measures
The performance measures used under the annual 
performance bonus are selected annually to reflect the 
Group’s main strategic objectives for the year and reflect 
both financial and non-financial priorities.
The Committee continues to believe that ROCE reinforces 
the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong 
returns for our Shareholders, thereby further strengthening 
the alignment of management’s incentives with SiG’s 
strategy. The Committee also continues to believe that 
underlying EPS is a key driver of long-term Shareholder 
value for SiG.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and 
achievable, taking into account the Group’s strategic 
priorities and the economic environment in which the 
Company operates. Targets are set taking into account a 
range of reference points including the Group’s strategic 
plan and broker forecasts for both SiG and its peers. The 
Committee believes that the performance targets set are 
very challenging and that the maximum outcomes are only 
available for truly outstanding performance.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER 
EMPLOYEES
Our approach to salary reviews is consistent across 
the Group, with consideration given to the level of 
responsibility, experience, individual performance, salary 
levels in comparable companies and the Company’s 
ability to pay. Remuneration surveys are referenced, where 
appropriate, to establish market rates. 
Senior Managers participate in an annual bonus plan 
which has similar performance targets to those of the 
Executive Directors. A limited number of Senior Managers 
also receive LTiP awards. Performance conditions are 
consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary 
by organisational level. All UK employees are eligible to 
participate in the SiP on the same terms. 
Pension and benefits arrangements are tailored to local 
market conditions, and so various arrangements are 
in place for different populations within SiG. Executive 
Directors participate in the same pension scheme as other 
senior managers.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT 
REMUNERATION
The Committee’s policy is to set pay for new Executive 
Directors within the existing Remuneration Policy in order 
to provide internal consistency. The Committee aims to 
ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary 
to appoint individuals of an appropriate calibre. 
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
To ensure alignment between Executive Director interests 
and those of Shareholders, the Company has established 
the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build 
up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the 
Company equivalent to a minimum of 200% of base 
salary. Under normal circumstances it is expected that 
this should be achieved within five years of appointment. 
it is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be 
mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the 
Company’s share plans.

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
in the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of 
remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual 
grant value
Base salary The base salary will be determined by reference to the scope and responsibility of the position as 
well as internal relativities and their current remuneration. Where a new appointee has an initial 
base salary set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period 
of years, subject to the Executive Director’s development in the role, which may result in above-
average salary increases during this period.
n/a
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include (but are not limited to) a 
company car, medical and permanent health insurance.
n/a
Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Company’s defined contribution pension 
scheme or receive a cash equivalent payment.
n/a
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SiP . n/a
Annual bonus The plan as described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum 
being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year employed. Targets for the personal element
will be tailored to the role of the appointee.
100% of salary 
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTiP on the same terms as other Executives,
as described in the policy table.
200% of salary
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a 
new appointment to “buy out” incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer and may exercise 
the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule 
to facilitate this, i.e. in the event that a different structure 
would be required. in doing so, the Committee will ensure 
that “buyout awards” would have a fair value no higher 
than that of the awards forfeited and would consider 
relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those 
conditions being met, and the remaining vesting period 
of these awards. Where, in the Committee’s opinion, 
awards forfeited are still subject (at date of appointment) 
to substantive performance conditions, any awards made 
in compensation will have SiG-specific performance 
conditions attached.
INTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by 
way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in 
line with the policy for external appointees, as detailed 
above. Where an individual has contractual commitments 
made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company 
will continue to honour these arrangements. incentive 
opportunities for below Board employees are typically 
no higher than for Executive Directors, but incentive 
measures may vary to provide better line of sight. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE 
CONTRACTS AND LEAVER/CHANGE OF 
CONTROL PROVISIONS AND POLICY FOR 
LOSS OF OFFICE
The Committee sets notice periods for the Executive 
Directors (including future Executive Directors) at twelve 
months. 
Subject to the considerations set out overleaf, the 
Company’s policy is to limit termination payments 
to pre-established contractual arrangements. in the 
event that the employment of an Executive Director is 
terminated, any compensation payable will be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the service contract 
between the Company and the employee, as well as the 
rules of any incentive plans.
if employment is terminated by the Company, the 
departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement 
(under statute or otherwise) to additional amounts, which 
would need to be met. in addition, the Committee retains 
discretion to settle any claims by or on behalf of the 
Executive Director in return for making an appropriate 
payment and contributing to the legal fees incurred by the 
Executive Director in connection with the termination of 
employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a 
settlement agreement (as provided for overleaf) and the 
individual must seek independent legal advice.

PROVISIONS AND POLICY FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (CONTINUED)
There is no provision in the Executive Directors’ contracts for compensation to be payable on termination of their 
contract over and above sums due in respect of notice and accrued but untaken holiday, and as outlined overleaf 
regarding bonus and LTiP . Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
in certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive 
Directors including (but not limited to) settlement, confidentiality, outplacement services, restrictive covenants and/or 
consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in 
the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders to do so.
The table below provides details of the main terms of Executive Director service contracts and termination payments 
not otherwise set out in this report.
Provision Policy 
Duration Continuous term subject to notice or reaching retirement age.
Holiday 30 working days’ holiday plus public holidays per holiday year.
Notice period Twelve months’ notice period in writing by either party, save in circumstances justifying summary termination.
Exit payments The Executive Directors will be paid a sum equal to base salary and the value of contractual benefits (or receive the benefits 
themselves) which will not include a bonus. The Company may pay as a lump sum or in instalments and may require the 
Executive Director to mitigate his loss by seeking alternative employment. Where phasing payments, any income received 
from a third party shall be deducted from sums due to the Company.
The Company will take account of all the circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining whether to exercise its 
discretion, including the need for an orderly handover and the contribution of the Executive Director to the success of the 
Company during his or her tenure.
Restrictive covenants Apply during the contract and for up to a period of twelve months after leaving, subject to any period served by way of 
gardening leave.

When considering termination payments under incentive plans, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes 
to ensure they are fair to both Shareholders and participants. The table overleaf summarises how the awards under the

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
NED RECRUITMENT
in recruiting a new Chairman or NED, the Committee will 
use the policy as set out in the table above. A base fee 
would be payable for Board membership, with additional 
fees payable for acting as Senior independent Director or 
as Chairman of a Board Committee as appropriate.
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS
The Committee acknowledges that Executive Directors 
may be invited to become independent Non-Executive 
Directors of other quoted companies which have no 
business relationship with the Company and that these 
duties can broaden their experience and knowledge to the 
benefit of the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted to accept such 
appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman. 
Approval will only be given where the appointment does 
not present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities 
and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the 
development of the individual. Where fees are payable in 
respect of such appointments, these would be retained by 
the Executive Director.
The “Minimum” scenario shows base salary, pension and benefits only. These are the only elements of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages which are not at risk. The “On-target” scenario shows fixed remuneration on page 
87, plus a target payout of 50% of the annual bonus and threshold performance vesting for long-term incentives. The 
“Maximum” scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”), including the Chairman, do not have service contracts. The Company’s policy 
is that NEDs are appointed for specific terms of three years unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with the 
Articles of Association or by, and at the discretion of, either party upon three months’ written notice. NED appointments 
are reviewed at the end of each three year term. NEDs will normally be expected to serve two three year terms, although 
the Board may invite them to serve for an additional period.
Summary details of terms and notice periods for NEDs are included below: 
NED Date of current letter of appointment Effective date of appointment Expiry of current term
Mr L. Van de Walle 16 September 2013 1 October 2010 12 May 2016

Mr J. C. Nicholls 6 May 2015 6 November 2009 12 May 2016
NEDs do not receive benefits from the Company and they are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme or 
participate in any bonus or share incentive plan. Any reasonable expenses that they incur in the furtherance of their 
duties are reimbursed by the Company.
Details of the policy on NED fees are set out in the table below:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and process Opportunity
To attract and retain NEDs of the highest 
calibre with experience relevant to the 
Company.
Fees are reviewed annually in May with 
any increase effective from 1 June.
The fee paid to the Chairman is 
determined by the Committee, and fees 
to NEDs are determined by the Board. 
The fees are calculated by reference to 
current market levels and take account 
of the time commitment and the 
responsibilities of the NEDs.
Additional fees are payable for acting 
as Senior independent Director or as 
Chairman of a Board Committee as 
appropriate.
Any fee increases are applied in line with 
the outcome of the review.
it is anticipated that increases to Chairman 
and NED fee levels will typically be in 
line with market levels of fee inflation. in 
exceptional circumstances (including, but 
not limited to, material misalignment with 
the market or a change in the complexity, 
responsibility or time commitment 
required to fulfil an NED role) the Board 
has discretion to make appropriate 
adjustments to fee levels to ensure they 
remain market competitive and fair to the 
Director.
The maximum aggregate fees, per annum, 
for all NEDs allowed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association is £500,000.

Kepler (a brand of Mercer), an independent firm of remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee after 
consultation with the Board, continued to act as the remuneration advisor to the Committee during the year. Kepler 
attends Committee meetings and provides advice on remuneration for Executives, analysis on all elements of the 
Remuneration Policy and regular market and best practice updates. Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman 
and is a signatory to, and abides by the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants of UK-listed companies (which 
can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Kepler’s parent, Mercer, does not provide any other services 
to the Company. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives from Kepler is independent. Kepler’s fees for 
the year in relation to advice to the Committee were charged on a time and materials basis and totalled £10,750 (2014: 
£20,300).
Deloitte LLP , external Auditor to the Group, has, when requested, performed specific procedures on the LTiP 
calculations at the end of the respective performance periods. Deloitte LLP was asked to perform this service in 2015 
and received fees for this service which totalled £2,000 (2014: £nil).

INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR 2015
annual bonus in respect of 2015
in 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors was 100% of salary. 90% of bonus was based on 
financial performance (of which 15% related to savings from the Group Strategic initiatives), and 10% on Health & 
Safety. For the financial performance element, 55% of bonus was linked to underlying PBT, 20% of bonus to the

The Committee reviewed Health & Safety performance during the year, focusing on the Group’s Accident incident Rate 
(“AiR”) and Health & Safety initiatives, and determined that the targets were achieved in full, and 10% of bonus (out of a 
maximum of 10%) was payable.
Therefore, based on performance, an outcome of 17.7% (out of a maximum of 100%) in respect of both financial and 
non-financial elements was warranted for both Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors have taken the decision to waive their 2015 bonuses in light of Group financial performance.

Long-term Incentive plan: 2013 awards
On 18 April 2013, Mr S. R. Mitchell and Mr. D. G. Robertson received an award of 363,036 and 214,191 nil-cost 
options respectively under the 2004 LTiP . Vesting of the award was dependent on three year average ROCE, defined 
as underlying operating profit after tax divided by average net assets plus average net debt (representing two-thirds of 
the award), and three year cumulative underlying EPS performance (representing the remaining one-third of the award). 
There was no re-testing of performance. The performance targets are illustrated overleaf:

For the ROCE element, if three year average ROCE over the three financial years ending 31 December 2015 is less than

line basis between these two points.
Actual average ROCE was 9.47% and cumulative underlying EPS was 33.5p, which resulted in the vesting of c. 7.78% 
and c. 11.67% of the maximum award respectively. 19.5% of the total award will therefore vest on 18 April 2016, 
subject to continued employment.

As disclosed in the Remuneration Policy, the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors 
to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of 200% of base 
salary. Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of appointment. it is 
anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Company’s 
share plans. Executive Directors’ current holdings as measured against the guideline is disclosed on page 97.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN: 2015 AWARDS
On 17 September 2015, Mr S. R. Mitchell and Mr D. G. Robertson were granted awards under the LTiP of 455,838 and 
274,323 shares respectively; details are provided in the table below. The three year period over which performance 
will be measured will be 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant (i.e. 16 September 2018), subject to ROCE and EPS performance. Executive Directors 
will additionally be required to hold any vested awards for a further two year period, to encourage long-term decision-
making and further improve shareholder alignment.

As in previous years, the ROCE and EPS targets have been calibrated with reference to analysis based on internal and 
external data and the Committee’s view of what it believes will provide an appropriate level of stretch.
in order to ensure targets remain commensurately stretching with what was intended at the outset, and also to ensure a 
fair outcome for both participants and Shareholders, the Committee has discretion to adjust the targets as appropriate, 
e.g. to reflect changes in capital, merger and acquisition activity, and any other reason the Committee determines in its 
absolute discretion. Further, if such discretion is exercised, the Committee undertakes to disclose the rationale for its 
decision in the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration the following year.

The Committee agreed that base salaries for the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Senior Leadership Team 
(“SLT”) would remain unchanged and would not increase for 2016. The average salary increase across the remainder of 
the Group for each territory/business for 2016 is 1.5%.

receive benefits in line with the policy.
annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in 2016 will remain unchanged from the opportunity in 
2015 of 100% of salary.
As in 2015, the 2016 bonus will be linked 55% to Group underlying PBT, 20% to ROCE, 15% to savings from the 
Group Strategic initiatives and 10% to Health & Safety. As was the case last year, the Committee has determined that 
performance targets will not be disclosed on a prospective basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but will be 
disclosed on a retrospective basis in the following year’s report. in 2016, financial performance objectives in respect of 
the bonus, will be measured based on budgeted exchange rates at the start of the year. This approach is in line with 
prevailing market practice, was applied in 2015 (in respect of financial performance) and will be consistently applied in 
2016 and future years. Financial performance in respect of the LTiP will continue to be based on actual exchange rates, 
in line with market practice.
As in 2015 and in line with the Remuneration Policy, one-third of the annual bonus will be deferred in SiG shares for a 
period of three years.
As set out in last year’s report, malus and clawback provisions apply to the annual bonus from the performance year 
ending 31 December 2015 (i.e. payments from 1 January 2016).
Lt Ip
in advance of each LTiP cycle, the Committee reviews the performance measures and corresponding targets to 
ensure they are appropriately stretching over the performance period. The Committee intends to make LTiP awards in 
September 2016, and will determine the appropriate measures and targets closer to the time and disclose them in the 
2016 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Malus and clawback
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Letter, the Committee last year noted the requirement for both malus and clawback 
provisions to be included in incentives under the updated UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee took 
action in 2015 in order to implement clawback provisions in the Company’s incentive schemes. Malus and clawback 
provisions are in place for awards made in and after September 2015 in respect of the LTiP , and for awards made on or 
after 1 January 2016 in respect of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) and annual bonus.
c hairman and Non-executive director fees
With effect from 1 May 2015, the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board is £168,000 p.a. and the basic fee payable 
to each Non-Executive Director is £48,204 p.a. The fees payable for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
are £10,000 and £8,000 p.a. respectively. The additional fee paid for being Senior independent Director is £2,000 p.a. 
Non-Executive Director fees are reviewed in May each year.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CHIEF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration from the prior year compared 
to the average percentage change in remuneration for all other employees being the SLT. To provide a meaningful 
comparison, the analysis includes only salaried employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same 
individuals appear in the 2015 and 2014 populations.
Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local 
market conditions, the Committee believes that using the SLT as a subset for purposes of comparing Chief Executive 
pay against wider employee pay provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.

the difference between the closing mid-market price of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the 
options, disregarding whether such shares were sold or retained on exercise, and is stated before tax.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Accounts for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group Accounts in accordance with international Financial Reporting Standards (“iFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the iAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law) including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the Accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
in preparing the Parent Company Accounts, the Directors are required to:
 Æ Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 Æ Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 Æ State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Accounts; and
 Æ Prepare the Accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
in preparing the Group Accounts, international Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 Æ Properly select and apply accounting policies;
 Æ Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 Æ Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in iFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
 Æ Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the Accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Accounts 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement

The significant accounting policies adopted in this Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are set  
out below.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Accounts have been prepared in accordance with international Financial Reporting Standards (“iFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”), and therefore the Group Accounts comply with Article 4 of the EU iAS Regulation.
The Accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at 
their fair value.
The Accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as set out on page 39.
The following standard was amended in the current period:
 Æ iAS 19 “Employee Benefits” (amended).
Adoption of the above standard has not had a material impact on the Accounts of the Group. 
At the date of authorisation of these Accounts, the following significant standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in 
these Accounts, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU):
 Æ iAS 1 “Disclosure initiative” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016;
 Æ iAS 16 and iAS 38 “Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation” – effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016;
 Æ iAS 27 “Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements” (amendments) – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016;
 Æ iFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” (amended) – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016;
 Æ iFRS 9 “Financial instruments” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018;
 Æ iFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; and
 Æ iFRS 16 “Leases” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards and interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the 
Accounts of the Group in future periods, except that iFRS 9 will impact upon both the measurement and disclosure of financial 
instruments, iFRS 15 will impact upon disclosures given in relation to revenue and trade receivables, and iFRS 16 will impact the 
assets, liabilities and income Statement charges in respect of leases.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated Accounts incorporate the Accounts of the Company and each of its subsidiary undertakings after eliminating all 
significant intercompany transactions and balances. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the 
periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately therein. Non-controlling interests 
consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests’ share of 
changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses attributable to the non-controlling interest in excess of their interest in 
the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interest of SiG except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding 
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The 
carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests 
in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the Shareholders of the Company.
Profit and loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the 
previous carrying amount of the net assets (including goodwill and intangible assets) of the businesses.
All results are from continuing operations under iFRS as the businesses disposed of in 2014 and operations closed in 2015 did not 
meet the disclosure criteria of iFRS 5 “Discontinued Operations” as they did not individually or in aggregate represent a separate major 
line of business or geographical area of operation. in order to give an indication of the underlying earnings of the Group the results of 
these businesses have been included in the column of the Consolidated income Statement entitled “Other items”.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT DISCLOSURE
in order to give an indication of the underlying earnings of the Group, certain items are presented in the column of the Consolidated 
income Statement entitled “Other items”. These include:
 Æ amortisation of acquired intangibles; 
 Æ restructuring costs;
 Æ acquisition expenses and contingent consideration;
 Æ other one-off items;
 Æ profits and losses arising on the sale of businesses and associated impairment charges;
 Æ trading profits and losses associated with disposed businesses; 
 Æ unwinding of provision discounting; 
 Æ fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments;
 Æ one-off recognition of deferred tax assets;
 Æ the taxation effect of “Other items”; and
 Æ the effect of the change in taxation rates.
The prior year comparatives have been re-analysed to present the results of the operations closed in 2015 within other one-off items.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit is stated after charging distribution, selling and marketing costs and administrative expenses but before finance 
income and finance costs.
GOODWILL AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the 
excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets (including intangible assets) and 
liabilities of the business acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, 
or more frequently when there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. if the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised on goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of remaining goodwill relating to the entity disposed of is included in the 
determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill recorded in foreign currencies is retranslated at each period end. Any movements in the carrying value of goodwill as a result 
of foreign exchange rate movements are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
Any excess of the fair value of net assets over consideration arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
income Statement.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group recognises 
two types of intangible asset: acquired and purchased. Acquired intangible assets arise as a result of applying iFRS 3 “Business 
Combinations” which requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations. Purchased 
intangible assets relate primarily to software that is separable from any associated hardware.
intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows:
Amortisation period Current estimate of useful life
Customer relationships Life of the relationship 7.4 years
Non-compete contracts Life of the contract 3.0 years
Computer software Useful life of the software 7.0–10.0 years
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with amortisation commencing once the assets are ready for their  
intended use.

Accounting Policies CONTiNUED

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and customer rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes. The 
Group principally earns revenue from the distribution of construction products and is able to recognise revenue on receipt of the goods 
by the customer. Customer rebates are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. 
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is allocated to customer rebates and recognised in the period as earned. 
Wherever revenue is generated from a contract to provide services, it is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract.
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage 
of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contracts costs incurred 
for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage 
of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are recognised only to the extent that the amount can be 
measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract 
costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are 
incurred. 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the total expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately. 
When contract costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings, the surplus is shown as 
amounts due from contract customers. For contracts where progress billings exceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognised 
profits less recognised losses, the surplus is shown as amounts due to contract customers.
BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until 
such a time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the 
Consolidated income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
PENSION COSTS
SiG operates six defined benefit pension schemes. The Group’s net obligation in respect of these defined benefit pension schemes is 
calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in 
both current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted using an appropriate discount rate to determine its present value and the fair 
value of any plan assets is deducted.
Where the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised 
as an expense in the Consolidated income Statement, on a straight-line basis, over the average period until the benefits vest. To the 
extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately.
The full service cost of the pension schemes is charged to operating profit. Net finance costs on defined benefit pension schemes 
are recognised in the Consolidated income Statement. Discretionary contributions made by employees or third parties reduce service 
costs upon payment of these contributions into the plan.
Any actuarial gain or loss arising is charged through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income and is made up of 
the difference between the expected returns on assets and those actually achieved, any changes in the actuarial assumptions for 
demographics and any changes in the financial assumptions used in the valuations.
The pension scheme deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The associated 
deferred tax asset is recognised within non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the Consolidated income Statement in respect of pension costs and 
other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and 
contributions actually paid are included within either accruals or prepayments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
The Group issues both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments (“share options”). Share options are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value determined is 
then expensed in the Consolidated income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase 
in equity (equity-settled share options) or in liabilities (cash-settled share options). The fair value of the options is measured using the 
Black–Scholes option pricing model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is 
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS CONTiNUED
For equity-settled share options, at each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the number of share options expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in the Consolidated income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
For cash-settled share options, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the 
liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, 
with any changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to liabilities.
CASH AND CASH Eq UIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency and converted at actual exchange rates at the date 
of the transaction. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an 
exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated income Statement.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date.
For the purpose of consolidation, income statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate for the 
year and their balance sheets at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations, and on foreign currency 
borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive income. 
On the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are 
reclassified to the Consolidated income Statement.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured and subsequently stated at fair value, with any resultant gain 
or loss recognised in the Consolidated income Statement. When determining the fair value of financial assets, the expected future 
cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate.
Loans and receivables are measured initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets (including trade receivables) are assessed for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset the estimated future cash flows have been negatively impacted. When there is objective evidence of impairment, 
appropriate allowances are made for estimated irrecoverable amounts based upon expected future cash flows discounted by an 
appropriate interest rate where applicable. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for 
all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance 
account. When a trade receivable is considered to be uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the Consolidated income Statement. 
if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated 
income Statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the 
amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured and subsequently stated at fair value, with any resultant 
gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated income Statement. The net gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated income Statement 
incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. 
Other financial liabilities (including trade and other payables) are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
When determining the fair value of financial liabilities, the expected future cash flows are discounted using an appropriate interest rate.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency 
swaps and commodity hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange, interest rate and fuel price risks 
arising from operational and financing activities. in accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. However derivative financial instruments, or any that do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or non-current liabilities if the remaining 
maturity of the derivatives is more than twelve months and they are not expected to be otherwise realised or settled within twelve 
months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised immediately at cost. Subsequent to their initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are then stated at their fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is derived from “mark-to-market” 
valuations obtained from the Group’s relationship banks. 
Unless hedge accounting is achieved, the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately and is included as 
part of finance income or finance costs, together with other fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, within the 
column of the Consolidated income Statement entitled “Other items”.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting, or when the Group revokes the hedging relationship. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Consolidated income Statement in the period. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Furthermore, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
CASH FLOW HEDGES
When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset 
or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is 
recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income (i.e. equity). When the forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. if a hedge of a forecast transaction 
subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the associated gains or losses that were previously 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income are reclassified into the Consolidated income Statement in the 
same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Consolidated income Statement.
For cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of any gain or loss is recognised immediately as fair value gains or losses on derivative 
financial instruments and is included as part of finance income or finance costs within the column of the Consolidated income 
Statement entitled “Other items”.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The portion of any gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss 
is recognised immediately as fair value gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and is included as part of finance income 
or finance costs within the column of the Consolidated income Statement entitled “Other items”. Gains and losses deferred in the 
hedging and translation reserve are recognised immediately in the Consolidated income Statement when foreign operations are 
disposed of.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the 
risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the Consolidated income Statement within “Other items”. Fair value gains or losses 
from remeasuring the derivative financial instruments are recognised immediately in the Consolidated income Statement within “Other 
items”.
TAXATION
income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax. income tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
in accordance with iAS 12, the following temporary differences are not provided for:
 Æ goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes;
 Æ the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
 Æ differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be 
realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND Eq UIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is shown at original cost to the Group less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Current estimate of useful life
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold buildings Period of lease
Plant and machinery (including motor vehicles) 3–8 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual values, which are based on market rates, are reassessed annually.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with depreciation charged on the same basis as all other assets once those 
assets are ready for their intended use.

INVENTORIES
inventories are stated at the lower of cost (including an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads, supplier rebates and 
discounts) and net realisable value. The cost formula used in measuring inventories is either a weighted average cost, or a First in First 
Out basis, depending on the most appropriate method for each particular business.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred up to completion and 
disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
LEASES AND HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The cost of assets held under finance leases and hire purchase agreements is capitalised with an equivalent liability categorised as 
appropriate under current liabilities or non-current liabilities. The asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its useful life.
Rentals under finance leases and hire purchase agreements are apportioned between finance costs and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The finance costs are charged in arriving 
at profit before tax. 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
in the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The 
aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
PROPERTY PROVISIONS
The Group makes provisions in respect of onerous leasehold property contracts and leasehold dilapidation commitments where it is 
probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle a present obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the 
best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors that have not been paid by the end of the year are not recognised in the Accounts until 
they have been approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
SUPPLIER REBATES
Supplier rebate income is significant to the Group’s result, with a substantial proportion of purchases covered by rebate agreements. 
Some supplier rebate agreements are non-coterminous with the Group’s financial year, and firm confirmation of amounts due may not 
be received until six months after the balance sheet date.
Where the Group relies on estimates, these are made with reference to contracts or other agreements, management forecasts and 
detailed operational workbooks. Supplier rebate income estimates are regularly reviewed by senior management.

Critical Accounting Judgments 
and Key Sources of Estimation 
Uncertainty
in the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described on pages 107 to 113, the Directors are required to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the change takes place if the revision affects only that period, 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
CRITICAL JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the Directors 
have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Group Accounts.
REBATES PAYABLE AND RECEIVABLE
Supplier rebate income is significant to the Group’s result, with a substantial proportion of purchases covered by rebate agreements. 
Supplier rebate income affects the recorded value of cost of sales, trade payables and inventories. Customer rebates affect the 
recorded value of revenue and trade receivables. The amounts payable and receivable under rebate agreements are often subject 
to negotiation after the balance sheet date. A number of agreements are non-coterminous with the Group’s financial year, requiring 
judgment over the level of future purchases and sales. At the balance sheet date the Directors make judgments on the amount of 
rebate that will become both payable by and due to the Group under these agreements based upon prices, volumes and product mix. 
PROVISIONS AGAINST RECEIVABLES
Using information available at the balance sheet date, the Directors make judgments based on experience regarding the level of 
provision required to account for potentially uncollectible receivables. 
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates six defined benefit pension schemes. All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been 
accounted for in accordance with iAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. As detailed within the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies 
on page 109, in accordance with iAS 19, all actuarial gains and losses have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive income.
For all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from independent 
qualified actuaries. in performing these valuations, significant actuarial assumptions and judgments have been made to determine the 
defined benefit obligation, in particular with regard to discount rate, inflation and mortality.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. 
The key estimates made in the value in use calculation are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates. The 
Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group. 
For those businesses not based in the UK or Western Europe, the cash flows are further risk-adjusted to reflect the risks specific to 
that individual CGU.
For the majority of the CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following 
year’s budget and a projection of cash flows based upon industry growth expectations (0%-3%) over a further period of four years. 
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates 
or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes. 
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more 
than 3% in perpetuity. The discount rates applied to all CGUs represent pre-tax rates and range between 7.9% and 10.8%.
Assumptions regarding sales and operating profit growth are considered to be the key area of estimation in the impairment review 
process, and appropriate sensitivities have been performed and disclosed in Note 11.
impairments are allocated initially against the value of any goodwill and intangible assets held within a CGU, with any remaining 
impairment applied to property, plant and equipment on a pro-rata basis.
The carrying amount of relevant non-current assets at 31 December 2015 is £668.4m (2014: £596.0m). impairment reviews performed 
during the year indicated that the carrying value of all of the Group’s non-current assets at 31 December 2015 is considered 
supportable.
TAXATION
Accruals for corporation tax contingencies require the Directors to estimate the level of corporation tax that will be payable based upon 
the interpretation of applicable tax legislation on a country-by-country basis and an assessment of the likely outcome of any open tax 
computations. All such accruals are included within current liabilities.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Therefore, estimates are 
made to establish whether deferred tax balances should be recognised, in particular in respect of non-trading losses.

6. INCOME TAX CONTiNUED
The total tax charge for the year differs from that resulting from applying the standard rate of corporate tax in the UK at 31 December 
2015 of 20.0% (31 December 2014: 21.0%). The differences are explained in the following reconciliation:
2015 2014

Profit on ordinary activities before tax 51.3  39.0 
Tax at 20.0% (2014: 21.0%) thereon 10.3 20.0 8.2 21.0
Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year:
– non-deductible and non-taxable items 4.8 9.4 6.2  15.9 
– losses not recognised – – 0.4  1.0 
– losses utilised not previously recognised (0.3) (0.6) (0.1) (0.3)
– other adjustments in respect of previous years (1.4) (2.7) (14.2) (36.4)
– effect of overseas tax rates 2.4 4.7 4.2 10.8
– effect of change in rate on deferred tax (0.8) (1.6) (0.2) (0.5)
Total income tax expense 15.0  29.2  4.5  11.5 
The effective tax rate for the Group on the total profit before tax of £51.3m is 29.2% (2014: 11.5%). The effective tax charge for the 
Group on profit before tax, before amortisation of acquired intangibles, restructuring costs, acquisition expenses and contingent 
consideration, other one-off items, profits and losses arising on the sale of businesses and associated impairment charges, trading 
profits and losses associated with disposed businesses, unwinding of provision discounting and fair value gains and losses on 
derivative financial instruments, of £87.4m is 24.0% (2014: 28.1%), which comprises a tax charge of 24.8% (2014: 27.3%) in respect of 
current year profits and a tax credit of 0.8% (2014: charge of 0.8%) in respect of prior years.
in 2014, a deferred tax asset of £14.9m was recognised in respect of previously unrecognised UK excess non-trading losses incurred 
in 2008 (see Note 22).
The following factors will affect the Group’s future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits:
 Æ the mix of profits between the UK and overseas; in particular, France/Germany/Belgium/Netherlands (corporate tax rates greater 
than 20%) and ireland/Poland (corporate tax rates less than 20%). if the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this 
could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge;
 Æ the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income;
 Æ the agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities; and
 Æ the recognition or utilisation (with a corresponding reduction in cash tax payments) of unrecognised deferred tax assets (see 
Note 22).
in addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has 
been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

7. DIVIDENDS
An interim dividend of 1.69p per ordinary share was paid on 7 November 2015 (2014: 1.42p). The Directors have proposed a final 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 2.91p per ordinary share (2014: 2.98p). The proposed final dividend is subject to 
approval by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. No 
dividends have been paid between 31 December 2015 and the date of signing the Accounts.

9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group had three share-based payment schemes in existence during the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: three). The Group 
recognised a total charge of £0.1m (2014: £0.7m) in the year relating to share-based payment transactions issued after 7 November 
2002 with a corresponding entry to the share option reserve. The weighted average fair value of each option granted in the year was 
163p (2014: 160p). Details of each of the schemes are provided below.
a) save as you earn (“saye ”) scheme 
The Company operated a SAYE scheme within the Republic of ireland which was open to all employees and was linked to a monthly 
savings contract over a five year period. The remaining options were either exercised or lapsed during 2015. 
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK since 2005. instead, the Company has operated a Share incentive Plan (“SiP”) since 
2005 as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.

b) Long-t erm Incentive plan (“Lt Ip”)
Under the existing LTiP policy, Executive Directors can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of

Exercise period 3 – 10 years 3 – 10 years 3 – 10 years
The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and 
the discretion of the Board.
Awards have also been made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTiP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic 
value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise. This scheme has exactly the same conditions and 
vesting criteria as the LTiP , the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being 
exercised, rather than through the issue of shares. This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, 
with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

b) Long-t erm Incentive plan (“Lt Ip”) continued
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three 
years. The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors’ best estimate for the effects of behavioural 
considerations.
c) share Incentive plan (“sIp”)
The SiP is offered to UK employees. The SiP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, 
including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis. The Company gives 
one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of £20 each month. No performance criteria are 
attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two 
years. in 2015, 108,120 (2014: 72,238) matching shares were granted during the year. Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of 
the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

11. GOODWILL CONTiNUED
Impairment review process
The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or 
more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are 
those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates. These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of 
the current economic environment. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money for the Group. in respect of the other assumptions, external data and management’s best estimates are 
applied.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following year’s 
budget and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations (0%-3%) over a further period of four years. 
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates 
or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes. 
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions. After this 
period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 3% in 
perpetuity. The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates and range between 7.9% and 10.8%.
2015 impairment review results
The carrying value of the Group’s CGUs remain supportable.
sensitivity analysis
A number of sensitivities have been performed on the Group’s significant CGUs to highlight the changes in market conditions that 
would lead to verge of impairment. The results are as follows:
2015
l ike-for-like market volume  
(average % per annum) Discount rate (%)
l ong-term operating profit growth 
rate (average % per annum)
CGU headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity
UK Distribution £520.5m 0.6 (15.1) 8.9  19.1  3.0 (13.9)
UK Exteriors £545.4m 0.9 (22.4) 8.9  16.4  3.0 (12.0)
Larivière €48.6m 1.4 (4.8) 10.8  1.7  2.0 (1.5)

CGU Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity
UK Distribution £678.7m 0.7 (20.2) 9.2  30.4  3.0 (21.2)
UK Exteriors £565.1m 0.9 (25.9) 9.2  24.8  3.0 (17.6)
Larivière €90.3m 0.4 (9.3) 11.0  2.9  2.2 (1.6)
The sensitivities noted above are the amounts by which the related assumption would have to vary before an impairment is indicated.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in revenue has 
been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of iAS 36 “impairment of Assets”. 
if a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from the forecast used in the goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment of £1.8m 
would arise in one CGU, Larivière. The Board has actively reviewed the forecast associated with Larivière, noting the conservative 
assumptions used and, in a challenging economic environment, its continued outperformance of the markets in which it operates, and 
is satisfied that no impairment is necessary. if revenues fell by 4.8% then the recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying 
value. The current forecasts provide headroom of £35.7m.

Settlement of loan notes and contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions 4.1 
Settlement of amounts payable for purchase of businesses 70.1 
in accordance with iFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, acquisition expenses of £1.9m in relation to the above acquisitions have been 
recognised within the Consolidated income Statement and have been presented within “Other items”.
it is currently expected that, dependent upon future profits, a further £30.9m may be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who 
are employed by the Group. These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business and, as required by 
iFRS 3, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the Consolidated income Statement as earned. The related accrual 
of potential consideration in the year to 31 December 2015 is £10.2m (31 December 2014: £2.9m). Added to the £1.9m acquisition 
expenses is a £2.2m increase in contingent consideration based solely on a reassessment of post-acquisition performance of 
the acquired businesses outside of the hindsight period, this has led to a charge within “Other items” in the Consolidated income 
Statement of £14.3m in respect of acquisitions (see Note 2).
in addition, £8.9m of deferred and contingent consideration (not subject to the vendors remaining within the business) has been 
recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Any further adjustments arising will be 
accounted for in 2016. These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to:
a) the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value; 
b) the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group; and
c) an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Group’s policies.
The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £20.9m and a gross contractual value of £21.4m. The 
best estimate at the date of acquisition of the contractual cash flows not able to be collected is £0.5m.
included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically 
excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. The goodwill of 
£29.4m arising from the acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 for all 2015 acquisitions amounted to £57.6m and 
£7.5m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2015 acquisitions for the period from 1 
January 2015 to the acquisition dates was £61.4m and £8.4m respectively.

goods of £18.8m at 31 December 2015 (2014: £20.7m). This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
included within the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £138.6m (2014: £130.5m) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age 
of these receivables is 34 days overdue (2014: 31 days).

At 31 December (18.8) (20.7)
in determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly. The concentration of 
credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision 
is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of £25.7m (2014: £31.7m) and a provision for 
impairment of £18.8m (2014: £20.7m). The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the 
specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
c redit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Trade 
receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a 
regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market 
sectors and geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where 
appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Treasury Risk Management section of the Strategic Report on pages 37 to 40 includes a review of all liquidity, interest rate and 
foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating 
or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities. The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Strategic Report on page 36.
The Group’s financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and derivative financial instruments. The following 
financial assets form part of the net debt of the Group:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Cash and cash equivalents (including cash deposits repayable on demand) 89.0 110.3
Other financial assets 1.3 0.9
Deferred consideration 1.5 1.5
Derivative financial instruments 36.8 33.9
Total 128.6 146.6
The Directors consider the fair value of financial assets to approximate to their book value. The interest received on cash deposits is at 
variable rates of up to 1.4% (2014: 2.0%).
The Group’s credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Of the above cash at bank, £17.3m (2014: £15.9m) is denominated in Sterling, £55.0m (2014: £78.1m) in Euros, £12.9m (2014: £14.1m) 
in Polish Zloty, and £3.8m (2014: £2.2m) in other currencies. Of the other financial assets, £1.3m (2014: £0.7m) is denominated in 
Sterling, and £nil (2014: £0.2m) in Euros. The deferred consideration is denominated in Sterling.
2015 interest rate and currency profile
The interest rate and currency profile of the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2015, after taking account of interest rate and 
currency derivative financial instruments (including derivative assets of £36.8m as noted above) was as follows:

in addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into a short-term currency derivative financial instrument which 
alters the currency profile of the Group’s financial liabilities. A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of £45.5m and a liability of 
€62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2015 at market rates and therefore the fair value is deemed to equate to its book value of 
£nil. The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2015 was £235.9m, of which £99.4m is denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling £10.0m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Group’s floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown 
in the table above. The fair value of the Group’s private placement notes at 31 December 2015 is estimated to be c.£248m and is 
classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes. The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to £55.3m and relates to 
finance lease contracts, fixed rate loans and loan notes (after applying financial instruments) and deferred consideration. The Directors 
consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to materially approximate to the book values shown above.

in addition to the currency exposures above, the Group entered into a short term currency derivative financial instrument which alters 
the currency profile of the Group’s financial liabilities. A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of £48.3m and a liability of 
€62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2014 at market rates and therefore the fair value was deemed to equate to its book value of 
£nil. The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2014 was £126.9m, of which £61.0m was denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling £10.5m, were secured on the underlying assets.
in both 2015 and 2014, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
Hedging relationships
included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to £36.8m 
(2014: £33.9m) and loans and receivables (including cash and cash equivalents) of £485.8m (2014: £477.4m).
included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 
£1.6m (2014: £1.1m) and liabilities (including trade payables) at amortised cost of £685.1m (2014: £573.6m).
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge 
relationship under the rules of iAS 32 and iAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments (for cash flow 
and net investment hedges) will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. Where the Group does 
not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the 
Consolidated income Statement in the column entitled “Other items”.
in order to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate, exchange rate, and commodity price changes, the Group utilises interest rate, 
currency, and commodity derivative financial instruments. The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by 
discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 Æ Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
 Æ Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 Æ Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of the financial instruments on pages 138 and 139 are categorised as Level 2.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTiNUED
a) Net investment hedges
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into one (31 December 2014: one) cross-currency forward contract which swaps 
Sterling denominated debt into Euro denominated debt. This derivative financial instrument is a net investment hedge of the Group’s 
Euro denominated assets and is designated and effective as a net investment hedge. The fair value of this derivative was £nil at 31 
December 2013, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, therefore the fair value movement to be recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive income in both 2014 and 2015 is £nil.
b) Cash flow hedges
With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is 
subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated income Statement within finance costs in the same period the hedged item 
affects the Consolidated income Statement. The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss 
and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt 
and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two (31 December 2014: two) cross-currency interest rate derivative financial 
instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt. in addition, as 
at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into one (31 December 2014: one) cross-currency interest rate derivative financial 
instrument which swaps fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt. These derivative financial 
instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group. All of these derivative financial 
instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. At 31 December 2015, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 
0.8 years (2014: 1.8 years).

As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two (31 December 2014: one) interest rate derivative financial instruments which 
swap variable rate debt into fixed rate debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group. All of these interest rate 
derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been 
deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. At 31 December 2015, the weighted average maturity 
date of these swaps is 4.1 years (2014: 3.6 years).

None of the above derivative financial instruments matures within one year (2014: £nil).
The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most 
significant element is crude oil price risk. As at 31 December 2015 the Group had entered into two (31 December 2014: nil) fuel price 
derivative financial instruments which swap variable price fuel into fixed price fuel, thereby creating an element of fuel cost certainty for 
the Group. One of these fuel price derivative financial instruments is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value 
movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. At 31 December 2015, the 
maturity date of this swap is one year.

b) Cash flow hedges continued 
The remaining fuel price derivative financial instrument had not been designated as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement of 
£0.4m has therefore been charged through “Other items” in the Consolidated income Statement. At 31 December 2015, the maturity 
date of this swap is one year, and therefore £0.4m of this derivative financial instrument matures within one year (2014: £nil).
The following table reconciles the net fair value gain recognised in equity on cash flow hedges as noted on page 138 of £3.4m (2014:

c) Fair value hedges
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two (31 December 2014: two) derivative financial instruments which hedge the 
fair value of the fixed interest private placement notes drawn down on 1 February 2007. All of these interest rate derivative financial 
instruments are designated and effective as fair value hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised immediately

c ontractual maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments, other 
financial assets, deferred consideration and cash and cash equivalents
iFRS 7 requires disclosure of the maturity of the Group’s remaining contractual financial liabilities. The tables overleaf have been drawn 
up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities including interest that will accrue to 
those assets and liabilities except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay the liability before its maturity. Both the inclusion 
of future interest and the values disclosed being undiscounted results in the total position being different to that included in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Given that this is a maturity analysis all trade payables and receivables (including amongst other items 
payroll and sales tax accruals which are not classified as financial instruments) have been included.

20. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
iFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group’s profit or loss and other equity of 
reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair 
value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities:
i) a 1% (100 basis points) increase or decrease in market interest rates; and
ii) a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a) Interest rate sensitivity
The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates. The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty 
interest rates.
in order to illustrate the Group’s sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 100 basis 
point change in each respective interest rate. The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting 
date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the 
reporting period. A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

i) floating rate Sterling debt and cash deposits;
ii) mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges; and
iii) floating rate Euro debt and Euro cash deposits.
b) Foreign currency sensitivity
The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars and Polish Zloty.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the 
Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s financial position. The sensitivity 
analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place 
at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. A positive number indicates an increase in 
profit or loss and other equity.

o nerous leases
The Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where a period of 
vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely 
to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis. The provision 
covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 28.
Leasehold dilapidations
This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair. The provision is 
calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract. The 
transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 28. 
c ontingent consideration
Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of completed acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are 
met. The utilisation of the contingent consideration provision includes the recognition of £2.7m of loan notes payable within one year.
o ther amounts
Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions. The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between 
one and twenty three years’ time.

During 2015, the Group recognised deferred tax assets of £0.9m (net) relating to previously unrecognised trading losses incurred in 
prior periods in ireland (£0.7m net) and Belgium (£0.2m net). in prior periods these trading losses were not recognised on the grounds 
of uncertainty. Following utilisation in the current and prior periods, the Directors now feel that the remaining amount is recoverable 
and therefore the asset has been recognised in full in the period. The £0.7m net tax credit relating to historical trading losses in ireland 
has been recognised as a non-underlying credit in line with where the trading losses (restructuring costs) were previously recorded, 
whereas the £0.2m net tax credit relating to Belgium has been recorded as an underlying tax credit.
During 2014, the Group recognised deferred tax assets of £14.9m (net) relating to c.£72m (gross) of previously unrecognised excess 
non-trading losses incurred in 2008 associated with the derivative financial instruments and included within “Other items” in the 
Consolidated income Statement. For the year ended 31 December 2015, c.£27m (gross) or £5.5m (net) of these non-trading losses 
were utilised, together with a prior year net tax credit of £0.7m (c.£2.7m gross).
The deferred tax charge within the Consolidated income Statement for 2015 includes a credit of £0.8m (2014: £0.2m) arising from the 
change in domestic tax rates in the countries in which the Group operates.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £3m (2014: £5m) that have not been recognised on the 
basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain. The tax losses in The Netherlands of c.£2.6m expire after eight 
years. The remaining tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £22m (2014: £18m) relating to unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it 
is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Of these schemes, one (2014: one) has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and five (2014: four) are overseas book 
reserve schemes. The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed. 
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. 
The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

c) pension schemes continued
in The Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry (“BPF HiBiN”). 
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under iAS 19, but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined 
contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SiG’s share of the assets and liabilities 
to be separately identified. Therefore, the Group’s annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each 
year. The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan decreased to 105.3% as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 112.2%). No change 
was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% (2014: 22.2%). The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the fund’s assets 
by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
in Belgium, the Company provides pensions for employees through a defined contribution scheme which, following a change in 
Belgian legislation, has a minimum guaranteed rate of return and is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under iAS 19. The 
Company has insured its liabilities. At 31 December 2015 the scheme has gross assets and liabilities of £0.4m (2014: £nil).
The Group’s total pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest was £7.8m (2014: £7.4m), of which a charge of 
£2.2m (2014: £1.9m) related to defined benefit pension schemes and £5.6m (2014: £5.5m) related to defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
in accordance with iAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who 
recommends the rate of contribution payable each year. The last formal actuarial valuation of the SiG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the 
UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2013 and showed that the market value of the scheme’s assets was £131.4m and their 
actuarial value covered 90% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other five schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the 
pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts. Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets. The liabilities of 
the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk. The 
risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is re-insured by an external insurance 
company.
investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by 
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create 
a plan deficit. Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees’ Statement of 
investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments. Due to the long-term nature of the 
plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan 
assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of 
plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. 
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
Consolidated income Statement charges
The pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest of £0.7m (2014: £0.6m) relating to the defined benefit pension 
schemes was £2.2m (2014: £1.9m).
in accordance with iAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing 
in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets. The actuarial valuations described 
previously have been updated at 31 December 2015 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the 
requirements of iAS 19. investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising, and therefore under the projected unit 
method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement. The four overseas book reserve 
schemes remain open to new members.

of £1.7m) and deferred tax charge of £0.7m (2014: £0.1m) in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of corporation tax to 19% 
from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income. in 
addition a deferred tax charge of £0.2m (2014: £0.7m) has been recognised in the Consolidated income Statement. A full reconciliation 
of the deferred tax movement is shown in Note 22.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax (from 2004 onwards) recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive income amounted to a loss of £37.7m (2014: £39.6m).
Of the above pension liability before taxation, £15.4m (2014: £19.4m) relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and £8.4m (2014: 
£9.3m) relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Pension liability at 1 January (28.7) (25.5)
Current service cost (1.5) (1.3)
Transfer to accruals 1.0 – 
Payment of unfunded benefits 0.2 2.4 
Contributions 3.5 3.4 
Net finance cost (0.7) (0.6)
Actuarial gain/(loss) 1.9 (7.7)
Effect of changes in exchange rates 0.5 0.6 
Pension liability at 31 December (23.8) (28.7)
Contributions of approximately £3.4m are expected to be paid to defined benefit pension schemes during the annual period beginning 
1 January 2016. The Group is contracted to pay £2.5m per annum to January 2019. The principal assumptions used for the iAS 19 
actuarial valuation of the schemes were:
2015
%
2014
%
2013
%
Rate of increase in salaries 2.5 2.5 2.5
Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.7 1.6 2.5
Rate of increase of LPi pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 3.3
Discount rate 3.9 3.6 4.5
inflation assumption 3.1 3.0 3.3
Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes’ rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption 
used for LPi revaluation in deferment.
The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 27.4 years (2014: 27.4 years). The life expectancy 
on retirement at age 60 of a male employee currently aged 40 years is 29.2 years (2014: 29.1 years).
if the discount rate were to be increased/decreased by 0.25%, this would decrease/increase the Group’s gross pension scheme deficit 
by £7.1m. if the rate of inflation increased/decreased by 0.25% this would increase/decrease the Group’s gross pension scheme deficit 
by £1.6m. if the life expectancy for employees increased/decreased by one year the Group’s gross pension scheme deficit would 
increase/decrease by £6.3m.

GOING CONCERN AND THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT 
WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIq UIDITY OF THE GROUP 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis 
of accounting contained within the Strategic Report on page 39 and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Strategic Report, on page 39. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 Æ the Directors’ confirmation on page 39 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 Æ the disclosures on pages 20 to 23 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 Æ the Directors’ statement on page 39 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
 Æ the Directors’ explanation on page 39 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done 
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
INDEPENDENCE
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm 
we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
The recognition and measurement of supplier rebate income 
Rebate income earned by the Group is significant to the Group’s 
result and affects the recorded value of cost of sales, trade 
payables and inventory. in some cases, rebate calculations 
are complex and judgmental, particularly at a time of uncertain 
demand and difficult trading conditions, being based on 
estimates of purchases and/or non-coterminous trading periods. 
Further explanation is given on page 114 Critical Accounting 
Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty. 
The consideration made by the Audit Committee is set out on 
page 75.
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls 
related to the recognition of supplier rebate income where 
income is significant. We discussed significant rebate contracts 
with the commercial managers to understand the complexities 
and judgments that may exist over income recognition.
We circularised suppliers in business units where rebate income 
is significant to confirm a sample of amounts receivable, 
including high value balances. Where supplier responses were 
not returned, we reviewed further correspondence between 
the Group and the supplier to verify the position taken. We also 
considered post year end recoveries against receivables.
We re-performed a sample of management’s calculations of 
rebate income, agreeing volumes to purchasing records and 
correspondence from suppliers where available or to other 
available documentation, and agreeing the rebate percentages 
applied to a signed contract where available or to other 
supplier correspondence. We compared rebate income earned 
by supplier against historical rates achieved and considered 
previous estimation accuracy to identify significant movements 
for further testing or enquiries.
We challenged whether the recognition policies and estimates 
were appropriate, particularly when there were non-coterminous 
trading periods, renegotiated rebate agreements and buy-ins, 
and we performed detailed testing to determine whether an 
appropriate level of rebate had been adjusted against stock to 
reflect the net cost of the related items.
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets
The goodwill and intangible assets (excluding computer 
software) of £494.4m represent 33% of total assets and 71% of 
non-current assets and therefore the judgments over the carrying 
value are significant.
Management’s judgments in relation to the financial forecasts of 
the business units, discount rates and perpetuity growth rates 
used to determine the value in use of the CGUs are subjective 
and are described in the Critical Accounting Judgments and Key 
Sources of Estimation Uncertainty on page 114 and Note 11 to 
the financial statements. 
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls 
related to the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets. 
We challenged management’s assumptions used in the 
impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, 
including specifically the cash flow projections, changes to 
the discount rates applied and perpetuity rates used. We 
performed sensitivity analysis against these assumptions. 
We have compared these to industry forecasts, the Group’s 
historical performance, budgeting accuracy, benchmarking 
against comparator groups and our understanding of the future 
prospects of the business. We tested the integrity of the model 
using our computer assisted analytical tools.
Particular focus has been given to Larivière given its carrying 
value of goodwill of £144.7m and the difficult trading conditions 
in France. As a result we applied a greater level of verification 
to the growth rates and additional sensitivity analysis over the 
trading performance and judgments taken.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
The recognition and presentation of Other items in the 
Consolidated Income Statement 
The Group has consistently used a three column approach 
for the presentation of the Consolidated income Statement 
to separately identify certain income/costs which are non-
underlying in nature. This includes certain costs relating to 
a significant restructuring programme. The inappropriate or 
inconsistent inclusion of income/costs within Other items could 
distort the underlying profit disclosed. The Group’s definition 
for separate presentation within Other items is set out in the 
Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 108. The 
net loss associated with Other items is £36.1m and reduces the 
Group’s underlying profit before tax by 41%.
This is on the face of the Consolidated income Statement on 
page 102 and also Note 2.
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls 
related to the recognition and presentation of Other items. We 
assessed the nature of the income/costs included in Other 
items and challenged whether they met the Group’s definition 
for separate presentation. Where income/costs have been 
presented as Other items, we obtained evidence that enabled 
us to assess whether this presentation is appropriate. We 
performed detailed substantive testing for a sample of the 
costs/income by verifying these against supporting invoices, 
agreements and other records as appropriate. Particular focus 
has been given to net restructuring costs of £8.3m as set out 
on page 118 to determine whether they arise from significant 
restructuring and changing the shape of the business rather 
than minor changes to the Group’s structure.
The recognition and measurement of provisions for trade 
receivables 
Trade receivables represent 49% of the Group’s current 
assets. The judgments regarding aged or impaired receivables 
are significant and are subjective with respect to the trading 
conditions in some of the countries in which the Group operates, 
particularly in ireland.
Further explanation is given on page 114 Critical Accounting 
Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty and Note 
15 in the Annual Report and Accounts.
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls 
related to the recognition and measurement of provisions 
for trade receivables. We challenged the appropriateness 
of management’s assumptions and estimates in relation to 
the provisions for trade receivables through discussions 
with local management who are the most knowledgeable of 
the customers themselves. in assessing completeness and 
accuracy we have reviewed evidence of customer disputes and 
defaults and whether this indicates that a provision is required. 
We have tested the ageing of the ledgers through agreement 
of ageing date to proof of customer delivery and recalculated 
the provision based upon this. We have assessed the 
appropriateness of provisions by considering subsequent cash 
receipts, past payment practices and the initial assessment of 
customer viability.
The risks noted above remain unchanged from the audit report in the prior year. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on page 75.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £4.25m (2014: £5m), which is below 5% (2014: approximately 5%) of underlying pre-tax 
profit (as defined on page 102), and below 1% (2014: 1%) of equity. Deteriorating market conditions have had an adverse impact on 
sales, driving a lower underlying pre-tax profit resulting in a lower materiality being determined. We use underlying pre-tax profit to 
exclude the effect of volatility from our determination and because it represents one of the primary KPis referred to both internally and 
externally. The recognition and presentation of Other items is treated as a significant risk as set out above.
Component materiality ranges between 50% and 95% of Group materiality (£2.1m to £4.0m) based on the components’ blended 
revenue and underlying pre-tax profit contribution. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £85,000 (2014: 
£100,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. The Group audit and audit of the consolidation is performed at the 
Group’s head office in Sheffield. The accounting records of the trading businesses within the Group are spread across the countries in 
which the Group operates. We perform audit work in each of the eight principal countries of operation.
Full scope audits were performed for the principal business units including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, and 
ireland covering 75% of the Group’s total assets (2014: 88%), 90% of revenue (2014: 91%) and 84% of pre-tax profit (2014: 89%). 
A further 17% of the Group’s total assets (2014: 9%), 5% of revenue (2014: 6%) and 6% of pre-tax profit (2014: 9%) were subject to 
specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of 
the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified on pages 154 and 155. Our full scope audits and the specified audit 
procedures were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality.
At the Parent Company level we also tested the consolidation process, including testing on the acquisitions which are significant to 
the Group’s results and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account 
balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group 
audit team visits each of the locations where the Group audit scope was focused once every year and the most significant of them at 
least twice a year. During 2015 and 2014 a senior member of the Group audit team visited Germany, France, ireland and the United 
Kingdom at least twice, and also Poland once.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion: 
 Æ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; 
 Æ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 Æ the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REq UIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 Æ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

from branches not visited by us; or
 Æ the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
c orporate Governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.

MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REq UIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION CONTiNUED
o ur duty to read other information in the annual r eport
Under international Standards on Auditing (UK and ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
 Æ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 Æ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 Æ otherwise misleading.
in particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and international Standards on Auditing (UK and ireland). We also comply with 
international Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. in addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. if we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Company Statement of  
Changes in Equity
year ended 31 December 2015
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company is exempt 
from the preparation of consolidated financial statements because it is included in the Group Accounts of SiG plc as detailed on pages 
102 to 152. The separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments which are held at fair value as disclosed on page 164). Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. in estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or 
liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
Fair value for measurement purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment 
transactions that are within the scope of iFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of iAS 17, and measurements that have 
some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in iAS 2 or value in use in iAS 36. Categorisation of fair 
value is set out in the Group Accounts on page 137.
The separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (FRS 101). For periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements, for 
the year ended 31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a qualifying entity that would otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and 
disclosure requirements of EU-adopted iFRS. The Company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 101.
As explained above, the Company has adopted FRS 101 for the first time in the current year. As part of this adoption, the following 
new and revised Standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year: 
 Æ Amendments to iAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (as part of the Annual improvements to iFRSs 2009 – 2011 Cycle 
issued in May 2012); and
 Æ iFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”.
The application of these specific Standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the Company.
in preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2014, the 
Company’s date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by FRS 101 
for the first time adoption of FRS 101.
The impact of these amendments to the Company’s previously adopted accounting policies was not material to the Shareholders’ 
equity as at the date of transition and as at 31 December 2014 and on the profit for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The following exemptions from the requirements of iFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in 
accordance with FRS 101:
 Æ the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of iFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”;
 Æ the requirements of iFRS 7 “Financial instruments: Disclosures”;
 Æ the requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of iFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”;
 Æ the requirement in paragraph 38 of iAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” to present comparative information in respect of:
i) paragraph 79(a)(iv) of iAS 1;
ii) paragraph 73(e) of iAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”;
 Æ the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A to 38D, 40A to 40B, 111, and 134 to 136 of iAS 1 “Presentation of Financial 
Statements”;
 Æ the requirements of iAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”;
 Æ the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of iAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”;
 Æ the requirements of paragraph 17 of iAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”;
 Æ the requirements in iAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group; and
 Æ the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c) to 135(e) of iAS 36 “impairment of Assets”.
The Company has notified its Shareholders in writing, and they do not object to the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the 
Company in these financial statements. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Group Accounts.

share-based payments
The accounting policy for share-based payments (iFRS 2) is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on pages 109 and 110.
derivative financial instruments
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on page 111.
Financial assets and liabilities
The accounting policy for financial assets and liabilities is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on pages 110 and 111.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
t angible fixed assets
The accounting policy for tangible fixed assets is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on page 112.
Foreign currency
The accounting policy for foreign currency is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on page 110.
t axation
The accounting policy for taxation is consistent with that of the Group as detailed on page 112.
dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors that have not been paid by the end of the year are not recognised in the Accounts until 
they have been approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
in the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the change takes place if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
c ritical judgments in applying the c ompany’s accounting policies
The critical accounting judgments are consistent with that of the Group as detailed on page 114.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments’ values 
in use. The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and 
suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet 
date was £443m (2014: £443m) with no impairment loss recognised in 2015 or 2014.
deferred tax assets
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. Therefore, estimates are made to establish whether deferred tax balances should be recognised, in particular in 
respect of non-trading losses.

Dividend Tax Allowance
in respect of UK Shareholders, from April 2016 dividend tax credits will be replaced by an annual £5,000 tax-free allowance on 
dividend income across an individual’s entire share portfolio. Above this amount, individuals will pay tax on their dividend income 
at a rate dependent on their income tax bracket and personal circumstances. The Company will continue to provide registered 
shareholders with a confirmation of the dividends paid by SiG plc and this should be included with any other dividend income received 
when calculating and reporting total dividend income received. it is the shareholder’s responsibility to include all dividend income when 
calculating any tax liability.
This change was announced by the Chancellor, as part of the UK government budget in July 2015. if you have any tax queries, please 
contact a Financial Advisor.

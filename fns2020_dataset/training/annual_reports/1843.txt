Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 01
“This has been an intensely difficult  
year for the Group following the sharp 
decline in the UK housing market. In the 
first half, as prices fell, we drove sales 
and reduced stock and debt levels. In 
the second half we have been able to 
maintain price levels and increase our 
reservation rates, with these encouraging 
trends continuing through the summer 
into the autumn. 
The Board has therefore decided it is  
now an appropriate time to substantially 
strengthen the Company’s balance sheet 
and reduce its debt levels via a Placing and 
a Rights Issue. This will also enable the 
Group to develop a number of its existing 
sites and to take advantage of land 
purchasing opportunities as they arise.”
Mark Clare, Group Chief Executive

Group overview
availability of financial credit quickly became  
a full scale international recession. 
The housing market in Britain was particularly 
hard hit during the first half of the Group’s 
financial year as deteriorating economic 
conditions were coupled with rapidly declining 
customer confidence and severe constraints 
on the availability of mortgage finance. In 
particular, the withdrawal by lenders of many 
higher loan to value mortgages has significantly 
affected the first time buyer market. 
House prices across Britain, including for the 
new build sector, fell sharply. For the Group, 
this was most acutely felt towards the end of 
the 2008 calendar year as it sought to reduce 
stock levels in a difficult market. 
During the second half of the financial year, 
sales prices began to show some signs of 
stabilisation reflecting historically low interest 
rates and a more limited supply of housing in 
both the second hand and new build market. 
The position, however, remains fragile with 
limited visibility; a sustained recovery of 
volumes and prices will depend on the 
improved availability of mortgage finance. 
The Group’s response
Responding to the dramatic decline of the 
market has been an immense challenge for 
the Group. In July and August 2008, the 
Group arranged a refinancing and amended 
its financial covenants. Sharp reductions  
in selling prices in the autumn led to an 
impairment of £499.5m against the value  
of land and work in progress during the  
year, of which £494.9m was recognised  
at the half year.
With prices reset across the business in 
January 2009, the Group has been able to 
improve sales rates to reduce stock levels 
further, enabling it to manage its working 
capital more efficiently.
The combination of this tight control of  
work in progress and sales generation has 
contributed to the reduction in the Group’s  
net debt by £373.7m over the course of the 
financial year to £1,276.9m at 30 June 2009. 
Against this backdrop, the Group has 
continued to focus on the clear set of priorities 
already established of driving sales, reducing 
costs and generating cash with the objective 
of reducing debt. The Group has made good 
progress in all these areas. 
At the same time, the Group has sought to 
ensure that it has the capability to respond to 
any recovery in the market. The initial signs of 
stabilisation seen at the start of 2009 have 
continued, underpinned by a greater degree 
of price stabilisation and improved customer 
sentiment. The Group has seen higher sales 
rates, fewer cancellations and levelling of 
prices. The Group does not, however, expect 
to see a sustained improvement in trading 
conditions until the availability of mortgage 
finance improves further. 
The housing market
During the financial year the magnitude of  
the economic downturn became apparent. 
What started as a sharp contraction in the 
This has been an immensely difficult year for the 
housebuilding sector with the industry experiencing a 
material and sudden fall off in customer demand driven 
by a structural change in the availability and terms of 
mortgage finance, decline in house prices and a loss of 
consumer confidence in light of the prevailing economic 
uncertainty. As a result, the Group, along with other 
housebuilders, experienced a significant fall in both the 
volume and value of the homes that it sold. 
Chairman’s statement Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 03
Group overview | Chairman’s statement
Cost reduction has also continued to be a 
priority. Whilst many of the savings the Group 
has generated have come through reductions 
in supplier and employee costs, structural 
changes in the Group’s cost base have also 
been achieved through actions such as  
the closure of operating divisions. The  
Group is now a more efficient organisation, 
positioning it better to respond when 
customer demand increases.
I recognise that many of the decisions that  
the Group has made in the year have 
adversely affected its employees; whilst  
that is something I very much regret it was 
necessary to ensure that the Group protected 
its core business during the downturn. 
I remain immensely impressed by the Group’s 
people who are dedicated to achieving 
excellence in the housebuilding industry.  
Their determination during these exceptionally 
difficult economic circumstances is a great 
credit to them. The Board is hugely 
appreciative that the Group’s employees have 
worked so hard to meet the demands placed 
upon them in these challenging times.
Corporate responsibility
The Board remains committed to the 
principles of corporate responsibility and 
despite the downturn in the market, it remains 
convinced that responsible business practices 
are fundamental to the future success of the 
Group. The Group is pleased that it has been 
able to progress its corporate responsibility 
strategies in the key areas of health and 
safety, the environment, customer care, 
employees and the communities where  
it works as part of the normal day-to-day 
business operations of the Group, and 
expects that this will position the Group better 
to respond to any recovery in the market.
Board
It was with regret that, in January this year, the 
Group announced that Mark Pain, the Group 
Finance Director, had decided to step down 
from the Board. Mark served the Company 
with distinction and the Board wish him well 
with his future career. 
His successor, David Thomas, who joined 
the Group in July 2009 from his combined 
role as Deputy Chief Executive and Finance 
Director at The GAME Group plc, is an 
extremely able replacement and I am 
delighted that the Company has been able to 
attract a Group Finance Director of his calibre.
After seven years on the Board, Michael 
Pescod stepped down in December 2008 
and the Board is particularly grateful for his 
wise counsel during his tenure, latterly as the 
Senior Independent Director. This role has 
been assumed by Bob Davies who originally 
joined the Board in May 2004. The Company 
is also pleased to welcome to the Board 
Tessa Bamford whose appointment as a 
Non-Executive Director was announced  
on 30 June 2009. The Board expects  
her experience in finance and business 
development to be a great asset to the Group.
Dividend
The Board suspended dividend payments in 
June 2008 as part of its cash conservation 
policy. The Board remains focused on 
strengthening the balance sheet and 
conserving cash. The existing terms of  
the Group’s committed bank facilities and 
private placement notes impose certain 
restrictions on the payment of dividends.  
In light of these restrictions no final dividend 
will be paid in respect of the financial year 
ended 30 June 2009. 
The Board is committed to reinstating the 
payment of dividends and will do so when it 
becomes appropriate and permissible to do so.
Priorities
Barratt Developments PLC aspires to be the 
leading housebuilder in Britain with a focus 
on efficient production, sales and marketing, 
land and planning, becoming the partner of 
choice and the quality of its people. 
Despite the difficult economic backdrop the 
Group is continuing to invest in these key 
areas. There are tangible results being 
achieved most notably that the Group is the 
only national volume housebuilder to be 
credited as Four Star in the Home Builders 
Federation 4th annual customer satisfaction 
survey. In terms of construction excellence, 
the Group had another year of outstanding 
achievement in the National House-Building 
Council ‘Pride In The Job’ quality awards. 
Whilst the timing and extent of any market 
recovery remain uncertain, these strengths 
and the reduced cost base now in place will 
enhance the Group’s ability to take advantage 
of any such recovery.
Proposed Placing and Rights Issue
The Board is today announcing a fully 
underwritten Placing and Rights Issue to  
raise gross proceeds of approximately  
£720m, together with amended financing 
arrangements which will come into effect 
upon successful completion of the Placing 
and Rights Issue. The Directors expect the 
Placing and Rights Issue will substantially 
strengthen the Group’s balance sheet and 
reduce financial indebtedness. The proceeds 
raised will enable the Group to develop its 
existing sites and better position it to take 
advantage of appropriate land purchasing 
opportunities. The amended financing 
arrangements are expected to allow the 
Group to take advantage of opportunities that 
may arise in a recovering market, as well as to 
provide an appropriate alternative framework, 
should a further downturn arise. 
Bob Lawson, Chairman
23 September 2009 04 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Group overview
Overall performance of the business during the 
financial year was dominated by the significant decline 
in customer demand for new housing. In response,  
the Group reduced the scale of its business, cut costs, 
sold at acceptable rates and reduced debt.
Group Chief Executive’s statement
“In addition... the Group 
is continuing to focus  
on the action needed to 
drive the longer-term 
performance of the 
business which will enable 
it to recover more quickly 
from the downturn when 
the market begins to 
improve – land and 
planning; sales and 
marketing; people and 
efficient production.”
of social housing fell to 15.7% (2008: 20.4%)  
as the Group reduced the number of new sites. 
During the year houses represented 50.5% 
(2008: 54.9%) of the Group’s completions, 
excluding central London, and the Group 
expects site replans to increase the proportion 
of houses available on its sites in future. 
Properties sold to investors rose to 20.9%  
of total completions compared with 14.1%  
in 2008. 
Net private reservations per site per week were 
up 10.5% compared with the 2008 financial 
year, 6.0% down for the first half and 28.6%  
up in the second half. A return to more normal 
seasonal selling patterns emerged, with 
second half net private reservations 15.4% 
above the first half levels on a per site per 
week basis. 
A lack of customer confidence, in particular  
the perception of falling house prices, led to  
a sharp decline in sales. This contributed to a 
lower forward order book of £464.3m (2008: 
£697 .6m) at the year end, of which £286.4m 
(2008: £538.7m) was contracted. 
The first half of the year was particularly 
challenging for the Group. Conditions became 
immensely difficult as a result of the 
deteriorating economic outlook and the 
resulting contraction in the availability of 
mortgage finance, and decline in customer 
confidence levels. Sales were only achievable 
at substantially reduced prices. In the second 
half of the year, the Group started to achieve 
some pricing stability, albeit at reduced levels. 
This combined with acceptable sales rates at 
planned selling prices allowed the Group to 
achieve its cash targets.
Declining volumes and prices have had a 
significant impact on the profitability of the 
Group. Group profit from operations before 
exceptional items fell from £550.2m to £34.2m. 
Operating margins before exceptional items 
were 1.5% (2008: 15.5%). As a result of 
inventory write-downs and other operating 
exceptional items of £519.5m (2008: £255.0m), 
the Group’s loss from operations was £485.3m 
(2008: £295.2m profit).
Tight control of land spend and work in 
progress and disposal of commercial 
development assets helped to reduce  
net debt to £1,276.9m at 30 June 2009  
(2008: £1,650.6m). 
Total completions for the year decreased  
to 13,202 (2008: 18,588). The overall mix  
of completions also changed. The proportion  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 05
Group overview | Group Chief Executive’s statement

Image top right: The five bedroom Headcorn home at Highwood, Kenley. Image bottom right: Squires Walk, Pulborough.
The average selling price measured over all 
completions reduced by 14.1% to £157,200 
(2008: £183,100). The underlying reduction, 
excluding the impact of mix changes, was 
approximately 22%. During the second half  
of the year, the Group experienced improved 
price stabilisation across the housebuilding 
business. Prices are now approximately 27% 
lower than at their peak in the summer of 
2007. Following the resetting of prices from 
January 2009 and as a result of increased 
visitor numbers in the second half and reduced 
stock levels, the Group was able to reduce the 
level of sales incentives being offered. 
Driving business performance
During the year the Group has focused on 
improving its operating efficiency. It has 
continued to prioritise driving sales, reducing 
costs and generating cash to reduce debt. 
These objectives were pursued whilst seeking 
to preserve the capability of the organisation  
to respond to any market recovery.
Maximising sales
The effectiveness of the Group’s sales 
channels has continued to improve. The 
Group has moved increasingly towards online 
and new technology to support sales. 
A range of products has been used effectively 
to address different market sectors and the 
barriers to house purchasers in the current 
market. Shared equity has been important in 
addressing the first time buyer market where 
the lack of higher loan to value mortgage 
finance has become a particularly difficult 
issue. 11.4% of the Group’s completions 
during the year depended on shared equity. 
HomeBuy Direct, the Government scheme,  
is now in operation and the Group reserved 
around 24 homes per week during the fourth 
quarter of the financial year using this scheme.
Part-exchange has been used to address the 
customer sector that has had difficulty finding 
purchasers for its existing homes. During the 
year 11.8% of completions (2008: 12.3%) were 
supported by part-exchange incentives. The 
Group’s ability to sell second hand properties, 
and thus manage its working capital, has 
enabled it to continue to use this mechanism 
as an effective sales support tool throughout 
the year.
Part-exchange stock levels have also 
continued to fall. At 30 June 2009, we had 
150 unreserved part-exchange units, down 
78% over the last twelve months (2008: 677).
Stock of completed units continues to reduce. 
We had 822 unreserved stock units at                
30 June 2009, 3.9 weeks’ supply at current 
sales rates, down 55% from the holding of 
1,821 units at 30 June 2008.
Cost reductions
Cost reduction programmes are well 
established and embedded in the Group’s 
operations. During the year the number of 
divisional offices was reduced from 32 to 25, 
whilst seeking to ensure that the core 
infrastructure of the Group and its brands 
have been preserved. 
The programme to reduce supply and build 
costs has continued to deliver substantial 
benefits for the Group. For example, since 
June 2007, the Group has reduced the basic 
housebuild costs of a standard house type  
by approximately 15%. Material prices and 
subcontractor rates have been reduced 
significantly to reflect the current conditions  
in the market. Whilst it is unlikely that these 
reductions will be permanent, other cost 
reduction programmes including technical 
design changes and replans from apartments 
to houses are expected to yield longer-term 
efficiency improvements.  Visitors per site

Group overview | Group Chief Executive’s statement
Managing cash
During the year the Group has continued to 
focus on generating cash. Having reduced 
excess stock in the first half, it carefully 
controlled work in progress, closely matching 
new build starts to sales. Site openings have 
been tightly managed, in particular by 
deferring investment on sites with significant 
upfront infrastructure requirements. The 
average number of sites during the 2009 
financial year was 503 (2008: 594). In addition, 
the progress made in disposing of certain 
commercial development assets from the 
Wilson Bowden Developments portfolio 
generated cash for the Group. 
Land spend during the year was largely 
restricted to fulfilment of pre-existing 
contractual commitments which could not  
be cancelled or deferred, although there was 
limited expenditure where the Group could 
source attractively priced opportunities on 
deferred terms. Land spend totalled £263.7m, 
a significant reduction on the spend of 
approximately £1.0 billion in 2008. 
Although the Group’s net debt has been 
reduced significantly during the year, future 
cash flows remain vulnerable given continued 
market uncertainty. Nevertheless, the Group 
has operated within its financial covenants 
throughout the last twelve months and, as 
explained in the basis of preparation on  
page 58, expects to continue to do so in  
the absence of a further downturn.
Driving up quality
The Group has continued to focus on the 
quality of the products it builds and on 
customer support during and after the sales 
process. The Group recently became, for  
the first time in its history, a Four Star builder 
in the Home Builders Federation 4th annual 
customer satisfaction survey. In addition, the 
Group has achieved 76 (2008: 73) National 
House-Building Council ‘Pride in the Job’ 
quality awards. 
The Group continues to make progress to 
improve the design of its products, internally, 
externally and for the development as a 
whole. The Group has been awarded its  
first ever Building for Life award for the 
development at City Point in Brighton and 
Building for Life standard for the development 
at Tachbrook Triangle in Pimlico, London,  
by The Commission for Architecture and the 
Built Environment (‘CABE’). The Building for 
Life awards are the National Standard for 
well-designed homes and neighbourhoods. 
The Group is continuing to improve the quality 
of design in its developments and has 
produced new internal design guidelines 
which seek to promote examples of good 
practice across the business. 
Product innovation
Customer demand, economics and regulation 
continue to influence the nature of the Group’s 
products. Houses made up 50.5% of Group 
completions, excluding central London  
(2008: 54.9%). As the Group replans sites,  
this proportion will rise further as apartments 
are replaced by new house types. 
Design innovation will be particularly important 
in meeting environmental challenges of the 
future at the most economical cost. The 
Group’s zero carbon house at the Building 
Research Establishment (‘BRE’) continues to 
be tested and management are pleased with 
its performance to date. Planning permission  
has been granted for the flagship zero  
carbon development at Hanham Hall and  
it is expected that work will start on site later  
this year.
Building on experience, the Group is currently 
developing a range of houses designed to 
meet the requirements of various aspects of 
the Code for Sustainable Homes. The Group 
believes that this work will provide both cost 
and reputational advantages for its products.
Commercial developments
Good progress has been made in the disposal 
of commercial developments assets from the 
Wilson Bowden Developments portfolio, with 
total cash proceeds of £181.1m received in  
the financial year ended 30 June 2009. 
Investments and development opportunities, 
with a net asset value of £55.9m as at 30 June 
2009, have been retained and are being 
managed by a dedicated team with a view  
to realising value when the market improves. 
This team will also seek opportunities to create 
value from the wider Group portfolio including 
where there are mixed-use sites.
Government initiatives
The Government has put in place a number  
of measures during the year to support the 
housebuilding industry. On the demand side, 
HomeBuy Direct, after a slow start, is now 
making a significant difference to the Group’s 
sales of shared equity products. Whilst 
Government support to the banking sector 
has been welcome, the Group has yet to see 
a material improvement in the availability of 
mortgage finance, in particular for the higher 
loan to value sector. Addressing this issue 
remains a priority to drive recovery.
On the supply side, the Government’s 
commitment of £400m of funding, announced 
in the 2009 Budget, and the additional 
resources that have since been made 
available to the Kickstart programme  
were a welcome development for the  
industry and the Group. Final funding  
for the Group under the scheme will be 
determined later in the year.
Health and Safety
The Group considers health and safety to  
be of paramount importance. A Health and 
Safety Committee, including members of the 
Board, has been formed in order to provide 
further focus to the Group’s strategy for 
improvement and to review overall Group 
performance. During the financial year the 
Group’s commitment to health and safety 
resulted in an improvement to its reportable 
Injury Incidence Rate to 522 per 100,000 
persons employed, a 20.4% decrease on  
the prior financial year. The Group is pleased 
to have achieved its objective to reduce the 
Injury Incidence Rate below 560 per 100,000 
by 2010 one year ahead of target.
Planning for recovery
In addition to the measures to improve the 
short-term performance of the organisation,  
the Group is continuing to focus on the action 
needed to drive the longer-term performance of 
the business which will enable it to recover more 
quickly from the downturn when the market 
begins to improve – land and planning; sales 
and marketing; people; and efficient production. 08 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Group overview | Group Chief Executive’s statement
Land and planning
If build activity scales back up in order to 
satisfy increased demand, it will be necessary 
to identify and secure investment opportunities 
in the land market, including strategic land, on 
appropriate terms to replenish the land bank to 
meet more normalised build levels. The Group 
intends to exploit fully its planning capabilities 
in order to extract maximum value from both 
existing and newly acquired sites.
Sales and marketing
The sales function is expected to benefit  
in an improving market from the efficiencies 
achieved during the downturn. A combination 
of a step up in training support and deployment 
of new technology on site will enable the 
Group to improve conversion rates. In addition, 
a shift in marketing focus away from deal-led 
advertising should support an improvement  
in sales performance.
People
The Group has continued to develop and 
invest in its people and their expertise, despite 
the downturn, in order to ensure appropriate 
and adequate resources are available to meet 
future demand. Increased professional and 
skilled resources, including in areas such as 
land buying, will be required and the Group’s 
successful graduate and apprenticeship 
programmes will need to be relaunched.
Efficient production
The competition for suppliers and contractors 
is expected to intensify when activity levels 
increase and shortages of labour, appropriate 
skills and materials, as well as cost pressures, 
may result. Whilst the Group’s strong 
procurement function and existing national 
procurement agreements with major suppliers 
will provide a firm base, it is committed to 
strengthening these relationships to ensure 
the support it needs as the market recovers.
Current outlook
The second half of the 2009 financial year has 
seen a degree of stability return to the UK 
housing market. The Company was able to 
maintain price levels after significant falls in 
the first half year, whilst achieving improved 
reservation rates per outlet. 
 
This trend has continued since the start of the 
new financial year with reservation rates in the 
first eleven weeks both above budget and 
those in the same period of the previous year. 
Overall reservation prices are running ahead 
of internal expectations.
Forward sales at 30 June 2009 were £464.3m 
(2008: £697.6m) representing 3,328 plots 
(2008: 4,586 plots). As at 13 September 2009 
forward sales had increased to £733.4m.
Total completions for the 2010 financial year 
are currently expected to be approximately 
12,000, with a similar mix between social and 
private completions, but consistent with the 
replanning and build programme undertaken 
since the second half of the 2009 financial 
year, a shift in product mix towards a higher 
proportion of houses. The Group anticipates 
this shift will slightly improve average selling 
prices for the period.
Nevertheless, the encouraging signs being 
experienced are subject to continued 
uncertainty in the wider economic climate. 
There is unlikely to be a sustained recovery in 
the UK housing market until mortgage finance 
is more readily available particularly in the 
higher loan to value segment and consumer 
confidence is more fully restored. 
Proposed Placing and Rights Issue
The Board is today announcing a fully 
underwritten Placing and Rights Issue to raise 
gross proceeds of approximately £720m, 
together with amended financing arrangements 
which will come into effect upon successful 
completion of the Placing and Rights Issue. 
The Firm Placing and Rights Issue will:
•  substantially strengthen the Group’s balance 
sheet and reduce its financial indebtedness;
•  allow the Group to develop its existing  
sites; and
•  improve the Group’s competitive positioning 
and enable it to take advantage of land 
purchasing opportunities as and when  
they arise in a period of market recovery.
The amended financing arrangements  
will enable the Group to take advantage of 
opportunities that may arise in a recovering 
market, as well as to provide an appropriate 
alternative framework, should a further 
downturn arise.

Report of the Directors
The Group has been operating in an extremely 
difficult market throughout the year. The deteriorating 
economic outlook and customer confidence coupled 
with constrained mortgage availability led to 
acceleration in the fall of house prices during the first 
half of the year. Whilst overall house prices remained 
relatively stable in the second half, mortgage finance 
remained difficult to obtain for many customers.
Business review
The Group delivered a profit from operations 
before exceptional items of £34.2m  
(2008: £550.2m). After inventory impairments 
of £499.5m (2008: £208.4m) and other net 
operating exceptional items of £20.0m  
(2008: £46.6m), the Group’s loss from 
operations was £485.3m (2008: £295.2m profit).
The key performance indicators of the 
business are outlined in the table on the  
next page. 
Housebuilding
The immensely difficult market in which the 
housebuilding business was operating 
significantly affected the results for the year. 
Market conditions meant that fewer new sites 
were opened and accordingly the average 
number of sites from which the Group was 
operating fell by 15.3% to 503 (2008: 594). 
Across housebuilding sites visitor numbers per 
site per week were down 4.0% from the prior 
year at 1.69 (2008: 1.76). Against the backdrop 
of decreasing site and visitor numbers, the 
private reservation rate per site per week 
increased by 10.5% from 0.38 to 0.42.
Total housebuilding completions were 13,202 
homes, a decrease of 29.0% on the prior year 
(2008: 18,588), and housebuilding revenue 
was £2,095.8m (2008: £3,414.2m). Of the total 
completions, private completions were 11,133, 
24.8% lower than the prior year (2008: 14,803), 
and social completions were 2,069, 45.3% 
lower than the prior year (2008: 3,785). Social 
housing completions represented 15.7% of 
completions in the year, versus 20.4% in the 
prior year, predominantly due to the decline  
in the number of new sites being opened.
Over the year, total average selling  
price decreased by 14.1% to £157,200  
(2008: £183,100). Private average selling 
prices decreased by 18.9% to £166,500 
(2008: £205,400). The decrease in private 
average selling prices reflects the significant 
fall in realisable sales values in the first half 
partially offset by a change in site and product 
mix. Social average selling prices increased, 
as a result of mix changes, by 11.7% to 
£107,100 (2008: £95,900). 
Housebuilding profit from operations before 
exceptional items was £38.8m (2008: £530.0m), 
giving an operating margin before exceptional 
items of 1.9% (2008: 15.5%). After inventory 
impairments of £431.5m (2008: £157 .2m) and 
other operating exceptional items of £14.9m 
(2008: £15.9m), housebuilding loss from 
operations was £407 .6m (2008: £356.9m profit).
The decrease in operating margin before 
exceptional items can be explained by a 
number of factors. First, underlying average 
selling prices, which exclude the impact of  
mix changes, have decreased by around 
22%, which has also reduced margins by 
approximately 22%, reflecting the significant 
fall in sales prices, particularly during the 
second quarter. In addition, selling costs 
reduced margin by around 0.6%. Cost 
reduction programmes, the reversal of land 
impairments, mix changes, land sales and 
other income benefited margins by 
approximately 9.0%.
Throughout the year there has been a focus 
on build costs. The housebuilding business 
has continued to reduce build costs through 
changing specifications, improving build and 
technical processes, renegotiating subcontractor 
rates and reducing the cost of materials. 
In addition to reductions in construction costs, 
there has been focus upon reducing the 
number of stock units held by the business 
and tight control of work in progress. 
Unreserved roof to complete units reduced by 
61.1% to 2,008 (2008: 5,157) and unreserved 
completed properties reduced by 54.9% to 
822 (2008: 1,821). 
The option of part-exchange remains an 
effective selling tool, with 11.8% (2008: 12.3%) 
of the Group’s completions in the year 
supported by the use of part-exchange 
incentives, but the housebuilding business 
continues to manage carefully its commitment 
to part-exchange properties. The number of 
unreserved part-exchange properties fell from 
677 at 30 June 2008 to 150 on 30 June 2009, 
a reduction of 77.8%. 10 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The housebuilding business has continued to 
reduce its overhead cost base throughout the 
year. Central functions and certain operating 
divisions have been re-organised, and seven 
operating divisions have either been closed or 
merged. During the year, restructuring costs 
of £22.0m have been incurred (2008: £15.9m).
Commercial developments
Conditions in the commercial property market 
continue to be extremely challenging, with 
pressure on rental incomes and, in turn, yields. 
Revenue from the commercial property business 
in the year totalled £189.4m (2008: £140.5m) and 
loss from operations before exceptional items 
was £4.6m (2008: £20.2m profit). Exceptional 
items were £73. 1m (2008: £81.9m), consisting of 
£68.0m (2008: £51.2m) impairment of inventories 
and restructuring costs of £5. 1m (2008: £nil) and 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of 
£nil (2008: £30.7m).
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the 
commercial developments business completed 
and sold the Eagles Meadow shopping centre  
in Wrexham, comprising 392,600 square feet  
of prime retail space, having secured lettings  
or offers for 90% of the scheme. 
On industrial sites, the commercial 
developments business completed the sale of 
a portfolio of land and commercial property 
on nine sites in central England and the sales 
of 73,300 square feet to Terex Pegson and 
19,400 square feet to Volvo at the Interlink 
development in Leicestershire.
 
With regard to the office portfolio, in February 
the commercial developments business 
completed construction of a forward-sold 
102,700 square feet development in the heart 
of Manchester.
Following the sales made during the year, the 
commercial developments business, which 
includes Wilson Bowden Developments as 
well as a number of commercial properties in 
Scotland, retains investment and development 
opportunities, including certain town centre 
retail schemes and certain city centre office 
opportunities, with a net asset value of 
£55.9m with a view to realising value when  
the market improves.
Land
The Group land bank consists of both owned 
and controlled plots. At 30 June 2009, the 
Group had 68,000 (2008: 78,700) owned  
and controlled plots.
Land additions during the year were £219m 
(2008: £922m). At financial year 2009 
completion rates, the Group’s owned and 
controlled land bank is sufficient for 5.2 years 
(2008: 6.0 years). The Group has continued  
to invest in new land where contractually 
committed to do so or, more recently, where  
it has been able to secure attractively priced 
opportunities on deferred terms.
The average cost per plot in the Group’s land 
bank was £44,000 at 30 June 2009
(2008: £44,400).
At 30 June 2009, detailed planning consents 
were in place on over 96.0% of land required 
to meet forecast activity for the next year 
(2008: 97.2%). In addition, the Group has 
10,400 acres of strategic land (2008: 10,900 
acres) which, until the necessary planning 
consents are obtained, is carried at current 
use value minimising the Group’s exposure  
to risk from its strategic land holdings.
During the year, the Group has impaired its 
inventories by £499.5m (2008: £208.4m), of 
which £494.9m arose in the first half, further 
details of which are provided in the Group

Core strengths
The Group’s core strengths of geographic and 
product diversity, quality and service and 
people and expertise remain robust, despite 
the more challenging operating environment. 
Geographic and product diversity
The Group’s housebuilding business operates 
throughout Britain, trading nationally under 
the Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes 
brands and in the South East under the local 
Ward Homes brand. At 30 June 2009, the 
Group was selling from 434 sites (2008: 585 
sites). Following divisional closures and 
mergers during the year, the Group now 
operates from 25 divisions. The Group, 
despite the cost reduction programme, has 
been careful to maintain both its product 
range and geographical reach throughout  
the year in order to spread its risks.
Each division has a dedicated land buying 
team with local knowledge and experience. 
These teams identify land suitable for 
development and secure planning permission 
to enable new homes to be built. This 
replans to increase the proportion of houses 
available on its sites in future.
The provision of social housing remains a key 
component of the Group’s activities with 
2,069 homes (2008: 3,785 homes) completed 
during the financial year ended 30 June 2009 
at an average selling price of £107,100 (2008: 
£95,900). In December 2008, the Group was 
allocated approximately 3,000 units under the 
HomeBuy Direct scheme with an anticipated 
sales value of approximately £500m. As at  
30 June 2009, 138 units had been legally 
completed, a further 172 had been reserved 
and there were 118 pending reservation. The 
Group is also pursuing other Government 
initiatives such as the Kickstart Housing Delivery 
programme announced in the 2009 Budget. 
Quality and service
The Group is committed to offering the 
highest standards of quality and customer 
service. The Group seeks to develop its 
quality and service standards by listening to 
its customers, monitoring its performance  
and adopting best practice throughout the 
organisation. The Group continues to make 
progress in improving customer service and
capability, combined with the Group’s 
strategic land portfolio, is designed to ensure 
that the Group has sufficient land to meet 
customer demand now and in the future as 
and when the market improves.
The Group serves all sectors of the market, 
creating homes for sale and shared ownership 
and works with Government agencies, housing 
associations, and other agencies on a broad 
range of urban regeneration schemes. The 
Group’s wide product range varies from homes 
for first time buyers, large family homes and 
high rise apartments to social housing and 
commercial development. Private selling prices 
during the 2009 financial year ranged from 
£47,500 to £2.3m, with an average selling price 
for the year of £166,500.
Throughout the year, there was a reduction  
in the demand for apartments, particularly in 
areas outside of London and the South East. 
The Group is currently replanning a number  
of sites replacing apartments with houses, 
which require less initial capital investment,  
to cater for this change. During the year, 
houses represented 50.5% (2008: 54.9%)  
of the Group’s completions, excluding central 
London, although the Group expects site  Would recommend to a friend

during the year, 96% of customers independently 
surveyed said they would recommend the Group 
to a friend, a satisfactory achievement against a 
backdrop of considerable change in the business 
and the market.
The Group’s high quality homes have been 
recognised independently by the recent 
achievement of Four Star builder status in  
the Home Builders Federation 4th annual 
customer satisfaction survey and 76 ‘Pride  
in the Job’ quality awards from the National 
House-Building Council.
The Directors believe that it is important to 
build high quality products which meet the 
needs of the Group’s customers in order to 
make it a housebuilder of choice. The Group’s 
sales and marketing teams continue to promote 
the Barratt Homes and David Wilson 
Homes brand names as brands which 
customers will associate with homes that  
they would want to live in, through the use  
of a variety of media channels.
The sales and marketing team have increased 
their efforts to promote the Group’s brands in 
response to the economic downturn. More 
focused marketing campaigns have been 
introduced through various media channels 
(internet, radio and direct mail), targeted 
incentives and discounts have been offered to 
customers and tools such as shared equity 
products, part-exchange and other innovative 
offers have been utilised to support sales.
The Group also introduced new sales 
technology, I-Sales, in 90 of its sales centres 
across Britain during the 2009 financial year. 
I-Sales combines website capability with the 
Group’s computerised customer database to 
allow sales staff to communicate with 
customers directly via e-mail. I-Sales is 
expected to be extended to all sales outlets 
during the current financial year.
The Group continues to use part-exchange as 
a selling tool for those customers who are 
finding it difficult to find a purchaser for their 
existing home. The Group’s ability to sell 
part-exchange units is demonstrated by the 
reduction in the number of unreserved 
part-exchange properties from 677 as at 
30 June 2008 to 150 as at 30 June 2009.
The Group also recognises the importance of 
assisting customers to find suitable financial 
assistance to purchase their new homes.  
The Group’s Lender Relations Manager works 
closely with mortgage lenders in order to 
assure them that the homes built by the 
Group are of a high quality which they can 
“The Group is committed to offering 
the highest standards of quality and 
customer service.”
The Group continues to make progress in improving customer service 
and during the year, 96% of customers independently surveyed said 
they would recommend the Group to a friend, a satisfactory 
achievement against a backdrop of considerable change in the 
business and the market.
The Group continues to make progress to improve the design of its 
products, internally, externally and for the development as a whole. 
The Group has been awarded its first ever Building for Life award for 
the development at City Point in Brighton (below left).

confidently lend on and to gain their support  
for affordable housing schemes such as the 
HomeBuy Direct scheme. The Group has also 
introduced a transparency policy which requires 
all sales staff to determine the ‘true’ identity  
of potential customers and to identify the true 
net price of properties sold to mitigate its and 
the mortgage lenders’ risk of inadvertently 
becoming involved in mortgage fraud. 
The Group’s procurement team negotiates 
national procurement agreements with all 
major suppliers and, as a result, it made 
further progress with its cost reduction 
programmes during the 2009 financial year, 
with improved efficiency and reductions in 
build costs, particularly in terms of technical 
specification. The Group has also made 
progress by renegotiating terms and pricing 
with its subcontractors at a local level. 
People and expertise
The Group recognises that one of its key 
strengths is its people and that despite the 
current economic environment it is important 
to continue to develop and invest in its people 
and their expertise. The Group has a Personal 
Development Review process, which involves 
one-to-one formal reviews every six months 
with regular informal review meetings taking 
place in between. These meetings are used  
to deal with any issues that individuals may 
have as well as identifying any training and 
development requirements and setting individual 
achievement targets for the year ahead.
The Group runs a Graduate Recruitment and 
Development Programme consisting of a two 
year multi-disciplinary programme of both 
on-job and off-job modules. Thirty graduates 
have recently completed the first two year 
programme and have all secured full-time 
roles within the business. Five graduates  
are currently entering their second year 
programme. On account of the downturn in 
the sector, the Group decided not to increase 
the number of graduates in the programme  
in the 2009 financial year but aims to recruit 
further graduates under the programme as 
and when the sector recovers.
Succession planning is in place across the 
Group and there are currently four leadership 
development programmes in place to assist 
with the development of individuals as part  
of the succession plan.
The Group conducts an engagement survey  
on an annual basis in order to gauge staff 
perception of working for the Group. The survey, 
consisting of a number of questions on a variety 
of work-related topics (such as work-life 
balance, support from line managers and 
communication), is circulated to all members  
of staff who complete the survey anonymously. 
The Group’s HR team prepare an engagement 
index based on the percentage of questions 
achieving the highest score. For the year ended 
30 June 2009 the engagement index increased 
by 59% compared to the previous year.
‘Get Recognised’, the Group’s motivational 
recognition programme, was developed and 
launched across the Group in late September 
2008. The scheme retains the best aspects of 
previous awards schemes whilst adding new 
elements such as instant and peer group 
recognition. Instant recognition enables peers 
as well as managers to nominate a colleague 
or team member who has performed above 
and beyond expectations, and successful 
nominations result in individuals winning 
experiences up to £1,000 in value.
The Group has also set key performance 
indicators to measure the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the Group’s people strategies 
and enable it to take appropriate action on 
staff turnover, retention, sickness, absence 
and capability.
The Group continues to make progress 
towards its target of a fully carded CSCS 
(Construction Skills Certification Scheme) 
workforce, including its subcontractors, by 
2010. At present, 95.4% (2008: 90%) of the 
Group’s workforce, including subcontractors, 
has achieved this target.
Corporate Responsibility
The Group is committed to the principles  
of Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) and has 
publicly stated this commitment in its CR  
policy which is available on the Group’s 
website, www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.

Report of the Directors | Business review
The Group has established a CR steering 
group to oversee the development and 
implementation of CR objectives and targets. 
The steering group has identified and assessed 
the key CR risks facing the business, which 
include Environmental, Social and Governance 
(‘ESG’) risks facing the business and has 
developed six charters that will be used to 
manage these risks and deliver the Group’s 
strategic CR objectives. The six charters are 
based around Environment, Health and Safety, 
Customers and People, Supply Chain and 
Communities. Operational functions within the 
business are responsible for each charter and 
integrate the Group’s CR strategy into normal 
business operations. This process ensures that 
adequate information in relation to ESG matters 
is available to the Board. Significant ESG risks 
that could impact on the future of the business 
are included in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section on pages 18 and 19.
The Group publishes a CR report each year 
that explains its approach to CR and its 
management of CR governance and risk,  
and reports on the actions taken by the  
Group during the year to improve CR 
performance. CR disclosures in the Annual 
Report and Accounts and CR report, 
including disclosures on ESG matters, are 
based on information collected annually from 
the business and from regular management 
information. This information is independently 
reviewed internally and sample information is 
checked through the internal audit process.
The Group’s CR reports are available on its 
website, www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. 
Environment and supply chain
The Group operates in a regulatory 
environment which is continuously changing, 
especially in respect of building regulations, 
planning requirements and environmental and 
sustainability requirements. The Government 
recently set a target for housebuilders to build 
all new homes with zero carbon emissions  
by 2016. In response to this the Group  
has established and follows a strong 
environmental agenda which emphasises  
the provision of low cost solutions to meet 
increasing environmental standards. 
The Group has also been selected as the 
preferred developer of the Carbon Challenge 
Development at Hanham Hall near Bristol. 
This development, which is expected to be 
completed in 2013, will become one of the 
first large scale zero carbon communities in 
Britain and is being built in partnership with 
the Homes and Communities Agency. Each  
of the 195 units will also meet Level Six of the 
Government’s Code for Sustainable Homes. 
The Group is committed to undertaking 
research and development that will enable  
it to respond to the increasingly stringent 
design criteria for modern housing. In 2008, 
The Group’s construction teams won 76 ‘Pride in the Job’ quality 
awards from the NHBC. Graham Watson and Jane Grendall NHBC

the Group was the first major housebuilder  
to build a home at the Building Research 
Establishment in Watford, the Green House, 
to Level Six, the highest level attainable, of  
the UK Government’s Code for Sustainable 
Homes. The Green House is currently being 
scientifically tested in order to provide valuable 
information as to how the Group can design 
and construct zero carbon homes successfully 
and cost effectively. 
The Group has an environmental charter in 
place which is reviewed and updated on an 
annual basis. The charter sets targets for the 
Group to manage its own environmental 
impacts, including energy and waste 
reduction, help its customers to improve the 
environment and improve the environmental 
standards of the homes that it builds.
The Group continues to build the majority of its 
developments on brownfield sites, with 70% 
(2008: 68%) of its completions in the year being 
built on brownfield land, which significantly 
exceeds the Government’s target of 60%. 
The Group assesses its performance against 
its environmental objectives by monitoring 
several performance indicators. The key 
performance indicator that the Group has 
chosen to monitor environmental performance 
is the average amount of carbon dioxide the 
Group emits during the construction process 
per unit completed. This metric increased 
from 1,429 kgCO
2
/unit in 2007 to 1,792 
kgCO
2
/unit in 2008 as data collection 
methods were refined and has now reduced 
to 1,782 kgCO
2
/unit which provides  
a stable baseline from which to set targets  
for reduction. The Group also monitors the 
proportion of construction waste segregated 
for recycling on site, which this year improved 
to 73% (2008: 58%). In addition, the Group 
continually seeks to monitor the numbers of 
environmental complaints logged through its 
environmental management system and the 
number of developments with biodiversity 
action plans and flood risk assessments. 
Health and Safety
The Group considers health and safety to be 
of paramount importance for its employees, 
customers and the public and has

implemented a comprehensive Safety, 
Health and Environmental Management 
System across its business.
The Group has strategies and programmes, 
not only to raise awareness, but also to 
ensure that it is applying effective systems  
to reduce injury and ill health across the 
business. A Health and Safety Committee, 
including members of the Board, has been 
formed in order to provide further focus to 
the improvement strategy and to review 
overall Group performance. During the 
financial year ended 30 June 2009, the 
Group’s commitment to health and safety 
reduced its reportable Injury Incidence Rate 
(‘IIR’) to 522 per 100,000 persons employed 
which is a 20.4% decrease on the rate of 
656 per 100,000 reported last year. The IIR 
is a key performance indicator which the 
business uses to measure health and safety 
performance on a monthly and annual basis. 
The Group is pleased to have achieved a 
long-term objective to reduce the IIR below 
560 per 100,000 by 2010, one year ahead of 
target, and remains committed to reducing 
the IIR year on year.

Report of the Directors | Business review
All divisions within the Group are certified to 
the health and safety standard OHSAS 18001 
which is verified by a programme of internal 
and external auditing. This demonstrates  
the commitment to have consistent and 
appropriate standards in place and is 
complemented by the Group’s own Safety, 
Health and Environmental Management 
System which has been fully reviewed during 
the year. The Group’s in-house team of 
advisers has carried out over 4,000 monitoring 
visits to its developments and this has 
contributed to a significant increase in 
standards and the awareness of the Group’s 
site teams. In the year ended 30 June 2009, 
divisions achieved an average of 96% 
compliance with the Safety, Health and 
Environmental Management System. In 
addition, a majority of the Group’s Safety,

During the financial year ended 30 June 2009, 
the Group continued to review and update 
management systems to mitigate certain key 
risks previously identified, being fire in high rise 
buildings, the integrity of reinforced concrete 
structures and the operation of tower cranes. 
The investigation by the police and the Health 
and Safety Executive into the incident at Bedfont 
in February 2008, where carbon monoxide 
poisoning from a gas heating installation caused 
the death of one person and left another 
seriously ill, continues. The Group is working 
closely with the authorities during the 
investigation and awaits the outcome. 
Communities
The Group aims to ensure that the 
developments it builds have a positive social 
and environmental impact on the people that 
live in and around them, and has committed 
through the Community Charter to improve  
its relationship with local people affected by 
new developments through consultation and 
engagement, tackling the issues around 
housing affordability and aims to ensure that 
standards of design are as high as possible.
The Group serves all sectors of the market, 
creating homes for sale and shared 
ownership and works with Government 
agencies, housing associations and other 
agencies on a broad range of urban 
regeneration schemes and completed 2,069 
social homes during the year. In addition, in 
December 2008, the Group was allocated 
approximately 3,000 units under the 
HomeBuy Direct scheme, where the 
purchaser pays 70% or more of the value  
of the home and the Government and the 
Group pay the balance. During the year the 
Group has also provided its own shared 
equity products, which include Dreamstart 
and Headstart, for 1,369 homes.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s financial and operational performance is subject to a number of risks. The Board seeks to ensure that appropriate processes are put in place  
to manage, monitor and mitigate these risks which are identified in the table below. The Group recognises that the management of risk is fundamental to  
the achievement of Group targets. As such all tiers of management are involved in this process. Principal risks of the Group include, but are not limited to:
Risk Mitigation
Market
Response to changes in the macroeconomic 
environment including unemployment, buyer confidence, 
availability of mortgage finance for purchasers, interest 
rates and the impact of competitor pricing.
A weekly review is undertaken of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, 
levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections.
The Group seeks to provide mortgage providers with complete transparency regarding house purchase 
prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon 
which to base their lending decision.
The Group works with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible  
for its customers.
Design and construction defects may lead to cost 
overruns including remedial costs, and may reduce selling 
prices and adversely impact the Group’s reputation.
The Group has a comprehensive approach to quality, service and customer care encapsulated in the 
‘Forward through Quality’ initiative and customer care code of practice.
Liquidity
Availability of sufficient borrowing facilities to enable  
the servicing of liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are 
designed to ensure that it has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Group’s borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May and 
October and November of each year, as these are the points in the year when the Group has the highest 
working capital requirements. Accordingly, the Group maintains sufficient headroom to cover these 
requirements. On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of £250m  
of available committed facilities.
The Group has in place a comprehensive detailed regular forecasting process encompassing profitability, 
working capital and cash flow that is fully embedded in the business. These forecasts are further stress 
tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking 
covenants is maintained.
Inability to obtain surety bonds. The Group actively maintains the number of surety facilities that are designed to ensure that it has sufficient bonds 
available. The Group has a comprehensive detailed regular forecasting process for surety bond requirements.
Inability of the Group to refinance its facilities  
as they fall due.
The Group has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private placement notes in aggregate 
is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
Inability of the Group to comply with  
its borrowing covenants.
The Group is in compliance with its borrowing covenants and at the date of approval of the financial 
statements the Group’s internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants  
for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements.
The Board is today announcing a fully underwritten Placing and Rights Issue to raise gross proceeds of 
approximately £720m, together with amended financing arrangements which will come into effect upon 
successful completion of the Placing and Rights Issue. The amended financing arrangements will enable 
the Group to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in a recovering market, as well as to provide  
an appropriate alternative framework, should a further downturn arise.
As explained on page 58, while the existing financing arrangements apply, if conditions in the wider UK 
economy, as they relate to the housebuilding sector, were to decline below that which has been assumed in 
the Group’s forecasts during the current financial year (and notwithstanding further management actions to 
both conserve and generate cash, including, if necessary, by making land sales) then there is a risk that the 
Group might generate lower than anticipated revenues, or cash, or require further write-downs in the value  
of the Group’s assets. This risk may result in the Group being unable to comply with its existing covenant 
package during the current financial year. If the amended financing arrangements do not come into effect, the 
Group will need to renegotiate the terms of its existing financing arrangements during the current financial year 
in order to secure revolving credit facilities of an appropriate duration so as to give the Directors increased 
confidence that they will be able to prepare the accounts in respect of such a period on a going concern basis 
and also to secure a covenant package across all its financing arrangements that provides greater flexibility. 
People
Ability of the Group to attract, retain and develop  
a sufficiently skilled and experienced workforce.
The Group has a comprehensive Human Resources policy in place which includes apprentice schemes, 
a Graduate Recruitment Programme, succession planning and training schemes tailored to each discipline. 
The Group has set itself the target of having a fully CSCS carded and qualified workforce by 2010.
Underfunding of the Group’s obligations in respect  
of the defined benefit pension scheme.
An actuarial valuation is conducted every three years. The Group reviews this and considers what 
additional contributions are necessary to make good this shortfall. To limit the risk further, with effect  
from 30 June 2009, the scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current 
employees and the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 19
Report of the Directors | Business review
Risk Mitigation
Subcontractors and suppliers
Shortages or increased costs of materials and skilled 
labour could increase costs and delay construction.
The Group adopts a professional approach to site management and seeks to partner with its supply chain.
Failure of a key supplier or inability to secure supplies 
upon appropriate credit terms.
The Group has a policy of having multiple suppliers for both labour contracts and material supplies and 
contingency plans should key suppliers fail.
Land
Securing sufficient land of appropriate size and quality 
to provide profitable growth subject to the available 
borrowing facilities.
Each division produces a detailed site-by-site monthly analysis of the amount of land currently owned, 
committed and identified. These are consolidated for regular review at Board level. In addition, each 
operating division holds weekly land meetings.
Every land acquisition is subject to a formal appraisal procedure and is required to achieve an overall Group 
defined hurdle rate of return.
The timing of conditional land purchase contracts 
becoming unconditional is uncertain. Unexpected 
changes in contract status may result in additional 
cash outflow for the Group.
Each division has a site-by-site detailed short-term and medium-term forecasting process including 
sensitivity scenarios.
Falls in house prices or land values or a failure of  
the housing market to recover could lead to further 
impairments of the Group’s inventories, goodwill  
and intangible assets.
The Group’s internal systems clearly identify the impact of sales price changes on the margin achievable. 
Biannual asset impairment reviews are performed.
The market for land can be illiquid and therefore it may 
be difficult to sell or trade land if required. Where land  
is sold, there is a risk that the proceeds may not be 
received from the counterparty.
The Group’s internal forecasting process is able to identify the impact of these sensitivities explicitly.
Government regulation
Changes in Government policy towards the 
housebuilding industry.
The Group consults with the UK Government both directly and through industry bodies to highlight  
potential issues.
The housebuilding industry is subject to extensive and 
complex regulations and an increasingly stringent 
regulatory environment including planning and 
technical requirements.
The Group has considerable in-house technical and planning expertise devoted to complying with 
regulations and achieving implementable planning consents.
Consequence of changes in tax legislation. The Group has adopted a low risk strategy to tax planning and potential and actual changes in tax 
legislation are monitored by both industry experienced in-house finance teams and external tax advisers.
Construction
Failure to identify and achieve key construction 
milestones, including the impact of adverse weather 
conditions, could delay construction or increase costs.
The Group’s weekly reporting identifies the number of properties at key stages of construction. Projected 
construction rates are evaluated as part of the monthly forecasting cycle.
Large development projects, including commercial 
developments, are complex and capital intensive  
and changes may negatively impact upon cash  
flows or returns.
Development projects, including returns and cash flows, are monitored regularly by divisional  
management teams.
Failure to promptly identify cost overruns. The total costs on every site in progress are evaluated at least quarterly and reviewed by the divisional 
management teams.
Cost reduction measures may adversely affect the 
Group’s business or its ability to respond to future 
improvements in market conditions.
In parallel to reducing costs during the downturn a Main Board level committee has developed a ‘Planning 
for Recovery’ programme.
Exposure to environmental liabilities and 
consideration of the impact of construction schemes 
upon the environment and social surroundings.
The Group regularly monitors a number of environmental impact indicators. The results of this will appear 
in the Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
Litigation and uninsured losses. The Group has an in-house legal department and consults with external lawyers as appropriate.  
The Group maintains insurance cover for all main risks of the Group.
Health and safety
Health and safety. The Group has a dedicated health and safety audit department which is independent of the management 
of the operating divisions.
IT
Failure of the Group’s IT systems, in particular those 
relating to surveying and valuation, could adversely 
impact the performance of the Group.
The Group has a fully tested disaster recovery programme in place.
Details of the Group’s management of liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk in relation to financial instruments is provided in note 26

Report of the Directors
It has been a very challenging year for the Group. 
During the first half, conditions became immensely 
difficult as a result of the deteriorating economic outlook 
and the resulting contraction in the availability of 
mortgage finance and decline in customer confidence 
levels. Sales were only achievable at substantially reduced 
prices. In the second half, the Group started to 
experience some pricing stability, albeit at reduced levels, 
and more acceptable sales rates allowing the Group to 
achieve its cash targets. Against this backdrop, the 
Group has had to balance the priorities of delivering 
sales, reducing costs and generating cash. Overall, the 
Group made a pre-tax loss for the year after exceptional 
items of £678.9m (2008: £137.3m profit).

Exceptional items
Operating exceptional items
i) Impairment of land and work in progress
The Group recognised a total impairment of 
land and work in progress of £499.5m (2008: 
£208.4m) during the year. This impairment 
comprised £431.5m (2008: £157.2m) related 
to the housebuilding business and £68.0m 
(2008: £51.2m) related to the commercial 
developments business. 
The Group completed site-by-site impairment 
reviews using valuations incorporating 
forecast sales rates and average selling prices 
that reflected both current and anticipated 
trading conditions during both the first and 
second half. At 31 December, the impairment  Revenue

Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 21
Report of the Directors | Group Finance Director’s review
of £494.9m reflected difficult trading 
conditions that the Group experienced during 
the second quarter. During the second half, 
average selling prices across the Group’s 
developments were in line with those 
incorporated into the impairment review at  
31 December and therefore overall no further 
impairment was required in the housebuilding 
business, although there were gross 
impairment reversals and charges of £120.9m 
due to performance variations across 
housebuilding sites. An additional impairment 
of £4.6m was made against an office 
development within the commercial 
developments business. 
ii) Restructuring costs
During the year, the Group closed seven 
trading divisions, restructured Wilson Bowden 
Developments and continued to adjust the 
size of its operations in light of the difficult 
trading conditions resulting in £27.1m  
(2008: £15.9m plus impairments of goodwill 
and intangibles of £30.7m) of restructuring 
costs predominantly related to redundancies 
and office closures. 
iii) Pension curtailment
The Group has recognised a curtailment gain 
in the income statement of £7.1m (2008: £nil) 
related to the defined benefit pension 
scheme. This arose due to the cessation of 
future accrual of defined benefit pensions  
for current employees and the associated 
removal of the link between accrued benefits 
and future salary increases and redundancies 
made during the year.
Financing exceptional item
During the year the Group incurred charges  
of £13.3m in respect of the make-whole fee 
which was triggered on the repayment of 
£36.7m of private placement notes.
Impairment of inventories relating to joint 
venture investments
At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted  
an impairment review of its share of the 
inventories included within its investments 
accounted for using the equity method.  
This resulted in an impairment charge for  
the year of £2.8m with a related deferred  
tax credit of £0.8m.
 
Tax impact of exceptional items
The tax impact of the operating and financing 
exceptional items is £148.3m (2008: £66.8m). 
Tax
The Group’s tax credit for the year was 
£210.3m (2008: £50.9m charge), an effective 
rate of 31.0% (2008: 37.1%). This is higher than 
the standard rate of 28% mainly due to 
adjustments in respect of previous years, 
which include a review of the Group’s 
historical contaminated land relief claims.
During the year, the Group received tax refunds 
totalling £51.3m mainly related to tax overpaid 
for 2008 due to the inventory impairments 
required at 30 June 2008. Since the year end, 
the Group has received repayments of over 
£40m of corporation tax related to the carry 
back of losses from the current year.

Report of the Directors | Group Finance Director’s review
Dividend 
The Board suspended dividend payments in 
June 2008 as part of its cash conservation 
policy. The Board remains focused on 
strengthening the balance sheet and 
conserving cash. The existing terms of the 
Group’s committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes also impose certain 
restrictions on the payment of dividends.  
In light of these restrictions, no final dividend 
will be paid in respect of the financial year 
ended 30 June 2009. 
The Board is committed to reinstating the 
payment of dividends and will do so when it 
becomes appropriate and permissible to do so.
Losses recognised in equity
During the year £70.4m of losses have been 
recognised in equity (2008: £4.0m) predominantly 
relating to losses on interest rate swaps.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the Group decreased by 
£536.2m to £2,331.6m reflecting the loss  
after tax for the year of £468.6m. 
Significant movements in the balance sheet 
include:
The Group’s book value of land was • 
£2,453.2m (2008: £3,117.5m), a decrease  
of £664.3m. This decrease includes land 
additions of £219m offset by land usage 
and the impairment of land explained 
above. During the current year, the Group 
reduced its actual expenditure on land 
following the deterioration in the market to 
£263.7m from the expenditure of 
approximately £1.0 billion in the prior year. 
 Work in progress of the Group at 30 June • 
2009 was £1,044.2m (2008: £1,569.3m). 
The fall of £525.1m reflects the Group’s 
strategy of decreasing stock holdings and 
generating cash to reduce debt. At 30 June 
2009, unreserved completed units were 
down 54.9% from 1,821 units in the prior 
year to 822 units.
 Part-exchange properties and other • 
inventories were £43.4m (2008: £143.2m) 
with the decrease reflecting the increased 
focus upon managing the working capital 
impact of this highly effective sales tool. At 
30 June 2009, owned unreserved units had 
fallen to 150 units from 677 in the prior year.
Group net debt decreased by £373.7m to • 
£1,276.9m over the full year. Due to the 
renewal of the Group’s borrowing facilities 
during the year only £8.5m (2008: £653.7m) is 
classified as a current liability at 30 June 2009.
 Goodwill and intangible assets remained at • 
£892.2m as the annual impairment review 
of the entire housebuilding business 
indicated that no impairment was required.
 The pension fund deficit on the Barratt • 
Developments defined benefit pension 
scheme reduced by £5.7m in the year to 
£31.5m after adjusting for the impact of the 
Group’s change of accounting policy to 
recognise immediately actuarial gains and 
losses following the curtailment of the 
scheme. The closure of the scheme with 
effect from 30 June 2009 with the resulting 
cessation of future accrual of defined 
benefit pensions for current employees  
and the associated removal of the link 
between accrued benefits and future salary 
increases contributed £7 .1m to this reduction. 
 The Group has recognised a corporation • 
tax asset of £50.6m and a deferred tax 
asset of £127.3m. The Group’s deferred tax 
asset has increased by £159.4m in the year 
including £130.1m due to trading losses 
that will be carried forward to offset the tax 
liabilities arising from future trading profits.
 Trade and other payables decreased by • 
£298.1m to £1,107.8m reflecting the 
decreased activity of the Group.
Cash flow
Group net debt at the year end was £1,276.9m 
(2008: £1,650.6m). The decrease in net debt 
is explained by the tables on page 23.
The decrease in net debt of £373.7m during 
the year is made up of inflows of £227.8m in 
the first half and £145.9m in the second half. 
The inflows reflect the disposal of assets from 
the Wilson Bowden Developments portfolio, 
tax refunds and reduced expenditure on  
land and work in progress which offset 
declining revenues.
The Group continues to be committed to 
reducing net debt over the short-term and  
has focused the business upon maximising 
cash generation whilst ensuring that it 
maintains an appropriate balance between 
volume and margin.
Treasury
The Board approves treasury policies and 
certain day-to-day treasury activities have 
been delegated to a Treasury Operating 
Committee that in turn regularly reports to  
the Board. The Group operates a centralised 
treasury function which operates within 
guidelines established by the Board and  
the Treasury Operating Committee. 
The Group has a conservative treasury risk 
management strategy which includes a target 
that 60-80% of the Group’s median gross 
borrowings calculated on the latest three-year 
plan should be at fixed rates of interest. At 30 
June 2009, 68.4% of the Group borrowings 
were fixed (2008: 61.6%). Group interest rates 
are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate  
debt instruments. 
Borrowing facilities 
In July 2008, the Group entered into a new 
£400m three-year committed revolving credit 
facility agreement. Around the same time, the 
Group also agreed an amendment to the 
Group’s existing £400m committed revolving 
credit facility agreement which extended the 
maturity date of £350m of the total commitments 
under that facility to 8 July 2011 to correspond 
to the expiry date of the new facilities (with 
£50m of commitments still scheduled to expire 
in February 2010). The Group redeemed 
£600m of its existing term loan facilities during 
the first half of which £200m was ahead of 
schedule due to the Group’s strong cash 
generation. The Group also repaid £36.7m of 
private placement notes on 12 January 2009. 
At this time, £13.3m of additional private 
placement notes were issued due to the 
make-whole requirements that apply under  
the private placement agreements.
In August 2008, the Group agreed to amend 
the financial covenants that apply under all of 
the Group’s committed bank facilities and 
private placement notes. The amendments 
suspended the application of the interest 
cover test and introduced a cash flow cover 
test that would apply in its place. Amendments 
were also made to the tangible net worth and 
gearing covenants.  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 23
Report of the Directors | Group Finance Director’s review
The average net debt during the year to  
30 June 2009 was approximately £1.8 billion, 
with net finance costs of 9.4%. Net finance 
costs following the amended financing 
arrangements coming into effect are currently 
expected to be around 8% of average net 
debt for the 2010 financial year.
Capital requirements
The financial performance of the Group  
is dependent upon the wider economic 
environment in which the Group operates  
in particular changes in the macroeconomic 
climate including buyer confidence, availability  
of mortgage finance for our purchasers, interest 
rates and the impact of competitor pricing.  
At 30 June 2009, the net debt position of  
the Group was £1,276.9m with headroom of 
£800.0m under the Group’s committed facilities. 
The Group is in compliance with its loan 
covenants and at the date of approval of  
the financial statements the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance 
with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
being at least twelve months from the date  
of signing the financial statements.

The Board is today announcing a fully 
underwritten Placing and Rights Issue  
to raise gross proceeds of approximately  
£720m, together with amended financing 
arrangements which will come into effect 
upon successful completion of the Placing 
and Rights Issue. The amended financing 
arrangements will enable the Group to take 
advantage of opportunities that may arise  
in a recovering market, as well as to provide 
an appropriate alternative framework, should 
a further downturn arise.
However, as explained on page 58, while the 
existing financing arrangements apply, if 
conditions in the wider UK economy, as they 
relate to the housebuilding sector, were to decline 
below that which has been assumed in the 
Group’s forecasts during the current financial 
year (and notwithstanding further management 
actions both to conserve and generate cash, 
including, if necessary, by making land sales) 
then there is a risk that the Group might generate 
lower than anticipated revenues, or cash, or 
require further write-downs in the value of the 
Group’s assets. This risk may result in the Group 
being unable to comply with its existing covenant 
package during the current financial year. If the 
amended financing arrangements do not come 
into effect, the Group will need to renegotiate  
the terms of its existing financing arrangements 
during the current financial year in order to  
secure revolving credit facilities of an appropriate 
duration so as to give the Directors increased 
confidence that they will be able to prepare the 
accounts in respect of such a period on a going 
concern basis and also to secure a covenant 
package across all its financing arrangements 
that provides greater flexibility. 
In conclusion
During the year, the Group has had to balance  
its priorities of maximising sales, reducing costs 
and managing cash to reduce debt. These were 
achieved despite the difficult conditions in the 
wider UK economy and net debt was decreased 
by £373.7m. The Group is committed to reducing 
net debt further and remains focused on 
maximising cash generation whilst ensuring that 
it maintains an appropriate balance between 
volume and margin.

movements in the Directors’ interests in executive share options are shown in the Remuneration report on page 51.
Under the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association, Mr M S Clare and Mr S J Boyes will retire in consequence of the period since their  
last re-election at the AGM to be held on 17 November 2009 and being eligible will offer themselves for re-election at that meeting. In addition,  
Mr D F Thomas and Miss T E Bamford will also retire at the AGM and offer themselves for election having been appointed by the Board since the  
last AGM.
At no time during or at the end of the year did any Director have a material interest in a contract of significance in relation to the business of the Group. 
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employer’s long-term incentive and share option plans it was agreed with Mr D F Thomas that 
he would be granted an one-off award that seeks to target benefits equivalent to the options granted under the Barratt Developments 2008 Executive 
Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) in 2008. In order to satisfy this obligation, Mr D F Thomas will be granted an option by the trustees of the Employee  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 27
Report of the Directors | Statutory Information
Benefit Trust which, if and when exercised, will be satisfied from ordinary shares acquired in the market. The option will be over 666,666 ordinary 
shares at an exercise price per share of 55 pence. The option will be subject to the same performance targets as the options granted under the 
ESOS in 2008 and will be on substantially the same terms and conditions as those options.
Property, plant and equipment
The Directors are of the opinion that the value of land and buildings included within the Group’s property, plant and equipment is in excess of book 
value but that the difference is not material in relation to the affairs of the Group.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (that is, information needed by the Company’s auditors in connection 
with preparing their report) of which the Company’s auditors are not aware.
Each of the Directors has taken all the relevant steps that they ought to have taken in accordance with their duty as a Director to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’).
Charitable and political contributions 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £28,300 (2008: £53,300). Of the donations in the current year £5,800 was to LandAid and 
the remainder was to local and good causes. No political contributions were made during the year (2008: £nil). 
Offices
The Group had 25 offices (excluding those offices undertaking an administrative function only) located throughout Britain at the end of the financial 
year, following the closure of three offices and the merging of eight offices into four during the financial year. A full list of the Group’s offices and their 
locations can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary at the registered office of the Company or from the Company’s

Risk management objectives 
The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 23, 24 and 25 to the financial statements. 
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market 
prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, 
detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management with the goal of ensuring that risks are 
promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department. These forecasts are further stress tested at a 
Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has 
in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using 
financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 28 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Statutory Information
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating 
Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the 
Treasury Operating Committee. 
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and 
medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May, and October and November, of each year, due to seasonal trends in 
income. Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient headroom under its revolving credit facilities to cover these requirements. On a normal 
operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of £250.0m of available committed bank facilities and identifies and takes 
appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2009, 
the Group had committed bank facilities of £2,284.4m (2008: £2,555.4m) and total facilities of £2,360.6m (2008: £2,651.6m). At 30 June 2009, the 
Group’s drawn debt was £1,484.1m (2008: £1,685.2m). This represented 65.0% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2009 (2008: 65.9%).
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2009. At the date of approval of the financial statements the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of 
signing the financial statements. Compliance with covenants is also considered on pages 58 and 59.
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private 
placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2009, the average maturity of the Group’s committed 
bank facilities was 3.1 years (2008: 3.3 years). 
b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions 
and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group has detailed procedures to manage 
significant operational risks including:
•  A weekly review is undertaken of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity 
and cash flow projections.
•  The Group seeks to provide mortgage providers with complete transparency regarding house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other 
incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision.
• The Group works with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for its customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities the critical judgements applied by management in 
these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands. The value of the Group’s available for sale 
financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2009, these were carried at a fair value of £86.5m (2008: £66.9m).
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2009, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price 
linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 
£6.2m (2008: £14.9m) with a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk 
and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate 
flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate 
movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 29
Report of the Directors | Statutory Information
The Group has a policy that 60–80% of the Group’s median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan (taking into account hedging) is 
at a fixed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and an average maximum duration of fifteen years. At 30 June 2009, 68.4% of the 
Group’s borrowings was at a fixed rate (2008: 61.6%).
       
The exposure of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities to interest rate risk is detailed in note 26 to the financial statements.
Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2009 was 6.6% (2008: 6.6%).
Sterling private placement notes of £114.2m (2008: £125.5m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest 
rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2009 was 11.5% (2008: 7.8%) with, at 30 June 2009, 
a weighted average period of 8.5 years (2008: 9.5 years) for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £164.9m (2008: £150.5m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange 
rate swaps, for 2009 was 11.0% (2008: 6.9%) with, at 30 June 2009, a weighted average period of 7 .8 years (2008: 8.8 years) for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2009, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s pre-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease by £3.9m (2008: £4.8m), the Group’s post-tax (loss)/profit would increase/
decrease by £2.8m (2008: £3.4m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £2.8m (2008: £3.4m).
iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2009, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $271.6m (2008: $300.0m). In order to mitigate risks 
associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt 
and a significant proportion of the interest payments. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US 
Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on  
the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt. As a result of the revised financing arrangements implemented in July and August 2008, the foreign 
exchange swaps match 73% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 27%.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 25 to the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2009, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher/lower and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group’s pre-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease by £0.7m (2008: £nil), the Group’s post-tax (loss)/profit would 
increase/decrease by £0.5m (2008: £nil) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £0.5m (2008: £nil).
c) Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered 
Social Landlords for Social Housing. The Group has £86.5m (2008: £66.9m) of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, 
although this asset is spread over a large number of properties. As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has  • 
a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an International Swaps and Derivatives • 
Association Master Agreement in place. These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to  
individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2009 was £31.0m (2008: £8.6m). The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the 
financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
 
As at 30 June 2009, the Company was exposed to £1,511.1m (2008: £2,230.1m) of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees, 
performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35 to the financial statements. 30 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Statutory Information
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure. 
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in note 30, and its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans), as set out in 
note 24. The Group’s risk management objectives are included on pages 18 and 19.
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in the business in order to 
appropriately manage its capital (these controls are discussed above). In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-
term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, (assuming the Company is paying a 
dividend), issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments and selling assets to reduce debt.
Likely future developments 
An indication of likely future developments in the Group including in the field of research and development is given in the Business review on  
pages 9 to 19.
Creditor payments 
The Group is responsible for agreeing the detail of terms and conditions relating to transactions with its suppliers. It is Group policy to ensure that 
suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the agreed terms of payment with suppliers where the goods and services have 
been supplied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of contract. Implementation of this policy resulted in a supplier payment period 
by the Company of 42 days (2008: 26 days) for its trade creditors at 30 June 2009.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
As at the date of this report, qualifying third party indemnity provisions under Companies legislation are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary of the Company, Directors and former Directors of any member of 
the Group or of an associated company or affiliate company and members of the Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and the 
Company’s Articles of Association against all liability arising in respect of any act or omission in their duties.
Investor relations
The Board believes that the effective management of investor relations is critical to its relationship with its shareholders and to the market in which 
the Company’s shares are held, analysed and traded. The Group’s corporate governance framework sets the context for its continuing investor 
relations programme particularly in respect of key areas such as board membership, remuneration and public accountability statements.
Following winning the ‘IR Magazine’ award for most progress in investor relations by a non-FTSE 100 company, in June 2008, the Company 
continued to develop its investor communication programme in conjunction with its financial public relations (‘PR’) advisers, Maitland, who took 
over from Weber Shandwick Square Mile in June 2008, and the Group’s joint brokers, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and UBS 
Investment Bank. The Company’s website (www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk) provides a full Company profile, regular corporate news updates, 
access to the Company’s share price, regulatory announcements and investor relations information. Further, shareholder services have been 
established whereby shareholders may deal in the Company’s shares via its website and also access the Company’s share register to view their 
shareholding, with the opportunity to make changes to their account details, including the downloading of appropriate forms and also access the 
history of their shareholding.
The Group’s annual and interim reports, together with interim management statements and half yearly trading updates, continue to be the primary 
means by which information about the Group, its Board and its business is communicated to institutional and private shareholders, investors and 
analysts. In addition, other major Company publications are available to shareholders on the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. 
The AGM is used to enable all shareholders to discuss the Group’s operations and progress directly with the Board. The Directors are available to 
answer shareholder questions, informally, before and after the AGM. The Chairman also invites questions from shareholders during the AGM. 
Information of a price sensitive nature is communicated as required by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary to the Company 
Announcements Office of the London Stock Exchange and the Group strives to ensure that all key information is effectively and clearly communicated.
In addition to the above formal communications, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director meet regularly with institutional investors 
and analysts in order to convey an understanding of the Group’s operations, the market and its management objectives, and in the year under 
review in excess of 100 such meetings were held. The aim is to meet with major institutional shareholders at least once a year. Press releases on 
the Group’s activities are made to journalists and the media through the Group Press Office and its external PR advisers. The Group’s joint brokers,  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31
Report of the Directors | Statutory Information
Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and UBS Investment Bank, also work actively on behalf of the Company in an effort to ensure that 
investors and potential investors in the business are given reliable information on the Group’s operations, its values and ethos in order to make 
informed investment decisions.
The Group Finance Director presents regular reports to the Group Board on the Company’s investor relations activities to ensure that it has a clear 
understanding of the views of major shareholders.

Changes to the Board
Mr D F Thomas joined the Board as an Executive Director and Group Finance Director on 21 July 2009 replacing Mr M A Pain, who stepped down  
on the same date. Miss T E Bamford joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2009. 
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employer’s long-term incentive and share option plans it was agreed with Mr D F Thomas that he  
would be granted an one-off award that seeks to target benefits equivalent to the options granted under the ESOS in 2008. In order to satisfy this obligation, 
Mr D F Thomas will be granted an option by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust which, if and when exercised, will be satisfied from ordinary shares 
acquired in the market. The option will be over 666,666 ordinary shares at an exercise price per share of 55 pence. The option will be subject to the same

Proposed Placing and Rights Issue
On 23 September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with UBS Limited, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, HSBC Bank plc, 
Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and RBS Hoare Govett Limited to fully underwrite a £720.5m equity issue, to be structured as a Placing and  
a Rights Issue. The Group has also entered into amended financing arrangements which will come into effect upon successful completion of the 
Placing and Rights Issue. Completion of the Placing and Rights Issue is conditional amongst other things upon shareholder approval at a General 
Meeting expected to be held on 19 October 2009.

Report of the Directors
Corporate Governance
The Board believes that, in terms of the overall direction and control of the Company, effective corporate governance will come principally from the 
values, standards and disciplines it seeks to apply in dealings with shareholders, customers, staff, suppliers, contractors and other stakeholders. 
Many of the Company’s core values and standards are set out in a range of procedures and practice guidelines communicated throughout the 
Group. However, external governance codes set the framework for the Group’s internal standards and it therefore seeks to comply with established 
best practice in all areas of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance with Code provisions  
The Company recognises the importance of maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance in all areas of its business. Throughout the 
year ended 30 June 2009 the Company complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (the ‘Code’) as detailed below. A copy of the Code is publically available from the Financial Reporting 
Council website (www.frc.org.uk).
The Board 
Composition
The Company is led and controlled by the Group Board. The names, responsibilities and other details of the Group Board Directors are set out on 
pages 24 and 25 of this report. 
 
Mr R A Lawson was appointed Chairman of the Company with effect from 1 July 2008. He is also currently the Chairman of Hays Plc, the specialist 
recruitment company and a Director of The Federation of Groundwork Trusts. Mr C G Toner retired as Chairman and from the Group Board on 
30 June 2008 and Mr M Pescod resigned from the Board on 31 December 2008.
At the end of the financial year the Board comprised nine members, including the Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors and four Executive 
Directors. The Company therefore complied during the relevant period with the principles of the Code in relation to the balance of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. The number and calibre of Non-Executive Directors on the Board, together with their diverse backgrounds and 
experience, also ensures that this principle is met. On 1 July 2009, the number of Non-Executive Directors (not including the Chairman) increased 
to five when Miss T E Bamford joined the Board. Miss T E Bamford is also currently a Director of Cantos Communications Limited and has a broad 
finance and business development background which is expected to prove a great asset to the Company. 
On 21 July 2009, Mr M A Pain stepped down as an Executive Director and as Group Finance Director and was replaced by Mr D F Thomas. 
Mr D F Thomas has a strong track record as a Finance Director having held this position at The GAME Group plc and at Millennium and Copthorne 
Hotels plc. This financial background combined with his wider operational experience is expected to prove to be extremely useful to the 
development of the Group’s business.
 
Board responsibilities  
The Board has overall authority for the conduct of the business of the Group. There are a number of matters that have been specifically reserved 
for the Board, these include:
determination and approval of matters relating to the strategy and management of the Group, including approval of long-term objectives and • 
commercial strategy, extension of the Group’s activities into new businesses/geographic areas;
 determination of the structure and capital of the Company such as changes to the Group’s management and control structure, share issues  • 
or buy back of shares;
 approval of financial reporting and controls such as interim and annual results announcements, the Group Annual Report and Accounts, • 
dividend payments, accounting and treasury polices;
establishment of effective systems of delegation and internal control and the annual review of their effectiveness; • 
authorising material acquisitions, disposals, investments, capital projects and other significant transactions; • 
monitoring the Group’s overall performance in relation to its strategies, plans, budgets and decisions; and • 
authorisation of conflicts of interest following recommendations from the Audit Committee. • 
Retirement and re-election of Directors
In accordance with best corporate governance practice, the Company’s Articles of Association require Directors to retire at intervals of no more 
than three years at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Accordingly, Mr M S Clare and Mr S J Boyes will retire in consequence of the period since 
their last re-election and, being eligible, each will offer himself for re-election at this year’s AGM. In addition, Mr D F Thomas and Miss T E Bamford, 
having been appointed by the Board since the last AGM, will retire at this year’s AGM and offer themselves for election. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 33
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
Information and professional development
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in an induction process which includes a meeting with all of the current Directors, provision 
of an induction pack, site visits and meetings with senior and operational management teams.
The Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company by attending appropriate external seminars and training courses, 
meeting with senior management and visiting regional and divisional operating offices.
In January 2009, the Board met for a full day to review and develop the overall business strategy of the Group which included presentations from 
senior management within the Group as well as external professionals. 
Each Director is issued with an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive operating and financial management reports for the period under 
review at least a week before any Board Meeting. The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary attends all Board and Committee Meetings 
and all Directors have access to his advice and, if necessary, to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense to assist with the 
discharge of their responsibilities as Directors. 
Any Director who is unable to attend a meeting presents his apologies and is invited to provide his views to the Chairman ahead of the meeting 
having reviewed the agenda, briefing papers and management information. The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary will meet with the 
absent Director after the meeting to go through any action points which are of relevance to that Director.
Formal minutes of each Board meeting are prepared, circulated and submitted for approval at the next meeting. 
Independence and effectiveness
The Board believes that the Chairman and all Non-Executive Directors are independent in that they have no business or other relationship with the 
Group that might influence their independence or judgement. 
The division of responsibility between the Chairman of the Board and the Group Chief Executive is clearly defined and has been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. He is responsible for organising the 
business of the Board, for setting its agenda and for ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman facilitates the effective contribution of the Non-
Executive Directors and also ensures that the Board receives timely and accurate information so as to properly conduct its business as well as 
ensuring that communications with shareholders are effective. 
The Senior Independent Director has specific responsibility for co-ordinating the evaluation by the Nominations Committee of the Chairman’s 
effectiveness as well as being a point of contact for shareholders in the event of there being any material issues or concerns which the Chairman 
and/or Group Chief Executive have failed adequately to address. The current Senior Independent Director is Mr R J Davies. 
In accordance with the Code, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met on two occasions during the year independently of the Executive 
Directors. The Senior Independent Director met once during the course of the year with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the 
Chairman, to assess the performance of the Chairman.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
On 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 codified the duty to avoid conflicts of interests, by which Directors have a duty to avoid a situation  
in which they have, or may have, a direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest with the Company. This duty applies to the 
exploitation of any property, information or opportunity regardless of whether the Company could have taken advantage of it. The Company’s 
Articles of Association were amended at the AGM held on 18 November 2008 to include a general power for the Board to authorise such conflicts.
The Board has, in accordance with its Articles of Association and best practice guidance, authorised the Audit and Nominations Committees to 
oversee the process for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board concerning any actual and/or potential conflicts of interest which 
arise or may arise in relation to each member of the Board and this process was carried out satisfactorily during the year.
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary maintains a Register of Directors’ conflicts of interests which is reviewed every six months by 
the Audit Committee who then make recommendations to the Board in respect of any changes to the authorisations that may be required. Each 
Director is responsible, and is aware of his responsibility, to notify the Audit Committee and/or the Board of any new conflicts or possible conflicts 
and of any change in circumstances relating to authorisations already given. The Board, when authorising any conflict or possible conflict of  34 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
interest, does not count in the quorum the Director whose conflict or possible conflict is being discussed and reserves the right to exclude a 
Director from a meeting whilst a conflict or possible conflict is being considered. 
Board Committees 
The Board has established three standing Committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee.  
It also has an Executive Committee which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business. Terms of Reference for the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available on the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. Membership and 
attendance of each Committee is shown in the table on page 36. 
The Audit Committee
All members of the Audit Committee, as identified in the table on page 36, are independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with Code 
provision C.3.1. The Board is satisfied that Mr M E Rolfe, who is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and  
was formerly the Finance Director of Gallaher Group Plc, has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee met on five occasions during the financial year. The attendance at each of these meetings is set out in the table on page 36  
of this report.
The Audit Committee invites the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, other members of senior management and senior 
representatives of the external auditors to attend meetings as required.
Principal responsibilities
Under its Terms of Reference the Audit Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s performance; • 
reviewing and challenging where necessary the consistency of, and changes to, its accounting policies; • 
monitoring the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit process and • 
making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and remuneration of the external auditors;
 monitoring the Group’s financial management and reporting systems and assessing the integrity and effectiveness of its accounting procedures, • 
system of internal control and the process for identifying and monitoring the risks facing the Group;
reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal audit function, the annual internal audit plan and all reports produced by the internal • 
auditor and management’s responsiveness to the findings and recommendations of the internal auditor; 
 reviewing whistleblowing procedures and ensuring arrangements are in place for proportionate and independent investigation and follow-up • 
action; and
 reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on the authorisation of Directors’ conflicts of interest. • 
The Terms of Reference for the Audit Committee are available from the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
As well as carrying out the work associated with the annual financial reporting cycle, the Audit Committee discharged a number of principal 
responsibilities during the year including, inter alia, the review of: the effectiveness of internal control systems; the Audit Committee’s Terms of 
Reference; auditor independence and non-audit fees policy; the whistleblowing policy; the internal audit plan; key accounting policies; judgements 
and issues; the external audit plan and associated reports and re-appointment of the external auditors.
Re-appointment of Auditors
The Audit Committee considered the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) as the Auditors to the Company in September 2009. On the basis 
that Deloitte had been appointed as the Company’s auditors, replacing PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, following a competitive tender in 2007 the 
Audit Committee made a recommendation to the Board to propose a resolution re-appointing Deloitte as the Auditors to the Company at the AGM 
to be held on 17 November 2009. 
Auditor objectivity and independence
Deloitte did provide non-audit related services during the year primarily relating to corporate finance services, financial modelling and advice on 
accounting and internal control matters.
The Company has also developed and implemented a policy on Auditor Independence and Non-Audit Fees (the ‘Policy’). The Policy sets out the 
duties of the Audit Committee relating to the maintenance of audit independence and non-audit fees and the services which the Auditors can  
and cannot provide to the Group.  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 35
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
Under the Policy the following services should not be provided by the Auditors:
bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements; • 
financial information systems design and implementation relating to the financial statements or accounting records; • 
appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions; • 
actuarial services; • 
internal audit outsourcing services; and • 
management functions, legal services or Executive recruiting. • 
The Company is also required, under the Policy, to obtain written confirmation from the Auditors that they remain independent on an annual basis. 
The Audit Committee is therefore satisfied that there are no independence issues in respect of the Auditors. 
Remuneration Committee 
All members of the Remuneration Committee, as set out in the table on page 36, are considered by the Company to be independent in accordance 
with Code provision B.2.1. 
Miss T E Bamford joined the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2009 and is considered to be independent by the Company.
The Remuneration Committee met on three occasions during the financial year. Attendance at each of these meetings is set out in the table on 
page 36 of this report.

During the year the Nominations Committee undertook a recruitment selection process involving external consultants, JCA Group Limited, which 
resulted in the appointment of a new Group Finance Director, Mr D F Thomas and The Zygos Partnership, which resulted in the appointment of an 
additional Non-Executive Director, Miss T E Bamford. 
The service contracts of the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection by any 
person at the Company’s registered office during normal office hours and at the AGM for 15 minutes prior to and throughout the meeting.

Board achievement, performance evaluation and training 
The Nominations Committee oversees the procedure for appointment of new Directors to the Board. All Directors joining the Board submit 
themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment and once every three years thereafter. The names of the Directors subject to 
re-election at this year’s AGM are set out on page 32. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term and normally serve a second 
three-year term subject to performance review and re-election. Beyond this a third three-year term may be served subject to rigorous review. 
During the year, the Board undertook a formal and structured process of evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors. Last year the performance evaluation was carried out using independent external consultants, Independent Audit Limited. This year the 
Board decided that it would be appropriate to carry out the performance evaluation internally using a questionnaire completed by all Board members 
and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.
Central to the evaluation process are the Board’s annual review of business strategy and the objectives and performance targets set by the Board 
each year for itself, its Committees and for the Group Chief Executive, and through him for the Executive Team, against which overall performance  
is measured. In this way the evaluation is undertaken within clear parameters linked to overall strategy, operational and financial performance and  
the role and contribution made by the Board, its Committees and individual Directors in the attainment of agreed objectives and targets. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
The results of the evaluation were presented to the Board in July 2009, and it was agreed that the Chairman would conduct one-to-one 
discussions with each Board Member in respect of the evaluation results. Following on from these meetings the Chairman, together with the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, will develop and submit an action plan to the Board to implement the recommendations arising from the 
evaluation and the one-to-one discussions.
Employment policy and involvement 
The Group is committed to developing the talents of its employees so that they can maximise their career potential and to providing rewarding 
careers in an atmosphere that ensures equal opportunities for all. Selection for employment and promotion is based on the objective assessment 
of ability and experience, giving full and fair consideration to all applications (including individuals with disabilities) for employment, and the Group  
is committed to ensuring that its workplaces are free from unlawful discrimination of any sort. The Company strives to ensure that its policies and 
practices provide equal opportunities in respect of issues such as training, career development and promotion for all existing or potential staff 
irrespective of gender, race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. Every effort is made to retain 
and support employees who become disabled whilst working within the Group.
The Board recognises that employee engagement is a key factor in the long-term success of the Company and has implemented a comprehensive 
employee engagement programme with the aim of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are invited to take part in an engagement 
survey each January and the results of this survey are fed back to each operating division who use the results to formulate a plan for improving 
engagement during the year ahead. 
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. The Company ensures that all significant events, economic factors and financial 
updates and the impact of these on the performance of the Company are communicated to employees through email alerts and regular newsletters. 
The Executive Committee regularly brief senior management via telephone conference calls which allow them to ask questions and enter into 
discussion. The Board and the Executive Committee also visit operating divisions and working sites in order to talk to employees face to face  
and get first hand experience of employees’ aspirations and concerns.
The Group runs a Graduate Recruitment and Development Programme consisting of a two year multi-disciplinary programme of both on-job and 
off-job modules. Thirty graduates have recently completed the first two year programme and have all secured full-time roles with the business and 
five graduates are currently entering their second year of the programme. 
Succession planning is in place across the Group and there are currently four leadership development programmes in place to assist with the 
development of individuals as part of the succession plan.
The Group is committed to employee training and development at all levels of the organisation and has introduced a suite of leadership and 
management development programmes aimed at all levels within the organisation from graduates and middle management to senior management. 
The programme is designed and delivered internally and is tailored to the needs of the business. 
Following shareholder approval at the 2008 AGM, the Company launched, in February 2009, a savings related share option scheme to encourage 
employee involvement in the Company’s performance. 39% of eligible employees currently participate. 
Investor relations
Details of the Group’s management of investor relations are provided on pages 30 and 31. 
Going concern 
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, financial performance 
and financial position are set out in the Group Chief Executive’s statement on pages 4 to 8 and the Business review on pages 9 and 11. The 
material financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may impact the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 18 
and 19 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk are outlined in note 26 to the financial statements.  38 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained in the 
Principal risks on pages 18 and 19 factors that particularly impact upon the performance of the Group include changes in the macroeconomic 
environment including buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for our purchasers, and interest rates. At 30 June 2009, the net debt 
position of the Group (as shown in note 24 to the financial statements) was £1,276.9m, with loans and borrowings of £1,484.1m with headroom  
of £800.0m to the Group’s committed facilities. The Group is currently in compliance with its financial covenants and at the date of approval of the 
financial statements the Group’s internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being  
at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements. 
As noted in note 36, on 23 September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with UBS Limited, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, 
HSBC Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and RBS Hoare Govett Limited to fully underwrite a £720.5m equity issue, to be structured  
as a Placing and a Rights Issue, to strengthen the Group’s balance sheet and reduce its financial indebtedness. In conjunction with the Placing  
and Rights Issue, the Company has negotiated certain amendments to the terms of the Group’s existing financing arrangements. The amended 
financing arrangements will only come into effect if a minimum of £450m total gross proceeds are raised pursuant to the Placing and Rights Issue 
and, before 31 December 2009, the Company reduces its borrowings under the Wilson Bowden acquisition facilities and the Group’s private 
placement notes by 40% such that the total amount of indebtedness thereunder does not exceed £900m (excluding any indebtedness under 
make-whole notes that are issued as a consequence of the prepayment). The Company has put in place arrangements to effect such prepayments 
following it becoming entitled to the net proceeds of the Placing and Rights Issue. Upon such prepayments being made, £50m of undrawn 
commitments under each of its Revolving Credit Facilities will automatically be cancelled so that they do not exceed £700m. The Directors expect 
the amended financing arrangements will enable the Group to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in a recovering market, as well  
as to provide an appropriate alternative framework, should a further downturn arise. 
Completion of the Placing and Rights Issue is conditional upon shareholder approval at the General Meeting expected to be held on 19 October 
2009, listing of the shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing and Rights Issue and upon the underwriting agreement not being terminated in 
accordance with its terms prior to the General Meeting. If the Placing and Rights Issue do not proceed the amended financing arrangements will not 
come into effect. Until such time as any subsequent renegotiation is concluded, the existing financing arrangements will continue to apply. While the 
existing financing arrangements apply, if conditions in the wider UK economy, as they relate to the housebuilding sector, were to decline below that 
which has been assumed in the Group’s forecasts during the current financial year (and notwithstanding further management actions to both 
conserve and generate cash, including, if necessary, by making land sales) then there is a risk that the Group might generate lower than anticipated 
revenues, or cash, or require further write-downs in the value of the Group’s assets. This risk may result in the Group being unable to comply with  
its existing covenant package during the current financial year. If the amended financing arrangements do not come into effect, the Group will need 
to renegotiate the terms of its existing financing arrangements during the current financial year in order to secure the revolving credit facilities of an 
appropriate duration so as to give the Directors increased confidence that they will be able to prepare the accounts in respect of such a period on  
a going concern basis and also to secure a covenant package across all its financing arrangements that provides greater flexibility. 
The above risks, that the amended financing arrangements do not become effective because the conditions to the Placing and Rights Issue are not 
satisfied, and that whilst the existing financial covenants remain in place the impact of a decline in the housebuilding sector may result in the Group 
not being able to comply with such covenants, represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern such that the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Nevertheless, based upon the Group’s expectation that conditions to the Placing and the Rights Issue will be satisfied, in addition to the Group’s 
current trading, forecasts, and further management actions which could be taken whilst the existing financial covenants remain in place referred to 
above, the Directors believe that the Group will continue to comply with its financial covenants and accordingly have formed a judgement that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements upon a going concern basis. Therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments 
that would result if the going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board confirms in accordance with Principle C.2 of the Code that it has maintained a sound system of internal control, to safeguard 
shareholders investment and the Company’s assets. There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group that has been in place throughout the year ended 30 June 2009 and up to 23 September 2009, which is regularly reviewed by 
the Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s business objectives rather 
than to eliminate those risks entirely. The system of internal control therefore provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 39
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
misstatement or loss. The system of internal control does, however, provide reasonable assurance that potential problems can be identified 
promptly and appropriate remedial action taken.
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s financial statements are reconciled to the underlying financial ledgers. A review of the 
consolidation and financial statements is completed by management to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately 
reflected.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is the responsibility of the Executive 
Directors and senior management to implement and maintain the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in accordance with policy 
approved by the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management framework are as follows:
i) a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority and responsibility for each operating division;
ii)  extensive financial and management reporting systems under which financial and operating performance is consistently reviewed against budget 
and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group level on a monthly basis;
iii)  principal risk areas are embedded in the Group’s monthly management reporting system so that risk identification and the control of risk are a 
routine aspect of management responsibility. These risks include:
the market, including changes in the macroeconomic environment, sales and quality of product; • 
liquidity, including the availability of sufficient borrowing facilities; • 
people, including the development of a skilled and experienced workforce; • 
subcontractors and suppliers; • 
securing sufficient land; • 
Government regulation, including obtaining planning permission; • 
 construction, including achieving key milestones and the impact on the environment and social surroundings; • 
health and safety; and • 
failure of the Group’s IT systems; and • 
iv)  internal control and risk management systems are supported by the Group internal audit team which is responsible for advising senior 
management, the Executive Directors and, through the Audit Committee, the Board on the operation and effectiveness of those systems. The 
internal audit team undertakes a planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations approved by the Audit Committee, including 
full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas such as the land viability process, land acquisition control and monitoring, work in 
progress and subcontractor payment controls. Where the internal audit team does not have the expertise or resources required to conduct 
complex audits they use external expertise. For example, during the year ended 30 June 2009, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP assisted with the 
internal audit of the Group treasury function.
In accordance with Principle C2.1 of the Code the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, covering all 
material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. A risk framework has been developed for 
all business processes by the Internal Audit function and approved by the Audit Committee. This framework forms the basis of the internal control 
audit plan for the year ahead, which tests if controls are being applied effectively in each operating division. Material issues identified during internal 
audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and by the Board on a quarterly basis, and necessary actions are 
immediately taken to remedy any failings in the internal control system.
During the course of its review of systems of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it 
has determined to be significant. Therefore, a confirmation of necessary actions has not been considered appropriate.
In addition, the management teams of all operating divisions identify key risks in their monthly management reports to the Executive Committee 
and complete a control self assessment twice a year in which they confirm that they have applied appropriate levels of control. The Audit 
Committee, as a standing agenda item every six months, reviews the risk framework to determine if the system of internal control remains effective 
and report on their findings to the Board. During the year under review, the Executive Committee prioritised the risk framework by identifying the 
risks considered most significant to the Group. For each of the risks identified, an assessment has been made of the probability and potential 
impact on the business and these risks are reported on internally and reviewed during internal audits and control self assessments.

23 September 2009 40 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors
Additional Information for Shareholders
The following description summarises certain provisions of the  
current Articles of Association (as adopted by special resolution on  
18 November 2008 (the ‘Articles’)) of Barratt Developments PLC (the 
‘Company’) and applicable English law concerning companies (the 
Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 2006, together the 
‘Companies Acts’). This is a summary only and the relevant provisions 
of the Companies Acts or the Articles should be consulted if further 
information is required. Certain amendments to the Articles will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (the ‘AGM’) on 17 November 
2009, primarily to deal with the implementation of the Shareholder 
Rights Directive in the United Kingdom on 3 August 2009 via The 
Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 and the 
implementation of the remaining provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
on 1 October 2009. Details of these proposed changes will be set out 
in the notice of the AGM and copies of the Company’s current Articles, 
together with copies marked up to show the proposed amendments, 
will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office from 
the date of despatch. 
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The shares are in registered form.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares  
Subject to applicable statutes and other shareholders’ rights, shares 
may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may 
by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far 
as it does not make specific provision) as the Board (as defined in the 
Articles) may decide. Subject to the Articles, the Companies Acts and 
other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares are at the disposal of the 
Board. At each AGM the Company normally puts in place annual 
shareholder authority authorising the Company’s Directors to allot 
unissued shares, in certain circumstances, for cash, in accordance 
with the guidelines of the Investor Protection Committees.
Voting 
Subject to any rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, 
every member present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or 
class meeting has, upon a show of hands, one vote or upon a poll, one 
vote for every share of which they are a holder. In the case of joint holders 
of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person 
or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the other joint 
holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. Under the 
Companies Acts, members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise  
all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf  
at a general meeting or class meeting. A member may appoint more  
than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided 
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member. A member that is a corporation 
may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a general 
meeting or class meetings as a Corporate Representative. 
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any shares held by them if any call or other sum 
then payable by them in respect of that share remains unpaid. Currently 
all issued shares are fully paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled 
to vote if they have been served with a restriction notice (as defined in 
the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Acts.
Deadlines for voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect 
of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may be 
exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by 
Corporate Representative. Under the Companies Acts, the deadline  
for delivering proxy forms cannot be earlier than 48 hours (excluding 
non-working days) before the meeting for which the proxy is being 
appointed. The Articles however, provide a deadline for submission of 
proxy forms of not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board 
may determine) before the meeting (not excluding non-working days).
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends not exceeding 
the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies their 
payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of 
shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the 
payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. 
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends  
or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if such person 
has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) 
after failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the  
Companies Acts.
Variation of rights 
Subject to the Companies Acts, the Articles specify that rights attached 
to any existing class of shares may be varied either with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of 
the issued shares of that class (calculated excluding any shares held as 
treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such 
separate general meeting (except an adjourned meeting), the quorum 
shall be two persons entitled to vote and holding or representing by 
proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of 
the class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares), but 
so that at any adjourned meeting one holder entitled to vote and 
present in person or by proxy (whatever the number of shares held by  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 41
Report of the Directors | Additional Information for Shareholders
him) shall be a quorum. The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights 
attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation  
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. 
Transfer of shares
Any shares in the Company may be held in uncertificated form and, 
subject to the Articles, title to uncertificated shares may be transferred 
by means of a relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply 
to any uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions are 
inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated form or with the 
transfer of shares by means of a relevant system. Registration of a 
transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances 
set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations (as defined in the 
Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the 
number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to be 
transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of their 
certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or  
in any other form which the Board may approve. The instrument of 
transfer must be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the 
case of a partly-paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share is 
deemed to remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into 
the register.
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully 
paid share. The Board may also decline to register a transfer of a 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped 
or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board 
may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one class of share; and 
(iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees.
The Board may decline to register a transfer of any of the Company’s 
certificated shares by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in  
the Articles) if such a person has been served with a restriction notice  
(as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided 
under the Companies Acts, unless the transfer is shown to the Board  
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale (as defined in the Articles).
Repurchase of shares
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may 
purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Acts. Any 
shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of 
the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued 
share capital. The Company currently has authority to buy back up to 
an aggregate of 34,671,802 ordinary shares during the period up to the 
next AGM. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 
10 pence and the maximum price payable is an amount equal to the 
higher of: (i) 105% of the average of the closing middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share (as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange Daily Official List) for the five business days immediately 
preceding the day on which that ordinary share is contracted to be 
purchased; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock 
Exchange at the time the purchase is carried out.
Amendment of Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of the Company may be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts by way of 
special resolution. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors shall be no less than two and no more than fifteen in number. 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or 
by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office only until 
the next following AGM and is then eligible for election by the 
shareholders but is not taken into account in determining the Directors 
who are to retire at that meeting dependent on length of their service 
and the period since their last re-election. The Board may from time to 
time appoint one or more Directors to hold employment or executive 
office for such period (subject to the Companies Acts) and on such 
terms as they may determine and may revoke or terminate any such 
appointment. Directors are no longer subject to a maximum age limit.
At every AGM of the Company, any Directors who held office at the 
time of the two preceding AGMs and did not retire at either of them, 
shall retire in consequence of the period since their last re-election. Any 
Director who has held office for a continuous period of nine years or 
more shall also retire. The Company may by special resolution remove 
any Director before the expiration of his term of office. The office of 
Director shall be vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign and the 
Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is requested by 
all of the other Directors and all of the other Directors are not less than 
three in number; (iii) he is or has been suffering from mental ill health; 
(iv) he is absent without permission of the Board from meetings of the 
Board for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his office 
is vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors 
generally; (vi) he is prohibited by law from being a Director; (vii) he 
ceases to be Director by virtue of the Companies Acts; or (viii) he is 
removed from office pursuant to the Articles.
Conflicts of interest requiring Board authorisation
The Board may authorise any matter which would otherwise involve a 
Director breaching his duty to avoid a situation where he has, or can 
have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the Company’s interests. The Director to whom the conflict of 
interest relates, and any other Director with a similar interest, shall not 
count towards the quorum nor vote on any resolution giving the 
authority. Should the other members of the Board decide, the relevant 
Director or any other Director with a similar interest, may be excluded  42 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Additional Information for Shareholders
from any Board meeting while the conflict is under consideration. The 
Board may impose terms and conditions on the authorisation as it 
deems necessary to deal with the conflict and it may revoke or vary  
any authorisation at any time. The Board intends to report annually  
on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that its powers of 
authorisation of conflicts are operated effectively and that the 
procedures have been followed.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum of Association, the Articles, 
the Companies Acts and any directions given by special resolution,  
the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who  
may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to the 
management of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the 
Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, property, assets 
and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities and 
to give security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company to 
any third party.
Indemnity of Directors
To the extent permitted by the Companies Acts, the Company may 
indemnify any Director of the Company or of any associated company 
against any liability and may purchase and maintain for any Director  
of the Company or of any associated company insurance against any 
liability. No Director of the Company or of any associated company 
shall be accountable to the Company or the members for any benefit 
provided pursuant to the Articles of the Company and receipt of any 
such benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming  
a Director of the Company.
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) holds 
ordinary shares in the Company. The shares are held in the EBT for  
the purpose of satisfying options and awards that have been granted 
under the various employee share schemes operated by the Company. 
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend 
payments on shares held within the EBT and these shares do not  
count in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares  
used to calculate earnings per share until such time as they are vested 
to the relevant employee. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares  
held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may take into 
account both financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries  
of the EBT or their dependants.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a 
change of control of the Company:
under the £2,150.0m credit facilities agreement dated 5 February 2007 • 
(as amended), the £400.0m revolving credit facility agreement dated  
9 July 2008 (as amended) and the £400.0m revolving credit facility 
agreement dated 2 February 2005 (as amended) in each case 
between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds TSB Bank Plc (as  
the facility agent) and the banks and financial institutions named 
therein as lenders (together, the ‘Credit Facilities’), the facility agent 
must, upon a change of control, cancel the total commitments of the 
lenders under such Credit Facilities and declare all outstanding credits, 
together with accrued interest and any other amounts payable in 
respect of such Credit Facilities, to be immediately due and payable. 
For these purposes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if any person or 
group of persons acting in concert gains control of the Company;
under the privately-placed notes originally amounting in aggregate  • 
to £20.0m (the ‘£20m Notes’) issued pursuant to a note purchase 
agreement dated 29 August 2007 to various institutions within a 
single corporate group, the holders of the £20m Notes have an 
option to require the Company to repay the entire unpaid principal 
amount of the £20m Notes held by each holder (at par), together  
with interest accrued thereon and a ‘make-whole’ amount in respect 
of any repayment occurring during an interest period; and
under the privately-placed notes originally amounting in aggregate to • 
£105.0m and $300.0m (the ‘Remaining Notes’) issued pursuant to 
note purchase agreements dated 23 August 2007 and 23 April 2008 
by the Company to various institutions, the holders of the Remaining 
Notes have an option to require the Company to repay the entire 
unpaid principal amount of the Remaining Notes held by each holder 
(at par), together with interest accrued thereon but without any 
‘make-whole’ amount in respect of any repayment occurring during 
an interest period.
Under the terms of the note purchase agreements in respect of the 
£20m Notes and the Remaining Notes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if 
any person or group of persons acting in concert acquires beneficial 
ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of the 
Company carrying voting rights.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders 
customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes other than in 
compliance with applicable securities laws.

Report of the Directors 
Remuneration report
Introduction
This year’s Remuneration report is prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/410) (the ‘Regulations’) and will be subject to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting (the ‘AGM’) to be 
held on 17 November 2009.
The key issues to be aware of this year are:
1. Executive Directors did not receive a salary increase in 2008 and will not be receiving one in 2009.
2. The Company’s final salary pension scheme was closed with effect from 30 June 2009.
3. No annual bonuses have been paid despite the achievement of cash management targets.
4. Annual bonus potential has been reduced for the financial year ending 30 June 2010 compared to the financial year ended 30 June 2009. 
5.  A bonus clawback provision has been introduced to any annual bonuses paid and to any options granted under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (‘ESOS’) in respect of the current and future years, subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to the approval of HMRC. 
6. As performance targets have not been met, the Long-Term Performance Plan (‘LTPP’) award granted in 2006 did not vest.
7.  At the 2008 AGM, shareholders approved the ESOS and Executive Directors were granted share options under this new ESOS. These had a 
lower expected value than the previous LTPP awards.
8.  In 2009, the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) will again grant share options rather than LTPP awards, which will have Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) performance conditions.
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for:
determining and reviewing the overall remuneration policy of the Company with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating Directors and senior • 
managers of the experience and calibre required;
determining and reviewing executive remuneration policy, including the terms and conditions of employment for Executive Directors and their • 
individual remuneration packages;
making recommendations to the Board in relation to the remuneration of the Chairman; • 
agreeing targets and benefits in respect of performance related pay schemes for all employees; • 
approving the rules of and the basis of participation in Group share options, long-term performance plans and cash-based bonus incentive • 
schemes and the specific awards, grants and payments made under any such schemes;
determining the policy for and scope of pension arrangements for Executive Directors and senior management; • 
agreeing severance arrangements or other compensation for loss of office or early retirement for all employees; • 
the evaluation of Executive Director performance with regard to the award of share incentives, annual bonus and other performance-based • 
remuneration; and
obtaining independent professional advice in relation to senior executive remuneration. • 
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are available from the Company’s website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee during the financial year were Mr R J Davies (Chairman), Mr R A Lawson, Mr W Shannon and Mr R MacEachrane.  
Mr R A Lawson joined the Committee on 1 July 2008 and Miss T E Bamford joined the Committee on 1 July 2009. The Committee met on three 
occasions during the financial year and attendance at each of these meetings is described on page 36 of the Report of the Directors. All Committee 
members are considered to be independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee’s decisions. The Group Chief 
Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered. 
The Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to 
shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors. In determining future remuneration policy, it will consider 
both the shareholders’ vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice
The Committee received input into their decision making from Mr M S Clare, the Group Chief Executive, Mrs J Mee, the Group Human Resources 
Director, and Mr L Dent, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. Mr L Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee. In addition, 
independent advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, advised the Committee in relation to changes to the Company’s remuneration policy and  
on the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements. Hewitt New Bridge Street did not provide any additional services  
to the Company. 44 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pension issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, was 
appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy 
Each year the Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice and market trends 
for the current and subsequent financial years. The underlying principles remain the same, namely, the Committee believes that executive 
remuneration should:
be fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders; • 
reward the sustained growth and profitability of the business; and • 
conform with market-leading best practice. • 
The Committee has the discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration  
of the Executive Directors. In addition, the Committee does take into account environmental, social and governance risks when setting any incentive 
structures for senior management in order to mitigate the possibility of the incentive structures motivating irresponsible behaviour. The Committee 
also considers the level of pay throughout the Group when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of the business is determined in no short measure 
by the skill and commitment of the Executive Team. The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service 
conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of a high calibre within the industry’s highly competitive employment 
market. Within these broad objectives, the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles:
the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets; currently over 50%  • 
of the total executive remuneration package is performance based;
performance-related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets based on • 
measures of shareholder return. With the exception of the share options granted in 2008, which were based on a return on capital employed 
performance metric, the Committee’s policy is to use a combination of TSR and EPS performance conditions; and
total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector. • 
The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
basic salary; • 
annual performance related bonus; • 
long-term share incentives; and • 
pension and other benefits. • 
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive Directors and 
are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash. Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities,  
skills and experience and to competitive market practice for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies and also for companies 
comprising the FTSE 250. In light of the prevailing market conditions there are no current plans to increase salaries for any employees across the 
business, including Executive Directors, for the financial year ending 30 June 2010. Therefore salaries with effect from 1 July 2009 remain as follows: 
      1 July 2009 1 July 2008 
      £ per annum £ per annum
Mr M S Clare      630,000 630,000
Mr M A Pain*      350,000 350,000
Mr D F Thomas**      400,000 –
Mr S J Boyes      350,000 350,000
Mr C Fenton      350,000 350,000
* Mr M A Pain stepped down from the Board on 21 July 2009.
** Mr D F Thomas joined the Board on 21 July 2009. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business set annually 
by the Board, including cash generation, operating profit, health and safety, customer service, employee engagement and personal targets. For the 
financial year ending 30 June 2010 the Executive Directors’ maximum bonus has been reduced to 100% of salary (180% of salary in previous years) 
and the target bonus has been lowered from 130% to 75% of basic salary. 
 
The Committee has retained a general discretion in the making of bonus payments, and will consider, among other factors, the underlying financial 
performance of the business relative to the sector.
The Committee has decided that for any bonuses paid in respect of the financial year ending 30 June 2010 and later years it will retain a power of 
clawback. This can be invoked if:
(a)  it is necessary to restate the Company’s accounts used to calculate a participant’s bonus, in circumstances where the original over-statement 
has led to a bonus being paid which would not otherwise have been paid; or 
(b)  the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in connection with his employment and this related to an act which led to a bonus being 
paid to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that bonuses will be retrospectively recalculated and, if bonus monies have been paid,  
the participant will be required to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid less any bonus that the 
Committee determines would have been paid regardless of the event in question. 
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable. 
For the financial year ended 30 June 2009, despite the achievement of the cash management and other non-profit targets, the Committee 
accepted the management’s proposal that no annual bonus should be paid.
In January 2009, it was announced that Mr M A Pain would be stepping down as Executive and Group Finance Director. On 21 July 2009,  
Mr D F Thomas took over as Group Finance Director and, in order to ensure an orderly handover of responsibilities, Mr M A Pain agreed to continue 
his employment with the Group until 31 October 2009. In consideration of the extension to his remaining in employment beyond his required notice 
period, the Company agreed to make a one-off payment of £100,000 to Mr M A Pain on 31 October 2009, subject to his employment remaining 
valid until that date. Mr M A Pain’s salary and benefits will continue as normal up until 31 October 2009. 
Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above target 
will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan. The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer 
additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan. 
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum of four for one for 
voluntary deferral; matching awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a period of three years. The relevant performance 
conditions are the same as those used for the LTPP, as detailed below. 
Because the maximum annual bonus for the year ending 30 June 2010 has been reduced to 100% of salary there will be no compulsory deferral  
of annual bonus into the Plan for this year. 
As no bonus is payable for the financial year ended 30 June 2009, no awards will be granted this year under the Plan.
Long-Term Performance Plan 
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003. No LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 
2009 and the Committee is not proposing to grant any LTPP awards for the financial year ending 30 June 2010. Instead the Committee has used 
and will use the ESOS as described on page 46.
Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. 
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. 46 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary 
with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
There is no re-testing of performance conditions. 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on TSR and 50% based 
on EPS growth. 
The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the awards, 
as they are fundamental measures of the Group’s underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2006 uses a comparator group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, Bovis 
Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. For awards made in 2007, the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award 
comprises those companies, excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index. For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total 
award will vest if the Company’s TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of the comparator 
group. 10% of the total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median. The 
award will vest on a straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets.
For awards made in 2006 and 2007, the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the 
RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the awards will vest on a straight-line basis. 
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
The qualifying period for the award granted in 2006 ended on 30 June 2009. Performance of this award against the constituent TSR and EPS 
targets was tested after the year end and neither of the targets had been achieved. Accordingly no part of the 2006 awards will vest.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008. It was the view of the Committee that the focus on share price 
growth arising from the use of market value options combined with this performance condition would ensure strong alignment with shareholders. 
Options were granted in December 2008 following this approval and it is intended to grant further options under the ESOS during the financial year 
ending 30 June 2010. 
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. 
Options must normally be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within 
ten years of grant. The maximum number of shares over which an employee may be granted options in any financial year under the ESOS will be 
limited so that the aggregate cost of exercise does not exceed 200% of his annual salary.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee. 
For options granted in 2008, 100% of the option will vest if the Return On Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 
reaches 14.5%, 25% of the award will vest if the ROCE reaches 10.5% and no part of the award will vest if the ROCE is below 10.5%. The award 
 will vest on a straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets. There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria. ROCE will  
be calculated as operating profit (measured across the whole year to 30 June 2011) divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less any intangible 
assets (being the average of the 12 month end figures during the same year). The Committee considered that ROCE was the most rounded 
measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of this award and was satisfied that the ROCE target range represented  
a stretching target considering the outlook for the housebuilding market.
For options to be granted in the financial year ending 30 June 2010, 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on 
relative TSR, and 50% on attainment of a target to be based on EPS growth.
For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if the Company’s TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper 
quartile or above against the TSR of a comparator group comprising the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts), 12.5% of the total award will vest  
if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median. The award will vest on a straight-line basis 
between the upper and lower targets. TSR will be calculated as the percentage change in share price plus dividends over a performance period, 
with the opening share price averaged across the dealing days in the three-month period ending immediately before the start of the performance 
period and the closing share price averaged over the dealing days in the last three months of the performance period.  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report
The EPS element of the award will be divided into three one-year targets with the Committee setting targets annually for the forthcoming year in 
each year. Performance against the EPS target for each year will be tested at the end of each year and the award will vest at the end of the 
three-year performance period in proportion to the level of achievement in each year against the relevant target. The EPS for the Company will be 
calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust. It should be noted that three one-year targets are only being used because of the 
current uncertain economic conditions and it is hoped that for future awards there will be greater economic certainty and that the Committee will 
return to the principle of using a three-year target.
Both performance conditions, once set, will be subject to an overriding Committee discretion to take into account, among other factors, 
performance relative to the sector and the underlying financial performance of the business including free cash flow.
The Committee chose these targets as the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the current time, as they are  
a fundamental measure of the Group’s underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders. 
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employer’s long-term incentive and share option plans, it was agreed with Mr D F Thomas 
that he would be granted an one-off award that seeks to target benefits equivalent to the options granted under the ESOS in 2008. In order to 
satisfy this obligation, Mr D F Thomas will be granted an option by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust and, if and when exercised, will be 
satisfied from ordinary shares acquired in the market. The option will be over 666,666 ordinary shares at an exercise price per share of 55 pence. 
The option will be subject to the same performance targets as the options granted under the ESOS in 2008 and will be on substantially the same 
terms and conditions as those options.
The Committee has decided to retain a power of clawback on any ESOS options granted during the financial year ending 30 June 2010 and later 
years on a similar basis to that described on page 45 relating to the payment of annual bonuses, subject in the case of HMRC approved options,  
to the approval of HMRC.
Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted an Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘ESOP’). Options must be held for a minimum of three years from 
the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years. The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is 
subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee.
No further options can be granted under the ESOP. Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged and are set out on page 
51. The award granted to Mr S J Boyes in 2003 vested in 2006 but has not been exercised.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘SRSOS’) was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008.
The SRSOS was implemented in order to promote share ownership amongst all employees of the Company, linking employee benefit to the 
performance of the Company, and to aid retention of staff.
All employees and Executive Directors who work more than 25 hours per week and who have five or more years of continuous service, ending on 
the date of grant, or such shorter period as the Board may decide, with the Company, or any subsidiary in the Group nominated to join in the 
SRSOS, are eligible to participate in the scheme. The Board has discretion to reduce the period of qualifying service and to invite other employees 
of the Group to participate. Under the SRSOS, employees can save up to £250 per month for three or five years and receive options to purchase 
the Company’s shares at a discount of up to 20% on the market value. During 2009, 1,792 employees (39% of those eligible) applied to participate 
in the SRSOS.
Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009/2010
The Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009/2010 (the ‘2009/2010 Plan’) has been established by the Board to enable options to be granted 
to senior management (other than those who participate in the ESOS or LTPP) to assist with their retention. No Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in the 2009/2010 Plan. Options under the 2009/2010 Plan will entitle the holder to acquire existing ordinary shares in the Company that 
will be purchased in the market for this purpose. Options may not be satisfied either by the issue of new ordinary shares or by the use of ordinary 
shares held in treasury. 48 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report
Because the explicit focus of the 2009/2010 Plan is staff retention, there will be no performance conditions imposed. Awards will be targeted on an 
individual basis reflecting personal performance and assessment of potential under the Barratt performance management system and will vest after 
three years subject to continued employment with the Company.
Pension benefits 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that they can choose to participate in the Company’s money purchase pension plan or receive  
a cash supplement that does not count for incentive purposes. The Company’s defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants in 2001. 
Mr M S Clare is and Mr M A Pain was paid a cash supplement equal to 30% and 25%, respectively, of basic salary per annum. It has been agreed  
that Mr D F Thomas will similarly receive a cash supplement of 25% of salary. 
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2007 showed a deficit of £87.4m calculated on the basis of the Barratt 
Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme’s (the ‘Scheme’) technical provisions. This was updated to 30 June 2009 by a qualified independent 
actuary and a deficit of £31.5m is included in the Group balance sheet as shown in note 27 to the financial statements. The Company and the 
Trustees of the Scheme have agreed that, with effect from 1 December 2008, the Company will pay, in addition to the joint contribution rate,  
£13.3m per annum for seven years to address the deficit.
On 14 April 2009, the Trustees agreed with the Company to terminate defined benefit accrual under the Scheme with effect from 30 June 2009, 
subject to certain conditions, and on 30 June 2009, the Company resolved to exercise its consent under the rules of the Scheme to agree to the 
closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme. The conditions include obligations on the Company to continue paying deficit reduction 
contributions at a level not lower than the £13.3m agreed in December 2008 and to consult with the Trustees with regard to the funding  
requirements of the Scheme before the occurrence of any event materially affecting (whether positively or negatively) the ability of the employers  
to fund the Scheme which is within the control of the Company.
Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the defined contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009. 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2009, Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton were members of the Company’s defined benefit section of the 
Scheme. This entitlement was based on a 1/60-accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65. The entitlement of Mr C Fenton was restricted  
by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006 and thereafter was calculated by reference to his basic  
salary. In lieu of the continued accrual of benefits under the Scheme, Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are entitled to receive cash supplements  
equal to 30% of their basic salary per annum.
Only the basic salary element of a Director’s remuneration is pensionable.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for dependents’ pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.
Service contracts 
All Executive Directors, with the exception of Mr M A Pain, are engaged on the basis of one-year rolling contracts which can be terminated by  
twelve months’ notice given by the Company or by twelve months’ notice given by the Executive at any time. Mr M A Pain, who stepped down from 
the Board on 21 July 2009, could, and did, terminate his contract by giving six months’ notice. There are no specific provisions for compensation on 
early termination or loss of office due to a takeover bid. The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership  
of a private healthcare scheme.

Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the recommendation of a Committee of Executive Directors having regard  
to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with the role. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board on the recommendation 
of the Committee again having regard to the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are appointed under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service contracts  
and their appointments can be terminated (by the Board) without compensation for loss of office and by giving the appropriate length of notice as 
prescribed in their respective letters of appointment. The notice periods applicable to each of the Non-Executive Directors are, Mr R A Lawson,  
three months’ notice, Miss T E Bamford and Mr M E Rolfe, one month’s notice and for Mr R J Davies, Mr R MacEachrane and Mr W Shannon no

Executive Directors Shareholding Guidelines
The following shareholding guidelines apply to Executive Directors:
within five years of first appointment Executive Directors are expected to hold throughout their remaining period of office ordinary shares in the • 
Company equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary;
for the purposes of determining the requisite level of each Executive Director’s shareholding relative to basic salary, the share price will be that • 
prevailing on 30 June in each year; and
provided Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares they are at liberty to sell shares so as to realise their LTPP awards or upon the • 
exercise of share options subject to the normal Listing Rules and Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules requirements for Director 
shareholdings.
Both Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton met the shareholding guidelines until the recent economic downturn which resulted in an unprecedented 
reduction in the share price in early 2008. The Committee is not currently expecting Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton to purchase additional shares  
to respond to this temporary position on the basis that no annual bonus has been paid and the 2006 LTPP awards did not vest, and will review the 
position on or after 30 June 2010.
The following tables and accompanying notes constitute the auditable part of the Remuneration report as defined in the Regulations.

The performance condition set by the Committee for the ESOP award granted in 2003, that the growth in EPS of the Company over a period of  
three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%, was met in 2006, but the option has not yet been exercised.  
The performance conditions for the ESOS grants are described on pages 46 and 47.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 30 June 2009 was 147.5 pence. The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company during

Notes
With effect from 30 June 2009, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit 
pensions for current employees and the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed.
The total pension accrued is the amount that the Director would have accrued if he had left the Scheme at the end of the year, when the Scheme closed.
The increase in the pension is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2008. The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to 
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’ pension benefits. They do not represent sums 
payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The inflation figure used of 5% is based on the change in RPI from September 2007 to September 2008, as in previous years.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
None of the Directors have any rights under the Company’s money purchase pension scheme.
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2009 and 22 September 2009.

Report of the Directors 
Financial statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts including the Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the International 
Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS Regulation’) to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS. The financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation  
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; •	
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact •	
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. •	
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretation and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken  
as a whole; and
b)   the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed on pages 24 and 25.

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Barratt Developments PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Barratt Developments PLC 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Group and Parent Company balance sheets, 
the Group and Parent Company cash flow statements, the Group  
and Parent Company statements of recognised income and expense, 
the Accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 36. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for  
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance  
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (‘APB’s’) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the •	
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2009  
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance •	
with IFRS; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the •	
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not 
qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made  
in the accounting policies note concerning the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The accounting policies note indicates 
the risk of the amended financing arrangements not becoming effective 
because the conditions to the Placing and Rights Issue are not 
satisfied, and that whilst the existing financing arrangements remain 
in place the impact of a decline in the housebuilding sector beyond 
that assumed in the Group’s forecasts may result in the Group not 
being able to comply with its existing covenant package during the 
current financial year, notwithstanding further management actions. 
These conditions indicate, along with other matters as set forth in the 
accounting policies note, the existence of a material uncertainty which 
may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include 
any adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue 
as a going concern, which would include additional write-downs  
of the carrying value of assets, including land and work in progress,  
and providing for any further liabilities that might arise.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has •	
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
the information given in the Report of the Directors for the financial •	
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent •	
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the •	
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are •	
not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require •	
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement contained within the Report of the Directors •	
in relation to going concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to the •	
Parent Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code specified for our review.

Financial statements
Accounting policies
for the year ended 30 June 2009
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations 
and Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations as 
adopted and endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS and therefore the Group financial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards Regulation.  
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial 
assets, derivative financial instruments and share-based payments.  
A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set  
out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The most 
significant estimates made by the Directors in these financial 
statements are set out in ‘Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty’.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group 
can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the 
Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, financial 
performance and financial position are set out in the Group Chief 
Executive’s statement on pages 4 to 8 and the Business review on 
pages 9 and 11. The material financial and operational risks and 
uncertainties that may impact the Group’s performance and their 
mitigation are outlined on pages 18 and 19 and financial risks including 
liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk are outlined in note 
26 to the financial statements. 
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider 
economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained in 
the Principal risks on pages 18 and 19, factors that particularly impact 
upon the performance of the Group include changes in the 
macroeconomic environment including buyer confidence, availability of 
mortgage finance for our purchasers, and interest rates. At 30 June 
2009, the net debt position of the Group (as shown in note 24 to the 
financial statements) was £1,276.9m, with loans and borrowings of 
£1,484.1m with headroom of £800.0m to the Group’s committed 
facilities. The Group remains in compliance with its financial covenants 
and at the date of approval of the financial statements the Group’s 
internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these 
covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months  
from the date of signing the financial statements. 
As noted in note 36, on 23 September 2009, the Company entered  
into an agreement with UBS Limited, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) 
Limited, HSBC Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and 
RBS Hoare Govett Limited to fully underwrite a £720.5m equity issue,  
to be structured as a Placing and a Rights Issue, to strengthen the Group’s 
balance sheet and reduce its financial indebtedness. In conjunction 
with the Placing and Rights Issue, the Company has negotiated  
certain amendments to the terms of the Group’s existing financing 
arrangements. The amended financing arrangements will only come 
into effect if a minimum of £450m total gross proceeds are raised 
pursuant to the Placing and Rights Issue and, before 31 December 
2009, the Company reduces its borrowings under the Wilson Bowden 
acquisition facilities and the Group’s private placement notes by 40% 
such that the total amount of indebtedness thereunder does not 
exceed £900m (excluding any indebtedness under make-whole notes 
that are issued as a consequence of the prepayment). The Company 
has put in place arrangements to effect such prepayments following it 
becoming entitled to the net proceeds of the Placing and Rights Issue. 
Upon such prepayments being made, £50m of undrawn commitments 
under both of its Revolving Credit Facilities will automatically be 
cancelled so that they do not exceed £700m. The Directors expect  
the amended financing arrangements will enable the Group to take 
advantage of opportunities that may arise in a recovering market,  
as well as to provide an appropriate alternative framework, should  
a further downturn arise. 
Completion of the Placing and Rights Issue is conditional upon 
shareholder approval at the General Meeting scheduled to be held on 
19 October 2009, listing of the shares to be issued pursuant to the 
Placing and Rights Issue and upon the underwriting agreement not 
being terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the General 
Meeting. If the Placing and Rights Issue do not proceed the amended 
financing arrangements will not come into effect. Until such time as any 
subsequent renegotiation is concluded, the existing financing 
arrangements will continue to apply. While the existing financing 
arrangements apply, if conditions in the wider UK economy, as they 
relate to the housebuilding sector, were to decline below that which has 
been assumed in the Group’s forecasts during the current financial year 
(and notwithstanding further management actions to both conserve 
and generate cash, including, if necessary, by making land sales) then 
there is a risk that the Group might generate lower than anticipated 
revenues, or cash, or require further write-downs in the value of the 
Group’s assets. This risk may result in the Group being unable to 
comply with its existing covenant package during the current financial 
year. If the amended financing arrangements do not come into effect, 
the Group will need to renegotiate the terms of its existing financing 
arrangements during the current financial year in order to secure the  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 59
Financial statements | Accounting policies
revolving credit facilities of an appropriate duration so as to give the 
Directors increased confidence that they will be able to prepare the 
accounts in respect of such a period on a going concern basis and 
also to secure a covenant package across all its financing 
arrangements that provides greater flexibility. 
The above risks, that the amended financing arrangements do not 
become effective because the conditions to the Placing and Rights 
Issue are not satisfied, and that whilst the existing financial covenants 
remain in place the impact of a decline in the housebuilding sector may 
result in the Group not being able to comply with such covenants, 
represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern such that the Group 
may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the 
normal course of business.
Nevertheless, based upon the Group’s expectation that the conditions 
to the Placing and the Rights Issue will be satisfied, in addition to the 
Group’s current trading, forecasts, and the further management actions 
which could be taken whilst the existing financial covenants remain in 
place referred to above, the Directors believe that the Group will 
continue to comply with its financial covenants and accordingly have 
formed a judgement that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements upon a going concern basis. Therefore, these financial 
statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the 
going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group has adopted:
Amendment to IAS39 and IFRS7 ‘Reclassification of Financial •	
Instruments’;
IFRIC12 ‘Service Concession Agreements’; and •	
IFRIC13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’. •	
The adoption of these interpretations and amendments to standards 
has not had any impact upon the profit or net assets of the Group in 
either the current or comparative year and has not required any 
additional disclosures.
Changes in accounting policies – defined benefit 
pension scheme
During the fourth quarter, as a consequence of the Group curtailing its 
defined benefit pension scheme during the year ended 30 June 2009, 
the Group changed its accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial 
gains and losses related to post-employment benefits for defined 
benefit pension schemes. The Group elected to voluntarily change its 
accounting policy from the corridor approach (under which actuarial 
gains and losses greater than 10% of the future obligation were 
recognised in the income statement over the average remaining 
working lives of the employees) to immediate recognition of actuarial 
gains and losses in shareholders’ equity in the period in which they 
arise. This change in policy was also considered appropriate with 
consideration to the expectation that the corridor method will be 
phased out by IFRS by 2013 and to bring the Group in line with 
prevailing practice in the UK.
The change in accounting policy has been recognised retrospectively 
and the 2008 comparatives have been adjusted. The retrospective 
adjustments had an impact on the Group balance sheet and the  
Group statement of recognised income and expense but not on  
the consolidated income statement or Group cash flow statement  
as follows:

As a result, the Group’s retirement benefit obligation decreased by 
£33.5m from £70.7m to £37.2m at 30 June 2008 and its deferred tax 
liability increased by £9.4m from £22.7m to £32.1m.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the Parent 
Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June.  
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated 
from the date when control passes to the Group using the purchase 
method of accounting and up to the date control ceases. All 
transactions with subsidiaries and inter-company profits or  
losses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded  
at their fair values. All changes to those assets and liabilities and the 
resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control 
of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition income statement. 60 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest 
with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has 
established joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its 
housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s share 
of profits and losses from its investments in such jointly controlled 
operations are accounted for on a direct basis and are included in the 
consolidated income statement. The Group’s share of its investments, 
assets and liabilities are accounted for on a directly proportional basis 
in the Group balance sheet.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total 
proceeds of building and development, and an appropriate proportion 
of revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of contract activity. Revenue is measured at  
the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents  
the amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The 
sale proceeds of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Construction contracts
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably. Variations to, and claims arising in 
respect of, construction contracts, are included in revenue to the extent 
that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of 
work performed to date. Contracts are only treated as construction 
contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the 
construction of a development or property. When it is probable that  
the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement immediately.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in  
trade receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less  
any foreseeable losses. Payments received on account for  
construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable  
on construction contracts.
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction 
contracts are included in trade payables.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are 
presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The Directors 
are of the opinion that the separate presentation of exceptional items 
provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business 
performance. Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the 
classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing 
and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the disposal  
of businesses or individual assets, pension scheme curtailments  
and asset impairments, including land, work in progress, goodwill  
and investments.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs are recognised in the income statement when the 
Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected 
parties. A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Profit/(loss) from operations
Profit/(loss) from operations includes all of the revenue and costs 
derived from the Group’s operating businesses. Profit/(loss) from 
operations excludes finance costs, finance income, the Group’s  
share of profits or losses from joint ventures and tax.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements at the time 
that they are paid, and final dividends are recognised at the time of 
agreement by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company recognises dividends from subsidiaries at the time that 
they are received.
Segmental reporting
The Group consists of two separate segments for management 
reporting and control purposes, being housebuilding and commercial 
developments. The Group manages these segments separately due  
to the different operational and commercial risks that they face.  
These segments therefore comprise the primary reporting segments 
within the financial statements. As all of the Group’s operations are 
within the United Kingdom, which is one economic environment in the 
context of the Group’s activities, there are no geographic segments  
to be disclosed. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net 
assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 
businesses is capitalised as an asset and reviewed for impairment  
at least annually.  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 61
Financial statements | Accounting policies
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each  
of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination at acquisition. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least 
annually. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has 
capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. 
Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash flows. 
Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its 
useful life on a straight-line basis. Where a brand is capitalised with an 
indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that result in the durability 
of brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, regulatory, 
contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful 
life of these intangible assets.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life 
brands by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount 
factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost  
of capital.
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of 
subsidiary undertakings by the Parent Company, they are treated as  
a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment 
in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight-line basis to 
their residual value over their estimated useful lives. Residual values 
and asset lives are reviewed annually.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over  
25 years. Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant is depreciated on  
a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which ranges from  
one to seven years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those 
overheads which have been incurred in bringing the inventories  
to their present location and condition. 
Land held for development, including land in the course of development, 
is initially recorded at discounted cost. Where, through deferred 
purchase credit terms, the fair value differs from the amount that will 
ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as  
a finance cost in the income statement over the period of settlement.
 
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to 
allocate site-wide development costs between units built in the current 
year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on 
such developments. In making these assessments there is a degree  
of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls  
to assess and review carrying-values and the appropriateness of 
estimates made.
Leases as lessee
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following 
the completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale 
of the development to third parties. Rental income from these operating 
leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all 
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not 
vested at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at  
the date of grant. Fair value is measured either using Black-Scholes, 
Present-Economic Value models or Monte Carlo models dependent 
upon the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value is expensed in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest where 
non-market vesting conditions apply. 62 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant and are re-measured both at the end of each reporting 
period and at the date of settlement with any changes in fair value 
being recognised in the income statement for the period. Fair value  
is measured initially and at the end of each reporting period using  
a Black-Scholes model and at the date of settlement as cash paid.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in 
respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not 
reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that 
result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay  
less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
Pensions
Defined contribution
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for certain 
employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged in 
the income statement in the year in which the contributions fall due.
Defined benefit
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised 
income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by  
the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Borrowing costs
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs and expenses them  
in the period to which they relate through the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for sale 
financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at 
the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets 
Zero coupon loans granted as part of sales transactions that are 
secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property 
are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value.  
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 16.
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets  
is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity in retained earnings, other changes including 
impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated 
using the ‘effective interest rate’ method, are recognised directly in  
the income statement. Where the investment is disposed of, or is 
determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 63
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater 
than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified 
as non-current assets and are measured at amortised cost less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances 
are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Impairment of financial assets
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment 
at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial 
difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer 
going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced  
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other 
receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the 
allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes  
in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised  
in the income statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or 
prolonged decline in the value of the property underpinning the value  
of the loan or increased risk of default are considered to be objective 
evidence of impairment. 
In respect of debt instruments classified as available for sale financial 
assets, increases in the fair value of assets previously subject to 
impairment, which can be objectively related to an event occurring 
after recognition of the impairment loss are recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that they reverse the impairment loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in bank 
accounts with no notice or less than three months notice from 
inception and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments consist of the Company’s ordinary share capital  
and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial 
liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction 
costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade  
and other payables. 
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing  
and are stated at amortised cost. 
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect  
of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the 
asset to which they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest 
rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which 
will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised 
over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using 
the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Bank borrowings 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and 
overdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle net the outstanding 
position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position 
in the balance sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method in the income statement. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form 
of interest rate swaps, basis rate swaps and cross currency swaps to 
manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising from  
the Group’s operations and sources of finance. The use of financial 
derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board 
of Directors as detailed in notes 25 and 26 to the financial statements.
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are 
designated as hedging instruments, being either hedges of a change  
in future cash flows as a result of interest rate movements, or hedges  
of a change in future cash flows as a result of foreign currency 
exchange rate movements.  64 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements | Accounting policies
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset 
or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging 
relationship is more than twelve months and as a current asset or  
a current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship  
is less than twelve months.
Hedge accounting
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are 
designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship the Group documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedged transactions. In addition, at the inception of the hedge and  
on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows  
of the hedged items.
Details of the fair values of the interest rate and cross currency swaps 
are provided in notes 23, 24 and 25 to the financial statements. 
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in note 30.
Cash flow hedge
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains 
and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency 
swap arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until 
realised. On realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within 
finance charges in the income statement. To the extent that any hedge 
is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair value of these swap 
arrangements are recognised immediately in finance charges in the 
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in 
equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to 
match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. 
Grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the 
asset. Grants related to income are deducted from the related expense 
in the income statement. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 65
Financial statements | Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
Impact of standards and interpretations  
in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these financial statements there were a 
number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been 
published and are therefore mandatory for the Group’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and later periods. All of these 
have been endorsed by the EU with the exception of the revisions or 
amendments to IAS39, IFRS1, IFRS7, IFRIC9/IAS39, IFRS1/IAS27, 
IFRIC17 and IFRIC18 and the Improvements to IFRSs. The Group  
has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to 
impact upon the Group are: 
Amendment to IAS23 ‘Borrowing Costs’. This amendment requires •	
an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part 
of the cost of the asset. A qualifying asset is one that takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. The option  
of immediately expensing these borrowing costs is removed subject 
to an exemption for inventories manufactured in large numbers on 
a repetitive basis. This amendment will apply to the Group from  
the accounting period commencing 1 July 2009. Adoption of the 
amendment is expected to result in a reduced interest charge in the 
income statement and a consequential reduction in gross margin 
from 1 July 2009. The Group is currently assessing the impact of  
this amendment on the Group’s results and financial position, 
although it may be significant and will require the Group to change  
its accounting policy.
IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS8 amends the current segmental •	
reporting requirements of IAS14 and requires a reporting approach to 
be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same 
basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. This standard will 
apply to the Group from the accounting period commencing 1 July 
2009. It is expected to lead to additional disclosures being provided  
in the Group’s financial statements. The Group does not expect to 
allocate its goodwill to alternative cash-generating units and therefore 
based upon the 30 June 2009 calculations no impairment of goodwill 
is expected upon adoption of this standard. If the Group was required 
to alter its cash-generating units, IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ limits 
the size of a cash-generating unit to an entity’s segments, which could 
in certain circumstances lead to an impairment of goodwill.
IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments (amendment)’. Non-vesting •	
conditions are to be taken into account in the estimate of the fair 
value of the equity instruments; vesting conditions that are not 
market conditions are not taken into account. This amendment will 
apply to the Group from 1 July 2009. Adoption of the amendment 
may impact the accounting for the Group’s Savings-Related Share 
Option Scheme in the income statement and equity from 1 July 2009.
Revision of IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. This revision •	
to IAS1 is applicable from 1 July 2009, and is expected to affect the 
presentation and classification of certain items within the Group’s 
financial statements.
Revision of IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’. Following this revision, •	
transaction costs must be expensed, rather than included as costs 
of acquisition, and contingent consideration will be required to be  
fair valued. In addition, there will be a choice of two goodwill 
measurement methods where less than 100% of the entity is acquired. 
This revision will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009, and although  
it will have no impact on implementation, it will have a significant 
impact on any future acquisitions.
Amendment to IFRS7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial •	
Instruments’ and IFRIC9/IAS39 ‘Embedded Derivatives’ expands  
the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements 
recognised in the statement of financial position. The amendments 
apply from 1 July 2009 and are expected to impact upon the Group 
by requiring additional disclosures in the annual financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS1 and IAS27 ‘Cost of an Investment in a •	
Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate’ is primarily 
applicable only to first time adopters of IFRS. IAS27 has also been 
amended to deal with circumstances where a parent reorganises the 
structure of its group by establishing a new entity as its parent. The 
amendments will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009, and although 
they will have no impact on implementation, they could impact the 
accounting for future reorganisations.
Improvements to IFRSs, issued in April 2009 is the current tranche  •	
of the Improvements to IFRS project and includes a number of minor 
amendments to existing IAS and IFRS, which require implementation 
from 1 July 2009. The impact of these amendments is currently 
being assessed by the Group.
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and 
interpretations are not expected to have any material impact on  
the financial statements of the Group:
An amendment to IAS39 ‘Eligible hedged items’. The amendment •	
makes two significant changes. It prohibits designating inflation as  
a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt and prohibits including 
time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as 
hedges. The amendment will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009.
Part 1 of the Improvements to IFRS project and ‘Improvements to •	
IFRSs’ has a number of smaller amendments to existing IAS and 
IFRS, which have implementation dates at various points during 
2009 and 2010 that apply to the Group from 1 July 2009. 66 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements 
Critical accounting judgements and  
key sources of estimation uncertainty
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed 
below the critical accounting judgements made and the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty within these financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the financial 
statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt  
with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dates are discussed below.
Carrying-value of land and work in progress
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and commercial 
development. Due to the nature of this activity, much of the 
development entered into by the Group is speculative in nature. 
Accordingly, the Group has in its balance sheet at 30 June 2009 
current assets that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s 
internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the 
carrying-value of land and work in progress is more than the lower of 
cost or net realisable value.
In respect of the half years ended 31 December 2008 and 30 June 
2009, the Group conducted reviews of the net realisable value of  
its land and work in progress carrying-values of its sites in the light  
of the deterioration in the UK housing market. Where the estimated  
net realisable value of the site was less than its current carrying-value 
within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in 
progress value. This resulted in an exceptional impairment of £499.5m 
being £494.9m at 31 December 2008 and a net impairment of £4.6m 
at 30 June 2009 as shown in note 18. These reviews were conducted 
on a site-by-site basis using valuations incorporating forecast sales 
rates, average selling prices and estimated costs to complete that 
reflected both current and anticipated trading conditions. These are  
key judgements in the impairment calculation. Should there be further 
significant movements in UK house prices then further impairments/
reversals of previous gross impairments of land and work in progress 
may be necessary. 
Impact of standards and interpretations  
in issue but not yet effective (continued)
IFRIC15 ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’. IFRIC15 •	
provides guidance on whether the construction of real estate should 
be accounted for under IAS11 or IAS18. The Group already accounts 
for the construction of real estate in accordance with IFRIC15, and 
accordingly this interpretation, which is effective from 1 January 
2009, will have no impact upon the Group.
IFRIC16 ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’. IFRIC16 •	
guides an investing company on the designation of, and accounting 
for, hedges in foreign operations. This interpretation will apply to the 
Group from 1 July 2009 and has no material impact as there are no 
foreign operations.
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and •	
IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements for certain puttable 
financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation’ require 
some financial instruments that meet the definition of a financial 
liability to be classified as equity, where certain strict criteria are met. 
These amendments will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009 and 
have no impact as the Group holds no such financial instruments.
IAS27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’. •	
The amendments relate, primarily, to accounting for non-controlling 
interests and the loss of control of a subsidiary, and will apply to the 
Group from 1 July 2009.
Revision to IFRS1 ‘First Time Adoption of IFRS’, effective 1 July 2009 •	
relates solely to first time adopters of IFRS.
IFRIC17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’ provides •	
guidance on the appropriate accounting treatment when an entity 
distributes assets other than cash as dividends to its shareholders. 
This interpretation will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009.
IFRIC18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ provides guidance  •	
to address divergent practice in the accounting by recipients for 
transfers of property, plant and equipment from ‘customers’.  
This interpretation will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009.
Amendments to IFRIC9 and IAS39 ‘Embedded Derivatives’ clarify •	
that on reclassification of a financial asset out of the ‘fair value 
through profit or loss’ category, all embedded derivatives have to  
be assessed and, if necessary, separately accounted for in the 
financial statements. The amendments will apply to the Group  
from 1 July 2009. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 67
Financial statements | Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimation of costs to complete 
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its 
developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide 
development costs between units built in the current year and in future 
years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. 
In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. 
The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review 
carrying-values and appropriateness of estimates made.
Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for 
under IAS11 ‘Construction Contracts’
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising 
revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. The application  
of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total 
expected costs to complete each site. The Group has in place 
established internal control processes to ensure that the evaluation  
of costs and revenues are based upon appropriate estimates. 
Impairment of goodwill 
The determination of the impairment of goodwill of the housebuilding 
business requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the housebuilding 
cash-generating unit as defined in note 11. The value-in-use calculation 
requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the 
housebuilding business, including the anticipated growth rate of 
revenue and costs, and requires the determination of a suitable 
discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The 
discount rate used is one applicable to the existing capital structure  
of the Group at the balance sheet date, as explained in note 36 there  
is a proposed change to the Group’s capital structure which may 
impact on the Group’s discount rate in future periods. The carrying 
amount of goodwill at 30 June 2009 was £792.2m with no impairment 
recognised during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Impairment of brands 
The determination of the impairment calculation for the Group’s 
indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires an estimation of  
the value-in-use of the brand as defined in note 12. The value-in-use 
calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from 
this brand, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, 
and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate 
the present value of the cash flows. The discount rate used is one 
applicable to the existing capital structure which may impact on the 
Group’s discount rate in future periods. The carrying amount of 
indefinite life brands at 30 June 2009 was £100.0m with no impairment 
recognised during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Deferred tax assets
At 30 June 2009 the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of 
£127.3m, of which £130.1m related to trading losses that arose during 
the year that are to be carried forward and relieved against profits 
arising in future periods. The judgement to recognise the deferred tax 
asset is dependent upon the Group’s expectations regarding future 
profitability based upon site revenue and cost forecasts for future years 
which contain a degree of inherent uncertainty.
Defined benefit pension 
The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate  
the Group’s liability in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme.  
In calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to  
be made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, 
price inflation, the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets and 
mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from 
those assumed, the pension liability may differ from that included  
in these financial statements. 
Hedge accounting
The majority of the Group’s facilities are floating rate, which exposes the 
Group to increased interest rate risk. The Group has therefore taken 
out £765.0m (note 25) of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The 
Group has adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the basis 
that it is highly probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match 
with the period of swaps. If the highly probable criterion was not met in 
future then any changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised 
in the income statement, rather than in equity. During the year ended 
30 June 2009, there was a loss of £81.0m (2008: £19.1m) included in 
equity related to these swaps.
In addition, the Group has entered into $271.6m of cross currency 
swaps to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange, 
arising from the Group’s sources of US Dollar denominated finance. 
These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge against future 
foreign exchange rate movements. If the hedges ceased to be highly 
effective then any changes in fair value of the swaps would be 
recognised in the income statement, rather than equity. During the  
year ended 30 June 2009, there was a gain of £30.3m (2008: £7.4m) 
included in equity related to these swaps. £7.2m (2008: £nil) of this gain 
was realised upon cancellation of $40.5m of foreign exchange swaps 
following repayment of $40.5m US Dollar private placement notes on 
12 January 2009.
Available for sale financial assets
The Group holds available for sale financial assets principally comprising 
interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions that are 
secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property. 
The loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows 
taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the 
estimated time of repayment. At 30 June 2009 the asset recognised  
on the balance sheet was £86.5m (2008: £66.9m).  68 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

3. Exceptional items
Impairment of inventories
During the half year ended 31 December 2008, in light of deteriorations in market conditions upon certain commercial and housebuilding sites that 
the Group had specifically targeted for sale and realised in the period, a net realisable value write-down of £62.6m was recognised against the land 
and work in progress value. In addition, the Group also conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying-values  
of its sites during the period in light of the continued deterioration in the UK housing market. Where the estimated net realisable value of the site was 
less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress value. This resulted in an impairment of 
£432.3m. The total impairment of inventories recognised as an exceptional cost during the half year ended 31 December 2008 was £494.9m.
During the half year ended 30 June 2009, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress  
carrying-values of its sites. Where the estimated net realisable value of the site was less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group 
impaired the land and work in progress value. This resulted in a further impairment of inventories for the year which was recognised as an exceptional 
cost of £nil for the housebuilding business although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of £120.9m due to performance variations 
upon housebuilding sites and £4.6m for the commercial developments business.
The total impairment of inventories recognised as an exceptional cost during the year ended 30 June 2009 was £499.5m (2008: £208.4m).
Further details on this impairment are given in note 18.
Impairment of goodwill
At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its goodwill as explained in note 11. This resulted in no impairment charge for the 
year (2008: £24.5m).
Impairment of intangible assets
At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its brands as explained in note 12. This resulted in no impairment charge for the  
year (2008: £6.2m).
Restructuring costs
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group incurred £27.1m (2008: £15.9m) of costs in relation to reorganising and restructuring the business, 
including redundancy costs of £17.6m (2008: £3.7m). 70 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

3. Exceptional items (continued)
Pension curtailment gain
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group recognised curtailment gains of £7.1m (2008: £nil) in respect of the cessation of future accrual  
of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the associated removal of the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases  
and redundancies made during the year. Further details are given in note 27.
Make-whole fee on redemption of private placement notes
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Group incurred charges of £13.3m (2008: £nil) in respect of the make-whole fee which was triggered  
on the redemption of £36.7m of private placement notes. Further details are given in note 24.
Impairment of inventories relating to investments accounted for using the equity method
At 30 June 2009, the Group conducted an impairment review of its share of the inventories included within its investments accounted for using  
the equity method. This resulted in an impairment charge for the year of £2.8m with a related deferred tax credit of £0.8m. Further details are given  
in note 14.

Legislation on the taxation of foreign profits received Royal Assent on 21 July 2009. These rules include provisions to restrict interest deduction on 
intra-group loans, which will apply to accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2010. Where interest deductions are restricted under these 
new rules in one Group company, the legislation includes the scope to claim an adjustment in the corresponding company and the flexibility to 
allocate the interest deductions across the Group in order to prevent losses becoming trapped. As a result it is not envisaged that these rules will 
impact on the Group’s future tax charge.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £468.6m (2008: £86.4m profit) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as 
cancelled, which were 345.0m (2008: 345.0m).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £468.6m (2008: £86.4m profit) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the 
year, giving a figure of 345.0m (2008: 346.7m).

Goodwill cost of £816.7m consists of £792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment and £24.5m relating to the commercial developments segment. 
The goodwill of the commercial developments business was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts its annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments 
segments. The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2009 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the  
carrying-value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill. The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and  
then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment. The first three years of cash flows 
were determined using the Group’s approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the fourth and fifth years were determined  
using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, considering available land purchases  
and work in progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which  
was based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s •	
housebuilding business. Accordingly the rate of 8.9% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate being 
the Group’s estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. This rate is calculated using the current capital structure of the Group  
at the balance sheet date. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 75
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements
11. Goodwill (continued)
Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site •	
basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For years four and five these have been estimated at  
a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and •	
planning permissions. For years four and five these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future 
changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon the expected •	
costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur due to the business  
being on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions. For years four and five these have been estimated at a Group 
level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
 
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Group’s goodwill was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2009 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected 
changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the difficult conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate appropriate to the 
position and risks of the Group. The result of the impairment review, which was based upon the capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date, 
was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying-value by £2,932.7m. As explained in note 36 there is a proposed 
change to the Group’s capital structure which may impact the Group’s discount rates for future periods. If the UK housing market and expectations 
regarding its future were to deteriorate further reducing operating margins by 7 .8% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by  
4.7% and all other variables were held constant then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying-value.

Brands
The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the 
Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for  
an indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so. 
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. At 30 June 2009 
an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 11. The conclusion of this impairment review was 
that the Group’s David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7.0m prior to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business 
brand operating in niche markets. Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.  76 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Other inventories      6.7 5.3
      3,540.8 4,830.0
a) Nature of inventories
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories 
will not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject  
to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
b) Impairment of inventories
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a net realisable value review of its land and work in progress which resulted in an impairment of £208.4m.
During the half year ended 31 December 2008, the Group provided £62.6m for a reduction in net realisable value upon certain commercial and 
housebuilding sites that it had specifically targeted for sale and realised.
The Group also conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during the period. This review 
compared the estimated net realisable value of each of the Group’s development sites with its balance sheet carrying-value and where the estimated 
net realisable value of an individual site was less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress 
value of the site. The result of this further site-by-site net realisable value review was an exceptional impairment of £432.3m. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 81
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements
18. Inventories (continued)
b) Impairment of inventories (continued)
The total impairment of land and work in progress recognised during the half year ended 31 December 2008 was £494.9m.
A further impairment review was conducted during the half year ended 30 June 2009. This also compared the estimated net realisable value of 
each of the Group’s development sites with its balance sheet carrying-value and where the estimated net realisable value of an individual site was 
less than its carrying-value within the balance sheet, the Group impaired the land and work in progress value of the site. The result of this further 
site-by-site net realisable value review was a net exceptional impairment of £nil for the housebuilding business, although there were gross 
impairment reversals and charges of £120.9m due to performance variations upon housebuilding sites, and £4.6m for the commercial 
developments business.
The total impairment of land and work in progress recognised during the year ended 30 June 2009 was £499.5m included in exceptional items 
(note 3).
The key judgement in estimating the net realisable value of a site was the estimation of likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete. Sales 
prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and considered the current prices being achieved upon each site 
for each product type.
Although the impairment of land and work in progress was based upon the current prices being achieved by the Group in the difficult conditions 
within the UK housing market, if the UK housing market were to deteriorate or improve beyond management expectations in the future then further 
adjustments to the carrying-value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments £1,460.5m (2008: £557.0m) of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c) Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in 2009 and included in cost of sales was £2,009.8m (2008: £2,714.2m) including £0.1m (2008: £10.4m) of 
inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of £nil (2008: £5.4m) on inventories that were written down in a 
previous accounting period, but excluding the £499.5m (2008: £208.4m) exceptional impairment. The reversal of £5.4m in the prior year arose 
mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land and other interests that had previously been written down to net realisable value.
During the second half, average selling prices across the Group’s developments were in line with those incorporated into the impairment review at 
31 December 2008 and therefore overall no further impairment was required in the housebuilding business, although there were gross impairment 
reversals and charges of £120.9m due to performance variations upon housebuilding sites.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2009 totalled £499.6m (2008: £218.8m), being the £499.5m (2008: £208.4m) 
classified as an exceptional cost and the remaining £0.1m (2008: £10.4m) incurred in the normal course of trading.

At 30 June      4.6 3.1
The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables which are in default. The impairment recognised in cost  
of sales represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries.  
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

The principal features of the Group’s drawn debt facilities at 30 June 2009 were as follows:
i)  Committed facilities
A committed £484.1m five-year term facility, of which £483.0m was drawn at 30 June 2009 and £1.1m was utilised by way of a bank guarantee to •	
support the loan notes, made available under a credit agreement dated 5 February 2007 (as amended from time to time and most recently with 
effect from 6 August 2008). At 30 June 2008, the facility was £529.4m but during the year £45.3m of the loan notes were repaid and the relevant 
proportion of the facility cancelled.
A committed £750.0m five-year revolving credit facility of which £750.0m was drawn at 30 June 2009, also available under a credit agreement •

Net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, interest bearing borrowings and foreign exchange swaps. The Group includes 
foreign exchange swaps within net debt as these swaps were entered into to hedge the foreign exchange exposure upon the Group’s US Dollar 
denominated private placement notes. The Group’s foreign exchange swaps have both an interest rate and an exchange rate element and only the 
exchange rate element on the notional amount of the swap is included within the net debt note above. The Group’s derivative financial instruments

25. Derivative financial instruments – swaps (continued)
a) Interest rate swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest rates, 
arising from the Group’s and Company’s sources of finance. All of the Group’s and Company’s interest rate swap arrangements contain a clause  
that allows the Group/Company or the issuer to cancel the swap in May 2012 at fair value.
As at 30 June 2009 the Group and Company had outstanding floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts of £1,209.4m (2008: £1,409.2m). In obtaining 
this funding the Group and Company sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated 
proportion of anticipated future debt requirements. 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £765.0m (2008: £765.0m) of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in 
accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 26. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates 
applicable to the debt were as follows:
      Fixed 
     Amount rate payable 
     £m % Maturity
     142.5 5.79 2012

     40.0 5.72 2022
     40.0 5.76 2022
     765.0
The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 
30 June 2009, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of £87.8m (2008: £6.8m) with a loss of £81.0m (2008: £19.1m) charged directly  
to equity in the year. There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Swaps with a notional amount of £95.0m were cancelled during the prior year on the refinancing of part of the Group’s and Company’s Sterling 
borrowings. Cumulative losses on these swaps of £3.6m were deferred in equity in the prior year as the forecast transaction specified in the hedge 
relationship is still expected to occur. These losses will be recognised in the income statement over the period the forecast transaction occurs; £0.4m 
(2008: £0.1m) of the loss was recognised in the income statement in the year, and a balance of £3.1m (2008: £3.5m) remains deferred in equity.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 26.
b) Basis rate swaps 
During the year, the Group entered into £400.0m of six-month basis rate swaps to swap the interest payable upon some of the Group’s borrowings 
from six-month LIBOR to one-month LIBOR plus a premium. These swaps reduced the cash interest payable by the Group by £1.4m over the 
six-month life. There were no basis rate swaps outstanding as at 30 June 2009.
c) Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign 
exchange arising from the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2009 the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $271.6m (2008: $300.0m). On 12 January 2009,  
as part of the US Dollar private placement notes repayment and issue of notes due to the make-whole agreement, the Company cancelled $40.5m  
of the foreign exchange swaps and entered into $12.1m of US Dollar denominated foreign exchange swaps. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 89

c) Foreign exchange swaps (continued)
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group 
treasury policy outlined in note 26. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows:
      Fixed

     56.2 9.24 2018
     271.6
  
The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements. The hedges match the contractual 
initial receipt, the final settlement, and as a result of refinancing on 9 July 2008 match 73% of the interest payments. The fair value of the swap 
arrangements as at 30 June 2009, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of £30.5m (2008: £7.4m) with a gain of £30.3m  
(2008: £7.4m) credited directly to equity in the year. £7.2m (2008: £nil) of this gain was realised upon cancellation of $40.5m of foreign exchange 
swaps following repayment of $40.5m US Dollar private placement notes on 12 January 2009. There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through  
the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 26.
26. Financial risk management
The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 23, 24 and 25. 
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system 
for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management with the goal of ensuring that risks are promptly identified and 
appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department. These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to 
ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme 
that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and 
derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, 
which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury 
Operating Committee. 
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and 
medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings  
are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May, and October and November, of each year, due to seasonal trends in 
income. Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient headroom under its revolving credit facilities to cover these requirements. On a normal operating 
basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of £250.0m of available committed bank facilities and identifies and takes appropriate actions 
based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2009, the Group had 
committed bank facilities of £2,284.4m (2008: £2,555.4m) and total facilities of £2,360.6m (2008: £2,651.6m). At 30 June 2009, the Group’s drawn 
debt was £1,484.1m (2008: £1,685.2m). This represented 65.0% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2009 (2008: 65.9%).
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2009. At the date of approval of the financial statements the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of 
signing the financial statements. Compliance with covenants is also considered on pages 58 and 59. 90 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements
26. Financial risk management (continued)
a) Liquidity risk (continued)
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities  
and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2009, the average maturity of the Group’s 
committed bank facilities was 3.1 years (2008: 3.3 years). 
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations. The undrawn committed 
facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows:
     Group  Company 
    2009 2008 2009 2008

In addition, the Group had £68.8m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2009 (2008: £88.7m).
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity

b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.  
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions  
and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group has detailed procedures to manage its  
market related operational risks which include:

The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2009 these were carried at a fair 
value of £86.5m (2008: £66.9m).
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
At 30 June 2009, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets 
and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £6.2m (2008: £14.9m) with  
a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk 
and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is 
appropriate flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating  
to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated  
private placements.
The Group has a policy that 60%–80% of the Group’s median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan (taking into account hedging)  
is at a fixed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and an average maximum duration of fifteen years. At 30 June 2009, 68.4% of the 
Group’s borrowings was at a fixed rate (2008: 61.6%).

Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2009 was 6.6% (2008: 6.6%).
Sterling private placement notes of £114.2m (2008: £125.5m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest 
rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2009 was 11.5% (2008: 7.8%) with, at 30 June 2009, 
a weighted average period of 8.5 years (2008: 9.5 years) for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £164.9m (2008: £150.5m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair  
value interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign 
exchange rate swaps, for 2009 was 11.0% (2008: 6.9%) with, at 30 June 2009, a weighted average period of 7.8 years (2008: 8.8 years) for which  
the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2009, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
pre-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease by £3.9m (2008: £4.8m), the Group’s post-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease by £2.8m  
(2008: £3.4m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £2.8m (2008: £3.4m).
iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2009, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $271.6m (2008: $300.0m). In order to mitigate risks 
associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt 
and a significant proportion of the interest payments. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US 
Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on  
the principal of its US Dollar debt. As a result of the revised financing arrangements implemented in July and August 2008, the foreign exchange 
swaps match 73% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 27%.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 25.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2009, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher/lower and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s pre-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease by £0.7m (2008: £nil), the Group’s post-tax (loss)/profit would increase/decrease 
by £0.5m (2008: £nil) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £0.5m (2008: £nil). 94 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

26. Financial risk management (continued)
c) Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered 
Social Landlords for social housing. The Group has £86.5m (2008: £66.9m) of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, 
although this asset is spread over a large number of properties. As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has  •	
a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
 The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an International Swaps and  •	
Derivatives Association Master Agreement in place. These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure  
to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2009 was £31.0m (2008: £8.6m). The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the 
financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
As at 30 June 2009, the Company was exposed to £1,511.1m (2008: £2,230.1m) of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees, 
performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in note 30, and its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans), as set out in 
note 24. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK 
house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage 
availability and competitor pricing. The management of these operational risks is set out in note 26b. In addition, the Group is subject to further land and 
construction cash flow risks, which the Group has established appropriate controls over in order to appropriately manage its capital, including:
Risk Mitigation
The timing of conditional land purchase contracts becoming 
unconditional is uncertain. Unexpected changes in contract status 
may result in additional cash outflow for the Group.
Each division has a site-by-site detailed short-term and medium-term forecasting process including  
sensitivity scenarios.
The market for land can be illiquid and therefore it may be 
difficult to sell or trade land if required. Where land is sold,  
there is a risk that the proceeds may not be received from  
the counterparty. 
The Group’s internal forecasting process is able to identify the impact of these sensitivities explicitly.
Inability to obtain surety bonds. The Group actively maintains the number of surety facilities that are designed to ensure that it has 
sufficient bonds available. The Group has a comprehensive detailed regular forecasting process  
for surety bond requirements.
Failure to identify and achieve key construction milestones, 
including the impact of adverse weather conditions, could  
delay construction or increase costs.
The Group’s weekly reporting identifies the number of properties at key stages of construction. 
Projected construction rates are evaluated as part of the monthly forecasting cycle.
Large development projects including commercial 
developments are complex and capital intensive and  
changes may negatively impact upon cash flows or returns.
Development projects, including returns and cash flows, are monitored regularly by divisional 
management teams.
Failure to promptly identify cost overruns. The total costs on every site in progress are evaluated at least quarterly and reviewed by the 
divisional management teams.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary 
dividends paid to shareholders, (assuming the Company is paying a dividend), issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments,  
and selling assets to reduce debt. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 95

Contributions during the year
Group defined contribution schemes consolidated income statement charge    3.9 4.9
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.2m (2008: £0.2m), which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’) which is closed to new entrants. With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions  
for current employees and the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed. This decision was taken following a detailed 
consultation process with the Trustees and employee members of the Scheme. Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place  
for current employees.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2007 and updated to 30 June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary. The projected  
unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost. Due to the Scheme ceasing to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions  
to employees from 30 June 2009, there will be no current service cost in future years. Following the completion of the Scheme triennial actuarial 
valuation for funding purposes, the Group has agreed to make future contributions to the Scheme, in addition to the normal contribution payment,  
of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 to address the Scheme’s deficit and the Group will also meet the Scheme’s administration expenses, 
death in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy. At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.4m (2008: £0.4m).
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair (bid) value. The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance 
sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions      2009 2008
 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations   
Discount rate      6.30% 6.30%
Rate of compensation increase      4.40% 4.70%
Rate of price inflation      3.40% 3.70%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost   
Discount rate      6.30% 5.80%
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets     6.82% 6.70%
Rate of compensation increase      4.70% 5.30%
Rate of price inflation      3.70% 3.30%
Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement. The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice 
from Mercer Limited, the Group’s actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to  
calculate the scheme liabilities:
      Male Female
Retired member born in 1935 (life expectancy at age 65)     21.3 24.4
Non-retired member born in 1965 (life expectancy at age 65)     23.1 25.9
The base mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables. The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Scheme’s 
membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption. Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium  
cohort projection.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption   Change in assumption   Increase in scheme liabilities
Discount rate   Decrease by 0.1%   £4.0m (2.0%)
Rate of inflation   Increase by 0.1%   £2.2m (1.1%)

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free 
investments (primarily Government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested 
and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset 
allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on scheme assets was as follows:

The issued share capital of the Company did not increase during the year. During the prior year the issued share capital of the Company was 
increased by the issue of: 
85,630 ordinary shares of 10p each for a cash consideration of £479,107 in satisfaction of options duly exercised in accordance with the rules  •	
of the share option plans.
120,512 ordinary shares as £1,313,581 in exchange for transfer of Wilson Bowden Limited shares arising on exercise of options under legacy  •	
Wilson Bowden Limited share option schemes following the acquisition of Wilson Bowden Limited.
The Barratt Developments PLC Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds 1,711,046 (2008: 1,711,046) ordinary shares in the Company. The cost 
of the shares, at an average of 165.9 pence per share (2008: 165.9 pence per share), was £2,838,386 (2008: £2,838,386). The market value of the 
shares held by the EBT at 30 June 2009, at 147.5 pence per share (2008: 58.0 pence per share), was £2,523,793 (2008: £992,407). The shares are 
held in the EBT for the purpose of satisfying options that have been granted under The Barratt Developments PLC Executive and Employee Share 
Option Plans. These ordinary shares do not rank for dividend and do not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares used to 
calculate earnings per share until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee.
29. Share-based payments 
a) Details of the share-based payment schemes
i) Executive Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘ESOP’). The grant of share options under the ESOP is at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be 
held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of 
grant. The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration 
Committee, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed 
the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998, and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 
1999. No options may be granted under the ESOP after 18 December 2007.
ii) Employee Share Option Plan
In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Plan’). The Board approves the grant of share options to 
employees under this Employee Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of the options 
granted under the Employee Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in  
the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index  
by at least 9%. No options may be granted under the Employee Plan after 10 April 2010.
Those who have participated in the Executive Share Option Plan do not participate in the Employee Share Option Plan.
iii) Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect 
from 1 July 2003. 
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003. No LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 
2009 and the Committee is not proposing to grant any LTPP awards for the financial year ending 30 June 2010. Instead the Committee has used  
and will use the ESOS as described on page 46.
Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.  
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 99

29. Share-based payments (continued)
a) Details of the share-based payment schemes (continued)
iii) Long-Term Performance Plan (continued)
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary with 
vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. There  
is no re-testing of performance conditions. 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on TSR and 50% based on  
EPS growth. 
The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the awards,  
as they are fundamental measures of the Group’s underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2006 uses a comparator group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, Bovis 
Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. For awards made in 2007, the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award comprises 
those companies, excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index. For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if 
the Company’s TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of the comparator group. 10% of the 
total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median. The award will vest on a 
straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets.
For awards made in 2006 and 2007, the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the  
RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between, the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.  
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
The qualifying period for the award granted in 2006 ended on 30 June 2009. Performance of this award against the constituent TSR and EPS  
targets was tested after the year end and neither of the targets had been achieved. Accordingly no part of the 2006 awards will vest.
iv) Executive Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’). The grant of share options under the ESOS is at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be 
held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of 
grant. The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration 
Committee, which for options granted in 2008 was based upon Return On Capital Employed (‘ROCE’). There will be no opportunity to retest any 
performance criteria. The ROCE performance condition is underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined  
by the ROCE condition is such that it correctly reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee. 
For options granted in 2008, 100% of the option will vest if the ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 reaches 14.5%, 25% of the award  
will vest if the ROCE reaches 10.5% and no part of the award will vest if the ROCE is below 10.5%. The award will vest on a straight-line basis 
between the upper and lower targets. There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria. ROCE will be calculated as operating profit 
(measured across the whole year to 30 June 2011) divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less any intangible assets (being the average of the  
12 month end figures during the same year). The Committee considered that ROCE was the most rounded measure of financial performance for a 
housebuilder at the time of this award and was satisfied that the ROCE target range represented a stretching target considering the outlook for the 
housebuilding market.
v) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘SRSOS’). Under the SRSOS, participants are required  
to make monthly contributions to an HM Treasury approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three years. On entering 
into the savings contract participants were granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under  
the rules of the SRSOS. The exercise of options under the SRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the SRSOS is  
HM Revenue and Customs approved and open to all eligible employees. The first grant under the SRSOS was made on 3 February 2009 at an 
exercise price of 87.05 pence per share. 100 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

29. Share-based payments (continued)
vi) Management Incentive Plan
In May 2009, the Company adopted the Management Incentive Plan 2008-2011 (the ‘Plan’). The Plan entitles participants to a cash bonus linked  
to the Company’s share price, subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, based upon 
ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011. There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria. The ROCE performance condition  
is underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined by the ROCE condition is such that it correctly reflects the 
underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period. 
vii) Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above target 
will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan. The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional 
amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan. 
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum of four for one for voluntary 
deferral; matching awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a period of three years. The relevant performance conditions are  
the same as those used for the LTPP as detailed on page 98 and 99. 
b) Outstanding equity-settled share-based payments
At 30 June 2009, the following options issued in accordance with the rules of the Executive Share Option Plan, the Employee Share Option Plan,

have an average term of 1.8 years (2008: 2.0 years) to expiry. Property leases have an average term of 5.7 years (2008: 6.7 years) to expiry. 
b) The Group as lessor
Property rental income earned during the year was £3.4m (2008: £1.4m).
The Group has lease agreements with third parties for certain commercial properties either in the process of development or which have been 
developed by the Group, and units on land to be subsequently developed for residential use. It is intended that the commercial properties, with 
their future rental income, will be sold to third parties in the normal course of business, and therefore they are classified as work in progress until  
the date of sale. At 30 June 2009, these properties had a carrying-value of £7.0m (2008: £20.3m), and land with rental units had a carrying-value  
of £45.9m (2008: £40.9m). At 30 June 2009, these rental agreements had an average term of 2.8 years (2008: 3.1 years) to expiry and total rental 
receivables over the remaining lease period are £4.9m (2008: £3.6m) with £1.5m (2008: £1.3m) expiring within one year, £2.7m (2008: £2.1m) 
expiring in more than one year and no later than five years and £0.7m (2008: £0.2m) expiring in five years or more.
33. Acquisitions
The Group acquired the entire issued share capital of one entity during the year, being:
Hawkstone (South West) Limited Acquired on 1 July 2008. •	
The total cash consideration was £4.0m. This company was solely acquired for the land and land options that it holds. The book value of land 
acquired was £2.5m and the fair value was £4.7m which was offset by a deferred tax creditor of £0.7m (£0.7m at fair value). No goodwill arose on  
this acquisition. The acquisition did not contribute to the revenue or profit of the Group for the year.
In addition, as a result of a reallocation between the fair value and book value of land acquired as part of the prior year acquisition of Chancerygate 
(Lionel Road) Limited, a deferred tax credit of £3.3m arises in the year to 30 June 2009.
The Group also received cash contributions under the Wilson Bowden SAYE scheme of £1.3m in the prior year. 110 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements
34. Contingent liabilities
a) Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries
The Company has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings.
Certain subsidiary undertakings have commitments for the purchase of trading stock entered into in the normal course of business.
In the normal course of business the Group has given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees. Management 
estimate that the bonds and guarantees amount to £417.5m (2008: £434.9m), and confirm that the possibility of cash outflow is considered minimal 
and no provision is required.
b) Contingent liabilities related to joint ventures
The Group has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its joint ventures, amounting to £3.9m at the year end (2008: £15.4m). 
At 30 June 2009, the Group has an obligation to repay £0.9m (2008: £0.9m) of grant monies received by a joint venture upon certain future 
disposals of land. 
The Group also has a number of performance guarantees in respect of its joint ventures, requiring the Group to complete development agreement 
contractual obligations in the event that the joint ventures do not perform what is expected under the terms of the related contracts.
c) Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries and joint ventures
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice as to the 
likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely 
to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligations cannot be made.
i) Incident at Battersea Park Road, London
One of the Company’s principal subsidiaries is BDW Trading Ltd (‘BDW’). On Tuesday 26 September 2006 at Battersea Park Road, London,  
a tower crane supplied to BDW (with operator) by a third party contractor collapsed. The collapse of the crane was not contained within the 
boundaries of the site and the crane operator and a member of the public were killed. In addition, significant damage was caused to a neighbouring 
block of flats and shops which resulted in the evacuation of a number of local residents due to concerns about structural stability. There is an 
ongoing criminal investigation currently being carried out by the London Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive to ascertain 
whether any of the parties involved are criminally liable for manslaughter or under relevant health and safety legislation. Although no assurance  
can be given, the Board has been advised that on the information available as at 22 September 2009, being the last practicable date prior to  
the publication of this Annual Report and Accounts, the risk of a finding of criminal liability against BDW is low. A number of civil claims brought 
against BDW in connection with the same incident have now been settled. All such claims are covered by the Group’s insurance, to the extent  
not recoverable from the third party contractor’s insurers.
ii) Incident at Bedfont Azure Lakes
On 28 February 2008, a resident was found dead and a lodger was found to be in a coma in housing association accommodation at the Bedfont 
Azure Lakes site developed by BDW. Police and Health and Safety Executive investigations commenced immediately into possible manslaughter/
breaches of relevant health and safety legislation. These investigations are ongoing. Claims are being made against BDW by both the housing 
association and by various residents on the estate where the incident occurred as a result of the disruption caused to them by an evacuation of the 
surrounding property, by their gas being turned off and by their premises having to be inspected in order to establish whether there was any wider 
issue with gas installations on the site. Some residents have claimed (retrospectively) that they have suffered some of the symptoms of mild carbon 
monoxide inhalation, such as headaches and dizziness. Given the nature of these various claims, it is too early to determine the full amount of the 
damages claimed, which are currently unquantifiable. The Group is undertaking work to ensure all installations at the site are safe and claims are 
being dealt with by the Group’s insurers, although the extent to which these are covered by the Group’s insurance or the insurance of other parties 
cannot, at present, be clearly ascertained.
35. Related party transactions
a) Remuneration of key personnel
Disclosures related to the remuneration of key personnel as defined in IAS24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ are given in note 9. There is no difference 
between transactions with key management personnel of the Company and the Group. Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009111

b) Disposal of WBD (Atlantic Square) Limited to Capella Developments Limited and Development Management Agreement with Capella 
Consultancy Limited
On 30 June 2008, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, WBD (Atlantic Square) Limited, was sold by Wilson Bowden Developments Limited to 
Capella Developments Limited for total consideration of £4.3m (on a debt and cash free basis). In addition, the Group entered into a Development 
Management Agreement with Capella Consultancy Limited, a sister company of Capella Developments Limited, in respect of the management by 
Capella Consultancy Limited of certain of the Group’s other Scottish properties and interests. The maximum consideration (including in respect of 
certain performance-related incentive arrangements) under the Development Management Agreement is £2.5m.
Capella Developments Limited and Capella Consultancy Limited were related parties of the Barratt Group because, at completion, each company 
was an associate of James Fitzsimons who was a former Director of Wilson Bowden Developments Limited, WBD (Atlantic Square) Limited and 
certain other companies within the Group.
At 30 June 2009, there was no outstanding balance (2008: £nil) due to the Group from either Capella Developments Limited or Capella Consultancy Limited.
c) Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries
The Company has entered into transactions with its subsidiary undertakings in respect of funding and Group services (that include management 
accounting and audit, sales and marketing, IT, company secretarial, architects and purchasing). Recharges are made to the subsidiaries based 
on utilisation of these services.
The amount outstanding to the Company from subsidiary undertakings at 30 June 2009 totalled £1,511.1m (2008: £2,229.3m). There was no 
amount owed by the Company to subsidiary undertakings at 30 June 2009 (2008: £nil).
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Company made management charges to subsidiaries of £22.0m (2008: £27.1m), received interest 
on Group loans from subsidiaries of £171.1m (2008: £102.1m) and received dividends from subsidiaries of £nil (2008: £1,058.4m).
The Company and Group have entered into counter-indemnities in the normal course of business in respect of performance bonds.
d) Transactions between the Group and its joint ventures
The Group has principally entered into transactions with its joint ventures in respect of funding, development management services (with charges 
made based on the utilisation of these services), purchases of land and work in progress and reimbursement of group and consortium tax relief 
(see note 14). These transactions totalled £1.9m (2008: £4.1m), £0.6m (2008: £3.6m), £18.5m (2008: £15.6m) and £nil (2008: £0.2m).
The amount of outstanding loans and interest due to the Group from its joint ventures at 30 June 2009 is disclosed in note 14. The amount of other 
outstanding payables to the Group from its joint ventures at 30 June 2009 totalled £nil (2008: £nil). The amounts outstanding are unsecured and 
will be settled in cash. The Group has also provided bank guarantees to the value of £26.0m (2008: £9.3m) to two of its venturers. No provisions 
have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by the related parties.
36. Post balance sheet events 
a) Additional Executive Share Option Scheme
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employer’s long-term incentive and share option plans it was agreed with Mr D F Thomas that 
he would be granted an one-off award that seeks to target benefits equivalent to the options granted under the ESOS in 2008. In order to satisfy 
this obligation Mr D F Thomas will be granted an option by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust which, if and when exercised, will be satisfied 
from ordinary shares acquired in the market. The option will be over 666,666 ordinary shares at an exercise price per share of 55 pence. The option 
will be subject to the same performance targets as the options granted under the ESOS in 2008 and will be on substantially the same terms and 
conditions as those options.
b) Proposed Placing and Rights Issue
On 23 September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with UBS Limited, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, HSBC Bank plc, 
Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and RBS Hoare Govett Limited to fully underwrite a £720.5m equity issue, to be structured as a Placing and  
a Rights Issue. The Group has also entered into amended financing arrangements which will come into effect upon successful completion of the 
Placing and Rights Issue. Completion of the Placing and Rights Issue is conditional amongst other things upon shareholder approval at a General 
Meeting expected to be held on 19 October 2009. 11 2 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Our business model
Unique  
“patient capture” 
business model
Our well established hospital network allows a seamless  
patient treatment pathway from local doctors to multi-profile  
or specialised hospitals whilst the insurance business  
plays a feeder role in originating and directing patients.
We operate a highly-integrated patient capture business model. Our ambulatory clinics and hospitals are organised in specific geographic clusters to provide services to the broadest range of patients with: • ambulatory clinics offering outpatient services; • community hospitals offering broader outpatient and a range of multi-profile inpatient healthcare services; and • referral hospitals offering a comprehensive range of complex and specialist services.
The referral hierarchy within each geographic cluster provides patients with a complete treatment pathway, from local physicians via ambulatory clinics and community hospitals to general or specialised referral hospitals, optimising utilisation of our facilities and medical personnel. Our specialist ambulances help to achieve this by facilitating the movement of patients between hospitals. 
While we provide most basic (‘‘primary’’) medical and surgical procedures at all of our facilities, the majority of more specialised or advanced (‘‘secondary’’ and ‘‘tertiary’’) interventional and surgical procedures are concentrated at our regional referral hospitals.

Referral hospitals We operate 16 referral hospitals, of which 14 are general hospitals and 2 are specialty hospitals, with a total of 2,209 beds as at 31 December 2015. These hospitals are located in Tbilisi and major regional cities and provide secondary or tertiary level outpatient and inpatient diagnostic, surgical and treatment services. Our referral hospitals, which serve as hubs for patients within a given region, had a 59.3.% bed utilisation and generated 88% of our total healthcare services revenue in 2015. The EBITDA margin for our referral hospitals for 2015 was 28.0%. 
Community hospitals We operate 19 community hospitals with a total of 461 beds as at 31 December 2015. Community hospitals are located in regional towns and municipalities and provide basic outpatient and inpatient diagnostic, surgical and treatment services to the local population. They also refer patients to referral hospitals for secondary or tertiary level treatment. Our community hospitals had a 19.3% bed utilisation and generated 9% of our total healthcare services revenue in 2015. The EBITDA margin for our community hospitals for 2015 was 27.7% 
Ambulatory clinics We operate four ambulatory clusters with a total of ten ambulatory clinics that provide outpatient diagnostic and treatment services. These clinics are located in Tbilisi and major regional cities. Ambulatory clinics generate the highest margin and management believes that this segment of our business will become the largest source of future growth. Our ambulatory clinics generated 3% of our total healthcare services revenue in 2015. The EBITDA margin for our ambulatory clinics for 2015 was 30.5%
We are the largest medical insurance provider in Georgia with a wide distribution network. We offer a variety of medical insurance products. We had approximately 234,000 customers as at 31 December 2015. We offer a wide range of comprehensive private medical insurance policies that customers can opt for instead of relying on the coverage provided under the UHC and other state-funded healthcare programmes and have introduced products that ‘‘top up’’ or supplement the UHC coverage. Our products are offered as corporate packages to large employers and standalone policies for self-paying individuals. Medical insurance generated GEL 55.3 million of revenue in 2015, comprising 22.7% of our total revenue and 4.7% of our total EBITDA. All of this revenue was generated by private medical insurance customers. We operate 11 branches and service centres of our medical insurance business located in a number of cities and towns across Georgia.
On 12 March 2016, GHG signed a legally binding MOU to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of GPC, one of the top three pharmaceutical retailers and wholesalers in Georgia. The acquisition of GPC supports GHG’s expansion strategy and its aim to be the leading integrated player in the Georgian healthcare ecosystem of GEL 3.4 billion aggregate value. It positions GHG as the major purchaser of pharmaceutical products in Georgia, and provides a platform which offers significant synergy potential. For further information, please see GHG’s announcement of the GPC transaction (http://ghg.com.ge/news), which was published on 16 March 2016.

Our strategy
Long-term,
high-growth story
Our long-term growth strategy is focused on achieving a ¹∕ ³ market share by 
both number of beds and revenue, and increasing profitability. 
We believe that we can more than double our 2015 revenue by 2018 
while achieving and maintaining an EBITDA margin of approximately 30%. 
To achieve this, we aim to:
We believe that the implementation of the UHC in Georgia (which 
provides basic healthcare coverage to the entire population), the 
highly fragmented nature of the healthcare services market (whereby 
the top five providers control approximately 40% of the market by 
number of beds, as of 31 December 2015) and existing service gaps 
in both the hospital and ambulatory segments have created 
significant potential for expansion and market share gains for us, 
through organic growth and acquisitions.

Industry and market overview continued
Medical insurance market
From 2007 to 2013, the private insurance 
market expanded significantly with 
total enrolment increasing to 491,885. 
This stands in contrast to 2006 when 
only 40,000 Georgian citizens (or less 
than 1% of the total population) had a 
voluntary medical insurance package, 
most of which were provided as part 
of a corporate benefits programme. 
As of 30 September 2015, 536,014 
voluntary medical insurance packages 
have been reported to the Insurance 
State Supervision Service of Georgia.
Growing awareness of the benefits of 
medical insurance among the population 
in Georgia may lead to greater demand for 
private medical insurance from employers 
and self-paying customers who seek better 
quality of services, quicker treatment, 
or more advanced procedures than are 
covered within the UHC framework.
Competitive landscape
Both state and private healthcare providers 
(ambulatory clinics and hospitals) compete 
in the Georgian market, with private 
providers accounting for the vast majority 
of total supply in the country. The market is 
relatively fragmented, with the five largest 
competitors (all of which are private) 
accounting for only a third of the total 
number of beds. The top 15 participants 
control 58% of capacity. This may 
indicate further growth potential for both 
new and incumbent market participants 
through mergers and acquisitions. The 
ambulatory clinics market is even more 
fragmented and no company controls 
more than a 1% market share, with the 
Company’s own market share at under 
1%, as of 31 December 2015. Therefore, 
further consolidation is likely, as the 
emergence of a large participant in the 
market via mergers and acquisitions.

entire population
Financing 
and top-up 
mechanism
  The UHC is fully financed by the government

leaving substantial room for top-up coverage including in the 
form of private medical insurance policies
Beneficiaries 
and providers
  UHC beneficiaries may select any healthcare provider enrolled 
in the programme

Chairman’s statement
In this letter I would like to focus on four key 
topics:
1. Georgia turns 25;
2. Expansion into pharmaceutical retail and 
wholesale business;
3. Good governance leads to good returns; 
and
4. Management make things happen;
Georgia turns 25:
In 2015 Georgia celebrated its 25th 
anniversary as an independent state. 
Although the country is over three millennia 
old, it was reborn when the Soviet Union 
collapsed in 1991. In its recent history 
Georgia has managed to transform itself 
from a corrupt and failed state into a young 
democracy with a rapidly growing economy, 
supported by a pro-business reforms. Over 
this period of time, GDP per capita has 
increased from US$500 to US$3,700 and, 
over the last 12 years, on the back of the 
reforms, real GDP has grown by average 
of 6%. Let me give you a brief summary 
as to why and how this has happened. 
Georgia’s independence in 1991 turned 
out to be a very expensive economic 
exercise. By 1995, Georgia’s real GDP 
collapsed to 28% of its 1990 level. This 
resulted in desperately poor and lawless 
society with no electricity, no gas, no 
heating, no telecommunication, no 
roads and no healthcare. In the 1990s 
Georgia also fought three civil wars and 
ended up losing 20% of its land. The 
second half of the 1990s was marked by 
declining crime rates, but also widespread 
corruption, weak state institutions and 
continued poverty. Therefore, people of 
Georgia demanded radical change and 
after the Rose Revolution in 2003, the 
new government managed to eradicate 
corruption and initiate pro-business 
reforms, among which was a reduction 
of the number of taxes from 21 to only 
six currently. In addition, the government 
embarked on a mass privatisation process 
while building strong state institutions. In 
2016, the World Bank named Georgia as 
the top reformer globally over the past 12 
years in its Ease of Doing Business Survey. 
The country ranks as one of the least 
corrupt in surveys done by Transparency 
International, and Trace International 
and Georgia is consistently ranked as 
the top performer in country policy and 
institutional assessments compiled by 
different organisations. Supported by a 
corruption-free environment and Ease of 
Doing Business reforms, the flow of foreign 
direct investment (FDI) has remained 
strong, standing at 9.7% of GDP in 2015.
In 2012, Georgia took yet another important 
step towards strengthening its democracy. 
Following parliamentary elections the 
country experienced a democratic and 
peaceful transfer of power – for the first 
time in recent history. The Georgian Dream 
coalition won the election and promised a 
more independent judiciary, an even better 
business environment, free media and 
healthcare for the entire population. In three 
years, the new government has managed 
to deliver on its promises and its healthcare 
reform is widely regarded as one of the 
government’s biggest achievements. The 
newly appointed Prime Minister has put 
forth new reform initiatives to boost growth 
and accelerate foreign investments. These 
new reforms aim to reduce corporate profit 
tax to zero, invest more in infrastructure, 
invest in labour market-driven education 
and create a single touchpoint for 
corporates to deal with the government 
institutions – making it even easier to do 
business in Georgia. The leading political 
parties recognise the need for a good 
business environment to attract FDI, which 
investment continues to play a crucial role 
in the country’s success. FDI (Foreign Direct 
investment) has averaged 10.0% of GDP in 
the past ten years, and with its business-
friendly environment – ease of doing 
business, professional and independent 
state institutions, and a corruption-free 
environment – Georgia is firmly on the 
path to becoming the investment and 
services hub of the region. With visitor 
numbers growing from 560,000 in 2007 to 
nearly 6 million in 2015, Georgia has the 
potential to also become the financial and 
healthcare services hub of the region. 
In this very short period of time, the 
Georgian population has managed to 
develop and grow the country. I have 
Dear Shareholders,
2015 was an eventful year for Georgia 
Healthcare Group. The Company 
successfully completed its public listing 
on the premium segment of the London 
Stock Exchange and raised US$100 million 
to fund its expansion plans. I would like 
to thank all our new shareholders for their 
support throughout the process. The 
capital we raised supports our growth plans 
and our target to double 2015 healthcare 
revenues by 2018, while achieving c.30% 
EBITDA margin. This target will be achieved 
by expanding GHG’s market share in the 
hospital segment by number of beds from 
the current 27% level to c.30%. Following 
the IPO, GHG has already accelerated the 
complete renovation of two hospitals, and 
is in the process of rolling out a nationwide 
chain of ambulatory clinics – the first of 
its kind in the country – where GHG’s 
revenue market share is currently just 1% 
and its aim is to grow this to c.5% by the 
end of 2018. Introducing new services – 
treatments which are currently not available 
in Georgia – will be another contributor to 
this growth. The Company’s own growth 
plans are underpinned by the government’s 
ongoing initiatives to make healthcare more 
accessible to all Georgians. You will be able 
to read about how GHG aims to deliver on 
each of its strategic pillars later in this report. 
2015 was an eventful year for GHG. 
The Company is well positioned to 
deliver on its strategy of doubling its 
2015 healthcare revenues by 2018. 09

been closely observing this remarkable 
transformation and the key take-away 
for me is the following: unless a corrupt 
and dysfunctional state goes fully bust, 
it is difficult to transform it. Once a 
transformation starts, it is difficult to stop it.
Expansion into pharmaceutical retail and 
wholesale business:
In March 2016 we announced one of 
our largest acquisitions and a move that 
marked our expansion into pharmaceutical 
distribution business. Initially, we did not 
actively plan to go into the pharmaceutical 
business Instead we worked on projects 
to independently secure and optimise 
our pharmaceutical supply chain for the 
hospitals, the ambulatory clinics and our 
medical insurance business. However, when 
an opportunity to acquire a pharmaceutical 
distributor presented itself, GHG’s 
management team saw this as a strategic 
fit and since they were able to conclude 
it on very attractive terms, this was to me 
and the Board a “must-do” deal. Subject 
to regulatory approvals, GHG signed a 
binding Memorandum of Understanding to 
acquire GPC, the third largest pharmacy 
chain in Georgia. This move supports our 
aim of being the leading integrated player 
in the Georgian healthcare ecosystem – a 
GEL 3.4 billion market. It positions GHG 
as the major purchaser of pharmaceutical 
products in Georgia. The acquisition price 
of GPC implies 5.7 times EV/EBITDA 
before eliminating unnecessary costs 
and capturing further cost and revenue 
synergies. Post-synergy this is reduced to 
3.3 times. The pharmacy business will be 
highly synergistic both to reduce the cost 
of pharmaceuticals for our hospitals and 
medical insurance business as well as to 
crosssell through GPC’s loyalty programme. 
GPC has c.12 million customer interactions 
per annum, and a strong brand. GHG will 
open GPC pharmacies on the premises 
of its c.40 hospitals and large ambulatory 
clinics, which is expected to significantly 
boost the revenue of GPC. The move is 
strategic and I strongly believe it will create 
huge shareholder value going forward.
Good governance leads to good returns:
We at GHG, strongly believe that great 
institutions are only built with robust 
governance, and that, without it, they 
cannot deliver sustainable value for their 
shareholders. We think that a high-
quality, diverse and independent Board 
is extremely important for the success of 
the Company. We see the Board as an 
institution, which is not only performing its 
fiduciary duties of management oversight 
and strategy setting, but also providing 
guidance and coaching to our top and 
mid-level executive management team. 
In the case of GHG, the Board’s role of 
oversight is made relatively straightforward 
by naturally aligning the interests of the 
shareholders and the management team. 
To achieve this, we award long-term vesting 
shares (up to five years) to the management 
team and ensure that share compensation 
makes up a large proportion (e.g. 80-90%) 
of total annual compensation. In this way, 
we create a long-term alignment between 
the interests of the management team 
and the shareholders. If shareholders 
make money, the management team 
makes money and if the shareholders 
lose money, the management team also 
loses money. With this simple approach, 
in addition to being executives, the 
management team feels and acts more 
like shareholders – because they are. 
Out of nine Board members, seven are 
independent and six are non-BGEO Group 
members. The Board meets every quarter 
to discuss and set strategy, to approve 
key projects and transactions and to 
review and approve recommendations 
from the committees: Audit, Clinical, 
Remuneration and Nomination. 
We have a diverse Board. David Morrison 
is our Senior Independent Board member, 
who also chairs our Audit Committee. He is 
well aware of our fiduciary responsibilities, 
and regulatory obligations, and knows 
very well how checks and balances work 
in a public company. His long tenure at 
Sullivan and Cromwell serves him well in this 
regard. Neil Janin heads our Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. His 
management consulting work for 25 years 
with McKinsey serves the GHG Board and 
management team very well. Neil spends 
time with the management team to help 
them brainstorm on different strategic 
issues and provides invaluable guidance. 
Neil’s management coaching skills and 
out-of-the-box thinking serve both the 
Board and the management well. Both Neil 
and David have an in-depth understanding 
of Georgia, as they have been Board 
members at the BGEO Group for the past 
6 years. Tim Elsigood is our hospital guru. 
He has extensive experience of running 
hospital businesses in Western, Central and 
Eastern Europe, as well as in North Africa. 
Tim knows very well what works and what 
does not work in the hospital business, 
which makes it easy for us to understand 
the strategic priorities for GHG. Dr. Michael 
Anderson heads our Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee. As a doctor, he has 
great input into how to improve the quality 
of our services. Ingeborg Oie, a healthcare 
research analyst and MD at Jefferies and 
a research analyst at Goldman Sachs, 
helps us to better understand investors’ 
ways of thinking and the Company’s long-
term strategy. Jacques Richier, another 
independent director, is CEO of Allianz 
France. His input in making strategic 
decisions for our medical insurance 
business is critical. Allan Hirst’s extensive 
experience as CEO of Citibank in multiple 
countries helps us to better understand our 
government relations strategy. The Board is 
extremely motivated and engaged in making 
GHG a successful institution and ultimately 
creating strong value for shareholders. 
Management make things happen:
Back in 2010 after the global financial crisis, 
Bank of Georgia’s intention was to divest 
its insurance subsidiary to raise capital. At 
the time Nick Gamkrelidze was CEO of our 
insurance company, Aldagi. Before making 
the decision to sell, the Board called in Nick 
to understand his plans in more detail. Nick 
presented the strategy of entering into the 
healthcare services sector, consolidating it 
and integrating it with our existing medical 
insurance business. The healthcare sector 
was ten times larger than the insurance 
sector and totally fragmented. The Board 
was convinced by Nick that investing 
in the healthcare business presented a 
much bigger opportunity than raising 
money from its divestment. Indeed, after 
embarking on the healthcare strategy, in 
less than five years Nick successfully led the 
transformation of a loss making company 
into a business with a market capitalisation 
of US$350 million following last year’s 
successful IPO. Nick is a visionary leader, 
with great execution skills. He learns fast 
and develops even faster, and he has not 
been shy to surround himself with a team 
of top class executives. The management 
team of GHG is young, smart, energetic, 
and gets things done in a fast and efficient 
manner. The management team has 
demonstrated that it can grow the business 
organically as well as through acquisitions. 
In the past five years the management 
team has completed over 30 successful 
acquisitions and integrations. Identifying 
and eliminating unnecessary costs and 
extracting synergies is in the DNA of this 
organisation. In Georgia, we do not have 
middle names, but if GHG’s management 
team had one it would be “efficiency”.
The management team at GHG is extremely 
motivated to develop themselves, the 
Company and the country’s healthcare 
system. Together with all the employees 
of GHG, they are not only building a 
great Company, but more importantly 
raising the standard of healthcare in the 
country. I am extremely honoured to have 
the opportunity to serve as Chairman of 
this great institution – one that we aim 
soon to be a billion Dollar company.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
2015 capped an extraordinary 
two-year growth period for 
Georgia Healthcare Group.
During the course of 2014 and 2015, the Group 
grew its operations substantially further becoming 
clear market leader among healthcare services 
and medical insurance providers in Georgia.
quarter of 2016 onwards, due to reduced 
expenditure on interest – we repaid GEL 
104.4 million borrowings at the end of 2015/
beginning of 2016, from IPO proceeds. 
This reduced total borrowings to GEL 
105.6 million as at 31 January 2016. As 
a result, our net debt to EBITDA was 
zero at the end of 2015, since cash and 
bank deposits exceeded borrowings.
Revenue, at GEL 242.7 million for the year, 
increased by 22.5% y-o-y, supported in 
particular by strong 17.3% organic growth 
in the Healthcare Services business, where 
revenue increased by 32.5% to GEL 195.0 
million. Margins in the Healthcare Services 
business also improved significantly 
with an EBITDA margin for the year of 
27.4%, compared to 24.3% in 2014. This 
improvement reflects the increasing 
utilisation and scale of our business as 
well as the capturing of ongoing efficiency 
savings and procurement benefits from the 
integration of recently acquired hospitals. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, this margin 
increased further to 29.8%, towards our 
target of c.30% EBITDA margin. We benefit 
significantly from our economies of scale 
and this was reflected in 14.8 percentage 
points of positive operating leverage 
during the year. We expect to deliver 
strong levels of organic growth in 2016, 
as we have done in previous years, with 
margins enhanced year-on-year together 
with positive operating leverage, which 
is one of the metrics we follow closely.
The increased focus on the Universal 
Healthcare Programme in Georgia has 
seen a substantial shift in revenue towards 
the healthcare services market, leading 
to a significant industry-wide reduction 
in medical insurance revenue from the 
previous State Insurance Programme 
(SIP). As a result, our medical insurance 
business experienced a 20.8% reduction 
in revenue during the year. Against this 
backdrop, it delivered an extremely resilient 
performance by refocusing on the private 
medical insurance market, where we 
grew our revenues by 32.0% as a result of 
introducing a differentiated product suite 
and improved pricing. Costs remained well 
managed and the combined ratio improved 
by 2.8 percentage points during the year 
to 96.7%. EBITDA from the insurance 
business more than doubled to GEL 2.6 
million. Net profit increased by 76.4% to 
GEL 1.8 million. Price increases to a number 
of insurance products (in response to the 
impact of the Lari devaluation in 2015) 
leaves the business in good shape for 2016. 
Apart from focusing on capturing further 
benefits of scale, the main Key Performance 
Indicator (KPI) for our insurance business 
in 2016 will be capturing more synergies 
with our high margin outpatient business 
and retaining at least twice as much claims 
within our own outpatient network.
We made significant progress in each of 
our strategic priorities during the year. 
At our healthcare services business, we 
continued to expand significantly in the 
At the end of 2015, we had 35 hospitals 
with 2,670 hospital beds representing a 
substantially increased market share of 
26.6% of Georgia’s total hospital beds. In 
addition, in 2015 we began to implement 
our ambulatory clinic strategy to develop 
a nationwide chain of ambulatory clinics, 
and have already opened four clusters of 
ambulatory clinics by the end of 2015. 
In November 2015, following our listing 
on the Premium Segment of the London 
Stock Exchange, we also became the 
first Georgian company outside of the 
financial sector with shares trading on 
an international stock market. As part of 
this process, we raised c.US$100 million 
for further investment in the development 
of the business over the next two-three 
years. Recently we also become a 
member of the FTSE All Share Index.
The 2015 results clearly reflect these 
significant developments and I am pleased 
to report a net profit of GEL 23.6 million, 
a 78.1% increase year-on-year. This profit 
was achieved despite the impact of a 
currency exchange adjustment relating 
to the proceeds received from the capital 
raise and before the positive impact of 
utilising some of the proceeds to reduce 
the Group’s existing indebtedness. 
Adjusting for these two issues, our run-rate 
net profit for the fourth quarter of 2015 
was GEL 9.5 million, or GEL 28.0 million 
for the full year. We expect significant 
improvement in our earnings from the first  11

higher revenue hospital segments in Tbilisi 
with the acquisition, in August 2015, of 
the High Technology Medical Centre 
University Clinic (HTMC). This acquisition 
of the single largest hospital and former 
competitor in the country increased our 
market share by hospital beds to 26.6%, 
as well as enabling us to be represented in 
the higher margin diagnostics and oncology 
segments in Tbilisi. Furthermore, we have 
already started renovation work on both 
our, Deka and Sunstone hospital facilities. 
These two newly modernised multi-profile 
hospitals are expected to be fully completed 
and operational in 2017. Our strategy to 
increase our share of healthcare revenues 
through the roll-out of a national network 
of ambulatory clinics has begun. By the 
end of January 2016 we had opened four 
ambulatory clusters in a number densely 
populated areas of Tbilisi and one in Kutaisi, 
the second largest city in Georgia. We 
plan to open at least six further ambulatory 
clusters in Tbilisi and other major cities in 
Georgia during 2016. This is an extremely 
significant growth opportunity for the Group 
over the next few years; we plan to build 
significant market share in what is a highly-
fragmented and high-margin segment of 
a market in which we currently have only 
approximately 1% share of the market. 
We have recently moved into the pharma 
business by agreeing to acquire a 100% 
equity stake in JSC GPC (“GPC”) (the 
acquisition remains subject to relevant 
regulatory approvals). GPC is the third 
largest pharmaceutical retailer and 
wholesaler in Georgia, and its acquisition 
clearly fits our strategy to be the leading 
integrated player in the Georgian healthcare 
eco-system. It positions us as a major 
purchaser of pharmaceutical products 
in Georgia and offers very important 
synergies to capture through decreased 
cost of goods sold in our services business. 
Moreover, GPC’s strong customer loyalty 
franchise, with one million monthly customer 
interactions and 0.5 million members of 
its loyalty programs, is expected to feed 
referrals to GHG’s ambulatory clinics, further 
enhancing our existing “patient capture” 
model. In this letter I would also like to 
welcome GPC’s management team and 
more than 1,600 employees to our Group.
The breadth and depth of the expertise 
and persistent efforts of our senior and 
middle management team have been 
instrumental in delivering our growth 
strategy and we remain firmly on track to 
more than double 2015 healthcare services 
revenues by 2018. Healthcare services 
revenue increased by 32.5% year-on-year 
in 2015 with organic revenue growth of 
more than 17%, which was supplemented 
by the impact of acquisitions completed 
over the last few years. In addition to the 
significant business opportunities available 
over the next few years, we continue to 
expect the overall Georgian healthcare 
services market revenue to grow at a 
compound rate that exceeds 13% per 
annum during the 2014-18 period. 
There are still many service gaps in Georgia 
which, as the largest provider of healthcare 
services in the country, GHG is focused 
on covering. In 2015 we successfully 
introduced new services to the country 
including liver transplant surgery, children’s 
cardiosurgery, oncologic radiotherapy 
in western Georgia and many other 
services. There is still a significant pipeline 
of similar services to explore and our 
team is constantly working to close these 
service gaps so as to enable us to fulfill 
our mission to provide Georgian citizens 
with access to high-quality healthcare 
services without leaving the country. 
Recruiting and retaining highly skilled 
personnel, both on senior as well as middle 
level, is one of our top priorities, considering 
the growth dynamics and current gaps 
in certain fields in Georgia. Therefore we 
will be further working on development 
and expansion of our management bench 
in 2016 to support our growth plans. 
We particularly focus on the training and 
education of our staff, as well as sourcing 
a new generation of medical personnel. 
We remain the only healthcare institution in 
Georgia to have in-house training of our own 
personnel. Since the beginning of 2014, we 
have invested over GEL 3.0 million in training 
and have a dedicated staff of 45 trainers, 
largely focusing on the areas of nursing and 
critical care. Developing a new generation of 
nurses and doctors is high on our agenda; 
to address this we facilitated the opening 
of a nursing college at the leading medical 
university in Georgia and have launched 
residency programmes in over ten fields. 
Both of these initiatives are fully operational 
now and we expect the young generation 
of doctors and nurses to further improve 
the quality of care for our patients.
In the medical insurance business, we plan 
to leverage opportunities from the reform of 
the Georgian healthcare sector to increase 
our private medical insurance customer 
base. During 2015, we increased our market 
share from 36.0% to 38.4%, whilst growing 
our revenues from private medical insurance 
products by 32%. There are significant 
synergies between our healthcare services 
and medical insurance businesses and the 
insurance business is playing a significant 
role in our ambulatory business expansion 
strategy. During 2015, for example, only 
GEL 3.5 million or 33.7% of total ambulatory 
claims was paid to ambulatory clinics 
within the Group. We expect that this 
number should double at least in 2016. 
From a macroeconomic perspective, 
Georgia’s performance has been 
remarkably resilient against the challenging 
backdrop in which many of Georgia’s 
regional trading partners have suffered 
economically as a result of falling oil 
prices. During 2015, Georgia delivered real 
GDP growth of 2.8%, whilst inflation was 
maintained below the 5% target range. 
Foreign Direct Investment continued to be 
strong; tourist numbers – a significant driver 
of US$ inflows for the country – continue 
to rise and, as a result, the Georgian 
Government’s fiscal position continues 
to be strong. The Universal Healthcare 
Programme remains a significant priority 
for the Government and Government 
expenditure on healthcare will increase 
by 81.4% from GEL 487.9 million in 2013 
to GEL 885.0 million in 2016 according to 
the approved government budget. This 
ongoing increase in expected Government 
healthcare spending underpins the 
substantial organic growth opportunities 
for the Group. The Government’s 
budgeted spend on healthcare, however 
still remains low compared to many other 
countries at just over 2% of GDP and 
approximately 7% of annual tax revenues.
As a result Georgia Healthcare Group is 
in extremely good shape to benefit over 
the next few years from the combination 
of its position as the largest healthcare 
services and medical insurance provider in 
the fast-growing, predominantly privately-
owned, Georgian healthcare services 
market. We have grown rapidly in recent 
years, driven by the significant organic 
expansion of existing facilities, and by 
selectively acquiring and integrating a 
number of complementary businesses 
and assets. We expect the Government to 
continue to prioritise healthcare services 
and this, combined with both organic 
and further acquisition opportunities, 
leaves the Group well positioned to deliver 
strong growth in 2016 and beyond.

Highly experienced management team with proven track record
Our Board of Directors and senior management team includes 
individuals with extensive experience in relevant fields including 
healthcare entrepreneurship and management, strategy and legal 
advisory, national healthcare policy setting, healthcare research 
analysis, financial services and advisory. 
Overview of key historical milestones
1
This team includes individuals who have 
held leading roles at institutions such 
as McKinsey & Company, JP Morgan 
Chase, EBRD, Sullivan & Cromwell, Bank 
of Georgia Holdings, Citibank, Smith & 
Nephew, Jefferies, Capio UK, Chelsea 
and Westminster Hospital, Allianz, EY and 
AstraZeneca, among others. Our senior 
management team have an average of 
11 years of management experience 
in the healthcare services and medical 
insurance markets and have implemented 
numerous strategic initiatives that have 
been integral to our continued growth. 
The senior management team is 
supported by executives and management 
personnel comprised of physicians and 
professional managers with extensive 
industry experience and expertise and, 
in many cases, long-standing experience 
in the healthcare or insurance industry. 
In particular, to ensure high clinical 
standards the Company has recruited 
select clinicians with extensive prior 
experience with leading western institutions 
such as the Division of Neonatology, 
University of Kentucky, the Oldenburg 
Cardio Surgery Centre (Germany), Treviso 
Regional Hospital General (Italy) and the 
Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chicago).
The market knowledge and experience 
of our management team is instrumental 
to our structured approach to both 
organic growth and acquisitions. Our 
strong business management team has 
increased market share by beds from 
under 1% in 2009 to 26.6% currently, 
with additional organic development 
capacity of up to approximately 30% 
from hospital renovations planned during 
2016 and 2017. Since the opening of our 
first ambulatory clinic in 2006 we have 
acquired and integrated 25 hospitals and 
ambulatory clinics and built or renovated 
a further ten facilities. We have grown our 
asset base from GEL 109.2 million (as at 
31 December 2011) to GEL 758.3 million 
(as at 31 December 2015) and added 1,495 
beds. For each acquisition or development, 
we form a multi-disciplinary integration team 
of senior executives covering the healthcare 
services and engineering, operations, 
finance, human resources, public relations, 
commercial and sales and legal functions. 
The team monitors and coordinates the 
integration process following established 
procedures. After completing the more 
immediate tasks of integrating financial 
systems and human resources, we focus 
on modernisation and the assessment 
and standardisation of service quality.

Georgia
N° 1
Reformer 2005-2012  
(WB Doing Business Report)
Notably, the ambulatory market is highly 
fragmented, with no single player having 
more than 1% of the market.
• Currently, service gaps exist in a number 
of basic diagnostics areas and 
treatments, such as MRI, laparoscopic 
surgeries, oncology, paediatrics, 
neonatology, intensive care, cardiology, 
and rehabilitation services.
Healthcare service providers (both state 
and private) generate revenue from out-of-
pocket payments (including fee-for-service 
and UHC co-payments), transfers from state 
healthcare programmes and payments 
from private medical insurance companies. 
Medical insurance companies depend on 
revenues from medical insurance policies 
purchased by employers for their employees 
and by individuals for their own use.
GDP growth expected to continue
Healthcare services spending per capita 
is currently at a very low base of only 
US$217, with annual outpatient encounters 
of only 3.5 per capita and hospital bed 
utilisation of only 50%, all significantly 
lower than many comparable countries. 
Supportive government reforms and 
the engagement of private players in 
the sector have resulted in significant

Ease of Doing Business  
(WB-IFC Doing Business Report 2016)
While the Georgian government is the main 
source of hospital service financing in the 
country, total government expenditure 
on health is very low at 2.7% of GDP, 
compared to the 5.0% benchmark set by 
peer countries, which leaves significant 
room for growth. The Georgian healthcare 
industry has undergone a number of 
reforms and transformations during the 
last two decades. Favourable government 
policy has resulted in the following: 
• The privatisation and renovation of 
nationwide healthcare infrastructure (of 
total nationwide hospital bed capacity, 
over 60% is new and only under 20% is 
in the public sector), including both 
‘‘bricks and mortar’’ buildings and 
medical equipment, replacing rundown 
Soviet-era facilities.
• Increased access to healthcare through 
the Universal Healthcare Programme, 
which has provided basic healthcare 
coverage to the entire population since 
2013. According to the IMF, this reform 
should improve healthcare outcomes 
and is estimated to add 1% of GDP per 
year to existing healthcare costs, making 
healthcare the largest area of reform in 
the country.
Georgia has one of the lowest per capita 
expenditures on healthcare in the EU and the 
CIS. Management believes that there are

Outlook and main growth drivers
As described above, the Georgian 
healthcare services market has shown 
double-digit growth in recent years and is 
forecast to reach GEL 3.1 billion by 2018. 
The hospitals segment accounts for 57% 
of all revenues generated in the market 
(as of 2014). According to forecasts by 
Frost & Sullivan, the hospitals segment 
is expected to grow at a compound 
annual growth rate of 11.3% from 2014 
to 2018 to reach GEL 1.6 billion. The 
ambulatory clinics segment is forecast to 
outpace the total market at a compound 
annual growth rate of 15.9% from 2014 
to 2018 to reach GEL 1.4 billion by 2018. 
The main growth drivers for healthcare 
services in Georgia are the following:
• Improving infrastructure to support 
demand. Continued investment in 
healthcare infrastructure, mainly by 
private healthcare providers that are 
continuing to expand their businesses to 
address the growing demand for quality 
medical care from the population. This 
has included modernising Soviet-era 
hospitals, upgrading medical 
technologies, facilitating easier access to 
healthcare and the addition of over 150

Capacity-wise Georgia stands 
alongside US, UK and Turkey
With significant room for optimisation in terms of service quality, 
as indicated by:
Under five mortality rate… … and life expectancy at birth
new hospitals between 2007 and 2013 
(with approximately 60% under private 
ownership). These developments also 
reflect an inflow of investments from 
strategic financial investors into the 
market given its high-growth potential. 
An increase in demand and 
hospitalisation rates is also expected as 
a result of the growing availability of 
affordable quality healthcare services, 
improving diagnostic services and 
increasing healthcare awareness in 
Georgia. By way of an example, 
according to analysis by Frost & Sullivan, 
the hospitalisation rate per 100,000 
people in Georgia for cardiovascular 
diseases was 2.5 times lower than in EU 
countries, which indicates a large 
number of undiagnosed or untreated 
conditions. The resulting growth in 
hospitalisation rates could drive 
efficiency in inpatient facilities. Utilisation 
of beds in Georgia, as measured by bed 
occupancy rates, has the potential to 
increase by between 20 to 30%. 
• Supportive government healthcare 
policies. Since its introduction in March 
2013, the UHC has provided the entire 
population with access to quality 
healthcare and is expected to help 
increase demand for medical care, 
particularly hospital services. In addition, 
The Georgian government has been 
steadily increasing the budget that it 
allocates to healthcare, including to the 
UHC and specific, disease-oriented, 
vertical programmes. According to 
budget announcements by the Georgian 
Ministry of Finance, healthcare spending 
is expected to amount to 885 million in 
2016, of which the addressable market 
for private healthcare providers (like 
GHG) is GEL 668.1 million, including GEL 
570 million for the UHC and GEL 98.1 
million for other healthcare programmes 
financed by the state, in addition to 
the UHC.
• Until September 2014, the majority of 
drugs in Georgia were sold without a 
prescription. Since then, the government 
has introduced prescription requirements 
for over 6,000 types of medicines, 
including antibiotics, cardiovascular, 
hormonal, endocrine and oncology 
products that account for more than 
50% of medicines registered in Georgia. 
This initiative should increase demand for 
outpatient visits and should reduce the 
widespread practice of self-treatment. 
• Analysis by Frost & Sullivan suggests 
that the extension of the UHC to cover 
ambulatory care, amendments to 
pharmaceutical regulations and 
increasing healthcare awareness in 
Georgia are all likely to contribute to 
the growth in outpatient visits in the 
coming years.
• Double digit growth in healthcare 
expenditure. Total healthcare 
expenditure in Georgia increased by 
almost seven times between 2000 and 
2012. However, on a per capita basis, 
healthcare spending remains low 
compared to certain emerging market 
peers, pointing to further growth 
potential. At the same time, economic 
growth and rising disposable incomes of 
Georgian citizens, including in the 
regions outside Tbilisi, will also lead to 
higher spending on healthcare services, 
particularly in consideration of the 
potential growth of ‘‘top up’’ medical 
insurance to supplement basic UHC 
coverage and the increase of corporate 
medical insurance plans for employees. 
Improving facilities and standards have 
the potential to develop health tourism by 
attracting citizens of neighbouring 
countries and, conversely, retaining 
Georgians currently seeking 
treatment overseas.
• Rapidly growing healthcare services 
market. Historically high growth in the 
Georgian healthcare services market is 
expected to continue, supported by both 
the hospital and ambulatory clinic 
segments. Increasing health awareness 
and quality of services will lead to growth 
in demand for diagnostics. Between 
2010 and 2013, the number of laboratory 
tests increased by 45%, from 5.5 million 
to 8 million. The number of advanced 
diagnostic tests, including medical 
imaging, is also increasing. In the same 
period, the number of computer 
tomography (CT) examinations has 
grown by 38% to almost 40,000. There 
has also been a growing demand for 
surgery and, in particular, advanced 
procedures—the overall number of 
surgeries performed is increasing by 9% 
annually in Georgia, which illustrates the 
growing demand for (and greater ability 
to deliver) such surgeries. In 2013 alone, 
the number of hip and knee 
replacements increased by 46% and the 
number of heart surgeries by 29% 
(Source: NCDC).
• Favourable demographics. The country 
has an ageing population, with an 
increasing proportion of its citizens aged 
over 60 who will require more frequent, 
better and prolonged healthcare 
treatments. Increasing incidence of 
certain lifestyle-related diseases (in 
particular, hypertension, ischemic heart 
diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and 
diabetes) will also boost demand for 
medical care. In addition, healthy fertility 
rates will drive demand for obstetric and 
child care services.

Universal healthcare programme
In March 2013, the UHC was introduced 
to address high private healthcare costs in 
Georgia. The UHC also supplemented and 
eventually replaced the existing two SIPs, 
making state-sponsored health coverage 
available on a significantly larger scale. The 
UHC is a government-funded healthcare 
programme that provides basic healthcare 
coverage to the entire population, including 
more than two million people who had never 
held medical insurance and purchased 
healthcare services only on an out-of-
pocket basis. Unlike the preceding SIPs, 
the UHC is not an insurance product but 
an undertaking by the government to 
reimburse healthcare providers directly for 
the delivery of treatment to patients. The 
programme is subject to certain limits and 
service and coverage exclusions, beyond 
which patients have to fund treatment 
on an out-of-pocket basis or rely on 
private medical insurance coverage. 
The key principles of the UHC programme 
are as follows:
• The UHC covers basic outpatient 
elective services most emergency care 
services, and elective inpatient services, 
subject to certain limits. 
• The UHC is fully financed by the 
government from tax revenues and 
administered by the Social Service 
Agency (SSA)—a body under the 
Georgian Ministry of Labour, Health and 
Social Affairs). In most cases, 
beneficiaries have an annual limit of GEL 
15,000 for planned procedures. For 
emergency admissions, the limit is GEL 
15,000 per incident for all individuals, 
except those from certain socially 
vulnerable groups and children under 
six. For planned procedures, patients are 
required to obtain approval from the SSA 
prior to treatment. These thresholds limit 
the services that a patient can access 
and result in the need for co-payments 
by patients for elective services and 
certain emergency services. There is 
a maximum two-month waiting time 
to obtain approval for elective 
inpatient services. 
• UHC beneficiaries are entitled to select 
any healthcare provider of their choice 
provided it is enrolled in the programme 
as a provider of the requested service.
• Any provider, whether private or state, is 
eligible to participate in the programme.
Pricing, reimbursement and settlement 
of services under the UHC programme
The actual prices that are charged to 
patients by healthcare providers are not 
regulated by the state. However, the 
reimbursement paid by the SSA to the 
healthcare providers under the UHC 
differs depending on the type of service 
provided and the location of the facility 
(in some cases reimbursement rates are 
higher in Tbilisi than in the regions). 
Healthcare service gaps
Despite significant reforms to the Georgian 
healthcare system, a number of healthcare 
service gaps remain, particularly in relation 
to the medical equipment available 
and the laboratory services provided in 
Georgia. There are limited numbers of 
the following items of medical equipment: 
magnetic resonance imaging machines 
(only three units in West Georgia), linear 
accelerator units (only six units in Georgia), 
gamma knife units (only one unit in West 
Georgia), positron emission tomography 
computers (only one unit in Georgia), 
cardiac catheterisation laboratories 
(limited availability outside of Tbilisi). 
There are also shortages in Georgia of 
the following equipment: laparoscopic 
instruments, equipment for interventional 
endoscopy including endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography, microwave 
tissue ablation systems, arthroscopes, 
choledocoscopes, muscle reinnervation 
systems, intraoperative ultrasound probes, 
vacuum machines, Flowtron mechanical 
compression units, and pH meter units. 
In addition, the Georgian healthcare 
system suffers from limited provision of the 
following laboratory services: no dedicated 
pathology laboratories for certain tests 
(samples are often sent abroad for testing), 
limited paediatric oncology services, 
limited rehabilitation services, no suitable 
IVF centres, no bone marrow transplant 
facilities, no molecular laboratories and 
no suitable genetic laboratories.

Medical insurance market
From 2007 to 2013, the private insurance 
market expanded significantly with 
total enrolment increasing to 491,885. 
This stands in contrast to 2006 when 
only 40,000 Georgian citizens (or less 
than 1% of the total population) had a 
voluntary medical insurance package, 
most of which were provided as part 
of a corporate benefits programme. 
As of 30 September 2015, 536,014 
voluntary medical insurance packages 
have been reported to the Insurance 
State Supervision Service of Georgia.
Growing awareness of the benefits of 
medical insurance among the population 
in Georgia may lead to greater demand for 
private medical insurance from employers 
and self-paying customers who seek better 
quality of services, quicker treatment, 
or more advanced procedures than are 
covered within the UHC framework.
Competitive landscape
Both state and private healthcare providers 
(ambulatory clinics and hospitals) compete 
in the Georgian market, with private 
providers accounting for the vast majority 
of total supply in the country. The market is 
relatively fragmented, with the five largest 
competitors (all of which are private) 
accounting for only a third of the total 
number of beds. The top 15 participants 
control 58% of capacity. This may 
indicate further growth potential for both 
new and incumbent market participants 
through mergers and acquisitions. The 
ambulatory clinics market is even more 
fragmented and no company controls 
more than a 1% market share, with the 
Company’s own market share at under 
1%, as of 31 December 2015. Therefore, 
further consolidation is likely, as the 
emergence of a large participant in the 
market via mergers and acquisitions.

Unique  
“patient capture” 
business model
Our well established hospital network allows a seamless  
patient treatment pathway from local doctors to multi-profile  
or specialised hospitals whilst the insurance business  
plays a feeder role in originating and directing patients.
We operate a highly-integrated patient capture business model. 
Our ambulatory clinics and hospitals are organised in specific 
geographic clusters to provide services to the broadest range of 
patients with: 
• ambulatory clinics offering outpatient services;
• community hospitals offering broader outpatient and a range of 
multi-profile inpatient healthcare services; and
• referral hospitals offering a comprehensive range of complex and 
specialist services.
The referral hierarchy within each geographic cluster provides 
patients with a complete treatment pathway, from local physicians 
via ambulatory clinics and community hospitals to general or 
specialised referral hospitals, optimising utilisation of our facilities 
and medical personnel. Our specialist ambulances help to achieve 
this by facilitating the movement of patients between hospitals. 
While we provide most basic (‘‘primary’’) medical and surgical 
procedures at all of our facilities, the majority of more specialised or 
advanced (‘‘secondary’’ and ‘‘tertiary’’) interventional and surgical 
procedures are concentrated at our regional referral hospitals.

hospitals, which serve as hubs for patients within a given region, had 
a 59.3.% bed utilisation and generated 88% of our total healthcare 
services revenue in 2015. The EBITDA margin for our referral 
hospitals for 2015 was 28.0%. 
Community hospitals
We operate 19 community hospitals with a total of 461 beds as at 
31 December 2015. Community hospitals are located in regional 
towns and municipalities and provide basic outpatient and inpatient 
diagnostic, surgical and treatment services to the local population. 
They also refer patients to referral hospitals for secondary or tertiary 
level treatment. Our community hospitals had a 19.3% bed utilisation 
and generated 9% of our total healthcare services revenue in 2015. 
The EBITDA margin for our community hospitals for 2015 was 27.7% 
Ambulatory clinics
We operate four ambulatory clusters with a total of ten ambulatory 
clinics that provide outpatient diagnostic and treatment services. 
These clinics are located in Tbilisi and major regional cities. 
Ambulatory clinics generate the highest margin and management 
believes that this segment of our business will become the largest 
source of future growth. Our ambulatory clinics generated 3% of our 
total healthcare services revenue in 2015. The EBITDA margin for our 
ambulatory clinics for 2015 was 30.5%
We are the largest medical insurance provider in Georgia with a wide 
distribution network. We offer a variety of medical insurance 
products. We had approximately 234,000 customers as at 
31 December 2015. We offer a wide range of comprehensive private 
medical insurance policies that customers can opt for instead of 
relying on the coverage provided under the UHC and other 
state-funded healthcare programmes and have introduced products 
that ‘‘top up’’ or supplement the UHC coverage. Our products are 
offered as corporate packages to large employers and standalone 
policies for self-paying individuals. Medical insurance generated GEL 
55.3 million of revenue in 2015, comprising 22.7% of our total 
revenue and 4.7% of our total EBITDA. All of this revenue was 
generated by private medical insurance customers. We operate 11 
branches and service centres of our medical insurance business 
located in a number of cities and towns across Georgia.
On 12 March 2016, GHG signed a legally binding MOU to acquire 
100% of the issued share capital of GPC, one of the top three 
pharmaceutical retailers and wholesalers in Georgia. The acquisition 
of GPC supports GHG’s expansion strategy and its aim to be the 
leading integrated player in the Georgian healthcare ecosystem of 
GEL 3.4 billion aggregate value. It positions GHG as the major 
purchaser of pharmaceutical products in Georgia, and provides a 
platform which offers significant synergy potential. For further 
information, please see GHG’s announcement of the GPC 
transaction (http://ghg.com.ge/news), which was published on 
16 March 2016.

Our strategy
Our long-term growth strategy is focused on achieving a ¹∕
³
 market share by 
both number of beds and revenue, and increasing profitability. 
We believe that the implementation of the UHC in Georgia (which 
provides basic healthcare coverage to the entire population), the 
highly fragmented nature of the healthcare services market (whereby 
the top five providers control approximately 40% of the market by 
number of beds, as of 31 December 2015) and existing service gaps 
in both the hospital and ambulatory segments have created 
significant potential for expansion and market share gains for us, 
through organic growth and acquisitions.

We believe that we can more than double our 2015 revenue by 2018, 
while achieving and maintaining an EBITDA Margin of approximately 
30%. To achieve this, we aim to:
• capture one third of the Georgian hospital market, where we had 
a 26.6% market share by number of beds, as of 31 December 
2015, through a combination of organic growth and the 
integration of recently acquired hospitals, mainly focusing on 
Tbilisi. We plan to increase our market share in the fast-growing, 
highly fragmented and underpenetrated outpatient market (where 
no company controls more than a 1% market share, with the 
Company’s own market share at under 1%, as of 31 December 
2015), through the launch of 20-30 ambulatory clinics within the 
next two to three years;
• invest in medical equipment, utilising existing service gaps, 
particularly in oncology, high tech diagnostics, laboratory, and 
specialist services;
• continue to lead the market in the quality of our medical care;
• drive margin improvements through operational efficiency and 
utilisation levels in our facilities; and
• maintain our existing market share in medical insurance and triple 
our 2015 self-pay insurance revenue.
We believe that our commitment to an integrated business  
model will allow us to continue to maximise operating efficiencies 
and synergies between our healthcare and medical  
insurance businesses. 25

up to c.500 beds that GHG aims to develop in 2016-17, which will bring our overall market share to c.30%
Expand through the development  
of hospitals, focusing predominantly 
on Tbilisi.
We are the single largest market participant, accounting for 26.6% of 
total hospital bed capacity in the country, as of 31 December 2015, 
which is more than five times higher than our nearest competitor, 
Gudushauri-Chachava. Our market share is expected to grow to 
30.0% as a result of the renovation of recently acquired hospital 
facilities, scheduled for completion in 2016 and 2017 (approximately 
500 additional beds). We have a market share of 18% by hospital 
revenue, as at 31 December 2015. We also have the widest 
geographic coverage network relative to our competitors, with 
facilities currently located in six regions covering three quarters of the 
4.5 million population of Georgia.
We aim to add approximately 1,000 hospital beds between 2015 and 
2018 (including the 530 beds obtained as part of the acquisitions of 
HMTC Hospital and Deka Hospital), predominantly in Tbilisi, through 
green field or brown field development. We have identified a focused 
portfolio of new build, brown field and green field opportunities in 
currently under served districts of Tbilisi or where there is specific 
potential due to our competitors’ weaknesses.
In particular, we plan to establish a general hospital in East Tbilisi  
by renovating and developing the existing Sunstone hospital.  
We purchased this property, a long established and well known 
hospital in Tbilisi that has not been fully operational for several years, 
in 2014. This provides us with access to patients in the East Tbilisi 
district, as well as referrals from East Georgia, and has an estimated 
total development capacity of 332 beds. We will also continue to 
integrate HTMC Hospital, which we acquired in August 2015. HTMC 
Hospital is a 450 bed major and well-established referral hospital in 
Tbilisi that is also the single largest hospital in Georgia. We also plan 
to renovate an additional hospital in Tbilisi, which we acquired from 
Deka in June 2015. This hospital has a potential 310 bed capacity and 
is located in a prime location in Tbilisi.
Additionally, although the Group has completed the main acquisition 
phase of its development and does not depend on further 
acquisitions, we will continue to assess acquisition targets 
opportunistically to strengthen our position in the market for multi-
profile referral hospitals in other districts of Tbilisi. Having multi-profile 
referral hospitals in other districts will complement our strategy of 
developing clusters of ambulatory clinics throughout the city. 26 

Increase market share through the 
launch of new ambulatory clinics 
across Tbilisi.
We are establishing a network of ambulatory clinics in Tbilisi to 
access a much patient base and help increase physician referrals to 
our hospitals. The development of this ambulatory network will 
enable us to capitalise on the high-growth potential of higher margin 
ambulatory services and develop the ambulatory clinic network as a 
feeder for our hospital network. Furthermore, we receive higher 
margins for the provision of services in Tbilisi compared to the 
regions and reimbursement rates under the UHC are higher in Tbilisi 
than in the regions, which will further enhance the profitability of our 
healthcare services business. We intend to take advantage of the 
gap between the average number of outpatient visits per capita, 
which in Georgia is the lowest in the region at 3.5, compared to 8.9 
in the CIS and 7.7 in the EU as at 31 December 2013.
We are in the process of developing networks of ambulatory clinics 
that are organised in cluster models, whereby each cluster includes 
a district ambulatory clinic, located centrally in a particular district of 
the city, and three to five smaller express ambulatory clinics, located 
in other areas of the same district. Currently we operate ten 
ambulatory clinics organized in four ambulatory clusters, of which 
three ambulatory clusters were opened towards the end of 2015. In 
total five ambulatory clinics were added during 2015. At least six 
more ambulatory clusters are expected to be opened in 2016.
Our new district ambulatory clinics provide the widest range of 
services available in Tbilisi. Most specialist services are provided on 
a full time basis and also include a small operating theatre and beds 
for outpatient services, chemotherapy and diagnostics services, 
including computer tomography scanning. A typical district 
ambulatory clinic occupies an area of 1,800-2,500 m
2
 and is open 
six days a week during normal working hours (from 10:00 am  
to 8:00 pm).
Our new express ambulatory clinics primarily provide general 
primary care physician outpatient services, with specialist services 
provided on a part time basis. Their diagnostics capabilities also 
incorporate clinical laboratories (which will collect samples locally 
and use referral laboratories to perform tests), ultrasound and ECG. 
Express ambulatory clinics are clustered within 25-30 minutes’ 
walking distance from the district ambulatory clinic in each 
neighbourhood to provide basic ambulatory services and refer 
patients to the district ambulatory clinic, where a wider range and 
more sophisticated services are offered. A typical express 
ambulatory clinic occupies an area of 120-200 m
2
 and is open  
seven days a week, with extended working hours (from 9:00 am  
to 9:00 pm).
Our ambulatory clinics, as with all our healthcare facilities, provide 
services to patients financed by a range of payment sources, 
including state coverage, private medical insurance or out of pocket 
payments. Our ambulatory network takes advantage of our unique 
capabilities as a healthcare service provider including, among other 
things, our comprehensive referral system, as well as access to a 
wide talent pool of specialised physicians, our central referral 
laboratory and our training centre.
The first phase of the launch was focused on Tbilisi and comprised 
three district clinics with between two and four express clinics for 
each district clinic. This project started at the end of 2014 and is 
expected to be completed within the next three years at an 
estimated cost of GEL 4.5 million per cluster. Following the 
completion of this phase, we plan to expand our presence in  
the fast-growing outpatient segment in all of the regions in which  
we operate, focusing on both enhancing our outpatient revenues 
and on increasing referrals to our hospitals. Our long-term target  
is to obtain a 17% market share by revenue in this segment.

Despite the high number of doctors available 
in Georgia, the average age of our doctors is 
50, they mostly come with Soviet medical 
education and we have a shortage of doctors 
in a number of areas. Therefore, the main 
priority for my team and me is sourcing and 
expertise advancement of our physicians. 
Evidence based medicine and western 
standards of care is our baseline.
We have been working on design and the 
development of residency programmes since 
2014, which we launched in 2015. I am glad 
to see high demand for our residency 
programmes (we received 120 applications 
for the 43 residency position within the first 
month of the announcement), which shows 
both, the reputation of our organisation and 
strong demand on the market for this 
profession. We also have re-training of 
currently practicing physicians. Our residents 
benefit from our collaboration with Georgian 
doctors that work abroad (USA, Europe, 
Middle East), who deliver classes via 
teleconferences and provide hands-on 
experience sessions during visits in Georgia. 
Our Goal for the next several years is to 
develop a sufficient number of doctors in the 
shortage areas and retrain the majority of our 
existing physicians.

Despite effective healthcare reforms in the 
areas of financing and infrastructure, Georgia 
has not done much yet in the area of Quality 
Management since the Soviet era.
On the other hand, our scale provides us with 
sufficient resources to develop our internal 
quality management system, which helps us 
standardise and ensure patient safety and a 
quality of medical care that we have 
developed and benchmarked against the 
international, EU and Joint Commission 
International (JCI) standards. We have also 
adopted various infection control procedures 
at our hospitals in partnership with external 
consultants including JCI Consultancy, CDC 
Atlanta, CDC Georgia, Emory University and 
the WHO European Regional Office. Our 
reputation for high quality care has also been 
strengthened by our global collaborations 
with leading institutions including the Mayo 
Clinic, John Snow Inc., URC, the 
Rostropovich Vishnevskaya Foundation and 
USAID. Our attention has been focused on 
the highest risk areas. The goal for the next 
several years is to develop and implement 
quality management measures at a larger 
scale within our healthcare facilities including 
components of quality activities, such as full 
risk management, antibiotic stewardship, and 
surgery care improvement project and

team that are driving the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare across the organisation. We capitalise on existing service 
gaps and overall lower quality of medical care in the country and on the other hand improved access to healthcare services through UHC 
financing. Need for improvement as evidenced by low incidence levels in these specialities (e.g. malignant neoplasms incidence rate in 
Georgia: 110.1, EU: 543.7), as well as c.US$100 million national spending on medical services import. On pages 27-32, the leaders of our

The World Health Organisation recommends 
a nurse to doctor ratio of 4:1 for Georgia, 
compared to our current ration of 0.9 nurses 
per doctor. 
To address this issue, we launched a 
post-graduate nurse training programme two 
years ago. This is an intensive nine month 
curriculum, and we have already retrained 
1,960 out of our 2,738 nurses. To source new 
nurses, we launched Nurse College together 
with the leading medical institute in Georgia. 
More than 200 nurses are expected to 
graduate from the college every year. We will 
be funding the education of the top 
performers in the class to incentivise the 
applicants, as currently the demand to join 
the nursing profession is not favourable in 
Georgia. To popularise the nursing 
profession, we also promote it on social 
media and through TV. 
The goal for the next several years is to 
accomplish 2:1 nurse to doctor ratio by 
continuing our current training and 
teaching initiatives.

Name: Alexi Baidoshvili, MD, PhD 
Position: Head of the Pathology 
Service Department
Pathology services do not exist in Georgia 
today. Whilst there are laboratories, the 
methodology and the skills, as well as the 
equipment that is used to carry out pathology 
tests is vastly outdated and 30 years behind 
those used in Europe – therefore test results 
are not reliable. Patients mostly mail the test 
materials to foreign clinics. The lack of 
proper pathology service spills over to 
other services, particularly the oncology 
services, creating a substantial service 
gap and deficiency. 
It takes years to develop some services and 
pathology is one of them. At GHG, we started 
working on this project several years ago. 
Success in pathology largely depends on 
skilled personnel and I am glad that we 
already have Georgian specialists, trained at 
the Laboratory of Pathology East Netherlands 
(LabPON) with the ultimate goal to return to 
Georgia to kick-start the pathology service. 
Our plan for the next several years is to 
launch a proper pathology service – the first 
such laboratory in Georgia, which will be part 
of a mega-laboratory.

other hand, the availability of quality 
ambulatory clinics is limited and the market is 
highly fragmented. 
To provide strong primary care to our patients 
we needed to create physical access, offer 
quality care and increase patient awareness. 
At the end of 2014, we tested the concept 
and in 2015, accelerated our ambulatory 
launch strategy, which implies the opening of 
around 30 ambulatory clinics, in Tbilisi and 
major regional cities, during 2015 and 2016. 
Patients like our clinics and insurance 
companies, that place GPs at our clinics note 
higher demand for GPs placed at our clinics 
compared to the competition. The Universal 
Healthcare Programme helps increase 
patients’ access to the primary healthcare.
Our goal for the next several years is to 
complete the roll-out of ambulatory clinics 
and increase awareness for the access and 
the quality of care, to boost utilisation.

Both, the utilisation and quality of laboratory 
services are very low in Georgia, a number of 
lab tests are still sent to the laboratories 
abroad. The role of quality laboratory services 
is critical in the development of primary 
healthcare in Georgia. 
Building up customer trust has been our 
primary focus for the last three years. Since 
2012, we started improving the service quality 
by investing in equipment, personnel training 
and process standardisation. Currently, three 
of our referral hospitals are certified with ISO 
90012008 and the rest of our healthcare 
facilities also adhere to the same standards of 
service. We have also focused on the 
efficiency of our operations and set up referral 
laboratories at our referral hospitals that 
perform lab tests on behalf of our other 
clinics. Currently we run 10 referral and 30 
non-referral laboratories. 
Our goal for the next several years is to 
launch a mega-laboratory in Tbilisi, Georgia, 
which will consolidate our investment and 
replace our referral laboratories in order to 
further improve the quality of tests as well as 
increase the range of tests.”

Name: Tamar Antelava, MD, PhD 
Position: Head of the OB-GYN 
Service unit
Georgia has the highest number of caesarean 
sections per 1,000 live births among the 
former Soviet Union republics – 39% of the 
total number of all deliveries in 2014. The 
maternal mortality ratio per live births is 
three-times higher in Georgia than in the 
European Region. Poor care during 
pregnancy spills over to the neonatal and 
paediatric fields. 
As a member of the committee that works on 
the national policy for maternal and child care 
policy in Georgia and as the head of the 
ob-gyn division at GHG, the largest ob-gyn 
unit in the country, I have an opportunity to 
both influence the policy as well as implement 
it in our healthcare facilities. GHG’s cluster 
business model is best suited to leverage the 
national regionalisation of perinatal services 
(introduction of levels of care). Our focus is on 
establishing the levels of care starting from 
villages though the referral centres, as well as 
the training of medical personnel to use 
relevant protocols. Progress is evident, as the 
share of women beginning antenatal care has 
increased and is now almost 80%, up from 
50% in 2003, but there is enormous room for 
improvement with service quality in maternal 
care. IVF service is scarcely developed and 
Georgians mostly travel abroad for this 
service – we will be launching the service in 
the second quarter of 2016.

Name: Koba Kiknavelidze, MD, PhD 
Position: Head of the Kutaisi 
Oncology Centre
Cancer diagnostics and treatment are in the 
early stages of development in Georgia, which is 
evidenced by very low reported incidence levels. 
For example, malignant neoplasms incidence 
rate in Georgia is 140.3, compared to 543.7 in 
EU, and the detection of over 30% of malignant 
neoplasms occur at stage IV, in many cases too 
late. This is due to the lack of investment in the 
service provision, lack of physicians and 
generally a low check-up culture in Georgia. 
To address this issue, in 2015 we launched 
West-Georgia Oncology Centre, which is 
equipped with the most up-to-date technology 
including the only linear accelerator in west 
Georgia and aims to become the major 
oncology centre for the west Georgian 
population. We invited two specialists from the 
US to support local physicians initially. Within the 
first three months of operations, we have 
achieved 80% utilisation. We support the 
detection stage with free-check-up 
programmes. Until then, the oncology service 
was only available in Tbilisi.
Our goal for the next several years is to provide 
good quality oncology diagnostics and 
treatment to west Georgia’s population (about 
1.8 million people) so that they don’t have to 
travel to the capital for the service. This 
enhances the variety of services provided, as 
well as increasing the capacity of our Oncology 
Centre, on the back of increased demand.

Position: Head of the Children’s 
Cardiac Service Unit
For almost 15 years, there was only one 
centre in Georgia that provided cardiology 
and cardiosurgery services for children. That 
largely limited access to the service. The 
detection level was low and the service 
provision limited. 
We at GHG started work on developing this 
service in 2014 and eventually launched a 
Paediatric Cardiosurgery Unit at Iashvili 
Hospital. In the first several months of 
utilisation, we have completed 21 surgical 
operations. To compare, a total of 513 open 
heart operations were performed on children 
under 15-years in 2014 in Georgia (latest 
available figure on national statistic). We 
provide free-of-charge diagnostics in the 
regions, to improve the detection rates.
The goal for the next several years is to 
strengthen the unit and its capacity.

Name: David Tsibadze, MD, PhD 
Position: Head of the Maternal and 
Children’s Health Service 
Department
Issues in maternal care spill over to children’s 
health, particularly at neonatal age. In Georgia, 
neonatal mortality was 60-80% of under five 
mortality during previous years, well above the 
43% global average. 
When I joined GHG in 2012, proper neonatal 
services were only available in one hospital in 
Tbilisi (Iashvili Hospital). All regional hospitals 
referred patients to Iashvili, which was working 
over its capacity, and many patients did not 
simply have access to a proper service. We 
could not improve services in the regions, 
because these simply did not exist. We started 
by launching neonatal units (conservative, 
surgical and intensive care) at our regional 
referral hospitals, one by one. We invested in 
equipment, and most importantly in personnel 
training, both physicians and nurses, where 
the help from our colleagues at the Mayo clinic 
was crucial, and who also helped us develop 
in-house trainers. We introduced referral 
protocols. Today, we have two neonatal units 
in our regions and the referral of patients to 
Iashvili decreased to 40%. 
Our goal for the next several years is to launch 
neonatal units at the two remaining referral 
hospitals and continue training and developing 
of our personnel to further decrease the 
referral rate from regions to Tbilisi.

Name: Maria Lipka, MD 
Position: Head of the Paediatric 
Service Unit
The biggest share of medical services import 
in Georgia comes from paediatric services, 
due to a lack of availability of services and 
their quality. On the other hand, the culture of 
regular visits to the doctor at an early 
paediatric age exists, as a favourable heritage 
from Soviet-times.
To address the gap in service supply, we are 
focusing on two areas – increasing access to 
basic paediatric services in our regional 
hospitals by setting up paediatric units 
(conservative, surgical and critical care) and 
introducing referral protocols to decrease 
referrals to hospitals in Tbilisi. We are also 
developing services that do not exist or 
where there is a shortage in their supply, like 
paediatric cardiosurgery, oncology, 
neurology, etc. 
Developing physicians is the most important 
step to succeed in both areas. Success of 
our residency programme is important to 
source paediatricians for our paediatric 
units and our collaborations with physicians 
and centres abroad helps us kick-start 
new services.
We have launched six paediatric units in the 
last two years and plan to launch four more.

Position: Head of the Cardiac Surgery 
Service Department
While the cardiac surgical services is one of 
the well-developed services in Georgia, two 
major gaps still exist: access to services in 
the regions of Georgia and therapeutic 
cardiology. These gaps are evidenced by a 
hospitalisation rate per 100,000 population 
that was 1,647 in 2014, which is two-fold less 
than in CIS and European Union countries. 
Additionally, cardiovascular diseases 
represent 16.5% of deaths, which includes 
51% of deaths due to strokes and 45% of 
deaths due to coronary heart disease. 
When I joined GHG in 2013, my main goal 
was to build a holistic cardiology service from 
diagnostics, through management and to 
surgery, as well as increase regional access. 
Since then, we have launched three 
catheterisation laboratories and four full scale 
cardio surgery units. We trained and recruited 
three interventional cardiologists and three 
cardiac surgeons. 
Our goal is to launch another fully-fledged 
cardiology units within our hospitals within 
the next three years, and increase utilisation 
and capabilities of the existing units.

The lack of quality of care in a number of 
areas in the Georgian healthcare system puts 
strain on critical care units. Gaps in 
post-operative and critical care services are 
in the areas of capacity and quality of care, 
which is the main focus of our critical care 
medicine service department. 
During the last two years, we have added 28 
intensive care beds in our hospitals (excluding 
acquisitions), on the back of the existing 
demand. We have retrained 133 and recruited 
51 intensive care specialists, and retrained 
256 nurses that work in critical care 
departments. Critical care units in a number 
of our hospitals are working at above 80% 
capacity, which we expect to enhance. 
Additionally, for our paediatric critical care 
units in Tbilisi, we have room to consolidate 
the units, thus consolidating the expertise 
and the investment, and consequently 
improving the quality of service and making 
operations more efficient. We are due to

The shortage and poor quality of medical 
services in Georgia lead to about US$100 
million worth of medical services taking place 
outside Georgia annually, which means 
Georgians travelling to Turkey, Israel and 
Europe for healthcare services. On the other 
hand, prices of healthcare services in Georgia 
are the lowest in the region, at least half of the 
prices charged in Turkey, which is an 
opportunity for attracting medical tourism to 
the country. 
For the next several years, the main focus of 
my unit is two-fold: 1. Reverse tourism – work 
with the heads of medical service units to 
identify and develop services where we have 
service gaps so that Georgians can use 
services locally instead of travelling abroad; 2. 
Medical tourism – attract patients from the 
neighbouring countries for the services where 
we have relatively good quality and 
competitive prices. Currently, this primarily 
includes specialised surgery (cardio, 
neurology, transplantology, plastic surgery, 
urology, radiation therapy, etc.).

Name: Levan Sukhishvili, MD 
Position: Head of the Emergency 
Care Medicine Service Department
Emergency units simply did not exist in 
Georgia until several years ago. To cover the 
lack of emergency specialists, hospitals had 
to staff emergency units with over 15 different 
specialists, which decreased the quality and 
efficiency of the ER. Strong ER units in each 
of our hospitals is a cornerstone of our 
business model, and it implies a strong 
referral system between community and 
referral hospitals. 
We started addressing this issue in 2011, and 
this involved two areas: the physical redesign 
of hospital admission units to transform them 
into ER units, and staffing with ER physicians 
and nurses. The former proved most 
challenging, as there were only 20 licensed 
ER specialists in the entire country in 2011 
and we needed at least four specialists per 
hospital. Therefore, partnered with the 
licensed training centre and later we launched 
our own licensed training centre. Since then, 
we have launched five emergency units and 
have three more launches in the pipeline for 
the next two years.

Continued focus on improving 
operational efficiency and utilisation 
to improve margins.
We will continue to optimise the cost of running our business and 
increase our margins, particularly by continuing to improve 
operational efficiency and utilisation.
Having centralised most of our administrative functions, we have 
freed up resources at the healthcare facility level and are now 
focused on achieving further efficiencies. In particular, we are 
focused on improved resource utilisation through expanded KPIs 
and benchmarking against internal and international best-practice 
targets. We intend to further centralise or consolidate services such 
as blood banks, laundry and waste management, within the regions. 
We will also seek further consolidation of administrative functions 
such as archives, additional call centres and clinical engineering. We 
plan to conduct personnel assessments to optimise staffing levels 
over the coming years throughout our healthcare facilities and 
improve our claims resubmission (invoicing) process. Among other 
steps to improve efficiency we plan to increase our ratio of nurses to 
physicians (which is 0.9:1, as of 30 June 2015, compared to the 
World Health Organisation recommendation of 4:1). This will allow 
physicians to delegate more tasks to nurses and free themselves up 
to attend to a greater number of patients. Our in-house training 
centre is integral to our plans to increase the supply of trained 
nurses, together with the nurse collage, which we recently launched 
with the leading Georgian medical school. We are also developing 
our internal Evex Quality Standards, which comply with both the 
regulation of medical records by the Georgian regulatory authorities, 
and with best practice international standards.
We intend to maximise our capacity and expand capabilities within 
our network in order to increase the utilisation of our existing 
healthcare facilities. In particular, we will seek to expand the range of 
services and eliminate service gaps, particularly in oncology, 
paediatrics, cardiology, critical and emergency care, ophthalmology 
and plastic surgery. We believe that demand for these services is 
demonstrated by the number of patients who currently travel to other 
countries for treatment. We plan to focus on providing patients with 
the most up-to-date treatment procedures and medical technology 
available on the market, and to make greater use of minimally 
invasive techniques. This will allow quicker recovery times for 
patients and more procedures to be performed at ambulatory 
clinics, with earlier and more widespread use of diagnostic 
techniques allowing earlier and more targeted treatment. In addition, 
we completed development of our facilities in the Samtskhe 
Javakheti region (which dated back to the Soviet era and did not 
meet Evex Quality Standards or national standards) by renovating 
the hospital space and installing new technologies, which we expect 
will significantly increase utilisation rates. We are on track in 
renovating two hospitals in Tbilisi, Deka and Sunstone, as well as 
launching six new ambulatory clusters in 2016. In March we rolled 
out our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for data 
collection and analysis to standardise quality levels throughout our 
hospitals and clinics and implementation processes. This system will 
also help us track capacity in a consistent manner across the 
network and identify areas for improvement. We also believe that our 
plans to focus on the expansion of our ambulatory clinics will 
improve our operating margins because these facilities are more 
efficient to operate.
Leverage opportunities from the 
reform of the Georgian healthcare 
sector to increase our self-pay 
medical insurance customer base.
We will continue to focus on deepening the vertical integration of our 
healthcare services and medical insurance businesses to attract 
self-pay customers seeking to top up their UHC coverage through 
private medical insurance. We will do this by offering integrated 
solutions, improving the effectiveness of our clinical pathways and 
demonstrating our value proposition through excellent clinical 
results, all of which are designed to expand the market for private 
insurance customers in an open and collaborative manner. We aim 
to reinforce our key relationships through referring family physicians 
and through the expansion of our ambulatory clinics while including 
additional and more complex procedures delivering attractive returns 
for our healthcare services business. Over time, this is expected to 
create increased volume for providers who are both efficient and 
clinically effective: areas in which we believe we are leaders.
We will seek to maintain our existing market share in medical 
insurance by growing it in line with the market. We will focus in 
particular on growth in self-pay medical insurance revenue, which 
we aim to triple by 2018. We expect that the basic coverage 
provided under the UHC will enhance the value of the additional 
service that we provide and will generate further opportunities, as 
patients seek quicker treatment, better quality service and facilities, 
or procedures that are not covered by the UHC, by topping up or 
substituting their state coverage through private medical insurance. 
We are developing new products designed for the private retail 
medical insurance market as well as business customers including a 
“top up” insurance product to be sold through our hospitals. 34 

Initial public offering
GHG – successfully listed 
on the premium segment 
of the London Stock Exchange 
in November 2015
In November 2015, GHG successfully priced its IPO and completed a premium 
listing, raising a total of approximately US$100 million in primary proceeds. 
This valued GHG’s market capitalisation at £218 million at admission, with a 
35% free float.
GHG received strong support from a diversified and extremely 
high-quality institutional investor base and welcomed more than 
100 new investors as it embarks on the next phase of development. 
Following completion of the IPO, at the beginning of 2016, GHG 
was included in the FTSE All Share Index
A public listing enhances GHG’s ability to take advantage of the 
significant market growth prospects of the Georgian healthcare 
sector. Most of the primary proceeds of approximately US$100 
million are being used to fund GHG’s immediate growth plans, 
aimed at helping it to achieve at least a doubling of 2015 revenue by 
2018. GHG’s clear growth vision, combined with hospital expansion 
potential and first mover advantage in the highly-fragmented and 
relatively under-penetrated ambulatory segment, creates a highly 
attractive investment opportunity in the Georgian healthcare 
services industry. 
The Boards of Directors and management teams of BGEO Group 
PLC (the majority shareholder of GHG) and GHG appreciate the 
growth potential that GHG has and many of the members have 
invested in the IPO. As the leading healthcare company in Georgia 
by both revenue and number of beds, GHG offers investors an 
opportunity to diversify their holdings and benefit from an 
emerging market business with a successful track record and 
strong future prospects.

Growth KPIs
Efficiency KPIs
The record revenue of GEL 242.7 million for 2015 was primarily driven by the 
32.5% growth in our healthcare services revenue, of which 17.3% was organic 
and 15.2% through acquisitions and other. 
In 2016 and beyond, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth, 
driven by a combination of organic growth and the integration of recently 
acquired hospitals, mainly focusing on Tbilisi. We plan to increase our market 
share in the fast-growing, highly- fragmented and under-penetrated outpatient 
market, invest in medical equipment, utilise existing service gaps, particularly in 
oncology, high-tech diagnostics, laboratory, and specialist services; continue to 
lead the market in the quality of our medical care; drive margin improvements 
through operational efficiency and utilisation levels in our facilities; and maintain 
our existing market share in medical insurance and triple our 2015 self-pay 
insurance revenue.
The combined effect of the increasing share of referral hospitals in our revenue 
mix, the increasing number of ambulatory clinics and growth of our medical 
insurance, and the integration activities carried out throughout 2015 at the 
healthcare facilities acquired during 2014 and 2015, is the main driver of 
efficiency strategy for our business. Other measures such as various investments 
in IT aimed at optimisation of workflow processes and the implementation of 
centralised cost administration represents the cost control measures we 
continue to deploy across the board in order to keep a tight grip on costs. A 
string of acquisitions in recent years, has placed an upward pressure on costs as 
synergies have not yet been fully realised from these acquisitions. 38 

Resources and responsibilities
Sustainability 
Being a leading healthcare provider in Georgia we are 
committed to adopting our approach to sustainability in our 
operations. Our goal is to develop long-term relationships with 
our main stakeholders, patients, employees and society, as well 
as taking into account our impact on the environment. 
By implementing effective, evidence-based 
medicine and scientific methodologies 
and healthcare quality management, we 
will satisfy our patients’ needs and deliver 
solid financial performance. As employees 
are a fundamental tool in this endeavour, 
our strategy is to attract the most qualified 
medical personnel and constantly develop 
them in line with international best practices.
Quality matters 
Ensuring a high quality of medical care is 
essential for the Georgian Healthcare Group. 
The recent change in our management 
team and a new business strategy initiated 
a number of fundamental changes in the 
way we approach quality of our services. 
We strive to build an effective model of 
quality management based on patients’ 
preferences, evidence-based medicine and 
scientific methodologies. For this purpose 
we have adopted a quality management 
programme and started to develop a 
consistent organisational structure for 
systematic quality assessment. We also 
constantly collaborate with international 
healthcare organisations and local medical 
schools to discuss and define the most 
up-to-date healthcare quality principles.
Quality management
In 2015, we created a Quality Management 
Programme that relies on modern 
approaches to quality matters in healthcare. 
The main goal of the programme is to form 
a new quality management framework 
based on methodical and comprehensive 
assessment of clinical practices. During 
the reporting period, we defined the 
programme’s goals and strategies and 
developed the main working policies in 
accordance with national regulations and 
best international practices. In 2016, quality 
management will encompass every clinic 
in the network and sophisticated quality 
measures and indicators will be employed. 
To manage the programme we
work in committees as well as in 
working units. Both of them operate 
at local and head office levels. 
Committees
In 2015, we defined the main functions of 
committees: identification of key quality 
and safety measures for hospitals, creation 
of key recommendations for improvement 
based on analysis of quality metrics 
throughout the network, trend observation 
and programmes approval. We started with 
the head office and a few clinics but in the 
future committees for all referral hospitals 
will be formed. It is planned that committees 
will meet at least twice a year. At community 
hospitals, a chief clinical officer will 
cover quality management activities. 
Working units
Working units are responsible for execution 
of defined quality management goals and 
objectives. They collect medical data in 
hospitals and carry out their own analysis 
for further centralised reporting. Before 
2015, there was only one single working 
unit responsible for all hospitals’ quality 
management and it operated from the 
head office. In 2015, we made it a goal 
to establish a working unit in each of our 
hospitals to allow proper attention to quality 
matters at the local level. By the end of 
2015, we already had 73 professionals 
in all existing working units: six of them 
in the head office, 22 in regional referral 
hospitals and 45 in other hospitals. 
Furthermore, to adjust working units to their 
new functions we revised their structure, 
defined staff positions, responsibilities, and 
job descriptions. Now each working unit 
has a chief quality officer, a quality control 
junior specialist, an epidemiologist and a 
hospital infection and prevention nurse. 
Working units are actively involved in other 
clinical standardisation processes related to:
• optimisation of patient, information, 
medical and nonmedical documentation 
flows
• development of clinical protocols and 
standard operating procedures in 
hospitals
• billing and price standardisation 
processes, etc. 
Occasionally the units participate in other 
cross functional and special projects. 
For instance, they set safety criteria for 
construction of hospitals in terms of 
infection control, patient safety, design 
and facility requirements for David 
Kodua medical centre (DKC) in Tbilisi.
Databases
We understand that effective quality 
management can only be based on the 
monitoring of reliable indicators. Therefore 
creating our own adequate Group-wide 
databases is one of our major priorities. 
In 2015, we put mechanisms in place that 
routinely monitor core clinical activities. 
We already have quality and safety core 
indicators databases for our units with 
the highest risk (ICU, NICU, PICU) ready 
to be set on server. We have also created 
databases for mortalities, prenatal care, 
penalties, medical errors and case 
reviews. An effective reporting and 
feedback system is also being created. 
We are getting started with developing of a 
trauma registry programme. So far, we have 
met with the national Centre of Disease 
Control (CDC) representatives and created 
the main document describing the system 
of trauma registry for hospitals. Currently, 
our plan is to discuss this programme 
with the CDC South Caucasus Office and 
to identify key points for collaboration on 
this matter with the Ministry of Health. 
Quality standards
We strongly believe that for better quality 
management we need to standardise 
our clinical and administrative practices. 
We use both national guidelines and 
recommendations offered by international 
professional organisations as a base 
for standardisation. In 2014, we signed 
a memorandum of collaboration with 
Joint Commission International (JCI), an 
accreditation institution for health care 
entities with high patient safety and quality 
standards. We have closely cooperated with 
Quality management

JCI experts to develop internal regulations, 
measures and indicators in accordance 
with its standards. So far, we have put in 
place quality improvements for antibiotic 
therapy of obstetric patients. Continuously 
collecting information through the data 
collection system will serve as a basis 
for further clinical practice analysis.
As another tool, centrally, we create 
protocols and pathways for our physicians 
and nurses based on the best domestic 
and international guidelines. These 
protocols and pathways serve as a tool 
for the standardisation of basic processes 
related to clinical activities. To track the 
effectiveness and adoption of adjusted 
processes we perform selective clinical 
audits. In 2015, we conducted first 
audits of activities related to pneumonia 
and urinary tract infection treatments 
in two of our referral hospitals. 
Infection control and prevention
Our healthcare facilities host a large 
number of people every day and it is 
essential to protect our patients, visitors 
and personnel from healthcare-associated 
infections (HAI). We aim to enhance 
patient safety by integrating effective 
infection prevention and control practices 
into our everyday clinical practice.
One of our major projects in 2015 was a 
tuberculosis (TB) prevention programme 
for hospitals. This was a unique project 
in collaboration with The Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
(GFATM) and the funding for the project 
was primarily provided by the US Agency 
for International Development (USAID). As 
a part of the collaboration, a workshop on 
TB control in hospitals was conducted in 
2015. Consequently, we created a new TB 
prevention programme which we plan to 
implement in our referral hospitals in 2016. 
To equip our staff with hands-on 
experience on all new procedures and 
policies, we conducted relevant training. 
A number of our intensive unit care 
(ICU) head nurses and infection control 
(IC) nurses have already completed 
Training of trainers courses and are 
now capable of training other nurses.
Independent medical case 
review process
The independent medical case review 
process is designed to reveal systemic 
problems and enhance preventive measures 
in our clinical practice. We have different 
case reviewing processes in place: for 
medical errors, for mortality, for sentinel 
events and for near-miss cases. We 
collect all necessary information on each 
case, including the results of root cause 
analysis, to develop response strategies.
In 2015, we designed a new process of 
medical case review in the head office 
and in Kutaisi referral hospital. Based on 
this review, we discuss recommendations 
for improvements with medical staff, then 
we supervise improvement processes 
in hospitals. As a next step we are 
going to spread out the experience 
gained in this project throughout our 
network of hospitals. We also plan to 
organise our own training courses in 
near-miss reviewing methodology.
Employee matters
Each of our employees plays his/her role in 
the delivery of quality healthcare services 
being an integral part of the Group’s 
success. We are rapidly expanding our 
healthcare operations and our headcount is 
growing accordingly. In 2015, the number of 
our employees increased by more than 
1,500 totalling 9,649 people, which makes 
us the biggest private employer in Georgia. 
To satisfy the growing needs of our business 
it is our first priority to effectively attract, 
retain and develop qualified professionals

In order to manage our workforce efficiently, 
we are in the process of adopting two 
modules of HR software systems: an HRMS 
data management system and a recruitment 
management system. Both systems are 
being tailored to satisfy our operating 
needs and to be in conformity with our 
HR policy. The software will significantly 
increase automation and optimise 
workflow of many HR related organisational 
procedures, including employee data 
administration, recruitment data processing, 
and statistical and analytical reporting. 
We recognise the importance of observing 
human rights and are committed to 
implementing socially responsible 
business practices. Our Human Rights 
Policy establishes priorities and puts 
control procedures in place to provide 
equal opportunities and prevent 
discrimination or harassment on any 
grounds, including disability. Our Human 
Rights Policy applies to all employment 
processes, training and development. 
We are committed to employee 
engagement. We believe that knowledge of 
our Group is key and we strive to provide 
our employees with a continuous flow of 
information which includes but is not limited 
to information about our corporate culture, 
the Group’s strategy and performance, risks 
relating to its performance, such as financial 
and economic factors, and our policies and 
procedures. We provide information in a 
number of ways, including via departmental 
managers, presentations, our intranet, 
e-mail and regular townhall and off-site 
meetings. We also value the views of our 
employees. We consult with our employees 
regularly and have implemented feedback 
systems, such as frequent employee 
satisfaction surveys, which ensure that our 
employee’s opinions are taken into account 
when making decisions which are likely to 
affect their interests. Employee feedback 
also helps to improve our customer focused 
orientation and client servicing approach.
The Group gives full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment when 
these are received from disabled people 
and employs disabled people whenever 
suitable vacancies arise. The Group 
ensures that disabled persons are fairly 
treated in respect of training and career 
development. Should an employee 
become disabled when working for the 
Group, we will endeavour to adapt the 
work environment and provide retraining if 
necessary so that they may continue their 
employment and maximise their potential.
Talent attraction
To ensure necessary amount of human 
resources for our growing business and to 
maintain the unquestionable professionalism 
of our teams we constantly look for new 
ways of attracting the most talented and 
skilled specialists. The Employee Planning 
and Recruitment Division is responsible 
for this process as well as for staff 
planning and recruitment. The Division 
applies different approaches to ensure a 
continuous pool of candidates for ongoing 
and planed recruitment needs, including:
• Job fairs and “milky ways” in universities;
• Internship programmes with universities;
• Postgraduate education residency 
programmes;
• Open and free trainings by EVEX 
Learning Centre;
• Partnership with medical associations in 
Georgia and abroad;
• Head hunting for key specialist and 
managerial positions (including Georgian 
specialists working abroad), etc.

We assess the competencies and 
knowledge of candidates with tests and 
different types of interviews including 
behavioural and case analyses. In 
addition, for medical candidates, such 
as physicians and nurses, we conduct 
medical tests, for administrative positions 
– GMAT or general abilities tests.
Job fairs
Job fairs are one of the most effective tools 
for attracting young talent. During 2015, our 
Recruitment Division organised eight job 
fairs and meetings with students at leading 
universities in Tbilisi and other regions of 
Georgia. In addition, we participated in four 
job fairs arranged by external organisations. 
Around 300 students were recruited 
at these job fairs for nurse, intern and 
junior doctor positions. In 2015, our main 
provider of medical human resources was 
Tbilisi State Medical University, where we 
recruited 54 students for nurse positions 
and nine for junior doctor positions. 
Memorandums of Understanding with 
universities
Medical educational institutions are 
our main resource of emerging talents. 
Both EVEX and our own learning centre 
– EVEX Learning Centre – established 
partnerships and signed Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoU) with two types of 
educational institutions: nursing colleges 
and universities. We provide them with 
our clinical sites for various educational 
purposes, including basic on-the-job 
education, training programmes and 
affiliated residency programmes. For 
instance, in 2015 EVEX Learning Centre 
conducted free one-year nursing training 
for 188 Kutaisi nursing college students 
and graduates. Eventually we offered 
jobs to 26 successful graduates of this 
programme in EVEX clinics in Kutaisi.
Training and development
We invest a lot of effort and funds in various 
professional education opportunities – 
mostly for nurses and physicians. In 2015, 
EVEX spent GEL 1.04 million on training 
and development. These funds mostly 
covered nursing training, emergency 
room specialists’ training and training of 
specialists for the oncology centre in Kutaisi.
We are proud to have our own EVEX 
Learning Centre, the only centre in 
Georgia offering continuous medical 
education. Apart from modern training 
methods, the centre offers up-to-date 
equipment, auditoria, computer labs 
and other facilities that conform to 
international standards. Our learning centre 
independently develops and runs a variety 
of Continuing Professional Development 
Programmes (CDP). Most of CDPs are 
medical training for physicians and nurses, 
yet non-medical staff, such as hospital 
administration and registry employees, 
participate in them as well. In 2015, EVEX 
trained 1,960 nurses, 1,720 physicians 
and 403 administration employees.
Training courses for physicians are based 
on national guidelines and protocols 
and the latest international discoveries. 
As for the nurse training, there are no 
national standards or regulations for CDP 
or vocational education programmes in 
Georgia. EVEX is a pioneer in these areas, 
and we have created our own protocols, 
guidelines and training modules. 
Residency
In line with our strategy to develop a 
new generation of doctors, we launched 
a postgraduate educational residency 
programme in a number of fields. These 
programmes ensure development of 
qualified specialists in the areas where 
EVEX lacks physicians. So far, we have 
observed high interest in such programmes 
– we received 120 applications from 
prospective residents since the launch 
of the programme in December 2015.

productivity and job satisfaction among 
our employees. These incentives vary for 
different types of employees depending 
on the nature of their job. For instance, 
front office employees who communicate 
directly with our patients can receive 
additional pay and a share-based bonus 
compensation for good performance. 
Beyond tangible rewards, we offer non-
monetary benefits that include medical 
insurance, malpractice insurance, 
pension plans, and allowances for 
accommodation, transportation 
and mobile expenses coverage.
In order to maintain equal treatment of all 
staff and promote employee awareness 
of their rights and obligations, EVEX uses 
one single version of Employee Handbook

Community matters
The Group serves three quarters of 
Georgia’s population and strives to promote 
healthy living and support wellbeing of 
local communities. We use our medical 
expertise when looking for ways to positively 
impact the society. That is why in our social 
initiatives we focus primarily on providing 
pro bono medical assistance, developing 
medical infrastructure and improving health 
literacy of the Georgian population.
In 2015 the Group significantly increased its 
financing of existing sponsorship and charity 
projects and started new ones. As a result, 
the Group’s total sponsorship and charity 
expenses increased more than 4.5 times 
in 2015 and amounted to GEL 509,190.
In 2015, we started new projects to 
grasp a wider set of issues in Georgia 
and make our sponsorship and charity 
activities more diverse. For instance, we 
invested GEL 94,644 in the construction 
of the first Children’s Hospice. Also 
we financially supported people who 
suffered from the floods in Tbilisi.
Free medical services
Construction of Children’s hospice
In 2015, we started the construction of the 
first Children’s Hospice where children will 
receive free palliative care for chronic and 
incurable diseases. Three main types of 
service will be provided by the hospice:
• 24-hour care on the hospice’s premises 
for ten children; 
• Day care centre where children will have 
an opportunity to stay with their parents 
and get necessary services; and
• Home visit and homecare service.
By now, the Children’s Hospice has already 
started providing homecare services for 
15-20 children on a monthly basis. The 
construction of the facilities is planned 
to be completed by the end of 2016.
Children’s oncology programme
The Group traditionally participates in the 
state Children’s oncology programme 
under which we offer oncology treatment 
for children in our Tbilisi Iashvili Children’s 
Central Hospital, a multi profile paediatric 
medical establishment. Our clinic is a unique 
provider of this service in Georgia, on 
which about GEL 1.27 million is subsidised 
yearly. In 2015, 169 young patients received 
treatment under this programme.
Disaster recovery assistance
In 2015, our doctors provided first 
aid assistance to Tbilisi flood victims 
suffering from various injuries. Sixteen 
of our physicians assisted over 1,000 
people harmed by this disaster. We also 
extended our sympathy to those we 
could not help in person and transferred 
GEL 25,000 into a dedicated fund to 
help families affected by the flood.
Free medical check-ups
We provided free regular medical 
examinations in six regions and 12 cities 
of Georgia, serving the socially and 
economically disadvantaged parts of 
the population. In 2015, we organised 
20 general healthcare check-up events, 
where 1,034 patients were seen by 
our 176 physicians free-of-charge.
Health literacy promotion
Sponsoring medical TV programmes is 
our way of promoting health literacy, which 
helps us reach a wide range of the Georgian 
population. We have four educational TV 
shows: The Doctors, Day Show, Impulse 
and Medical hour. All shows share expertise 
in a simple and clear manner on various 
health and wellness issues such as 
screening programmes, allergies, cardio 
vascular disease, oncology, arthritis, and 
others. Sometimes celebrity interviews, 
health news, healthy recipes and helpful 
tips are also broadcast during the shows. 
As our medical TV programmes proved 
to be very popular in 2014, we increased

their scale and financing from GEL 
20,000 in 2014 to GEL 177,180 in 2015. 
Conferences for doctors
We believe that professional medical 
education is a building block of healthcare 
quality in Georgia. For this reason, we 
make an effort to develop a healthy learning 
environment by financing international 
and local conferences. In 2015, we 
sponsored six medical conferences which 
brought together medical scholars and 
health care practitioners from Europe, 
Asia and Georgia to share knowledge 
and experience that influence and shape 
healthcare delivery. As a result, in the 
reporting period we more than doubled 
our support of conferences (from GEL 
66,512 to GEL 149,684 respectively).
Environmental matters
We recognise that our operations impact the 
environment and we responsibly approach 
this matter. Most of the Group’s impact 
comes from medical waste generation and 
combustion of fuels both for stationary use 
and for owned vehicles. We also affect the 
environment by using significant amounts 
of water in our hospitals, purchasing 
electricity and paper. Although our overall 
negative impact is not comparably high, 
we still aim at becoming more recourse 
efficient and environmentally friendly. 
Waste management
Hospitals’ most significant environmental 
impact is associated with generation of 
medical waste. Environmental risks can 
be significantly minimised with proper 
waste handling and disposal. Our waste 
management procedures are compliant 
with the Georgian legislation which 
defines risk categories and appropriate 
procedures of medical waste treatment. 
Our clinics collect and dispose of medical 
and biological waste through a properly 
outsourced service, in compliance with 
the national laws and regulations, to 
prevent human and environmental harm. 
For the collection of waste we use plastic 
bags that have sufficient strength and 
are secured with staples to safely retain 
waste. Also, we do not fill more than two-
thirds of bags’ capacity. Further, steam 
sterilisation is used to decontaminate 
biological and biohazardous waste, 
including blood. All used sharps are placed 
only in proper sharp disposal containers. 
On average waste is collected from our 
sites twice a week and the maximum 
interval between collections is one week. 
Resources and responsibilities continued
We pass our waste to a local company 
specialising in medical waste disposal. 
To ensure the reliability of our contractors 
we examine their certificates and monthly 
reporting as well as imposing penalties if 
necessary. In total, our hospitals generated 
125 tonnes of medical waste in 2014 and 
115 tonnes in 2015 (8.7% decrease).
Greenhouse gas emissions management
To light up our hospitals’ premises and run 
medical equipment we consume thousands 
of kilowatts of electricity yearly. In fact, 
electricity usage accounts for about a half 
of our total greenhouse gas generation. 
To decrease this negative impact we plan 
to implement a number of energy saving 
solutions, such as installation of LED lights 
and energy efficient equipment, in the 
nearest future. We also work out ways to 
minimise our carbon footprint by other 
means. For instance, heat insulation is being 
improved in a number of hospitals. Still there 
was an increase of Scope 2 emissions in 
2015 mainly due to electricity consumption 
by our new major hospitals that we acquired 
during 2015 and at the end of 2014 in Tbilisi:
• High Technology Medical Centre 
University Clinic (HTMC), a 450-bed 
major and well-established referral 
hospital (2015);

Appendix 1. GHG Emissions Calculation 
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013 (Scope 1 and 
2) and additionally reported on some 
emissions under Scope 3. These sources 
fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not 
included in our consolidated statement. 
We have used the World Resources 
Institute/World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WRI/
WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(GHG): A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised 
edition) and emission factors from 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2015.
The reported data is collected and reported 
for the boundaries of two Group’s 
businesses:
• EVEX, which includes its head office, 
hospitals and other entities where the 
Company has operational control;
• Imedi L, which includes its head office.
Scope 1 (combustion of fuel and operation 
of facilities) includes emissions from:
• Combustion of natural gas, diesel, and 
petrol in stationary equipment at owned 
and controlled sites;
• Combustion of petrol and diesel in 
owned transportation devices (cars 
and buses).
Scope 2 (electricity, heat, steam and  
cooling purchased for own use) includes 
emissions from:
• Electricity spent at owned and controlled 
sites; to calculate the emissions we used 
conversion factor for Non-OECD Europe 
and Eurasia (average) conversion from 
the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2015; 
• Used heat and steam.
Scope 3 includes emissions from:
• Air business travel (short haul and long 
haul); information of the class of travel is 
unavailable hence we used an “average 
passenger” conversion factor;
• Ground transportation, including taxi, 
coaches, and car hire.
Data on emissions resulting from travel 
is reported for business-related travel 
only, and excludes commuting travel. 
Data from joint ventures, investments, 
or sub-leased properties have not been 
included within the reported figures. 
The data is provided by onsite delegates, 
invoices, and meter readings.

Risk management
Risk management
Overview
The Directors acknowledge that they have overall responsibility for 
risk management, the Group’s system of internal control, for 
reviewing the effectiveness of those controls and for ensuring that an 
appropriate culture has been embedded throughout the 
organisation. In accordance with the guidance set out in the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial Business Reporting, and in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code itself, an ongoing system has 
been established for identifying, managing and evaluating the risks 
faced by the Group. This system has been in place for the period 
ended 31 December 2015 and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report.
The Board is also responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of any principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve 
its strategic objectives.
This system is bespoke to the Group’s particular needs and risks to 
which it is exposed and is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
risk. Due to the limitations inherent in any system of internal control, 
this system provides robust, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
To assist in the identification and management of the Group’s 
principal risks, the Board has developed a system of regular reports 
from management and reserved specific key matters for its decision.
The Board has put in place corporate governance policies and 
procedures that aim to ensure that there is good and clear 
awareness and understanding of the policies and procedures 
amongst senior management.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control which have 
operated throughout the period are:
• well-defined procedures for the assessment, approval, control 
and monitoring of major capital projects, including acquisitions 
and disposals;
• a robust Board committee structure, each of which deal with 
specific aspects of the Group’s affairs and an organisational 
structure with clearly defined levels of authority and division 
of responsibilities;
• regular reports to the Audit Committee and Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal control;
• the close involvement of the Executive Director in all aspects of 
day-to-day operations, including regular meetings with senior 
management to review all operational aspects of the business 
and risk management systems;
• a structure of operational committees that have established 
various policies and which monitor the risk in the given operation; 
• a remuneration policy for executives, which motivates them 
appropriately without encouraging excessive risk taking; 
• reviewing and monitoring the operation of the whistleblowing 
facilities in place to allow staff to raise concerns about possible 
legal, regulatory, financial reporting or other improprieties;
• the Audit Committee’s review of the quarterly, half year and full 
year financial statements and corresponding press releases;
• The attendance at each Audit Committee meeting of the internal 
and external auditors; and
• Updates, on a quarterly basis, to the Management Board in 
relation to the Group’s financial risk profile, policies, limits 
and ratios.
Effectiveness Review
As part of the listing process, the Directors performed a robust 
assessment of risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance and liquidity. As part 
of this exercise, a detailed review of the operation and effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control was undertaken by 
management and the Board reviewed its effectiveness. Further 
assurance was obtained by internal audit and the external auditors.
The Board was able to conclude with reasonable assurance that the 
appropriate internal control and risk management systems were 
maintained throughout the period. The review did not identify any 
significant weaknesses or failings in the systems. The Board, in 
conjunction with management, continually reviews and develops the 
internal control environment.
The Board therefore confirms that throughout the period ended 
31 December 2015 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, there have been rigorous processes in place to identify, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks faced by the Group, as 
documented on pages 47 to 49 including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity in 
accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial Business Reporting published by the 
Financial Reporting Council.
Going Concern Statement
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (which is 
for this purpose a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of these financial statements). Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. The principal risks and 
uncertainties, together with their trend and outlook and mitigating 
actions is set out on pages 47 to 49.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over 
a longer period than the 12 months required to make the going 
concern statement. The Board conducted the review as part of the 
IPO process and concluded that a viability period of three years 
would be most appropriate taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal risks documented 
on pages 47 to 49 of the Annual Report. The principal risks identified 
are those that pose the greatest risk to the viability of the Group. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 
31 December 2018.
A period of three years was deemed to be appropriate because the 
Group’s working capital model and business planning cover a three 
year period. In addition, as part of the IPO process a complete stress 
test for a period of three years had been undertaken. Finally, the Group 
operates in an emerging market with a rapidly evolving business 
environment which makes a longer forecast period highly speculative.
Therefore, whilst the Board has no reason to believe the Group will 
not be viable over a longer period, the period over which the Board 
considers it appropriate to form an expectation as to the Group’s 
longer-term viability, is the three year period. This period provides 
the Board with sufficient, realistic visibility on the future in the context 
of the industry environment. 47

Principal risks and uncertainties
The table below describes the principal risks and uncertainties 
relating to the Group’s operations and their potential impact, as 
well as the trend and outlook associated with these risks and the 
mitigating actions taken to address these risks.
It is not possible to fully mitigate all of our risks, and there may 
be other risks and uncertainties besides those listed below 
which may also adversely affect the Group and its performance. 
More details on risk management can be found in the following 
sections of this Annual Report: Audit Committee Report pages 
78 to 80, Clinical Quality and Safety Committee Report page 81 
and Risk Management pages 46 to 59. Identified below are those 
risks that the Board considers to be the most relevant to the 
Group in relation to their potential impact on achievement of its 
strategic objectives. All of the risks set out below could materially 
affect the Group, its business, future operations and financial 
condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from 
expected or historical results. The risks below are not the only 
that the Group will face. Some risks are not yet known and some 
currently not deemed to be material could later become so.
Risks and uncertainties Trend and outlook Mitigation
We might not be able to expand our business 
in line with our strategy, realise our revenue 
and growth targets or achieve the intended 
benefits or operating synergies from these 
projects. According to our strategy, we plan 
to more than double our 2015 revenue by 
2018, capture one third of the Georgian 
hospital market and increase our market 
share in the outpatient market. Achieving 
this will place significant demands on our 
management and operational resources.
We have made significant progress in each 
of our strategic priorities during the year. 
At the beginning of 2014, the Group had 
28 hospitals with 1,329 hospital beds. 
At the end of 2015 we had 35 hospitals 
with 2,670 hospital beds representing a 
substantially increased market share of 
26.6% of Georgia’s total hospital beds. We 
have continued to expand significantly in the 
higher revenue hospital segments in Tbilisi 
with the acquisition, in August 2015, of the 
High Technology Medical Center University 
Clinic (HTMC). Furthermore, we have already 
started renovation work on two other 
facilities, which we expect to become fully 
operational as multi-profile hospitals in 2017.
Our strategy to increase our share of 
healthcare revenues through the roll-out 
of a national network of ambulatory clinics 
has begun. By the end of January 2016 we 
had opened four ambulatory clusters in a 
number of high-population density areas in 
Tbilisi and one in Kutaisi, the second largest 
city in Georgia. We plan to open at least a 
further six ambulatory clusters in Tbilisi and 
other major cities in Georgia during 2016.
We are achieving operating synergies in line 
with our plans and expect to continue to do so.
The Group is focused on the execution 
of our growth strategy and reorganising 
and adding management capacity to 
better ensure that we meet our targets.
The Group has a solid track record not only 
of making but of integrating acquisitions. 
We have a dedicated integration team 
comprising highly experienced professionals 
with extensive integration project 
experience. The integration team meets 
at least weekly to discuss all aspects of 
the integration process, including but not 
limited to financial, commercial, clinical, 
human resources and legal matters.
We operate in an evolving regulatory 
environment. We cannot predict what 
additional regulatory changes will be 
introduced in the future or their effect.
Since 2007, there have been a number of 
reforms and profound transformations in 
the Georgian healthcare services market 
aimed at achieving higher standards of 
care, modernisation of equipment and 
facilities, wider access to healthcare and 
lower healthcare costs. We expect that 
the regulatory environment will continue 
to evolve in the advancement of these 
goals, but that future developments 
will be less fundamental than was the 
structural shift to universal healthcare.
Continued investment in our people and 
processes is enabling us to meet our 
regulatory requirements and position us well 
to respond to changes in regulation. In line 
with our integrated control framework, we 
carefully evaluate the impact of legislative and 
regulatory changes as part of our formal risk 
identification and assessment processes. As 
part of this process, we engage in constructive 
dialogue with regulatory bodies, where 
possible, and seek external advice on potential 
changes to legislation. We then develop 
appropriate policies, procedures and controls 
as required to fulfil our compliance obligations. 
The legal department regularly consults with 
ministries, regulators and tax authorities. 48 

Risks and uncertainties Trend and outlook Mitigation
We might not be able to predict in full the 
effects of Georgia’s recently implemented 
Universal Healthcare Programme. Our strategy 
assumes that the limited cover available under 
the programme will help increase demand 
for private medical insurance. However, 
these opportunities may not materialise.
The increased focus on the Universal 
Healthcare Programme in Georgia has seen 
a substantial shift in revenues towards the 
healthcare services market leading to an 
industry wide significant reduction in medical 
insurance revenues from the previously in-
force State Insurance Programme. As a result 
our medical insurance business experienced 
a 20.8% reduction in revenues during the year. 
Our private medical insurance has shown 
resilience and revenue from private medical 
insurance products grew by 32% with an 
increased customer base of approximately 
234,000 people holding our medical 
insurance policies as at 31 December 2015.
In the medical insurance business, we plan 
to leverage opportunities from the reform of 
the Georgian healthcare sector to increase 
our private medical insurance customer 
base. We will continue efforts to optimise 
pricing, introduce differentiated products, 
better target sales efforts and increase our 
sales force. We will continue to use the 
medical insurance business as a feeder for 
our medical services business, a role that 
will, we believe, be enhanced in the future as 
we roll-out our ambulatory growth strategy.
We compete with other state and private 
providers of healthcare services across 
Georgia. In some cases, competing 
healthcare providers in certain regions are 
more established than we are, and may 
have greater experience, infrastructure and 
brand loyalty than we do. Our competitors 
may consolidate, develop alliances or 
adopt predatory pricing policies to capture 
market share. Our reputation for high clinical 
standards could suffer if our quality declines 
or our competitors improve their services.
We are the largest provider of healthcare 
services in the country. In addition, we are 
the only provider so far that is consolidating 
in the fragmented Georgian healthcare 
services market. We have the widest 
population coverage (being accessible 
to over three quarters of the 4.5 million 
Georgian population) and the greatest 
geographic reach within the country.
We remain the only healthcare institution 
in Georgia to undertake in-house 
training of our own personnel. Since the 
beginning of 2014, we have invested 
over GEL 3.0 million in training and have 
a dedicated staff of 45 trainers.
We will seek to protect our reputation for 
high clinical standards, which we believe 
continues to drive demand for services at 
our healthcare facilities and attracts more 
patients and physicians which, in turn, 
helps us further enhance our reputation 
for high-quality care and strengthen our 
relationships within the local community. 
In 2015 we successfully launched unique 
services in the country such as liver 
transplant surgery, children’s cardio surgery, 
oncology radiotherapy in western Georgia. 
We will continue to focus on the training and 
education of our staff, as well as sourcing 
a new generation of medical personnel.
Our healthcare services business depends 
on revenue from the Georgian government 
and a small number of private insurance 
providers. We expect that this concentration 
of revenue sources will continue. Accordingly, 
our future success and ability to obtain 
favourable prices will depend in part 
on our ability to maintain good working 
relationships with private insurance providers 
and may be impacted by any changes to 
state-funded healthcare programmes.
The Universal Healthcare Programme 
remains a significant priority for the 
government and government expenditure on 
healthcare will increase by 81.4% from GEL 
487.9 million in 2013 to GEL 885.0 million 
according to the approved government 
budget for 2016. This ongoing increase in 
expected government healthcare spending 
underpins the substantial organic growth 
opportunities for the Group. The government’s 
budgeted spend on healthcare however 
still remains low, compared to many other 
countries, at just over 2% of GDP and 
approximately 7% of annual tax revenues.
We expect the government to continue 
prioritising healthcare services.
The Group monitors the macroeconomic 
environment in Georgia and budgetary 
performance of the state to assess the 
forecasted future cash flows from the state.
Georgia shares borders with Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey and has had 
ongoing disputes in the breakaway regions 
of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia, and with Russia. These disputes 
have led to sporadic violence and breaches 
of peace keeping operations. Regional 
tensions could have an adverse effect on 
the local economy and our business.
Despite tensions in the breakaway territories, 
Russia has opened its market to Georgian 
exports. Russia and Ukraine’s relationship 
has continued to deteriorate. As a result, 
there is significant uncertainty as to if, how 
and when the conflict between Russia 
and Ukraine will be resolved. Russia/
Turkey tensions have developed with the 
escalation of the Syrian crisis, and Armenia/
Azerbaijan tensions continue unabated.
Georgia continues to grow in spite of the 
regional tensions. During 2015, Georgia 
delivered real GDP growth of 2.8%, whilst 
inflation was maintained below the 5% target 
range. Foreign Direct Investment continued to 
be strong and tourist numbers – a significant 
driver of US$ inflows for the country – continue 
to rise. As a result, the Georgian government’s 
fiscal position continues to be strong.
Georgia has taken significant steps to 
reduce its dependence on Russia and 
Ukraine. Even without Russia, Georgian 
exports have more than tripled since 2005 
to US$2.9 billion in 2013. With the recent 
economic turbulence in Russia, exposure to 
the Russian market is once again receding. 
In 2014 Georgia and the EU signed an 
association agreement introducing the 
deep and comprehensive free trade area 
(DCFTA), effective since 1 September 2014, 
which is intended to simplify Georgia’s 
access to the EU market. The Government 
continues to maintain strong relationships 
with international development partners. 
An ongoing IMF programme, introduced in 
July 2014, is intended to help implement the 
government’s economic reform programme 
and aims to reduce macroeconomic 
vulnerabilities and dependency on the 
public sector, and increase policy buffers 
and support growth, while making the 
economy more resilient to external shocks.

Risks and uncertainties Trend and outlook Mitigation
Political and governmental instability in 
Georgia could have a material adverse effect 
on the local economy and our business. 
Business and investor friendly reforms may not 
continue or may be reversed or such reforms 
and economic growth may be hindered as a 
result of any changes affecting the continuity 
or stability of the current coalition government 
or as a result of a rejection of reform policies 
by the president, the parliament or others.
Georgia is one of the fastest growing 
countries in Eastern Europe, with real GDP 
growth averaging 5.8% during 2005 to 2014 
(according to Geostat) and is considered 
an open market in which to do business. 
Growth-oriented reforms and ongoing 
economic liberalisation since becoming a 
WTO member in 2000 have transformed 
Georgia into a country that is ranked by 
the World Bank as more business friendly 
than both Switzerland and France. In 2014, 
Moody’s and Fitch upgraded the outlook on 
Georgia’s sovereign credit rating to positive, 
citing improved economic prospects and 
the provisional application of the DCFTA.
Regular meetings of the supervisory board 
Audit Committee and the Management 
Board are aimed at analysing such risks, 
elaborating responsive strategies and 
action plans and in this way mitigating 
such risks. The Management Board 
employs a number of legal, accounting 
and macroeconomic advisors and analysts 
that help the Group navigating through 
these risks by means of timely identifying 
them and proactively managing them.
The Group are exposed to the effects of 
fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency 
exchange rates on our financial position and 
cash flows. Our functional currency is the 
Georgian Lari and our principal transactions 
are carried out in GEL. Our exposure to foreign 
exchange risk arises primarily with respect 
to the US Dollar and the Euro. While all of 
our revenues and expenses are in GEL, a 
significant part of the medicines and medical 
disposables that we purchase are imported 
and the prices are pegged to foreign currency 
(mostly US Dollars and/or Euro). Furthermore, 
the prices of almost all of the medical 
equipment that we purchase are also set in 
foreign currency (mostly US Dollars and/or 
Euro). A significant portion of our borrowings 
(primarily loans to fund our expansion 
plans) are denominated in US Dollars.
We expect significant improvement in our 
earnings from the first quarter of 2016 
onwards, due to reduced expenditure on 
interest as we pre-paid GEL 104.4 million 
borrowings at year end 2015/beginning of 
2016 from IPO proceeds, which reduced 
total borrowings to GEL 105.6 million, as at 
31 January 2016. As a result of pre paying 
the borrowings, our net debt to EBITDA 
was zero at the end of 2015, due to cash 
and bank deposits exceeding borrowings.
The Group continuously monitors 
market conditions and reviews market 
changes, performing stress and scenario 
testing to assess our financial position 
in adverse economic conditions.
The Group’s currency risk is controlled 
by setting sensitivity loss limits. Its open 
currency positions are managed by the 
finance department on a day-to-day basis 
and are monitored by the head of reporting 
and analysis on a real time basis.
We have established limits on possible 
losses for each type of operation and 
monitor compliance with such limits.
The Group’s business processes and risk 
management structures are in the process 
of being developed and until they are 
fully developed the risks associated with 
weaknesses in the processes and structures 
are higher than they will be when the new 
processes and structures are in place. 
As part of the IPO process a number 
of policies and procedures were put in 
place in order to ensure that we had a 
robust governance structure in place.
The Group is in the process of designing 
and implementing new business processes 
and risk management structures designed 
to better manage the business and 
ensure that these risks are mitigated as 
far as possible, including processes and 
structures relating to: clinical processes 
and medical records; information 
technology and information security; 
product pricing; operational risk, corporate 
security and business continuity; and risk 
management in the insurance business. 
The Group has recently signed a binding 
memorandum of understanding to acquire 
a 100% equity stake in JSC GPC, a retail 
and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution 
business. If consummated, this acquisition 
will bring a new business line to the 
Group and there are risks that we may 
not be able to integrate the business and 
functions and therefore gain the necessary 
synergies and that management may be 
distracted from other business priorities. 
While retail pharmacy operations represent 
a new business for the Group, JSC GPC 
and the Group together will be the largest 
buyer of pharmaceuticals in Georgia and 
GHG Management expects to be able to 
eliminate unnecessary costs, deliver on 
cost synergies. In addition, some JSC GPC 
pharmacies today offer ambulatory clinical 
services, and the Group plans to realise 
cost and revenue synergies in developing 
its more profitable ambulatory business.
GHG management is experienced in 
integrating new businesses into the Group. 
In addition, the Group has taken action to 
strengthen its team. David Kiladze JSC 
GPC’s CEO for more than 20 years will 
continue to lead the JSC GPC business 
and George Arveladze has recently been 
appointed as the Deputy CEO in charge 
of the ambulatory and pharmaceutical 
business of the Group. George has extensive 
experience in the Georgian retail sector.  50 

Managing risk 
effectively
The following discussion may not contain all the 
information that is important to readers of this 
Annual Report. 
A discussion of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework can be found on page 46. The Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties are outlined on pages 47 to 49. The Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee Report and the Audit Committee Report can 
be found on pages 78 to 80, respectively. In addition, Note 37 of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements provides additional 
detail regarding risk management procedures.
Overview 
The GHG Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework. 
Our approach to risk is founded on a strong risk management 
culture. Managing risk is engrained in our everyday business 
activities. We seek to create an environment where there is 
openness and transparency in how we make decisions and manage 
risks and where business managers own the risks and risk 
management processes associated with their activities. 
The GHG Board determines the Group’s risk appetite and monitors 
risk exposures to ensure that the nature and extent of principal risks 
are aligned with the Group’s overall goals and strategic objectives. 
The GHG Board has adopted formal policies and procedures which 
set out the system through which risks are identified, assessed, 
quantified, managed and monitored. Clearly delegated authority 
levels and reporting lines have been established and comprehensive 
reporting forms an integral part of our framework. 
The GHG Audit Committee and GHG Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee support the GHG Board in overseeing the risk 
management framework, the internal control infrastructure, 
monitoring risk exposures and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems. 
Overall risk management structure
Management of risk is fundamental to the healthcare and insurance 
businesses and is an essential element of the Group’s operations. 
The main risks inherent in the Group’s operations are clinical risk, 
credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including foreign currency and 
interest rate risks), operational risk and legal risk. The following is a 
description of the Group’s risk management policies and procedures 
in respect to those risks. Business risks such as changes in the 
environment, technology and industry are monitored through the 
Group’s strategic planning process.
The Group’s risk management system is based on the principle of 
continually assessing risk throughout the life of any operation and 
includes such stages as: 
• risk identification;
• quality and quantity assessment of a particular risk;
• determination of an acceptable risk level;
• placement of authority limits and creation of reserves;
• use of mitigating actions and mitigation strategies;
• ongoing monitoring and control allowing efficient adjustments in 
case of any negative changes in the conditions on which the 
preliminary risk assessment was made; and
• analysis of efficiency of the risk management system.
The Group conducts its risk management activities within the 
framework of its unified risk management system. 
Risk management bodies
The principal risk management bodies of the Group are the: Board 
of Directors, Audit Committee, Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee, Management Board, Financial Risks Committee (in

Department Reporting Lines
Finance department Deputy CEO, Finance
TMQS Deputy CEO, Clinical
ORMD Deputy CEO, Operations
Legal department General Counsel
TMQS
The main goal of the TMQS management group is to support the 
process of building the organisational excellence in patient care, 
education and research and to align the Company’s mission, vision, 
values and goals with the medical quality and safety issues. The 
group is responsible for: creating the organisation structures for 
quality management in head office as well as in hospitals (facilities), 
establishing and implementing the evidence based practice and 
scientific approach to the quality management, supporting the 
process of standardisation in hospitals, establishing and analysing 
the trends of quality measures and indicators, identification of gaps 
for improvement and coordination of improvement projects in the 
medical facilities, creating the quality reporting system and results 
feedback system, ensuring compliance with data collection and 
reporting requirements for governmental and other regulatory 
agencies, facilitating and ensuring the implementation of patient 
safety and risk management initiatives, establishing the principles for 
statistical analysis, creating and managing the infection control/
prevention process and surveillance in the hospitals.
Finance department
The Finance department is in charge of the Financial Risks 
Management function. It implements the Group’s Financial and Tax 
risks policies by ensuring compliance with: established open 
currency position limits; counterparty limits and counterparty credit 
terms for both, receivables and payables; limits on possible losses 
for the foreign currency and interest rate risks; tax legislations; all 
policies and procedures set by the Financial Risks Committee. The 
Finance department administers the entire Financial Risk 
Management process at the Financial Risks Committee, being 
represented by the Deputy CEO, Finance. The Finance department 
also focuses on the Group’s relationship with the tax authorities and 
provides practical advice and tax optimisation plans for the Group 
and, also, assesses the entire Group’s tax risks and exposures and 
reports to the Management Board. 
The finance department also manages foreign currency exchange, 
money market and derivatives operations and monitors compliance 
within the limits set by the Financial Risks Committee for these 
operations. It is also responsible for management of long and 
short-term liquidity and cash flow and monitors the volumes of cash 
on the Group’s accounts for the purposes of their sufficiency.
The finance department manages credit risks with respect to 
particular debtors and assesses overall portfolio risks for entire 
receivables. It is responsible for ensuring compliance with the 
Group’s Credit Risk Policy and approved credit terms, management 
of the quality of the Group’s receivables portfolio. It also prepares 
analysis of the impaired, aged and bad debts and performs the bad 
debt (soft and hard) collection function, in accordance with the set 
out policies. 
ORMD
The ORMD is responsible for identification and assessment of 
operational risk categories within the Group’s processes and 
operations. It is also responsible for detecting critical risk areas or 
groups of operations with an increased risk level, and developing 
international procedures to address those risks, including without 
limitation, developing business-process optimisation schemes, 
including document circulation, information streams, and distribution 
of functions, permissions and responsibility.
Risk measurement and reporting
The Group measures risk using a method which reflects both the 
expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and 
unexpected losses. These models use probabilities derived from 
historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. 
The Group also runs worse case scenarios that could arise in 
the event those extreme events, however unlikely to occur do, 
in fact, occur. 
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on 
limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business 
strategy and market environment of the Group as well as the level of 
risk that it is willing to accept. The Group also conducts ongoing 
monitoring and control allowing efficient adjustments in case of any 
unexpected changes in the conditions on which the preliminary risk 
assessment was made. In addition the Group monitors and 
measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the 
aggregate risk exposure across all risks types and activities. 
The Group maintains a management reporting system which 
requires the Finance department to prepare certain reports on a 
monthly basis. On a monthly basis, a statement of operations, 
balance sheet, cash flows and financial risk reports (which include 
the Group’s open foreign exchange positions, cash flows, limits and 
balances on bank accounts, liquidity position and analysis, credit 
risk position and analysis) are prepared. Based on those reports the 
Finance department assesses and manages the financial risks and 
confirms whether or not the Group has been in compliance with the 
mandatory financial ratios and its policies. Also, on an annual basis, 
a similar set of reports, including financial analysis, is submitted to 
the Board to assess the Group’s overall performance.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and 
processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks. This 
information is presented and explained to the Management Board, 
and the head of each business division. The report includes 
aggregate credit exposure, profitability, efficiency and liquidity ratios 
as well as the risk profile changes. Senior management assesses 
the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly 
basis. The Management Board receives a comprehensive risk report 
once a quarter which is designed to provide all the necessary 
information to assess and draw conclusions on the Group’s 
risk exposure.
Specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed  
for all levels throughout the Group in order to ensure that all 
business divisions have access to extensive, relevant and  
up-to-date information. 
Risk mitigation and excessive risk concentration
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses different 
financial instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes in 
interest rates, foreign currencies, pricing risk, credit risk and 
exposures arising from forecast transactions. While these are 
intended for hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting.  54 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Strategic report
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged 
in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic 
region, or have similar economic features that would cause their 
ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by 
changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations 
indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to 
developments affecting a particular industry or geographical 
location. In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the 
Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus 
on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of 
credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly. 
Clinical risk 
The TMQS is in charge of the entire healthcare risk assessment and 
management. Healthcare risk assessment and reporting system 
requires the quality management group (head office and hospitals) 
to prepare specifically designed reports on a monthly basis, to 
identify the potential risks and gaps for improvement, and to prepare 
tailored recommendations for those improvements. Risks are 
identified from a number of internal and external sources. Internal 
sources are: incident reports (sentinel event, near misses, 
medication dispensing errors, adverse drug reactions, injury 
reports), peer review activities, complaints and claims, patient and 
staff satisfaction surveillance reports, quality and safety measures 
and indicators, clinical audit, medical records. External sources are: 
financial penalties, lawsuits, review reports and correction reports 
issued by the healthcare regulator. Through assessing the proper 
data and information, the TMQS identifies whether or not each of the 
medical facility and the Company are in compliance with preliminary 
defined quality and safety goals. TMQS also identifies what is the 
financial loss attributable to medical malpractice and penalties. 
Clinical risk assessment and analysis process is based on the 
detailed study of the failure events, analysis of the risks associated 
with these failure events and their root causes as well. 
The clinical staff and quality management group are actively involved 
in the risk treatment process. Risk treatment strategies include the 
following: risk acceptance, risk avoidance and risk reduction and 
minimisation. Quality staff reviews the measures for risk assessment 
on a monthly basis: mortality rates, rehospitalisation rate, length of 
stay, safety measures including intra-hospital infections, 
complication and adverse reactions rate. Having analysed the data 
and identifying the trends, quality management group creates a list 
of recommendations for improvement. 
The quality management group reviews the mortality cases 
identifying cases for detailed analysis. This group also coordinates 
the mortality and morbidity reviewing activities in the hospitals. 
Based on the root cause analysis and principles, these activities 
establish, the opportunities for system improvement. Creating the 
culture of safety and trust, we encourage the event reporting 
process. Through monthly analysis of the trends of penalties from 
state and other official agencies, the quality management group has 
the opportunity to assess the clinical activities from the legislations 
point of view. It identifies missed opportunities for improving the 
quality of medical charts, coding and billing activities. Training of 
medical and administrative personnel in basics of management is a 
way to achieve these goals.
The TMQS department reviews quarterly the revenue 
breakdown and identifies trends according the medical 
services. Identifying the areas for financial loss and matching 
these trends with quality of care, it identifies the ways for cost 
effective improvement of the clinical activities. The department 
also reviews the standardisation of patient flow, information 
and documentation flows in the hospitals, to further reduce 
the process variation and to improve control mechanisms.
The Clinical Risk Management process is a regularly, recurring 
routine process. The TMQS Department prepares and submits 
a set of regular reports and analysis to the Management 
Board and the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee. 
Local laws and regulations determine how a medical facility 
is to be designed, used and maintained. Compliance with the 
laws and regulation requirements are monitored on a regular 
basis and results are presented to management. The Company 
provides regular reporting to the relevant State authorities 
regarding compliance with the respective laws and regulations. 
In addition to federal requirements, local authorities also 
perform annual inspections and report on findings, providing 
recommendations to the Company to amend and improve 
identified areas of non-compliance or inconsistencies. The 
reports are studied and analysed by the Operations department, 
first of all, and then submitted to the Company’s Management 
Board for discussion. Responsive measures and action 
plans are being developed, approved and implemented, to 
address areas of non-compliance and underlying risks. 
The Company employs highly skilled and regularly trained technical 
personnel. These specialists undertake regular monitoring and 
maintenance of the facilities. Heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning, power systems and utility systems are maintained by 
in-house team of technicians. This process is divided into three 
parts: 1) Testing; 2) Evaluation; and 3) Processing. Technicians 
ensure that spare parts and accessories are replaced timely and 
periodically, in accordance with the respective manufacturer’s 
recommendations. For sophisticated facility components and 
complicated technical maintenance, services are performed by the 
respectively authorised manufacturer representatives. 
The fire alarm and fire safety systems are in compliance with the 
State regulations including fire-hoses, fire-escapes and evacuation 
plans. For risk minimisation purposes, the generators, medical gas 
stations and other high-risk objects are placed outside the main 
buildings, in specially constructed areas. Other physical safety 
issues have been examined by an outside consulting agency and an 
appropriate action plan has been adopted by the Management, 
which is being currently implemented, in stages.
Medical equipment is maintained either by the in-house team of 
professional engineers, or by the suppliers of the equipment, or by 
contracted outsourced companies (authorised service companies 
only). The maintenance is being conducted in accordance with the 
specifications determined by the respective manufacturer. The 
Company maintains a database of all medical equipment it owns, 
with indication of maintenance requirements, actual maintenance 
needs and time schedules. The regular performance evaluation, 
technical check-ups and monitoring of the equipment is conducted 
by a team of in-house professional engineers.
Normally, and in the vast majority of occasions, new medical 
equipment has a service and guarantee period from six months to 
three years. Additionally, the Company has signed multi-year service 
agreements for maintenance of the high-tech medical equipment. 
At least annually, the Company conducts technical check-ups for the 
entire medical equipment. Check-ups include testing, calibration (if 
required) and safety checks. Inspectors/engineers are equipped with 
a wide set of special testing devices and professional equipment 
for check-ups.
Management is updated by the Operations department through a 
semi-annual medical equipment status report.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its 
payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress 
circumstances. The Group’s capability to discharge its liabilities is 
dependent on its ability to realise an equivalent amount of assets 
within the same period of time. To limit this risk, management has 
arranged diversified funding sources. It manages assets with 
liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a 
regular basis. This incorporates an assessment of expected cash 
flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be 
used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable assets (mostly 
current accounts and time deposits with commercial banks) that it 
believes can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen 
interruption of cash flows. It also usually acquires committed lines of 
credit that it can access to meet its liquidity needs. 
The Group has established a comprehensive analysis to be 
conducted on a regular basis to identify potential liquidity crisis 
indicators as well as to ensure that sufficient funding of the 
Group’s operations are available at any moment under the 
Base Case scenario. 
The Group defines the asset and liability mismatching risk as 
the risk that as of any date, the total amount of liabilities to 
be settled/repaid may exceed the total amount of the readily 
available cash and cash equivalents or other liquid assets that 
may be immediately converted into cash. To avoid this, the Group 
manages maturity matching of financial assets and financial 
liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on several key liquidity 
ratios and the negative maturity gaps. The ratios are assessed 
and monitored on a monthly basis and compared against set 
limits. In case of deviations amendment strategies/actions are 
discussed and approved by the Financial Risks Committee. In 
case of large significant deviations from the set limits of the ratios 
or negative gaps, the Group assesses the probability of 100% 
withdrawal of all liabilities as they mature, based on prior history 
and statistics, during the crisis as well as during usual business 
conditions. Based on identified liquidity drawbacks, Management 
defines its respective funding strategies and action plan. 
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows:
• Accounts payable;
• International borrowings;
• Loans and borrowings from local commercial banks;
• Debt securities issues;
• Revenue from healthcare services;
• Net insurance premiums earned; and
• Other operating income.
An important tool of liquidity management is a matching of the credit 
terms between the key receivables, on one hand, and the key 
payables on the other. The Financial Risks Committee sets the credit 
terms for both, accounts receivable and accounts payable and sets 
policies for the respective matching and credit term gaps. 
The Group regularly analyses the maturity profile of its financial 
liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations. 
Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice 
were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects that 
many suppliers and creditors will not request repayment on the 
earliest date. 
The liquidity Management process is a regular monthly recurring 
process. Overall, the process is managed through the Liquidity 
Management framework, approved by the Financial Risks 
Committee. The framework models the ability of the Group to fund 
under both normal conditions, under the Base Case, and during a 
crisis/stressed situations. This approach is designed to ensure that 
the funding framework is sufficiently flexible to ensure liquidity under 
a wide range of market conditions. The liquidity management 
framework is reviewed annually to ensure it is appropriate to the 
Group’s current and planned activities. The annual review 
encompasses liquidity stress testing, the respective funding 
scenarios modelled, the modelling approach, international as well as 
local funding capacities, limit determination and minimum holdings 
of liquid assets. The liquidity framework is reviewed by the Financial 
Risks Committee prior to approval by the Management Board. 
Liquidity management involves: 
• ensuring that the Group has sufficient cash and cash equivalents 
available for funding its regular business operations; 
• ensuring that the Group has sufficient cash and cash equivalents 
that may become needed during unexpected crisis to fund its 
unusual and extraordinary business operations, including 
customer accounts payable or borrowings urgency repayments, 
and other crisis trends, when they occur; 
• ensuring that the Group regularly and consistently complies with 
the internal ratios and liquidity requirements set by the Group’s 
Management for the purposes of ensuring the above goals; 
• ensuring that Imedi L regularly and consistently complies with the 
Insurance State Supervision Service of Georgia (the “ISSSG”) 
liquidity ratio requirement as well as internal liquidity requirements 
of the Group, as established by Management; and
• ensuring the Group has adequate plans in place for sound 
liquidity management. 
The Group has the following liquidity management policies: 
• To maintain ISSSG liquidity requirements at least at minimal 
required levels in Imedi L;
• To maintain the internally set limits for the key liquidity ratios, such 
as: negative maturity gap position limit, liquid assets to total debt, 
liquid assets to total assets, EBITDA to total debt, Debt Service 
Ratio, Days Sales Outstanding for receivables, net minimal 
operating cash flows limits, unsecured funding limits, short-term 
vs. long-term funding limits, long-term debt repayment 
concentration limits; and
• To be able to continue stable operational activity at least during 
30 working days under Distressed Scenarios.
Key liquidity management body of the Group is the Financial 
Risks Committee. 
The finance department is actively involved in liquidity management 
on a daily basis. The finance department monitors, on a daily basis, 
those key liquidity ratios and liquidity measures that are analysed by 
the Financial Risks Committee and Management Board on a monthly 
basis. Such monitoring involves the ratios described above, short 
term (up to one month) funding capabilities and funds management, 
short-term and long-term funding opportunities and capacities, 
managing operating cash in both Lari and foreign currency, etc. 
Liquidity regulatory reporting is limited to the Imedi L ’s report on the 
calculation of the minimal adequacy of liquid reserves, as prescribed 
by the ISSSG.  56 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Strategic report
The ISSSG liquidity position is assessed and managed by Imedi L 
primarily on a stand-alone basis, based on the liquidity requirements 
established by the ISSSG. As of 31 December 2015 the calculation

The liquidity Risk Management process is a regularly, recurring 
routine process. The finance department prepares and submits a 
set of regular reports and analysis to the Financial Risks Committee 
and the Management Board on a quarterly basis. 
The Management Board believes that the Group’s liquidity is 
sufficient to meet each of its present requirements. For information 
on the Group’s liquid assets, liabilities and maturity profile of the 
Group’s financial liabilities as well as further information on the 
liquidity risk of the Group see Note 37 of the Notes to consolidated 
financial statements of this Annual Report. 
Market risk 
The Group is exposed to market risk (including pricing risk, currency 
exchange rate risk and the interest rate risk), which is the risk that 
the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will 
fluctuate due to changes in market variables. Market risk exposures, 
such as foreign currency and interest rate exposures, arise from 
open positions in fixed income and/or open foreign currency 
positions, all of which are exposed to market fluctuations. The 
general principles of the Group’s market risk management policy are 
set by the Financial Risks Committee. The Group aims to limit and 
reduce the amount of possible losses on open market positions 
which may be incurred by the Group due to negative changes in 
currency exchange rates, or interest rates, or quotes on securities. 
The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or 
non-trading positions. In order to address these risks, the Financial 
Risks Committee specifically establishes limits on possible losses for 
each type of operation and the Finance department monitors 
compliance with such limits.
Risk management continued
Borrowed funds maturity breakdown as at the year-end is as follows: 
31 December 2015 
Repayment schedule, GEL million 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022

% of total assets 4.9% 8.9% 3.8% 3.2% 1.9% 1.6% 0.1%
As for the pricing risk, it mostly arises from the fact that sales 
prices set by the Group on its own products and services 
may vary, due to the Group management reasons or due to 
competitive or other environmental and regulatory reasons. 
The Financial Risks Committee regularly reviews the Group’s 
pricing list, compares it against market competitive forces, 
against the state tariffs through UHC, performs analysis of the 
pricing structure by products and services and determines 
the most efficient service/product/sales mix and strategy for 
improving margins through optimisation of the pricing policies. 
Currency exchange rate risk
Currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. The Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuation 
in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial 
position. The Group’s currency risk is calculated as an aggregate 
of open positions and is controlled by setting a sensitivity loss 
limits (established by the Financial Risks Committee) with respect 
to the Group’s currency basket. The Group uses the historical 
simulation method based on one-year statistical data. Its open 
currency positions are managed by the Finance department on 
a day-to-day basis and are monitored by the Head of Reporting 
and Analysis on a real-time basis. The Financial Risks Committee 
sets open currency position limits with respect to both, short-
term and long-term positions and stop-loss limits. Currently, the 
Group’s proprietary trading position is limited by the Financial 
Risks Committee to 5% of the total shareholders’ equity. 
Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk as a result of borrowing 
at fixed interest rates, subject to regular refinancing needs, at newer 
market terms, i.e. newer interest rates. The Group’s exposure to 
interest risk also arises as a result of its investment in current 
accounts, demand deposits and term deposits with commercial 
banks interest rates on which differ from those of term borrowings at 
fixed and floating interest rates. Interest margins on assets and 
liabilities having different maturities may increase or decrease as a 
result of changes in market interest rates.
The majority of the Group’s term financial assets and term financial 
liabilities have fixed interest rates. In order to minimise interest rate 
risk, the Group monitors its interest rate (reprising) gap and 
maintains an interest rate margin or loss acceptable under the 
existing circumstances. The Financial Risks Committee sets limits  
on those gaps as well as defining the interest policies of the Group 
by defining the interest rate ranges through which financial assets 
must be invested in or financial liabilities must be attracted at. 
Compliance with the Group’s interest rate policy is monitored  
by the Finance department.
Pricing risk
The Group has a high concentration of its revenues from state 
through UHC. The state does not regulate prices for healthcare 
services and products in Georgia. Both, market forces as well as 
the contractual terms with the Company’s largest client – the State 
impact the Company’s revenues. The pricing risk is the Company’s  57

susceptibility to potential changes and variations in its sales prices 
for the healthcare services and products, either through market 
forces or through the state funded UHC. The Pricing Committee, 
supported by the Finance department performs regular monitoring 
of the Company’s price list and related profit margins, compares 
them against competitors, to assess competitiveness, and against 
the UHC, to assess the magnitude of deviations from it and the 
respective additional out-of-pocket needs for its patients. The Pricing 
Committee sets the optimal service and product mixes in order to 
optimise price mixes and maximise profits. The finance department 
monitors implementation of those mixes and policies in practice. 
Market Risk Management process is a regularly, recurring routine 
process. The finance department prepares and submits a set of 
regular reports and analysis to the Financial Risks Committee, the 
Pricing Committee and the Management Board. 
The Financial Risks Committee sets minimum or maximum limits 
(as deemed necessary) on the majority of the above defined ratios/
covenants and exposures. The Pricing Committee sets prices for the 
Company’s healthcare services and products as well as the product/
service mix strategies for the margins/profits optimisation purposes. 
The Financial Risks Committee and the Pricing Committee, together 
with the Finance department, undertake an annual review of 
the Group’s and the Company’s market risk profile that outlines 
the current market strategy for the coming year. This review 
encompasses trends in the local markets, macroeconomic and 
regulatory environment affecting the market and competitive forces 
locally as well as globally, funding and investment alternatives, 
peer analysis, estimation of the Group’s upcoming reprising 
requirements, estimated market capacity and pricing risk analysis. 
Credit risk 
The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that a 
debtor or counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full or 
in part when due. Credit risk arises mainly in the context of the 
Group’s regular sales activities from its healthcare products 
and services as well as insurance products and services. The 
general principles of the Group’s credit policy are outlined in its 
Credit Risk Policy. The Credit Risk Policy also outlines credit 
risk control and monitoring procedures and the Group’s credit 
risk management systems. The Credit Risk Policy is reviewed 
annually or more frequently, if necessary. As a result of these 
reviews, new procedures addressing the standards and 
methodology for provisioning of receivables pursuant to IFRS 
requirements is implemented and being regularly updated. 
The Group manages its credit risk through: the Financial Risks 
Committee and Finance department, which has a specially 
designated Risk Management unit and also encompasses the 
receivables collection functions. 
The Group manages its credit risk by placing limits on the amount of 
risk accepted with respect to individual corporate debtors, individual 
retail debtors and the state, by setting and managing the credit 
terms for its receivables and by establishing a sound soft collection 
practice, tailored to the specifics of the credit risk profiles. The 
Group monitors its credit terms and credit limits, as well as detailed 
ageing of each debtor to undertake proper measures in respect of 
each individual debtor. The Group’s largest and major exposure of 
credit risk is the State. It applies the standard sovereign risk to that 
exposure. On a daily basis the Group monitors state payments 
performance in close cooperation with the Ministry of Labor, Health 
and Social Affairs, for the timely settlement of invoices. 
The Group additionally monitors the macroeconomic environment in 
Georgia and budgetary performance of the state to assess the 
forecasted future cash flows from the state. Exposure to individual 
corporate or retail debtors is analysed on an individual basis, based 
on the credit terms, limits and aging. The Group uses a prepayment 
or, in case of a credit term, a collective, legally binding credit 
responsibility in case of the individual free flow customers. This 
enables the Group to faster initiate and execute further collection in 
case of non-payment. As for the corporate debtors, its majority 
comprises insurance companies and provider clinics/hospitals. With 
the majority of these corporate debtors most of them there is a two 
way movement of services and, respectively invoices. The Group 
actively uses netting of receivables and payables as the fastest way 
of settlement with them. For the net receivables, after the netting, 
properly set and legally well probed collection procedures are 
applied, in case of non-payment. 
The Financial Risks Committee approves individual transactions with 
large single exposure and large credit risk concentration. It also 
establishes credit risk categories and provisioning rates in respect of 
such transactions. The Deputy CEO, Finance and Finance 
department adopt, in consultation with the Management Board and 
the Financial Risks Committee, decisions on the acceleration and 
write-off of the non-performing receivables/debtors. 
The Group’s credit quality review process provides early 
identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular revision of the credit terms 
fulfilment, debt services and ageing analysis. Counterparty limits are 
established and each counterparty is assigned a risk rating based 
on the past performance and ageing. Risk ratings are subject to 
regular revision. The credit quality review process allows the Group 
to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is 
exposed and take corrective action. 
The Group’s compliance with credit risk exposure limits and credit 
terms is monitored by the Finance department on a continuous 
basis. Exposure limits and credit terms are subject to annual or more 
frequent review. The Group establishes provisions for impairment 
losses of financial assets (mostly receivables from healthcare 
services and insurance premiums receivable) when there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. The Group creates provisions by reference to the particular 
debtor’s credit rating (in case of state and corporate or institutional 
customers/debtors) and, also, by reference to the past debt service 
and the aging analysis in respect of all debtors including individuals. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed by an adjusted provision 
account. Determination of provisions for impairment losses is based 
on the Group’s credit risk policy and provisioning methodology, 
which is approved and updated by the Financial Risks Committee, 
and reflects the amount which, in the judgment of Management, is 
adequate to provide for losses incurred. Provisions are made as a 
result of an individual appraisal of financial assets. Provisions are 
made against gross amounts receivable.
Under the Group’s internal receivables provisioning methodology, 
which is based upon IFRS requirements, the Group categorises its 
receivables into the following homogeneous categories: receivables 
from state, receivables from insurance companies, receivables from 
corporate customers and healthcare service providers and 
receivables from individuals. Receivables from state is provisioned at 
the sovereign credit risk rate of Georgia. Receivables from insurance 
companies and corporate customers and healthcare service 
providers on an individual assessment basis, analysing net 
exposures, analysing the prior history of their debt service and the 
ageing of current outstanding exposures. Receivables from 
individuals are assessed collectively, based on the historical loss 
rates for the unimpaired category (less than 30 days overdue) and 
collectively as well for the impaired ones (more than 30 days 
overdue). Collective assessment of the impaired receivables from 
individuals (more than 30 days overdue) is based on the overdue 
buckets, aggregating credit exposures by the number of days 
overdue. The worse is the bucket, i.e. the more is the number of  58 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Strategic report
days overdue for each particular credit exposure, the higher is  
the impairment rate. Amounts overdue for more than one year  
are provisioned from 80% to 100% of the total gross receivable 
and are further written off and transferred to debt collection  
service providers. 
The Group has a receivables collection unit within the Finance 
department, which reports to the Deputy CEO, Finance. It analyses 
overdue bad debt on a regular (monthly) basis, proposes the write 
off amounts to the Management Board, supervises the soft 
collection process conducted by the call centre and analyses results 
and efficiency of the soft collection, monitors hard collection service 
providers for efficient work. 
The credit risk management process is an ongoing routine process. 
The finance department prepares and submits a set of regular 
reports and analysis to the Financial Risks Management Committee 
and the Management Board. 
Operational risk 
The Group is exposed to operational risks, arising out of the various 
operational activities in which it is engaged. Operational risk is the 
risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or 
external events. When controls fail to perform, operational risks can 
cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or 
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all 
operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring 
and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the 
risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and 
assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
The Group manages its operational risks by establishing, monitoring 
and continuously improving its policies relating to the various 
aspects of the Group’s cash, payments, accounting, sales, trading 
and core processing operations and data backup and disaster 
recovery arrangements.
The ORMD is responsible for identification and assessment of 
operational risk categories within the Group’s processes and 
operations, detecting critical risk areas or groups of operations 
with an increased risk level, developing response actions and the 
imposition of restrictions in critical risk zones to neutralise identified 
risk and developing business-process optimisation schemes, 
including document circulation, information streams, distribution 
of functions, permissions and responsibilities. The ORMD is also 
responsible for developing and updating policies and procedures 
and ensuring that these policies and procedures meet or exceed 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as helping 
to ensure that significant operating risks stay within acceptable 
levels. It also conducts monitoring activities and performs 
periodic assessments of the Group’s internal control systems 
to detect any infringement or errors on the part of the Group’s 
departments and divisions. An operational risk manager (head of 
the department), who reports to the Deputy CEO, Operations is 
responsible for the oversight of the Group’s operational risks.
Taxation risk 
The Group is exposed to taxation risks, arising out of the various 
economic activities in which it is engaged. Taxation risk is the risk of 
having additional charges or levies imposed on the Group as a result 
of non-compliance with the tax regulation, or the risk of material 
litigations arising from such non-compliance, including the risk of 
ceasing business due to such litigations. 
Brief summary of the Tax Unit is as follows: 
• Functions of the Tax Unit involve: 1) tax filing and tax reporting; 
and 2) tax risk management, tax compliance and tax litigation; 
these functions are centralised in the Group and cover both, the 
Company and Imedi L, on a centralised basis
• The tax Unit reports directly to the Deputy CEO, Finance 
• Occasionally the Group and its Tax Unit seek external advice  
and support on taxation matters, from different advisors, 
involving audit and accountancy firms as well as law firms,  
under different jurisdictions
Key functions of the Tax Unit are: 
• Review of key contracts and issuance of tax approval to the 
contract owners
• Review of the Group’s new products and services or changes to 
existing products and services and issuance of tax clearance/
approval to the service and product owners
• Regular tax reviews of the Group and its subsidiaries and 
issuance of respective review and due diligence reports with 
indication of key risks, potential deviations from tax legislation 
and respective recommendations
Legal risk 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is also subject to legal 
actions and complaints arising not only from the Group’s usual 
operations as well as from tax litigations or tax disputes or other 
regulatory disputes (such as the regulatory matters and other). Legal 
risk is the combination of: 
• the risk of suffering losses from the litigations where the Group is 
a respondent (tax litigations, customer litigations, regulator 
litigations, etc.); 
• the risk of not winning benefits or recoveries where the Group is a 
plaintiff (recoveries of receivable, customer litigations, etc.); 
• the risk of material breaches of contracts and related covenants 
with the risk of default to the Group (large lenders, large 
corporate customers, regulator, etc.); 
• the risk of weak contracting with the detrimental or non-feasible 
terms to the Group (large customers, large suppliers, etc.); and 
• the risk of legal non-compliance with the insurance, or healthcare 
or tax and other regulations effective in the operating 
environment, that may result in default, or event of default or 
charges/liens to the Group. 
Structure of the Legal department is as follows: 
• Litigation team;
• Contractual team;
 – Healthcare and insurance service contracts with customers: 
 – Corporate
 – Retail
 – Non-service contracts (such as SPAs, MoUs, asset purchase 
agreements, rent agreements, etc.) 
• Public registry unit;
• Legislative monitoring unit.

Key functions of the Legal department in terms of the legal risk 
management are: 
• Appearing in court as a respondent on behalf of the Group; 
• Appearing in court as a plaintiff on behalf of the Group; 
• Looking at each case when the Group, as a plaintiff, is 
represented by other departments; 
• Legal compliance of all new services, products or projects 
initiated by the Group; 
• Drafting all types of standard contracts (contract templates) for 
other departments;
• Drafting all major non-service and non-customer related 
contracts;
• Drafting cross-border and M&A agreements;
• Monitoring draft legislative changes; 
• Advising on changes to current legislation;
• Legal consulting of other departments/employees;
• Organising relation with notary bureaus;
• Providing legal assistance for subsidiaries;
• Working on legal support for funding.
Each new service or product initiated in the Group goes through the 
Legal department for legal opinion. In most cases the responsible 
lawyer is involved in the service or product development process 
from the very beginning. The lawyer assigned to the project 
assesses the legal risks and gives particular advice to the project 
team. When the product receives its final form it comes to the 
legal department before submitting to the Management Board or 
Board of Directors, as applicable, for final approval from a legal 
perspective. If there are no legal risks or they are all adequately 
mitigated and the new service or product is acceptable from a legal 
point of view, it receives approval from the Legal department.
The Legal department is in charge of the contract drafting 
process, each standard contract in the Group is drafted by the 
Legal department. All other departments involved in this process 
are obliged to use such drafts. Any change in the standard 
version is subject to approval by the Legal department. 
The Legal department has a leading role in the litigation process. 
It represents the Group as a defendant in every court dispute. 
The head of Legal together with her deputies maintain a register 
of all litigations where the Group is a defendant. Each litigation 
is managed on an individual basis. The probability of the final 
outcome, for each individual litigation, is also assessed by the 
Legal department. The Legal department leads the entire process, 
it decides which internal or external experts need to be involved, 
and makes other decisions necessary for each individual litigation. 
Based on the assessment of the probabilities of the outcome, 
an initial assessment of the entire amount of claim per case, 
together with the probability assessment is provided to the Finance 
department. Based on this assessment, the Finance department 
defines the amount of provision required for each litigation as well 
as in aggregate. This process is a regular monthly process. 
Lawyers from the Legal department appear in court on behalf of 
the Group, as a plaintiff. The litigation team also looks at each case 
when the Group, as a plaintiff, is represented by other departments. 
Lawyers from the litigation team are directly involved in case 
preparation process. 
Legal department is monitoring entire portfolio of cases where 
the Group is a claimant. It also presents portfolio analysis on a 
quarterly basis.  60 

GHG’s revenue growth of 22.5% was primarily driven by our 
healthcare services business, which reported revenue of GEL 195.0 
million, up 32.5% y-o-y with strong organic growth of 17.3%, and the 
remaining 15.2% growth coming from recent acquisitions. Our 
medical insurance business contributed GEL 55.3 million to total 
revenue, recording a decrease of 20.8% y-o-y, which was primarily 
driven by the shift to the UHC, partially offset by a strong 32.0% 
y-o-y growth in revenue from private medical insurance products.
Healthcare services revenue growth of 32.5% was primarily driven 
by referral hospitals, which posted revenue of GEL 168.5 million in 
2015, up 36.6% y-o-y, driven by strong organic growth and 
acquisitions. Referral hospitals contributed 88% to total revenue 
from healthcare services. We expect a significant portion of the 
future growth of our hospital revenue to come from referral hospitals, 
in line with our strategy to increase our market share to 1/3 across 
Georgia through further investments in renovation and expansion of 
existing referral hospital facilities. Our organic healthcare services 
revenue growth of 17.3% was largely sourced from referral hospitals. 
Community hospitals, contributing 9% to total revenue from 
healthcare services, also posted strong 24.8% growth in revenue to 
GEL 17.6 million, attributable solely to organic growth driven by the 
introduction of the UHC.
Ambulatory clinics, contributing only 3% to total revenue from 
healthcare services, posted revenue of GEL 5.3 million, also up y-o-y 
as a result of organic growth alone that was mainly driven by our 
ambulatory clinics in Tbilisi. Currently, we operate ten ambulatory 
clinics organised in four ambulatory clusters, of which three 
ambulatory clusters were opened towards the end of 2015. As a 
result their impact on 2015 financial results was not material. We 
expect ambulatory clinic revenue to grow significantly faster over the 
next few years, in line with our strategy of launching an additional 
10-12 ambulatory clusters with a total of 20 to 30 ambulatory clinics 
in the next two to three years.
Revenue from ambulance and rural primary care services was 
discontinued in the end of 2014 due to the full handover of the 
administration function related to these services to the government 
as part of the UHC. The handover contributed to the improvement of 
our operating margins as our ambulance and rural primary care 
services line had very low profitability. 
Our organic revenue growth of 17.3% was largely sourced from 
government-funded healthcare programmes, especially the UHC. 
Since the full roll-out of the UHC in mid-2014, government 
expenditure on healthcare has grown considerably, increasing 81.4% 
from GEL 487.9 million in 2013 to GEL 885.0 million, according to the 
approved government budget for 2016. Out of GEL 885.0 million, 
addressable market for GHG is GEL 668.1 million, which includes 
GEL 570 million for the UHC and GEL 98.1 million for other 
healthcare programmes financed by the state, in addition to  
UHC. As of 2015, GHG’s market share was 22.9% and 12.2%,  
for the UHC and other healthcare programmes financed by  
the state, respectively.

Overview Financial statements Additional information Governance
Our revenue from government-funded healthcare programmes was 
GEL 145.7 million, up 80.1% y-o-y. The dramatic growth was 
primarily driven by the UHC and more than offset the anticipated 
decline in revenues from private medical insurance companies under 
the previous system, which slid in 2015 to GEL 10.9 million.
Out-of-pocket payments by patients increased to GEL 34.8 million. 
The UHC places coverage limits on medical treatments, co-
payments and has certain exclusions (i.e. charges that are not 
covered by the UHC). Any charges in excess of the limit and 
co-payments are covered by patients on an out-of-pocket basis.
As a result, in 2015 our healthcare services revenue was sourced  
as follows:
• 76% from the government (up from 56% a year ago, when the 
UHC implementation was in progress prior to full implementation 
in September 2014)
• 18% was sourced from out-of-pocket payments (down from 22% 
a year ago) and 
• 6% was sourced from private medical insurance companies 
(down from 22% a year ago) 
We expect the share of out-of-pocket payments and revenue from 
private medical insurance companies to increase over the next few 
years, as a result of the rollout of our ambulatory expansion strategy, 
as the larger proportion of elective out-patient services are still 
financed by patients themselves.
High double-digit growth in our healthcare service revenues was 
partially offset by the anticipated decline in medical insurance 
revenues. As government spending on healthcare was consolidated 
under the UHC, the revenue from our medical insurance business 
decreased to GEL 55.3 million. Medical insurance business revenue 
from the state declined steadily in 2014 and reduced to zero by the 
end of 2015. Our private medical insurance, however, has shown 
resilience and revenue from private medical insurance products 
grew by 32.0%, with approximately 234,000 people holding our 
medical insurance policies as at 31 December 2015. This growth 
reflected improved pricing and the introduction of differentiated 
products, as well as more targeted sales efforts and an increase in 
our sales-force which has led to an increase in the number of people 
insured. Within the changed private insurance landscape that 
resulted from the introduction of the UHC, our medical insurance 
business has strengthened its market share and now accounts for 
38.4% of the total medical insurance sector of Georgia based on net 
insurance premium revenue as of 30 September 2015, up from 
36.0% as of 31 December 2014.
Despite the decline in the relative size of our medical insurance 
business due to the introduction of the UHC, our medical insurance 
business plays a crucial role in our business model. Our medical 
insurance business is an important feeder for our medical services 
business, and that role will, we believe, be significantly enhanced in 
the future as we roll-out our ambulatory growth strategy. In 2015, our 
medical insurance claims expense was GEL 46.1 million, of which 
GEL 24.1 million (52% of total) was inpatient, GEL 12.2 million (27% 
of total) was outpatient and GEL 9.8 million (21% of total) was drugs. 
Only GEL 7.4 million, or 16.1% of total of our medical insurance 
claims were retained within GHG. The feeder role of our medical 
insurance business is particularly important for our ambulatory 
services. In 2015, GEL 3.5 million, or 33.7% of our ambulatory 
medical insurance claims were retained within GHG. With our

recently launched ambulatory clinics and the ambitious ambulatory 
expansion strategy, the retention rate should improve in the future on 
a larger base, providing a significant revenue boost. In addition, 
following the expansion of our healthcare services business in 
referral and specialty hospitals in the capital, where our medical 
insurance business has the highest concentration of its insured 
clients, more of our medical insurance customers will be utilising 
more of our hospitals, our facilities are increasingly favoured by 
these customers over competitor facilities due to the better quality of 
service received, access to a one-stop-shop style of service for 
ambulatory services and ease of claim reimbursement procedures.
Our margins improved as a result of the increasing utilisation and 
scale of our business, as well as our continued focus on efficiency 
and the ongoing integration of recently acquired healthcare facilities, 
with a 15.8% increase in total cost of service (COGS) lagging behind 
22.5% growth in revenues.
More than half of the growth in COGS in 2015 came from an 
increase in payroll costs, primarily attributed to recent acquisitions, 
but growth was also driven organically. Since 31 December 2014, 
our headcount has increased by 1,659 employees, of which 1,165 
were added through acquisitions completed in 2015, and reached 
9,709 full-time employees as of 31 December 2015. As at 
31 December 2015, we employed 2,705 doctors and 2,738 nurses, 
up from 2,394 doctors and 2,264 nurses a year ago. The 
disproportionate increase in the cost of materials and supplies is due 
to the impact of recent hospital acquisitions. We acquired DEKA and 
HTMC this year, as well as Traumatology and Sunstone in the 
second half of 2014. Both, HTMC and Traumatology have higher 
levels of cost of materials and supplies versus revenue, compared to 
our other hospitals, as both are large referral hospitals with varied 
service mixes. 
Management follows the relationship between healthcare services 
business costs and revenues closely. Our direct salary rate (expense 
on direct salaries as a percentage of gross revenue) improved to 
34.9%, from 36.7% a year ago, reflecting the integration efforts of 
acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. The materials rate 
(expense on direct materials as a percentage of gross revenue) was 
14.9%, up from 12.3% a year ago, reflecting the addition of referral 
hospitals, which, due to the service mix, have a higher rate of 
expenditure on materials compared to the average of our hospitals.
Medical insurance claims grew due to GEL devaluation against US$ 
drove the retail prices of drugs up, which represent c.20% of our 
medical insurance claims. To address the second driver, we have 
adjusted the pricing and underwriting criteria (copayments) of our 
medical insurance products and it is expected to affect the loss ratio 
gradually, with the renewal of existing contracts or new sales at 
adjusted prices. Additionally, we are renegotiating prices for drugs 
with pharmaceutical distributors, leveraging our combined scale 
from claims on drugs in our medical insurance business and 
purchases of drugs and other medical disposables for our 
healthcare services business. 
The increase in gross profit to GEL 93.1 million in 2015 was 
supported by the 22.5% growth in revenues, which outpaced the 
15.8% growth in cost of services during the period. This drove an 
increase in gross margin (defined as gross profit divided by revenue) 
to 38.4%. 
As our business grew significantly in 2015, we were particularly 
focused on realising synergies from recent acquisitions, which is 
reflected in operating expenses that were well contained in 2015. 
Primarily driven by recent acquisitions, operating expenses 
increased 10.7% y-o-y, with salaries and other employee benefits in 
our healthcare services business constituting a major driver of this 
growth, which results primarily from increased headcount and 
governance costs. Notably, administrative salary rate of our 
healthcare services business (administrative salary expenses as a 
percentage of gross revenue) was 11.8%, up from 10.9% a year ago 
and the SG&A rate (selling, general and administrative expenses as  
a percentage of gross revenue) improved to 4.0%, down from 4.7% 
in 2014.
With revenue growth outpacing this increase in expenses, our 
operating leverage was positive at 14.8 percentage points. Strong 
operating leverage was mainly driven by our healthcare services 
business which posted a positive operating leverage at 10.3 
percentage points y-o-y. This resulted from the realisation of 
post-acquisition synergies, as well as the increasing benefits of the 
scale of our business. These improvements more than offset the 
costs of the new governance structure put in place since the end of 
2014 in preparation for the IPO in 2015.
Furthermore, post-acquisition synergies in our healthcare services 
business are not yet fully reflected in the current financial results, as 
the integration process for a number of recent acquisitions is still 
ongoing. We are continuing our work on realising synergies, mainly 
administrative inefficiencies in recently acquired hospitals, as 
benchmarked against our existing healthcare facilities in the areas of 
procurement, process standardisation and payroll.
The business delivered a significant increase in our EBITDA to GEL 
56.1 million in 2015, driven by healthcare services EBITDA, which 
reached GEL 53.5 million. The EBITDA margin for our healthcare 
services increased by more than three percentage points to 27.4%  
in 2015 toward our longer-term target of at least 30%. The 
improvement is mostly a result of removing inefficiencies brought in 
through the acquisition of new hospitals in 2014 and 2015 as well as 
the increased scale of the business, more than offsetting the costs 
of the new governance structure, as mentioned above.

We expect continued improvement in our EBIDTA margin as a  
result of: 
• The ongoing integration of recently acquired healthcare facilities, 
including the centralisation of some back-office functions; 
• The increased contribution of ambulatory clinics to our revenues, 
which have an EBITDA margin of over 30% and currently 
represent only 3% of our healthcare services revenue (our target 
is to increase ambulatory clinic revenue contribution to 15% in 
2018);
• Recently launched services, and department expansions, 
described under “Update on operating performance, project  
and development highlights” below, picking-up and reaching 
annual run-rates.
The increase in 2015 of depreciation and amortisation costs to GEL 
12.7 million was primarily driven by the completion of acquisitions 
during the past year, but also the completion of large development 
projects in 2015, which are described below under “Update on 
operating performance, project and development highlights”.
The rise in net interest expense to GEL 20.3 million resulted from the 
higher level of borrowings throughout the year, which were incurred 
for financing acquisitions and growth projects, as well as an increase 
in the reference rate for local currency borrowings – a primary 
currency for GHG borrowings. In-line with our previously announced 
intention to deleverage the Group, the majority of the Group’s 
borrowings was repaid in advance at year end 2015/beginning of 
2016 from IPO proceeds. Accordingly, net interest expense is 
expected to decrease significantly in 2016. Borrowings amounted to 
GEL 152.8 million as at 31 December 2015, a 6.2% reduction 
compared to GEL 162.9 million a year ago. Following the advanced 
repayment of our loans from local banks in the beginning of 2016, 
the borrowings further decreased to GEL 105.6 million as at 
31 January 2016, which also includes GEL 35.5 million of US Dollar 
denominated bonds outstanding. Overall, we have repaid a total of 
GEL 104.4 million. As a result of prepayments, our net debt to 
EBITDA was zero as of the end of 2015, due to cash and bank 
deposits exceeded the borrowings. In connection with the advance 
repayments to local banks, we have secured committed credit lines 
in local currency which will be drawn as needed for future capex 
spending. On the back of this exercise in reducing interest expense, 
we have freed up cash flow to finance development capex, which 
should result in lower leverage levels than we initially anticipated. 
The reversal in our net gains from foreign currencies from a loss in 
2014 to a GEL 2.1 million gain in 2015 was primarily a result of GHG’s 
efforts during the end of 2014 to decrease foreign currency risk 
exposure on foreign currency borrowings, compared to previous 
reporting periods. The Company has converted most of its 
borrowings into local currency and the rest was hedged so the short 
position was closed. 
As a result, our profit for the period rose to GEL 23.6 million, up 
78.1% on 2014. The adjusted profit was GEL 28.0 million, which 
reflects in a currency exchange adjustment relating to the proceeds 
received from the capital raise and the positive impact of utilising 
some of the proceeds to reduce the Group’s existing indebtedness 
by GEL 104.4 million to GEL 105.6 million as at 31 January 2016.
Balance sheet highlights
Our balance sheet increased substantially over the last year with 
assets growing to GEL 758.3 million as of 31 December 2015. The 
growth of total assets by GEL 349.0 million y-o-y was largely driven 
by the 69.1% (GEL 181.8 million) increase in GHG’s property and 
equipment, reflecting the acquisition of new hospitals during 2015. 
Cash and bank deposits have also significantly increased, reflecting 
the receipt of the funds raised in the IPO during the end of 2015. The 
increase in shareholders’ equity largely reflects the primary 
placement of equity shares in the IPO.

2015 operating highlights
We operated 2,670 hospital beds in 45 facilities by the end of 2015, 
up from 2,140 beds in 39 facilities a year ago, an increase of 530 
beds resulting in a year-end market share of 26.6%. The increase in 
the number of hospital beds was primarily in Tbilisi, the capital city of 
Georgia, where revenue per bed is significantly higher compared to 
other regions. Our footprint increased in Tbilisi, where our market 
share in beds grew from 14.1% as of 31 December 2014 to 24.0% as 
of 31 December 2015. It reflects the implementation of GHG’s 
expansion strategy that resulted in acquisition of nine hospitals with 
the total of 1,380 beds since the end of 2013. 
In August 2015 we acquired a 50% equity interest in and control of 
GNCo. GNCo is a holding company that owns 100% of HTMC Hospital, 
a major and well-established 450 bed referral hospital in Tbilisi, which is 
also the single largest hospital in Georgia, providing a wide range of 
inpatient and outpatient services, including the largest department of 
oncology radiotherapy in Georgia. HTMC acquisition increased our 
market share by beds by 4.5%, from 22.1% up to 26.6%.
On June 30, 2015 we acquired 95% of the shares of LLC Deka – a 
healthcare company operating in Georgia. After completion of the 
full renovation in May of 2017 it will run at 310 bed capacity. 
Alongside with Deka, we started renovating Sunstone hospital, 
acquired in September of 2014 which will run at a 332 bed capacity. 
Renovating both hospitals will add an additional capacity of c.500. 
Completion of the full renovation of Sunstone is planned for April 
2017, with gradual opening of departments in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Both projects will increase our national and Tbilisi market share in 
beds up to c.30%. 
As a result, our market share by number of beds will approach our 
target of 1/3. However, we have significant room to catch up in terms 
of market share by hospital revenue, which currently stands at c.18%. 
We accelerated the launch of ambulatory clinics in the second half of 
2015, in line with our strategic goal to open 10-12 ambulatory 
clusters, with 20-30 ambulatory clinics within 2-3 years. Currently 
we are predominantly a hospital provider, with under 3% of our 
healthcare services revenue derived from ambulatory clinics. We aim 
to tap the highly fragmented and under-penetrated outpatient 
segment that represents c.40% of national spending on healthcare 
services (excluding pharmaceuticals), where no single player has 
more than 3% of the market. There is currently a very low utilisation 
level of outpatient services in the country (Georgia has the lowest 
average number of outpatient encounters per capita in the region 
– Georgia: 3.5, CIS: 8.9, EU: 7.7) and this, combined with higher 
margins make this sector even more attractive.
We organise our ambulatory clinics in geographic clusters. Each 
ambulatory cluster consists of one District Ambulatory Clinic (a large 
multi-profile ambulatory clinic that provides complex outpatient 
services; total area of 1800-2500 sq/m) and several (3-5) Express 
Ambulatory Clinics (smaller ambulatory clinics providing basic 
outpatient services; total area of 120-200 sq/m) that refer patients to 
District Ambulatory Clinics. Development of ambulatory cluster 
requires approximately US$0.8 million capex, with a payback period 
of up to three years. Ambulatory clinics cater to all age groups and 
provide a wide range of outpatient services, including general 
practitioner and specialist physician consultations, imaging and 
functional diagnostics, as well as clinical, biochemical and serological 
laboratory tests. Currently we operate a total of four ambulatory 
clusters with a total of ten ambulatory clinics, of which three clusters 
and four ambulatory clinics were launched in 2015. We aim to launch 
additional at least six ambulatory clusters during 2016. 
Notable ambulatory developments in 2015:
• In September 2015, we launched our largest multi-profile 
ambulatory clinic in the Tbilisi district of Gldani, that covers a 
population of c.245,000. The clinic will serve as a referral point for 
the Gldani district ambulatory cluster. In December 2015, we 
enhanced the Gldani neighbourhood cluster by adding an 
Express Clinic.
• In November-December 2015, we launched two new ambulatory 
clusters, one in Tbilisi, and one in Kutaisi, the second largest city 
in Georgia. The Tbilisi ambulatory cluster is located in the Varketili 
neighbourhood, which covers a population of c.300,000 and the 
Kutaisi ambulatory cluster covers a population of c.200,000.

We invest in medical technology, on the back of renovated 
infrastructure, enhancing our service mix and introducing new 
services to cater to unfulfilled demand, as indicated by low incidence 
levels that lag far behind peer benchmarks. 
Despite our heavy commitment to acquisitions in 2015, we did not 
neglect investment in organic development. We define development 
capex as additions to GHG’s property, plant and equipment, 
excluding acquisitions. During 2015, we spent a total of GEL 71.2 
million on capital expenditures, an increase of 75.1% y-o-y. Of this, 
maintenance capex was GEL 7.2 million, up 72.2% y-o-y, which 
represented 3.7% of total healthcare business revenues, the same 
level as in 2014. We also spent GEL 63.9 million on development 
projects, which included the launch of Kutaisi Oncology Centre 
(capex of GEL 12.0 million), the development of critical care services 
at Sunstone hospital (capex of GEL 2.0 million), the renovation of our 
hospitals in Samtskhe region (capex of GEL 7.9 million), which 
become fully operational in February 2016, launch of paediatric 
cardiology department in Tbilisi (capex of GEL 3.7 million) and the 
roll-out of the ambulatory clinics (capex of GEL 7.9 million). 
In November 2015, we launched a paediatric cardiology department 
at the children’s referral hospital in Tbilisi, which is now the second 
healthcare facility in Georgia to provide full scale cardiac services, 
including cardiac surgery for children in Georgia. During the first 
month of operations, we performed ten surgeries.
We expanded service offerings in a number of our hospitals: 
• launched ophthalmology, emergency care, cardiology 
departments and expanded the imaging diagnostics department 
in Zugdidi referral hospital, west Georgia; 
• launched an emergency department and neurosurgery unit at 
Traumatology referral hospital in Tbilisi; 
• launched an emergency department and expanded an imaging 
department at Telavi referral hospital, east Georgia; 
• expanded the intensive care department at Batumi referral 
hospital, west Georgia; 
• launched a haemodialysis department at Kutaisi Referral 
Hospital, west Georgia; 
• launched a cardio-intensive care unit at Kutaisi referral hospital, 
west Georgia; and
• launched the obstetrics and gynaecology department at Batumi 
referral hospital, west Georgia

In spite of these investments, there are still significant shortages  
in the supply of equipment and service gaps, which leaves 
significant room for further growth. We expect to launch a number  
of such services in the beginning of 2016, including adding and 
expanding neurosurgery, cardiosurgery, and intensive care units in 
our regional hospitals; and IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) and paediatric 
kidney transplantation.
In May 2015 we launched Western Georgia’s largest and most 
well-equipped Oncology Centre in Kutaisi (capex of GEL 12.0 
million). The centre offers cancer treatment of Western 
Georgia’s population where radiotherapy and drug therapy 
departments work under supervision of leading Georgian 
oncologists from US and Europe. 
Physician overcapacity and nurse shortage yet to 
be addressed
Source: World Health Organisation and World Bank 2013 Data
We initiated and facilitated the opening of a mutual Nurse College at 
David Tvildiani Medical University, a leading medical institution in 
Georgia. The curriculum was developed in line with standards set by 
the National Council of State Boards of Nursing in the US. More than 
200 nurses are expected to graduate from the college every year. 
We will be funding the education of the top performers in the class. 
This cooperation is critical for us to address the country’s shortage 
of nurses and we expect to recruit our nurses from this newly 
opened college.
In line with our strategy to develop a new generation of doctors, we 
launched residency programmes in a number of fields, including 
paediatrics, neonatology, children’s emergency care, children’s 
neurology, anaesthesiology and intensive care, laboratory medicine, 
obstetrics and gynaecology, children’s cardio and rheumatology. 
These programmes are particularly important to source specialists in 
the fields where we have a shortage of doctors. Since the launch of 
the programme in December 2015, we have received 120 
applications from prospective residents. We selected 43 candidates 
who started the programme in the first quarter of 2016.
In September 2015, experts from the Mayo Clinic conducted training 
for our staff in Paediatric Fundamental Critical Care Support 
(PFCCS) and Fundamental Critical Care Support (FCCS) – the two 
most critical fields in the country with supply gaps. In addition to 
training physicians, the training also covered developing trainers to 
provide further training and continuous development for our doctors. 
Our collaboration with Mayo Clinic in respect of training and quality 
development has been highly productive. This has been operational 
since 2013 and we will continue this partnership to improve our staff 
qualifications and operations.

Directors’ Governance Statement
Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholders,
We are pleased to present the first Governance Report in respect of 
our short time as a listed company. We appointed all of our Directors 
prior to listing to give them time to understand the business and the 
market in which we operate and in order for us to begin to benefit 
from their advice and assistance. During this period, the Directors 
made many site visits and all received corporate governance training 
from our external legal advisors. We are pleased to report now on 
some key highlights of the robust structure that we have established: 
• a complete committee structure with terms of reference that are 
compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code, with each 
committee composed to ensure that we have the correct skill 
sets for it to operate effectively;
• a Board with a proven track record in business with both sector 
and country-specific knowledge consisting of one Executive 
Director, seven Independent Non-Executive Directors and one 
Non-Executive Director deemed not to be independent; and
• a complete suite of governance policies.
Our flat management structure and high level of involvement from 
management ensures that good governance practices stretch far 
beyond the boardroom and are continually implemented in the 
successful delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities.
The Board recognises the importance of, and is committed to, 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance. We 
have been complying with the obligations applicable under the UK 
Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules as a subsidiary 
of a listed parent company since November 2006, when Bank of 
Georgia Holdings PLC (now named BGEO Group PLC) became the 
first Georgian company to list global depositary receipts on the 
London Stock Exchange. All Directors are fully aware of their duties 
and responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
While the Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance it has not been possible nor necessarily relevant for the 
Company to comply with all of the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the period. We intend to progress towards 
full compliance wherever possible, but believe that the key 
governance procedures to deliver a robust structure are already  
in place.
We are confident that both the Board and management will support 
the growth strategy of the Group and strengthen the existing 
governance structure that we have in place. We look forward to 
reporting to you next year as to how our governance arrangements 
have continued to develop.

Directors’ Governance Statement continued
Compliance statement
GHG adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code at the point of listing on the London Stock Exchange. Since that date, the Company has 
applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code except for the following:
Code provision Code wording Explanation of non-compliance
A.3.1 The Chairman on appointment should be independent. Irakli Gilauri is the Company’s Chairman and at the time 
of appointment to this role also served as Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company’s principal 
shareholder, BGEO Group PLC. As such, the Board 
does not consider Mr Gilauri to be independent. 
Nevertheless, the Board believes that it is in the 
Company’s best interests to take advantage of 
Mr Gilauri’s capabilities and experience in leading  
the Board.
B.6.1 The Board should state in the Annual Report how 
performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and its individual Directors has been conducted. 
The Board has not carried out an annual evaluation of its 
own performance or that of the Chairman. In the short 
period of time between listing and the year end, the 
Board focused on matters relating to the IPO and it was 
considered too early for the Board to undertake an 
evaluation of its own performance. It is intended that 
such a review will take place in the coming year.
B.6.3 The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, should be responsible for, the 
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into 
account the views of Executive Directors.
B.7.2 The Chairman should confirm to shareholders when 
proposing a Non-Executive Director for election that, 
following formal performance evaluation, the individual’s 
performance continues to be effective and to 
demonstrate commitment to the role.
The role of the Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company for its shareholders, ensuring that it maintains the highest 
standards of corporate governance. It sets the strategic direction and governance structure for the Company that will assist with achieving its 
long-term success. In addition, the Board oversees areas such as financial policy, internal control and risk management and is responsible for 
ensuring the overall effectiveness of systems in place. 
Prior to listing, the Board adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval, which is reviewed regularly. A summary of the 
matters reserved for the Board is set out on page 69.
The Board has delegated other specific duties to its principal committees and the Board has full visibility on matters discussed at Board 
committee level. In 2015, the Board had four principal committees being the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee and the Nomination Committee. Each committee has agreed terms of reference which can be found on the Group’s 
website www.ghg.com.ge.

Policy, Code of Conduct, Health and Safety Policy, Internal Audit 
Policy, Policy on the Provision of Non-Audit Services by the 
External Auditor, Related Party Transaction Policy, Share Dealing 
Code, Whistleblowing Policy and any other policies the Board 
deem appropriate;

• any changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board 
following recommendations from the Nomination Committee;

• determining the remuneration policy for the Directors, Group 
Company Secretary and other senior executives, following 
recommendations from the Remuneration Committee; and
• undertaking a formal and rigorous review annually of its own 
performance, that of its committees and individual Directors.
Division of responsibilities
The Board has agreed a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director.
Roles and responsibilities
Chairman – Irakli Gilauri
As Chairman, Mr Gilauri is primarily responsible for leadership of the 
Board, setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. 
The other key responsibilities of the Chairman are:
• ensuring that Board agendas take full account of the important 
issues facing the Group and the concerns of all Board members;
• ensuring that the performance of the Board as a whole, its 
committees and individual Directors is formally and rigorously 
evaluated at least once a year;
• providing support, advice and a sounding board for the Chief 
Executive Officer while respecting executive responsibility; and
• ensuring that the Board as a whole plays a full and constructive 
part in the development and determination of the Group’s 
strategy and overall commercial objectives.
Chief Executive Officer – Nikoloz Gamkrelidze
Mr Gamkrelidze is responsible for the day-to-day running of the 
Group, with authority delegated by the Board, carrying out the 
agreed strategy and implementing specific Board decisions.
The other key responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer are:
• proposing, developing and supervising the Group’s strategy and 
overall commercial objectives, in close consultation with the 
Chairman and the Board; 
• together with the executive team, for implementing the decisions 
of the Board and its committees;
• identifying and executing new business opportunities outside the 
current core activities, in line with strategic plans;
• ensuring that the Chairman is alerted to forthcoming complex, 
contentious or sensitive issues affecting the Group of which he 
might not otherwise be aware; and
• ensuring that the executive team gives appropriate priority to 
providing reports to the Board which contain accurate, timely and 
clear information.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director – David Morrison
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board of 
a UK listed company should appoint one of its Independent 
Non-Executive Directors as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director. Given his experience at BGEO Group PLC and his 
background, the Board has appointed David Morrison to fill this role.
The key roles and responsibilities of the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director include:
• being available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
or Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve, or for which such 
contact would be inappropriate; and
• meeting with the other Non-Executive Directors at least once a 
year to appraise the Chairman’s performance and on such other 
occasions as are deemed appropriate.
This separation of responsibilities between the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, together with the schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board, ensures that no one individual has unfettered powers of 
decision making.
Non-Executive Directors and independence
Our principal shareholder, BGEO Group PLC, owned 96.24% prior to 
listing and now holds 65.03% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. Therefore, there is a relationship agreement in place with the 
BGEO Group. The principal purpose of the relationship agreement is 
to allow the Company to operate its business independently from 
the BGEO Group and to ensure that transactions and relationships 
between the Company and its principal shareholder are on arm’s 
length terms and on a normal commercial basis. The relationship 
agreement that the Company has entered into with the BGEO Group 
entitles the principal shareholder to appoint one person to be a 
Non-Executive Director of the Company for so long as it holds at 
least 20% of the voting share capital of the Company.
The UK Corporate Governance Code states that the Board should 
determine whether Non-Executive Directors are ‘independent’, 
meaning whether they are independent in character and judgement 
and whether there are any relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement. 
The Board has therefore considered the independence of the 
Company’s Non-Executive Directors (particularly in light of the fact 
that some of them serve on the Board of BGEO Group PLC and in 
terms of the factors described in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code) and has determined as mentioned previously that all 
Non-Executive Directors are independent except for Irakli Gilauri. 70 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Governance
Directors’ Governance Statement continued
Irakli Gilauri is the Company’s Chairman and at the time of 
appointment also served as the Chief Executive Officer of the 
Company’s principal shareholder, BGEO Group PLC. Nevertheless, 
the Board believes that it is in the Company’s best interests to take 
advantage of Mr Gilauri’s capabilities and experience in leading  
the Board.
The UK Corporate Governance Code states that the Board should 
explain its reasons if it determines that a Director is independent 
notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances  
that may appear relevant to its determination. The Board considers 
that David Morrison and Neil Janin are independent for the  
following reasons:
David Morrison also serves on the board of BGEO Group PLC 
(together with Irakli Gilauri and Neil Janin) and is the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and member of several other committees of BGEO 
Group PLC. His background as a corporate lawyer, advising multiple 
clients, gives him a particular sensitivity to conflicts and 
independence questions (in his career as a lawyer, his clients 
included many publicly held companies, often in competing 
businesses and his expertise included governance). The Board has 
therefore determined that Mr Morrison is independent in character 
and judgement.
Neil Janin also serves on the board of BGEO Group PLC (together 
with David Morrison and Irakli Gilauri) as its Independent Non-
Executive Chairman. Mr Janin was independent on his appointment 
to the board of BGEO Group PLC and, through his experience of 
advising multiple clients throughout his career as a consultant, is 
familiar with conflicts and independence issues. The Board has 
therefore determined that Mr Janin is independent in character  
and judgement.
Board meetings 
The Company listed on 12 November 2015 and therefore in the short 
period of time between listing and the year end, the Company held 
one Board meeting, at which all Directors were present. From the 
year end and up to the date of publication of this Annual Report, the 
Board held four further Board meetings. 
Appointment and tenure
On appointment all the Non-Executive Directors received a letter of 
appointment that set out the time commitment expected and the 
fees payable. The letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
Each Director is subject to election by shareholders at the  
Annual General Meeting of the Company intended to be held on 
26 May 2016.
Commitment
Each Non-Executive Director is expected to commit approximately 
25 to 35 days per year to the role. An additional time commitment is 
expected to fulfil their role as either a committee chairman or 
member. All Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting 
and each committee meeting for which they are a member. If a 
Director is unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional 
circumstances, he or she still receives the papers in advance of the 
meeting and has the opportunity to discuss with the relevant 
chairman or the Company Secretary any matters he or she wishes 
to raise and to follow up on the decisions taken at the meeting. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary are 
always available to discuss issues relating to meetings or other 
matters with the Directors. Reasons for non-attendance are 
generally prior business commitments. 
The Board believes that all Directors are effective, committed to their 
roles and have sufficient time available to perform their duties. 
Therefore, all Directors will be putting themselves forward for 
election at the Company’s first Annual General Meeting which is 
intended to be held on Thursday 26 May 2016. 
During 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority published 
amendments to the UK Listing Rules which included changes 
affecting premium listed companies with a controlling shareholder. 
This means that the Independent Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company must be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the 
independent shareholders (which excludes the controlling 
shareholder) of the Company as well as by a majority of the votes 
cast by all shareholders.
Development
Prior to the IPO, all Directors received in-depth training and guidance 
as to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of a 
public limited company. In addition, the Directors visited some of the 
Group’s key sites and received updates from senior management. 
To ensure that the Board as a whole remains fully informed of the 
views of shareholders, the Board receives regular updates on 
shareholder sentiment. All Directors can attend shareholder 
meetings and analyst presentations, and shareholders may meet 
informally with the Directors at the Annual General Meeting. 
Information and support
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary 
and, in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the 
Board as a whole.
The Directors receive presentations from senior management on 
their particular area of the business. 
External appointments
Any external appointment or other significant commitment of the 
Director requires prior approval of the Board. Our Non-Executive 
Directors hold external directorships or other external positions but 
the Board believes they still have sufficient time to devote to their 
duties as a Director of the Company and believe that the other 
external directorships/positions held provide the Directors with 
valuable expertise which enhances their ability to act as a Non-
Executive Director of the Company. 71

Overview Financial statements Additional information Governance
Directors’ conflicts of interests 
The Companies Act 2006 requires Directors to avoid situations in 
which they have or can have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts 
or may conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in 
addition to the existing duty that a Director owes to the Company to 
disclose to the Board any transaction or arrangement under 
consideration by the Company. The Company’s Articles of 
Association include provisions giving the Directors authority to 
approve such situations. There is no breach of duty if the relevant 
situation has been authorised in advance.
The Company Secretary minutes the consideration of any conflict or 
potential conflict of interest and authorisations granted by the Board, 
and maintains a register of conflicts of interest. The Directors are 
required to inform the Company Secretary on an ongoing basis of 
any new, actual or potential conflict of interest that may arise, or if 
there are any changes in circumstances which may affect an 
authorisation previously given. No conflicts of interest have been 
disclosed up to the date of this Annual Report.
Board evaluation
Due to the short period of time between listing and the year end it 
has not been possible, nor necessarily desirable, to carry out a 
formal evaluation of the Board, its committees and the individual 
Directors. The Board believes that a meaningful evaluation can only 
take place after the Board and its committees have been working 
together for some time. The Board intends to carry out a Board and 
committee evaluation in 2016.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of good communication with 
all of its shareholders and maintains an active dialogue with its key 
financial audiences, including institutional shareholders. During the 
IPO process, management were in regular contact with institutional 
investors and held a number of investor roadshows. The Chief 
Executive Officer and Chairman are closely involved in investor 
relations and the Head of Investor Relations has day-to-day 
responsibility for such matters. The Board are provided with 
shareholder feedback at Board meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer, Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
are available to discuss the concerns of shareholders at any point 
during the year. 
All announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange are 
available on the Group’s website www.ghg.com.ge.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to such meeting. All 
shareholders are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting where 
there is an opportunity for individual shareholders to question the 
Chairman and, through him, the chairs of the principal Board 
committees. After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders can 
meet informally with the Directors.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all 
resolutions proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting will be 
voted on separately and the voting results will be announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and made available on the Company’s 
website as soon as practicable after the meeting. These will include 
all votes cast for, against and those withheld, together with all 
proxies lodged prior to the meeting,
UK Bribery Act 2010 (the ‘Bribery Act’)
The Bribery Act established criminal offences for bribing another 
person, receiving a bribe, bribing foreign officials and failure by 
commercial organisations to prevent bribery. In response to the 
legislation, the Group has implemented an anti-bribery and 
corruption policy. The Board firmly stands against bribery and 
corruption and attaches the utmost importance to the policy and 
has introduced an anonymous whistleblowing helpline.
Directors’ responsibilities
Statements explaining the responsibilities of the Directors for 
preparing the Annual Report and consolidated and separate 
financial statements can be found on page 97 of this Annual Report. 
A further statement is provided confirming that the Board considers 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.  72 

formally meet in 2015. 
Chairman’s Overview
I am pleased to present the first Nomination Committee report for 
the Group.
The Nomination Committee was established as part of the IPO 
process. One of my roles as Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
is to ensure that we have the appropriate balance of skills,

positions. The Nomination Committee’s primary purpose is to 
ensure that the Group has the best possible leadership and a clear

Responsibilities of the Nomination Committee
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are:
• to regularly review the structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) of the Board  
and make recommendations to the Board with regard to  
any changes;
• to give full consideration to succession planning for Directors and 
other senior executives, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Group and the skills and expertise 
needed on the Board in the future;
• to be responsible for identifying and nominating candidates, for 
the approval of the Board, to fill Board vacancies as and when 
they arise;
• to evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity on the Board and, in light of this evaluation, prepare a 
description of the role and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment;
• to prepare a job specification for the appointment of a Chairman, 
including the time commitment expected;
• to keep under review the leadership needs of the Group, both for 
Executive and Non-Executive positions, with a view to ensuring 
the continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in the 
marketplace;
• to review annually the time required from Non-Executive 
Directors. Performance evaluation should be used to assess 
whether the Non-Executive Directors are spending enough time 
to fulfil their duties; and
• to make recommendations to the Board concerning the 
formulation of succession plans for both Executive and Non-
Executive Directors and in particular for the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer.
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Group’s website www.ghg.com.ge.
Election of Directors
The Independent Non-Executive Directors, apart from David 
Morrison, Neil Janin and Allan Hirst, were appointed in consultation 
with the sponsors for the IPO. Candidates were chosen on the  
basis of their extensive experience in relevant fields. Interviews  
were conducted and appointments made on the basis of strong 
interview performance.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the 
Directors will stand for election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, this being the first Annual General Meeting of the Company 
following their appointment. Going forward, the Directors will offer 
themselves for re-election on an annual basis. The biographical 
details of each Director are shown on pages 72 and 73 of this 
Annual Report. During the short period of time between listing and 
the year end, no formal performance evaluation has taken place. 
However, the Nomination Committee is satisfied that the Directors 
are performing effectively and are committed to the role. It is 
intended that a formal evaluation will take place in 2016.
Diversity
The Group takes account of diversity when recruiting, including 
when considering Board appointments. We see significant benefit to 
our business in having a Board drawn from a diverse range of 
backgrounds, since this brings the required expertise, cultural 
diversity and different perspectives to Board discussions. However, 
we do not believe this is achieved through simple quotas, whether  
it be gender or otherwise. Accordingly, the Group will continue  
to appoint candidates based on merit and relevant experience  
in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Board consists of Directors with a wide range of skills and 
business experience drawn from a number of industries. This is 
critical for bringing both the expertise required and to enable 
different perspectives to be brought to Board discussions. 
Furthermore, the Board comprises a range of nationalities which 
brings cultural diversity as well as different geographical experiences 
and viewpoints. The combination of these factors means the  
Board benefits from a diverse range of competencies, perspectives 
and thoughts, which provides a dynamic environment for  
decision making.
I am pleased to report that at present four out of ten of our senior 
managers are female. At present we only have one female Board 
member but the Nomination Committee will continue to assess 
diversity in its Board appointments going forward.
Looking ahead to 2016
In the coming year the Nomination Committee will, in particular, be 
focused on Board and senior management succession and will 
make recommendations to the Board where appropriate. As 
previously mentioned, the Nomination Committee also intends to 
carry out a Board and committee evaluation. I look forward to 
reporting in next year’s Nomination Committee report the progress 
made by the Committee. 78 

process and its terms of reference, together with the Audit 
Committee’s composition were approved by the Board prior to 
listing. The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on the

The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that all members

or appear to, affect their judgement. It further recommends that one 
such member has recent and relevant financial experience.
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of our

The Audit Committee members have been selected to provide the 
wide range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil 
the Audit Committee’s duties and responsibilities.

disclosure for over 25 years and therefore hold the recent and 
relevant financial experience required under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Tim Elsigood has over 35 years of international 
healthcare management experience in over 15 countries across the 
world. Jacques Richier has over 30 years’ experience in the 
insurance industry and has held senior positions within various 
insurance businesses since 1998. Allan Hirst held senior positions at 
Citibank for nearly 25 years working in Russia, the Middle East and 
the Indian subcontinent until his retirement. 
The Audit Committee will meet as often as is deemed necessary, but 
at least four times a year at appropriate times in the financial 
reporting and audit cycle. The Audit Committee normally invites the 
Deputy CEO, Finance and representatives from the external auditor 
to attend each meeting. Other members of the management team 
will also attend, as invited.  79

• any material litigation faced by the Group;
• changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code; and
• the risk of fraud in recognition of healthcare revenue and gross 
premium written.
Significant issues considered in relation to the accounts
IT projects and implementation deadline 
As part of the IPO process, the Group introduced its own IT services 
separate from that of the BGEO Group. The Audit Committee 
received reports from management on the current IT systems and 
new IT systems being developed. Whilst the Audit Committee has 
concluded that the current IT structure and systems in place are 
producing reliable data, the Audit Committee also notes that 
improved systems need to be put in place as current processes  
are too labour intensive. The Audit Committee intends to monitor  
the ongoing IT projects to ensure that they support an improving 
control framework.
The internal audit function
The Group has a newly established internal audit function. The Audit 
Committee received a presentation from the internal audit 
department on its remit, organisational structure and priorities. As 
the structure is new, it will continue to evolve in 2016. The Audit 
Committee has concluded that much of the clinical focus of internal 
audit’s work will report to the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee. 
Non-clinical areas of internal audit will report to the Audit Committee, 
which will work closely with the Head of Internal Audit in order to 
ensure that it is appropriately staffed and able to operate effectively.
The organisational structure of the Group’s internal audit function is 
presented in the diagram below:
Audit Committee, and  
Clinical Quality and Safety Committee
Head of Internal Audit
Head of Clinical  
Process Audit Unit
Head of Non-Clinical  
Process Audit Unit
The internal audit department is completely independent of the 
Group’s management board. The Head of Internal Audit reports to 
the Audit Committee and the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee 
and has a staff of 10 employees. The Non-Clinical Process Audit 
Unit reports to the Audit Committee. 
As part of its auditing procedures, the Non-Clinical Process Audit 
Unit is responsible for the following:
• identifying and assessing potential risks regarding the  
Group’s operations;
• reviewing the adequacy of the existing controls established in 
order to ensure compliance with Group policies, plans, 
procedures and business objectives;
• developing internal auditing standards and methodologies;
• carrying out planned and random inspections of the Group’s 
departments and divisions and auditing its subsidiaries;
• participating in external audits and inspections by regulators;
• making recommendations to management on the basis of the 
internal audits to improve internal controls; and
• monitoring the implementation of the external auditor’s 
recommendations.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for the overall system of internal 
control for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. In 
accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s guidance, it 
carries out such a review annually, covering all material controls 
including those relating to financials, operations and compliance.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group has operating controls and policies 
in place which were reviewed by the Board as part of the listing 
process through the Financial Procedures and Prospects 
memorandum. 
The Board discharges or intends to discharge its duties in this  
area by:
• having a formal policy on matters reserved for the Board and 
holding regular Board meetings to consider these matters;
• receiving regular management reports which provide an 
assessment of key risks and controls;
• ensuring there is a clear organisational structure with defined 
responsibilities and levels of authority;
• having the necessary documented policies and procedures in 
place; and 
• scheduling regular Board reviews of financial budgets  
and forecasts.
The Board, with advice from the Audit Committee, is satisfied that an 
effective system of internal control and risk management is in place 
which enables the Group to identify, evaluate and manage key risks 
and which accords with the guidance published by the Financial 
Reporting Council.
Appointment of external auditor
The current external audit firm was appointed by Bank of Georgia 
Holdings PLC (now named BGEO Group PLC) in 2012 when the 
Group was wholly-owned by the BGEO Group and has served as 
the external auditor for the BGEO Group for three years. In 
accordance with best ethical standards, however, external auditors 
are required to adhere to a rotation policy whereby the audit 
engagement partner is rotated after five years.
For purposes of continuity during the Group’s first reporting period 
since listing, this engagement has been continued by the Group. 
Going forward, the Group will adhere to best practice on audit firm 
rotation as a listed entity.
Ernst & Young has expressed its willingness to act as the external 
auditor of the Group. Separate resolutions proposing Ernst & 
Young’s appointment and determination of its remuneration by the 
Audit Committee will be proposed at the 2016 Annual General 
Meeting and the Group will continue to monitor the performance of 
Ernst & Young going forward. 80 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Governance
External auditor independence
In order to ensure independence of the external auditor, the Group 
has in place a policy to govern the non-audit services carried out by 
the external auditor. The policy sets out the circumstances in which 
the external auditor may be permitted to undertake non-audit 
services. Allowable services are pre-approved up to £100,000. Any 
permissible non-audit services that exceed this threshold require 
approval from the Audit Committee and must be robustly justified 
and, if appropriate, tendered before being approved. No such 
approval has been required since listing. 
Responsibilities for external audit
The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring the external 
auditor’s independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee 
recommends the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the 
Company’s external auditor. The Audit Committee also reviews and 
sets the terms, areas of responsibility and scope of the audit as set 
out in the external auditor’s engagement letter; the overall work plan 
for the forthcoming year, together with the associated fee proposal 
and cost effectiveness of the audit; any major issues which arise 
during the course of the audit and their resolution; key accounting 
and audit judgements; the level of errors identified during the  
audit; the recommendations made to management by the  
auditor and management’s response; and the external auditor’s 
overall performance.
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit 
process during the year, considering performance, objectivity, 
independence and relevant experience and recommended to  
the Board the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Company’s 
external auditor.
The Group continues to benefit from the insight and knowledge that 
the external auditor has of its business processes and controls and 
therefore the Board has approved resolutions to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, to appoint Ernst & Young as 
the Company’s external auditor and to authorise the Directors to set 
Ernst & Young’s remuneration.
Viability statement
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors are required to assess the viability of the Group. The Audit 
Committee spent time considering the timeframe over which the 
viability statement should be made. It was agreed that a period of 
three years would be appropriate. This corresponds to the period for 
the stress testing undertaken by the Group and takes into 
consideration the Company’s working capital model and business 
planning which also covers a three year period. The Audit 
Committee discussed its analysis with management and the Board. 
The viability statement is set out in the strategic report on page 46.
Non-audit work and independence
In preparation for listing, due to Ernst & Young’s extensive 
knowledge of the Group, the Board decided that Ernst & Young 
were best placed to undertake the considerable amount of work 
required in the short timeframe in the preparation for listing. 
As a result of this, for the year ended 31 December 2015, a total of 
US$1,282,264 non-audit fees incurred for Ernst & Young’s services 
in relation to the listing of the Group are not expected to re-occur in 
the future. Therefore, the Audit Committee does not consider that 
this work compromises the independence of the external auditor. 
Whistleblowing
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness, 
honesty, integrity and accountability and as a result has a 
whistleblowing policy in place. The policy is intended to make 
employees or third parties aware that they should report any serious 
concerns or suspicions about any wrongdoing or malpractice on the 
part of any employee of the Group. Examples include fraud, 
breakdown of internal controls, misleading customers, bribery, 
dishonesty, corruption and breaches of data. There have been no 
instances of whistleblowing during the period under review. 
Review of the “fair, balanced and understandable” requirement 
in respect of Annual Reports
Having been requested by the Board to advise it, the Audit 
Committee examined the Annual Report to consider whether it is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
In considering this statement, the Audit Committee took the 
following matters into consideration:
• the Chief Executive Officer carries out a detailed review of the 
Annual Report at an early stage of the process;
• the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with the 
appropriate senior management, spend a significant amount of 
time considering whether the overall tone and message of the 
Annual Report is correct;
• the Company Secretary works very closely with each committee 
chairman to produce each committee report;
• individual sections of the Annual Report and financial statements 
are drafted by suitably experienced senior management; 
• a final draft of the Annual Report is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and the external auditor on a timely basis to allow 
matters to be considered fully;
• an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual 
accuracy; and 
• an advanced draft is considered and reviewed by the Group’s 
legal advisors.
After consideration of all of this information, the Audit Committee is 
satisfied that the Annual Report and accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Evaluation
As the Audit Committee was formed as part of the IPO process and 
therefore has only been in existence for a short period, an evaluation 
of performance has not been undertaken. The Audit Committee 
intends to carry out an evaluation in 2016.
Priorities for 2016
As mentioned above, the Audit Committee’s priorities for 2016 are to 
monitor the Group’s IT systems that have been introduced post 
listing, carry out the first Audit Committee evaluation, to scrutinise 
the internal audit process to ensure satisfaction with the quality and 
coverage of the work carried out by internal audit and to ensure that 
its members receive ongoing training to ensure the Audit 
Committee’s effectiveness.

Clinical Quality and Safety Committee Report
Chairman’s Overview
I am pleased to present the first Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) report for the Group. The Committee 
was established as part of the IPO process to assist the Board in 
monitoring certain non-financial risks, including clinical performance, 
health and safety, and healthcare facilities of the Group. The terms of 
reference and committee membership were approved by the Board 
as part of the IPO process.
The Committee will meet as often as is deemed necessary, but at 
least four times a year, to discharge its duties. Due to the short 
period of time between listing and the year end, the Committee met 
once to discuss the focus of the Committee and how best to 
discharge its duties going forward and all committee members were 
present. Since the year end and prior to the approval of the Annual 
Report, the Committee has met on one occasion.
As the Committee has only been in existence for a short period of 
time, an evaluation of the Committee’s performance has not been 
undertaken. We intend to undertake an evaluation in 2016.
I look forward to reporting to you next year on how the Committee 
continues to develop and the areas of work within its remit that it has 
focused on.

• ensuring that the Group has the correct procedures and policies 
in place in the area of health and safety, in order to ensure a high 
quality service to patients;
• working with the internal audit department and management to 
understand areas within the Group in which health and safety 
can be improved; and
• conducting a formal performance evaluation of the Committee.

Remuneration Report
This structure is comprised of two key components:
• salary compensation consisting of a modest cash sum and 
deferred shares that vest over a four year period; and
• discretionary compensation payable entirely in deferred shares 
which vest over a three year period. Discretionary compensation 
is dependent on both Group performance and on the Executive 
achieving his or her key performance indicators (KPIs) in each 
financial year. We pay no cash bonuses, which is another 
distinguishing feature of our structure.
The overall effect of our remuneration structure is that the majority of 
an Executive’s compensation is paid in the form of deferred shares 
with long vesting periods, thus naturally aligning the interests of 
Executive Management with that of the Group’s shareholders.
There are certain circumstances in which deferred share salary 
shares and discretionary deferred share compensation may not vest, 
for example, if the Executive is dismissed, resigns or does not 
accept a contract renewal. If an Executive departs from the Group 
on good terms, however, the Board may, in its discretion permit 
shares to vest. This promotes loyalty amongst our Executive 
Management and motivates them to work in the long-term interests 
of the Group.
As a very significant percentage of an Executive’s compensation is in 
the form of deferred shares with long vesting periods, Executive 
Management are incentivised on an ongoing basis and for the long 
term. Therefore, we do not see the need to operate a long-term 
incentive plan (LTIP) as we have achieved the same objectives 
through our deferred share compensation structure. By focusing 
Executives on the Group’s sustainable, long-term performance, our 
Policy guards against any Executive taking risks which endanger our 
long-term stability. Our structure aligns both salary and discretionary 
remuneration with long-term stability and share price growth.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the annual 
statement and the annual report on remuneration will be put to  
an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and the Policy will be put forward to a binding shareholder 
vote. If approved by shareholders, the Policy will become  
formally effective.
The key components of remuneration are set out in detail within the 
Remuneration Policy Report.
I would like to thank our Executive Management and employees for 
their continued hard work and dedication, especially in the lead up 
to the Company’s IPO.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

1. Chairman’s Statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present to you our first 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the Group. The Company 
established its Remuneration Committee as part of the IPO process. 
The report sets out the Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) for our 
Executive Management Team which consists of our Chief Executive 
Officer, Nikoloz Gamkrelidze, and key senior managers of key 
functions and divisions within the Group. In this report we refer to 
our Executive Management Team collectively as “Executive 
Management” and each individual in the team as an “Executive”.
Executive Management worked to bring to market and close a 
successful IPO in a period where global financial markets were 
extremely turbulent, all the while completing acquisitions and 
growing the business. In its 2015 compensation actions, the 
Remuneration Committee recognised the performance of Executive 
Management in achieving this in such difficult circumstances and 
awarded discretionary compensation at or near the maximum 
opportunity available under our Policy.
In determining the levels of Executive Management rewards,  
the Remuneration Committee will continue to ensure that there  
is a strong and demonstrable link between actual remuneration 
received and the achievement of the Group’s strategic and  
business objectives. 
The Group has adopted, subject to shareholder approval, a 
remuneration structure that is simple and aligns the interests of 
shareholders and Executive Management, but is competitive enough 
to attract the right calibre of individual.

2. 2015 Annual Remuneration Report
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) and the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules. As required by the Act, a 
binding resolution to approve the Policy set out in section 4 and an 
advisory resolution to approve all other sections of this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (other than section 3 which describes senior 
management remuneration) will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting, which is intended to be held on 26 May 2016.
2.1 Governance summary
Membership
The members of the Remuneration Committee as at 31 December 
2015 and at the date of this report are listed below:
Member
Neil Janin (Chairman)
Ingeborg Oie
Tim Elsigood
Irakli Gilauri
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Remuneration Committee is currently comprised of three 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Irakli Gilauri serves as Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company’s principal shareholder, BGEO 
Group PLC. As such, the Board does not consider Irakli Gilauri to  
be independent. 
2.2 Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The Board sets the Group’s Policy and the Remuneration Committee 
is responsible, within the authority delegated to it by the Board, for 
determining specific remuneration packages and the terms and 
conditions of employment for Executive Management. The 
Remuneration Committee ensures that each Executive is provided 
with the appropriate incentives to enhance the Group’s performance 
and to reward them for personal contributions to the success of the 
Group. The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on the 
Group’s website www.ghg.com.ge.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
2.3 Attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings
In the short period of time between listing and the year end of the 
Company, no Remuneration Committee meetings were held. Since 
the year end and prior to the approval of the Annual Report, the 
Committee has met on two occasions. At the request of the 
Remuneration Committee, other individuals can attend Committee 
meetings in order to provide advice on remuneration matters. 
Attendees at Remuneration Committee meetings do not participate 
in discussions or decisions related to their own remuneration. Going 
forward, the Committee will meet as often as is deemed necessary 
but in any event at least twice a year. 
2.4 Advice to the Committee
The Committee keeps itself fully informed on developments and best 
practice in the field of remuneration and it seeks advice from external 
advisors when appropriate. No external remuneration consultants 
were engaged in the period from listing to the year end.
2.5 Statement of shareholder voting
The Company has not held an Annual General Meeting since listing 
and therefore there are no voting results on which to report. Details 
of the remuneration-related voting will be reported on in the 2016

Notes:
1 GHG and JSC GHG cash salaries are expressed in US Dollars but paid in GBP and Lari, converted into the respective currency as described in Note 2 of the table in 
section 4.2 of the Policy. Accordingly, there may be variations in the numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
2 Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year. The value attached to each 
GHG share for the purpose of this award is US$1.16 per share (based on the EY valuation report dated 1 April 2015). Mr Gamkrelidze was awarded 175,000 deferred 
share salary shares. For the purpose of calculating the maximum opportunity for discretionary deferred share compensation, however, the value of the deferred share 
salary is instead calculated by reference to the share price as of the date of admission to listing which was US$2.58298 (based on the official share price of GBP1.7 per 
share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5194, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date), and on that basis 
deferred share salary amounted to US$452,022.
3 Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figure shows the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year. The 
discretionary deferred share compensation award is capped at US$602,022, a figure calculated by adding 100% of total salary comprising annual cash salary of 
US$150,000 and deferred share salary of US$452,022 (calculated as described in the last sentence of Note 2 above). The value of the discretionary deferred share 
compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 15 February 2016 which was US$2.5303 (based on the official share price of GBP1.7388 per share 
converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.4552, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). For 2015, options were 
awarded over 237,500 GHG shares. This discretionary compensation in respect of 2015 is deferred and 33.33% vests in January 2017, 33.33% vests in January 2018 
and 33.33% vests in January 2019, subject to the leaver provisions described in section 4.5(b) of the Policy. The means of determining the number of shares underlying 
this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 4.2(b) of the Policy. The basis for determining Mr Gamkrelidze’s 2015 discretionary award is 
described in section 2.7 below.
4 Benefits. The figure shows the gross taxable value of health and disability insurance and Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.
5 Pension. The figure shows the aggregate employer contributions for the relevant years into the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme. 
6 Dividend equivalents. The figure shows the dividend value paid in respect of nil-cost options exercised in relation to 2015.
7 Mr Gamkrelidze was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.
8 No money or other assets are received or receivable by Mr Gamkrelidze in respect of a period of more than one financial year, where final vesting is determined by 
reference to achievement of the performance measures or targets relating to a period ending in 2015.
The following table sets out details of total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Gamkrelidze, for the year ended 31 December 
2015 and his discretionary compensation as a percentage of maximum opportunity.

Single total figure of remuneration (US$) 956,064
Discretionary compensation as a percentage of maximum opportunity (%) 100
Note:
The maximum opportunity is calculated as set forth in Note 3 to the table above.
2.7 Basis for determining Mr Gamkrelidze’s discretionary deferred share compensation
The number of discretionary deferred shares granted to Mr Gamkrelidze in a given year is dependent on both Group performance and his 
achievements of the KPIs set for him by the Remuneration Committee.
The following table details the KPIs set for Mr Gamkrelidze in respect of 2015, as well as his performance against these.
Key performance measure
2015 
Target
2015

Delivery of the Initial Public Offering Successful delivery of the Initial Public Offering Successfully completed

EBITDA margin 25%-27% 27.4%
Loss ratio 80%-85% 83.4%
Delivery of outpatient strategy Delivery on strategy Successfully launched
Retention of claims within EVEX 15%-20% 16.1%
On time delivery of hospital capex projects Delivery on strategy Projects completed
Mr Gamkrelidze’s KPIs largely track the Group’s KPIs as he is expected to deliver on the Group’s strategy. In addition to the KPIs listed in the 
table above, the Committee considers non-tangible factors such as leadership and forward-looking strategy development when determining 
Mr Gamkrelidze’s discretionary compensation.
In respect of 2015, the Committee determined that Mr Gamkrelidze met all of his KPIs. The Committee viewed Mr Gamkrelidze’s performance 
as excellent. As a result, the Committee determined that Mr Gamkrelidze should be awarded discretionary deferred share compensation 
valued at US$600,946. See section 4.2(b) of the Policy which describes why the Remuneration Committee steers away from strict weighting 
of the performance measures and the discretion it retains in respect of determining the number of discretionary deferred shares that may  
be granted.

None of Mr Gamkrelidze’s connected persons have any interests in the shares of the Company.
From 1 January 2015 and up to the date of signing of this report, in accordance with our remuneration Policy, Mr Gamkrelidze was awarded a 
total of 412,500 GHG shares which are unvested and unexercised. Further information about this award is set out in the Notes to the table 
provided in section 2.6. 
There have been no other changes in interests in GHG shares since 31 December 2015.
Due to the fact that the majority of an Executive’s compensation takes the form of deferred shares, Executive Management will in future years 
hold large amounts of unvested shares. Therefore, the Group does not have a policy requiring Executive Management to hold a specified 
number of shares. The Group also does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a minimum number of shares but some of the Non-
Executive Directors have nevertheless decided to become shareholders. 
2.13 Details of Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Company has entered into letters of appointment with each Non-Executive Director. The letters of appointment require Non-Executive 
Directors to provide one month’s notice prior to termination. The letters of appointment are effective from 4 September 2015 with each 
Non-Executive Director being put forward for election at the 2016 Annual General Meeting, being the first Annual General Meeting of the 
Company following his or her appointment. Continuation of a Non-Executive Director’s employment is conditional on his or her continued 
satisfactory performance and re-election by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting.
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for a tenure of six years on both the GHG and JSC GHG boards. Upon the expiry of such 
six-year tenure, the appointment of the relevant Director will generally cease at the next upcoming Annual General Meeting. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, if the Board determines that, in order to maintain the balance of appropriate skills and experience required for the Board, it is 
important to retain a Director on the Board beyond the relevant six-year period, the Board may offer the Director a letter of appointment for an 
additional one-year term. Such a one-year “re-appointment” may be renewed no more than two times, with the effect that the usual six-year 
tenure may be extended to a maximum of nine years if circumstances were to warrant such extension.

3. Key Senior Managers Remuneration 
At the time of this report, in addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there are three key senior managers. On 29 April 2015, the Group entered 
into service agreements with the three individuals. The remuneration received by each of them for the year ended 31 December 2015 is set 
out in table 3.1 below. This disclosure is made solely in the interests of transparency, since there is no requirement to make this disclosure. 
Therefore, remuneration of the key senior managers will not form part of the Policy set out in section 4 of this Remuneration Report, nor is it 
subject to shareholder approval.
The remuneration structure set out in the Policy is broadly applied to the key senior managers. This means that, as for the Chief Executive 
Officer, the key senior managers receive remuneration based on two components:
• salary which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a four year period; and 
• a discretionary award, 100% payable in deferred share compensation vesting over a three year period, which will be dependent on both 
Group performance and the key senior manager achieving his or her KPIs.
3.1 Single total figure of remuneration for key senior managers

Notes:
1 JSC GHG cash salary is expressed in US Dollars but paid in Lari. David Vakhtangishvili’s cash salary as shown in the table above is for the period from 1 May 2015 to 
31 December 2015.
2 Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year. The value attached to each 
GHG share for the purpose of this award is US$0.94 per share (based on the EY valuation report dated 1 April 2015; the per share value is different to the value attached 
to the Chief Executive Officer award as the award dates differ). The key senior managers were each awarded 53,000 deferred share salary shares. For the purpose of 
calculating the maximum opportunity for discretionary deferred share compensation, however, the value of the deferred share salary is instead calculated by reference to 
the share price as of the date of admission to listing which was US$2.58298 (based on the official share price of GBP1.7 per share converted into US Dollars using an 
exchange rate of 1.5194, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date, and on the basis deferred share salary amounted to 
US$ 136,898). Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the work 
year even though the number of deferred share salary shares is fixed in the respective contracts. The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an 
explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are described in section 4.2(b) of the Policy.
3 Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figures show the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted in the relevant year. The discretionary deferred 
share compensation award is calculated by adding 100% of total salary comprising annual cash salary and deferred share salary (calculated as described in Note 2 
above). The value of the discretionary deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 15 February 2016 which was US$2.5303 (based on 
the official share price of GBP1.7388 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.4552, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of 
England on the same date). For 2015, Mr Vakhtangishvili, Mr Mindiashvili and Mr Gogia were awarded options over 98,000, 92,000 and 91,000 shares respectively. This 
discretionary compensation in respect of 2015 is deferred and 33.33% vests in January 2017, 33.33% vests in January 2018 and 33.33% vests in January 2019. The 
means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 4.2(b) of the Policy.
4. See Notes 4, 5 and 6 in the table provided in section 2.6.
3.2 Shareholdings of key senior managers 
As at 31 December 2015, the key senior managers as listed above do not hold any vested or unvested GHG shares. It is envisaged that in 
future years, in accordance with our remuneration Policy, the key senior managers will hold both vested and unvested shares. Irakli Gogia 
subscribed for 9,400 GHG shares as part of the Company’s IPO.
4. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
4.1 Statement of implementation of the Policy in 2016
Subject to shareholder approval, the Policy will take effect from the date of the 2016 Annual General Meeting and is intended to apply until the 
date of the Annual General Meeting in 2019. As such, there will be no significant changes between the Policy as described in this annual 
report and its implementation. The Policy applicable to Directors which is described in this section 4 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
will be put to shareholders for a binding vote at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. 
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this Policy 
taking effect. The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include (without 
limitation) obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and benefit plans. 88 

Cash salary
• The amount is fixed in the Executive 
Director’s contract with GHG and,  
if applicable, with JSC GHG.  
The total amount payable to 
Mr Gamkrelidze under his current

Deferred share salary
• The number of shares underlying 
each annual award is fixed for the 
duration of the Executive Director’s 
contract with GHG or JSC GHG,  
as the case may be. The number  
of deferred share salary shares 
under Mr Gamkrelidze’s current 
contract with JSC GHG is  
175,000 per annum.
The level of salary for an Executive 
Director is reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee when the 
service contract is renewed. Renewal 
is due to take place in 2020.

Discretionary 
deferred share 
compensation
Annual performance-based 
compensation paid entirely in the 
form of nil-cost options over GHG 
shares which vest over a three 
year period. As with the deferred 
share salary, this promotes the 
Group’s long-term success by 
closely aligning the Executive 
Director’s and shareholders’ 
interests. The Group pays no 
cash bonus to its Executive 
Director and has no LTIP.
Awarded annually after the end 
of the work year in respect of 
which the award is made over 
a number of GHG shares that 
are determined annually by 
the Remuneration Committee, 
based on the performance of 
the Group and the achievement 
of the KPIs set for the Executive 
Director by the Remuneration 
Committee for the work year 
(see section 4.2(b) on page 90).
Awards vest as to 33.33% 
in January of each of the 
second, third and fourth years 
following the work year.
At vesting (upon exercise of the 
nil-cost options), the Executive 
Director receives (in addition to 
the vested shares) cash payments 
equal to the dividends paid (if 
any)on the underlying shares 
between the date the award was 
made and the vesting date

Unvested deferred share 
compensation lapses upon 
termination by GHG or JSC GHG 
“for cause” or by the Executive 
Director other than for “good 
reason” or if the Director does 
not remain employed by the 
Group (each as defined in the 
relevant service contract, as is 
explained for Mr Gamkrelidze 
in section 4.5(b) below). The 
Board has, however, reserved 
the right to permit unvested 
discretionary deferred shares to 
vest irrespective of the Executive 
Director’s departure when such 
Executive Director departs on 
good terms with the Group.
If at any time after awarding 
discretionary deferred share 
compensation it has been 
determined that there was a 
material misstatement in the 
financial results for the financial 
year in respect of which the award 
was formally granted, the Board 
has the right to cause some or 
all of the award for that financial 
year or for any subsequent 
financial year that is unvested 
at the time of its determination, 
not to vest and to lapse.
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation is granted 
out of a pool of shares made 
available for such awards.
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right to award no 
discretionary deferred share 
compensation if the Group’s 
performance is unsatisfactory or if 
the Executive Director’s performance 
is poor in light of the KPIs set by 
the Remuneration Committee 
for the Executive Director.
For Mr Gamkrelidze, the maximum 
value of discretionary deferred share 
compensation that may be awarded 
in a given year for the remainder of 
his service contract with the Group 
is capped at 100% of total salary 
(see section 4.2(b) on page 90).
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation for any newly appointed 
Executive Director, other than 
Mr Gamkrelidze, will not comprise 
more than 125% of the Executive 
Director’s total salary. However, 
the Remuneration Committee has 
reserved the right to increase the 
maximum discretionary deferred 
share compensation to 150% of the 
Executive Director’s total salary for 
performance that has resulted in 
outstanding benefits for shareholders. 90 

Pension The provision of retirement 
benefits helps to attract and 
retain high-calibre talent.
The Group operates a defined 
contribution pension scheme. 
The Executive Director and 
the Group each contribute a 
minimum of 1% of the Executive 
Director’s gross monthly cash 
salary payable under his service 
contract with JSC GHG.
There is no provision for 
the recovery or withholding 
of pension payments.
The Group will match in additional 
contributions in a proportion of 0.2 
to one, up to a maximum additional 
Group contribution of 1% of gross 
monthly salary where the Executive 
Director makes additional contributions 
up to 5% of gross monthly salary.
Benefits Non-cash benefits are in line with 
Georgian market practice and are 
designed to be sufficient to attract 
and retain high-calibre talent.
Benefits consist of health 
insurance, disability insurance, 
Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance and personal security 
arrangements (if requested 
by the Executive Director).
A tax equalisation payment may be 
paid to an Executive Director if any 
part of his remuneration becomes 
subject to double taxation.
There is no provision for the 
recovery or withholding of benefits.
There is no prescribed maximum 
on the value of benefits payable 
to an Executive Director.
If the Executive Director’s personal 
circumstances do not change and 
the Group is able to obtain benefits 
on substantially the same terms 
as at the date of the publication of 
this Policy, the aggregate cost of 
benefits for an Executive Director 
during the Policy’s life is not 
expected to change materially.
Notes:
1 Under service contracts with GHG and/or JSC GHG (as applicable).
2 GHG cash salary is converted from US Dollar to GBP at the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on each monthly payment date. JSC GHG cash salary is 
converted from US Dollar to Lari at the exchange rate published by the National Bank of Georgia on each monthly payment date.
3 Dividend equivalents (if any) are paid in Lari as at the date dividends were paid to other shareholders.
a) Deferred share salary
The deferred share salary comprises the most important element of the Executive Director’s fixed annual remuneration and is commensurate 
with his role within the Group. By heavily weighting base salary in favour of deferred share compensation rather than cash, Executive 
Director’s day-to-day actions are geared towards sustained Group performance over the long term. The deferred share salary component is 
neither a bonus nor LTIP, it is salary fixed at the outset of each service contract and is therefore not subject to performance targets or 
measures. The salary increases or declines in value depending on Group performance over the four-year vesting period, aligning the 
Executive Director’s interests directly and naturally with those of the Group’s shareholders.
b) Discretionary deferred share compensation
The Group does not operate an LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation. No cash bonuses are paid to the Executive Director. Instead, individual and Group performance 
is rewarded through an award of discretionary deferred share compensation that vests over the three years following the work year. 
As discretionary deferred share compensation is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any 
performance measures over the period from award to vesting. The aggregate pool of shares available each year for awards of discretionary 
deferred share compensation for the Executive Director and the Executive Management as a whole is determined annually by the 
Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion, based on a number of factors including: 
• financial objectives; 
• strategic objectives; and
• people and similar softer objectives.
The number of shares over which the Executive Director’s discretionary deferred share compensation will be granted is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee by reference to the performance of the Group and the Executive Director’s KPIs. These KPIs are set for the 
Executive Director by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year and reflect the Executive Director’s required contribution 
to the Group’s overall key strategic and financial objectives for that financial year. See section 2.7 above for a description of the KPIs set for 
Mr Gamkrelidze in respect of 2015 and his performance against these, as well as the KPIs which have been set for him in respect of 2016.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee has defined the set of factors to be considered in determining the aggregate pool of discretionary 
deferred shares and evaluating an Executive Director’s performance, it seeks to steer away from defining a series of narrow objectives for 
Executive Management and does not employ strict weighting of performance measures. A high level of discretion is intentionally maintained 
when determining the quantum of discretionary deferred shares awarded to the Executive Director even in a “good” year for the Executive 
Director (e.g. achievement of most of his KPIs). In a “bad” year for the Group (e.g. poor financial performance by it), the Executive Director 
could receive little or no discretionary share compensation.

Strategic report
Overview Financial statements Additional information Governance
As mentioned in the Policy table above, the maximum value of discretionary deferred share compensation that Mr Gamkrelidze may be 
awarded in a given year for the remainder of his service contract with the Group is capped at 100% of his total salary. For these purposes, 
total salary comprises the annual cash salary and the deferred salary shares provided for in Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contract, the latter 
being valued, for the current service contract, by reference to the share price as of the date of admission to the London Stock Exchange, and 
for future service contracts, by reference to the share price as of the date of the contract.
c) Equity compensation trust 
An equity compensation trust has been established for the purpose of satisfying deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share 
compensation in the form of nil-cost options awarded to any eligible executive. The trust was established in 2015. If GHG need to issue new 
shares or repurchase shares, or a combination of both, in order to ensure that there is a sufficient number of shares committed to the trust in 
order to satisfy awards, the Group has committed to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share compensation 
from the time of listing on the London Stock Exchange will not exceed 10% of GHG’s ordinary share capital over any 10-year period.
d) Comparison with remuneration policy for employees generally
The components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors (as provided for by the Policy) are broadly the same as those for 
non-Board members of the Executive Management. Other members of senior management and middle management receive their entire 
salary in cash and do not receive deferred share salary. Their bonuses may be either in the form of cash and/or shares which vest over a 
three-year period following the award. All other employees within the Group receive a cash salary and may be eligible to receive cash 
bonuses, portions of which may be deferred until the publication of the audited annual results for the work year and/or based on continuous 
employment with the Group. The deferred portion of the cash bonus may also be reduced if it is revealed, upon completion of the annual 
audit, that the annual results published by the department where the employee works were incorrect in any material respect. All employees 
receive a competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on the same 
terms as applicable to Executive Directors.
e) Business expenses
Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their service 
contract, on provision of valid receipts.
4.3 Elements of the Policy – Non-Executive Directors
In 2015, each member of the Board of GHG, with the exception of Mr Gamkrelidze, served as a member of the supervisory board of JSC 
GHG. Each member of the Board, with the exception of Mr Gilauri, received (in respect of their services to GHG) a base fee and was further 
remunerated for membership on the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and Clinical Quality and Safety Committees, where applicable.
The Policy provides for a Non-Executive Director’s remuneration package to be comprised of the following elements:
Component Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Base cash fee The fee for the GHG Board is 
competitive enough to attract and 
retain experienced individuals. The 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director receives a higher base 
fee which reflects the extra time 
commitment and responsibility.
Cash payment on a quarterly basis. The amount of remuneration is 
reviewed every three years by 
the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, 
to amend and vary the fees if there are 
genuinely unforeseen and exceptional 
circumstances which necessitate such 
review and in such circumstances 
any significant increase shall be the 
minimum reasonably required. The 
maximum aggregate GHG fees for 
all Non-Executive Directors which 
may be paid under GHG’s Articles 
of Association is £750,000.
Cash fee for 
each committee 
membership
Additional fee to compensate 
for additional time spent 
discharging committee duties.
Cash payment on a quarterly basis. The amount of remuneration 
for committee membership is 
reviewed every three years by 
the Remuneration Committee. 
Notes:
1 Non-Executive Directors did not receive any deferred share salary or discretionary deferred share compensation, pensions, benefits or any variable or performance-
linked remuneration or incentives in 2015.
2 Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their letters of 
appointment, on provision of valid receipts.
3 Non-Executive Directors who are appointed to the Board of the Company and/or to the supervisory board of JSC GHG by shareholders of the Company are required to 
waive any entitlements to fees which would otherwise be payable to them under the Policy for so long as they are appointees of a shareholder. 92 

4.4 Total remuneration opportunity for our sole Executive Director
The chart below shows the remuneration which Mr Gamkrelidze, the sole Executive Director, could receive in respect of 2016 under the 
Policy at three different performance levels. It should be noted that, at the maximum level, 83% of Mr Gamkrelidze 2016 compensation will be 
in the form of deferred shares for which the vesting period is either three or four years. At the minimum level, 67% of Mr Gamkrelidze’s 2016 
compensation will be in the form of deferred shares for which the average vesting period is either three or four years.

Notes:
1 Salary is comprised of cash, deferred share salary, benefits and pension contributions. Mr Gamkrelidze’s total cash salary in 2016 in respect of both his service contract 
with GHG and JSC GHG will be US$225,000. For the purpose of calculating the value of deferred share salary shares in this chart a share price of US$2.58298 (this being 
the share price as of the date of the IPO) per share has been used. Deferred share salary in respect of 2016 will be formally granted in January 2017 and will vest from 
January 2018 to January 2021. For the purpose of this chart, the value of pension and benefits for 2015 has been used as it is assumed that pension and benefits in 2016 
will be substantially the same.
2 The means of determining the number of shares underlying the discretionary deferred share compensation and terms and conditions applying to this compensation are 
described in section 4.2(b). For the purpose of calculating the value of discretionary deferred shares in this chart a share price of US$2.58298 (this being the share price 
as of the date of the IPO) per share has been used. Discretionary deferred shares in respect of 2016 will be formally granted in January 2017 and will vest in January 
2018, January 2019 and January 2020. 
3 Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives only fixed remuneration, comprised of cash salary, deferred share salary, benefits and 
pension contributions and the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and/or the Director’s performance in 2016 does not warrant any award of 
discretionary deferred share compensation.
4 On target opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives fixed remuneration (as described above) and assumes a discretionary deferred share 
compensation award at 70% of the maximum opportunity for Group and individual performance which is in line with the Group’s expectation, which is excellent performance. 
5 Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives fixed remuneration (as described above) and a discretionary deferred share compensation 
award of 100% of total salary (i.e. the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and the individual’s performance in 2016 warrant the highest possible level of 
discretionary deferred share compensation). 
6 The value of deferred shares does not take into account any increase or decrease in share price over the vesting period or dividend equivalents (if any) payable on vesting 
(upon exercise of the nil-cost options).
4.5 Policy on payments for loss of office
From the date of listing up to the year end, no Executive Director left the Group and therefore no payments for loss of office were paid to, or 
receivable by, any Director.
The following paragraphs (a) and (b) describe the Group’s policy for payments on termination of Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contracts with GHG 
and JSC GHG. In 2015 and as at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gamkrelidze is the sole Executive Director on the GHG Board. The 
Group’s policy on payments for loss of office for Non-Executive Directors is described in paragraph (c) below and its approach to payments 
for loss of office for future Executive and Non-Executive Directors is described in paragraph 4.6 below. The Directors’ service contracts and 
letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.

(b) Termination of JSC GHG service agreement dated 29 April 2015
On 29 April 2015 the Group entered into a service contract with 
Mr Gamkrelidze. Neither party shall have the right to terminate the 
agreement prior to expiration of the employment term for any reason 
whatsoever, except for: 
(a) termination by the Group for cause, which shall be on the basis of 
a written notice to the Chief Executive Officer and shall have 
immediate effect; 
(b) termination by the Group without cause, which shall be on the 
basis of a written notice to the Chief Executive Officer and shall 
have immediate effect; 
(c) termination by the Chief Executive Officer upon serving three 
months’ prior written notice. Unless otherwise agreed with the 
Board, the Chief Executive Officer will resign only upon expiration 
of this three month notice period.
Separation payments
In the circumstances listed below where Mr Gamkrelidze’s service 
contract is terminated, he is entitled only to accrued and unpaid 
cash salary and accrued but not yet paid business expenses, a 
leaving allowance and severance payment constituting the 
immediate monetary equivalent of no less than six months’ base 
salary and any accrued but unpaid tranches of the cash bonus (if 
any) if termination is by the Company without cause. Mr Gamkrelidze 
is entitled to three months’ base salary and any accrued but unpaid 
tranches of the cash bonus (if any) in the case of termination by 
Mr Gamkrelidze for good reason.
The Group may restrict Mr Gamkrelidze from being employed in the 
healthcare industry and/or providing consulting or similar services to 
a competing healthcare institution for a period of up to four months 
following the termination of his employment and will continue to pay 
him his full cash salary under the JSC GHG service contract as 
compensation for his unemployment during this period.
In addition, without the prior written consent of the Company, 
Mr Gamkrelidze shall not contact, deal with or solicit any customer 
or client of the Group with whom he has had any business dealings 
in the six months prior to the termination of his service contract, for 
the purpose of providing services similar to or in competition with 
those provided by the Company.
The garden leave and non-compete period does not in aggregate 
exceed six months.
Vesting and lapse of awards
If the agreement is terminated by the Company for cause, 
Mr Gamkrelidze terminates the agreement for any reason other than 
for good reason, upon the expiry of the agreement Mr Gamkrelidze 
does not accept a new service agreement upon substantially similar 
terms and/or Mr Gamkrelidze does not remain or immediately 
become an executive of another group company as defined in his 
service agreement, then unless otherwise resolved by the Board, 
any unvested awarded deferred cash salary and discretionary 
deferred share compensation as at the date when the Executive 
ceases to be an “executive” shall lapse.
If the agreement is terminated without cause, upon the expiry of the 
agreement Mr Gamkrelidze is not offered a new service agreement 
upon substantially similar terms or Mr Gamkrelidze ceases to be an 
“executive” by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement 
(at normal retirement age), then any unvested awarded deferred 
share salary and discretionary deferred share compensation as  
at the date when the Executive ceases to be an “executive”  
shall continue to vest in the normal way during the respective  
vesting period(s).
If before the end of the vesting period Mr Gamkrelidze ceases to be 
an “executive” by reason of death, Mr Gamkrelidze terminates the 
agreement for good reason or a change of control event occurs, 
then any unvested awarded deferred share salary and discretionary 
deferred share compensation shall vest immediately.
(c) Termination of Non-Executive Directors’ appointment
Each Non-Executive Director is required to submit himself or herself 
for annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The letters of 
appointment with GHG for each Non-Executive Director are effective 
from 4 September 2015. 
The letters of appointment provide for a one month notice period 
although the Group may terminate the appointment with immediate 
effect without notice or pay in lieu of notice if the Non-Executive 
Director has committed any serious breach or non-observance of 
his or her obligations to the Group, is guilty of fraud or dishonesty, 
brings the Group or him/herself into disrepute or is disqualified as 
acting as a Non-Executive Director, among other circumstances. 
Upon termination, the only remuneration a Non-Executive Director is 
entitled to is accrued fees as at the date of termination, together with 
reimbursement of properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the 
termination date.
4.6 Policy on the appointment of external hires and internal 
appointments
Any new Executive Director appointed to the Board would be paid 
no more than the Remuneration Committee considers reasonably 
necessary to attract a candidate with the relevant skills and 
experience. His or her remuneration package would comprise the 
components described in section 4.2 above. The Remuneration 
Committee may, in its discretion and taking into account the role 
assumed by the new Executive Director, vary the amount of any 
component in the package. This discretion will only be exercised to 
the extent required to facilitate the recruitment of the particular 
individual. In addition, the terms and conditions attaching to any 
component of the remuneration might be varied insofar as the 
Remuneration Committee considers it necessary or desirable to do 
so in all the circumstances.
Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and, where 
relevant, his or her family, may be provided depending on the 
individual’s circumstances. The Group has not set a maximum 
aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any individual’s 
relocation support, but it will aim to provide support of an 
appropriate level and quality on the best terms that can reasonably 
be obtained. 94 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Governance
Upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the 
Group may “buy out” incentive awards which were granted to an 
incoming Executive Director by a previous employer and which have 
been foregone. In these circumstances, the approach will be to 
match the estimated current value of the foregone awards by 
granting awards of deferred share compensation which vest over a 
similar period to the awards being bought out. The application of 
performance conditions and/or clawback provisions may also be 
considered, where appropriate. Such new awards may be granted in 
addition to any deferred share salary and discretionary deferred 
share compensation.
Any payment upon termination of a new Executive Director’s service 
contract would not exceed 12 months’ cash salary under the 
relevant service contract, plus any accrued and unpaid cash salary, 
benefits and holiday pay and reimbursement of any business 
expenses. The Group may also continue to pay a former Executive 
Director his full cash salary for any period following the termination of 
his appointment during which he is prohibited from competing with 
the Group.
It is expected that the following vesting provisions will apply to 
deferred share compensation in the case of termination of a new 
Executive Director’s service contract: 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would lapse upon 
termination of the service contract by the Company or JSC GHG 
for cause, termination by the Executive Director other than for 
good reason or if the Executive Director’s employment is 
terminated for any other reason and he/she is not offered 
continued membership of the GHG Board or JSC GHG’s 
supervisory board. 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would continue to vest in 
the normal way during the respective vesting period(s) upon 
termination by the Company or JSC GHG without cause, if the 
Executive Director’s service contract expires and he/she is not 
offered a new service contract on substantially similar terms on 
expiration or if the Executive Director ceases to be an Executive 
Director by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement 
(at normal retirement age). 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would vest immediately 
upon death of the Executive Director, termination of the service 
contract by the Executive Director for good reason or a change  
of control. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board reserves the right to permit 
unvested deferred share compensation to vest irrespective of the 
Executive Director’s departure when such Executive Director 
departs on good terms with the Group.
Any new Non-Executive Director appointed to the Board would  
be paid no more than the Remuneration Committee considers 
reasonably necessary in light of market practice among other  
FTSE Small Cap companies and the current remuneration of  
other Non-Executive Directors. His or her remuneration  
package would comprise the same components as the  
existing Non-Executive Directors. 
If an existing employee of the Group is appointed as an Executive or 
Non-Executive Director, any obligation or commitment entered into 
with that individual prior to his/her appointment will be honoured by 
the Group in accordance with the terms of those obligations or 
commitments, even where they differ from the terms of the Policy.
4.7 Consideration of shareholder views and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Remuneration Committee considers the pay and employment 
conditions of Executive Management (other than Directors) when 
determining an Executive Director’s remuneration as well as changes 
in pay and employment conditions across the Group as a whole in 
relation to the proposed pay for Directors.
The Remuneration Committee relies on its judgement, particularly 
given that international comparisons are the most relevant for senior 
management and the Georgian labour market is more relevant for 
other employees.
As a newly listed company, the Remuneration Committee takes an 
active interest in shareholder views on its Policy and will be reviewing 
voting outcomes from the Company’s first Annual General Meeting 
expected to be held on 26 May 2016.
4.8 Minor changes 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out 
in this report (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for the amendment.

Directors’ Report
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Board from 
time to time. Non-Executive Directors’ fees (as distinct from any 
salary, remuneration or other amount payable to a Director pursuant 
to other provisions of the Articles of Association or otherwise) may 
not exceed £750,000 per annum in aggregate or such higher 
amount as may from time to time be determined by ordinary 
resolution of the Company. The fees paid to the Non-Executive 
Directors are shown on page 85 of this Annual Report.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
The Group maintains liability insurance for its Directors and Officers. 
The Company has also granted indemnities to its Directors and the 
Company Secretary. Neither the indemnity nor insurance cover 
provides cover in the event that a Director (or Officer or Company 
Secretary) is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

Company with information concerning interests in those shares.
All employees (including Directors) that are deemed to be Company 
insiders have complied with the Group Share Dealing Code.
There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights save in situations 
where the Company is legally entitled to impose such a restriction 
(for example under the Articles of Association where amounts 
remain unpaid in the shares after request or the holder is otherwise 
in default of an obligation to the Company). The Company is not 
aware of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.

Relationship Agreement 
On 23 October 2015, the Company entered into a relationship 
agreement with JSC BGEO Investments and Bank of Georgia 
Holdings PLC (now named BGEO Group PLC) which regulates the 
degree of control that BGEO Group PLC and its associates may 
exercise over the management and business of the Group. The 
principal purpose of the relationship agreement is to ensure that the 
Company and its subsidiaries are capable at all times of carrying on 
their business independently of BGEO Group PLC and its 
associates. The relationship agreement took effect on admission to 
listing and will continue until the earlier of: (i) the Company’s shares 
ceasing to be admitted to listing on the Official List; and (ii) BGEO 
Group PLC, together with its associates, ceasing to own or control 
(directly or indirectly) 20 per cent. or more of the voting share capital 
of the Company. If BGEO Group PLC ceases to be a controlling 
shareholder (within the meaning of LR 6.1.2A of the Listing Rules), it 
may terminate the relationship agreement by giving one month’s 
written notice to the Company.
Under the relationship agreement, for so long as BGEO Group PLC 
and its associates together hold 20 per cent. or more of the voting 
share capital of the Company, BGEO Group PLC shall, and has 
agreed to procure that each of its associates shall, amongst  
other things:
• conduct all transactions, agreements or arrangements entered 
into between the Company or any of its subsidiaries (on the one 
hand) and BGEO Group PLC and its associates (on the other) on 
an arm’s length basis and on normal commercial terms and in 
accordance with the related party transaction rules set out in the 
Listing Rules;
• not take any action that has or would have the effect of 
preventing the Company or any of its subsidiaries from complying 
with their obligations under the Listing Rules;
• not propose or procure the proposal of any resolution of the 
shareholders of the Company (or any class thereof) which is 
intended, or appears to be intended, to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules; and/or
• abstain from voting on any resolution required by LR 11.1.7R(3) of 
the Listing Rules to approve a transaction with a related party 
involving BGEO Group PLC.
The relationship agreement entitles BGEO Group PLC to appoint 
one person to be a Non-Executive Director of the Company. BGEO 
Group PLC will retain the right to appoint one Non-Executive 
Director of the Company for so long as it (together with its 
associates) holds at least 20% of the voting share capital of  
the Company.
The relationship agreement also provides that (subject to permitted 
exceptions) neither BGEO Group PLC nor its associates shall 
compete with the business of the Group nor use any names 
associated with the Group and that the Group shall not use any 
names associated with BGEO Group PLC or its associates.
A copy of the relationship agreement is available to view at the 
Company’s registered office.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are set out in Note 39 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 146 of this Annual Report.
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit before taxation for the year of GEL 23.6 
million (year ended 31 December 2014 GEL 14.5 million). Profit after 
taxation for the year was GEL 23.6 million (year ended 31 December 
2014 GEL 13.3 million). 
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends 
provided that no such dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by its Directors. The Directors may also pay interim 
dividends as appear to be justified by the profits of the Company 
available for distribution. As the Company is a holding company, it 
relies primarily on dividends and other statutorily (if any) and 
contractually permissible payments from its subsidiaries to generate 
the funds necessary to meet its obligations and pay any dividends to 
its shareholders. The Company has stated in its listing prospectus 
that it does not intend to pay any dividend for the first two years 
following the admission of shares to listing.
Significant contracts and agreements
At no time during 2015 did any Director hold a material interest in 
any contracts of significance with the Company or any member of 
the Group. The Company is not party to any significant agreements 
(apart from the Relationship Agreement) that would take effect, alter 
or terminate following a change of control of the Company. 
Political donations
The Group did not make any political donations or incur any political 
expenditure during 2015. 
Payment of creditors
We value our suppliers and acknowledge the importance of paying 
invoices in an orderly and timely manner. It is the Group’s practice to 
agree terms on an individual basis when entering into contract and 
meet obligations accordingly. The Group does not follow any 
specific published code or standard on payment practice.
Code of conduct and ethics
The Group is committed to the highest standards of conduct in all 
aspects of its business. As part of the listing process, the Group 
adopted a code of conduct and ethics policy that its Directors and 
employees are expected to abide by.
External auditor
A resolution to appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors of the Group 
will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Meeting, together with an explanation of the business to be dealt 
with at the meeting, is included as a separate document sent to 
Shareholders who have elected to receive hard copies of 
shareholder information and is also available on the Group’s website. 
Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware 
and each Director has taken all steps that he/she reasonably should 
have taken as Directors in order to make him/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
statutory auditors are aware of such information.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the accompanying 
consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under the law, 
the Directors have elected to prepare the accompanying 
consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable law.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
accompanying consolidated and separate financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.
In preparing the accompanying consolidated and separate financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business.
The Directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of 
the Group, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the 
consolidated and separate financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. 
The Directors have further responsibility for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The 
Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Each Director confirms that to the best of his/her knowledge:
• the consolidated and separate financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report (which includes the accounts), taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
In arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of 
processes that form part of its internal control and risk management 
systems, including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate senior management 
with overall coordination by the Head of Investor Relations to 
ensure consistency across sections;
• an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure  
factual accuracy;
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual Report are 
undertaken by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior 
executive management;
• an advanced draft is considered and reviewed by GHG’s legal 
advisors; and
• the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to 
consideration by the Board.

In executing our audit response to the above risk of material misstatement, we also considered the 
risk of fraud in relation to management override of controls particularly post close adjustments and 
significant areas of accounting estimate.
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components and audit 
procedures on specific balances for a further six components.
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for more than 
88% of Group’s pre-tax profit, revenue and total assets.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risk of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing this risk, we have performed the procedures below which 
were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on this individual area.
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Risk of fraud in recognition of healthcare 
revenue and gross premium written
Balance of GEL 239.1 million, prior year 
comparative GEL 196.3 million
The Group is one of the largest healthcare 
providers in Georgia. The Group’s 
management may be under pressure to 
report strong financial performance in order 
to meet the expectations of internal and 
external stakeholders, particularly following 
the listing of Georgia Healthcare Group PLC 
and in light of lowered economic growth 
forecasts in Georgia and the devaluation 
of the Georgian Lari against the US 
Dollar. Further, compensation tied to the 
performance of the Group may create an 
incentive for management to manipulate 
results. As a consequence, there is a greater 
risk of misstatement in these balances, 
either by fraud or error, including through the 
potential override of controls by management.

We performed a walkthrough of the healthcare revenue and 
gross premium written processes and assessed the design 
and operating effectiveness of key controls.
We increased our standard sample size for transactional 
testing by at least 1.7 times according to our statistical 
sampling methodology, to respond to this risk of fraud. We 
agreed transactions on a sample basis back to supporting 
audit evidence, such as agreements, receipt of cash and 
invoices; where appropriate, we also recalculated the  
fees charged.
We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing 
in order to identify and test the risk of misstatement arising 
from management override of controls. We performed 
substantive analytical review to consider unusual trends that 
could indicate material misstatements, and we considered 
changes in key drivers of healthcare revenue, such as bed 
occupancy, number of patients and number of beds. 
For the gross premium written, we recalculated the unearned 
premium reserve and related income statement accounts, 
and we performed analytical reviews, including ratio analysis, 
trend analysis and prediction analysis.
We also performed cut-off testing to obtain evidence that 
revenue is recognised in the correct period.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over 
this risk area in six components, which covered 94% of the 
risk amount.
Based on the results of 
our audit procedures, 
we concluded that the 
healthcare revenue and gross 
premium written for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 
are materially correct. 100 

The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity 
within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk 
profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as 
recent Internal Audit findings when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to make sure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected nine components. Of the nine components selected, we performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of three components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For 
the remaining six components (“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within the components that 
we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile.

Components subject to a full scope audit account for over 46% of the Group’s revenue, over 32% of the Group’s pre-tax profit and over 44% of 
the Group’s total assets. Components subject to a specific scope audit account for over 48% of the Group’s revenue, over 56% of the Group’s 
pre-tax profit and over 45% of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the components but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
The remaining 11 components together represent 12% of the Group’s pre-tax profit. For these components, we performed other procedures, 
including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components 
by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors operating under our instruction.
For the one specific scope component, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to make sure that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits the principal components of the Group. The Senior Statutory Auditor is based in the UK, but since Group management and operations 
reside in Georgia, the Group audit team operates as an integrated primary team including members from the UK, Georgia and Russia. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor visited Georgia four times during the current year’s audit and there was regular interaction between team members in  
each jurisdiction. 
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the Georgian primary team and the component team and any issues arising from their 
work, as well as meeting with Group and local management. In addition, we participated in planning and closing meetings and reviewed selected 
audit working papers. The primary team interacted regularly with the component team where appropriate during various stages of the audit and 
were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave 
us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be GEL 1.2 million, which is 5% of pre-tax profit. 
We consider the basis of our materiality to be one of the principal considerations for shareholders of the Company in assessing the financial 
performance of the Group. It is linked to the key earnings measures discussed when the Group presents the financial results.
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. Our evaluation of materiality requires professional 
judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative considerations implicit in the definition.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and made adjustments based on the final financial performance of the Group.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% of our planning materiality, namely GEL 0.6 million. We have set performance materiality at this percentage 
(which is the lowest in the range) due to it being our initial audit of the Group. Our approach is designed to have a reasonable probability of 
ensuring that the total of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed our materiality of GEL 1.2 million for the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based 
on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of 
the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was as follows:
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC GEL 0.5 million
JSC Medical Corporation EVEX GEL 0.3 million
Unimed Kakheti LLC GEL 0.3 million
All specific scope components GEL 0.1 million to GEL 0.2 million
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of GEL 59 thousand, which is set at 
5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2015 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider 
the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on page 97, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  102 

including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.

1. Background
In 2014 the JSC Insurance Company Aldagi (“Aldagi”) and its subsidiaries (“Aldagi group”) began a corporate reorganisation in order to separate 
the healthcare services and medical insurance business, from the property and casualty insurance business.
As at 1 August 2014, Aldagi’s medical insurance business segment was separated and transferred to a newly established legal entity, JSC 
Insurance Company Imedi L (“Imedi L”). At the same time, healthcare providers included in the Aldagi group were transferred to a newly 
established holding company, JSC Medical Corporation EVEX (“EVEX”).
Both Imedi L and EVEX have been ultimately owned by the Bank of Georgia Holdings plc (“BGH”) since the commencement of reorganisation, but 
did not represent a group of entities until 27 August 2015, when BGH established a holding company, Georgia Healthcare Group PLC (“GHG” or 
“the Group”), and transferred its shares in Imedi L and EVEX to GHG. BGH changed its name to BGEO Group PLC (“BGEO”) in 2015. Refer to 
Note 23.
Financial information related to the pre 27 August 2015 period has been prepared for GHG from the financial statements of the combined entities 
as if GHG had been established and the transfer of the BGH’s shares in EVEX and Imedi L had been completed as at 31 December 2013.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 the ultimate parent of GHG is BGEO Group PLC (“BGEO”), incorporated in London, United 
Kingdom. GHG results are consolidated as part of BGEO’s Accounts.
The Group’s healthcare services business provides medical services to inpatient and outpatient customers through a network of hospitals and 
clinics throughout Georgia. And its medical insurance business offers a wide range of medical insurance products, including personal accident, 
term life insurance products bundled with medical insurance and travel insurance policies to corporate and retail clients.
In November 2015, Georgia Healthcare Group PLC, a public limited liability company newly incorporated in United Kingdom, successfully placed 
its shares on London Stock Exchange Premium Listing through an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). The Offering comprised 38,681,820 shares 
equating to an offering size of approximately GBP 66 million, representing approximately 29% of GHG’s share capital on Admission, excluding the 
Over-allotment Option. Citigroup Global Markets Limited was granted an over-allotment option exercised in November 2015 in respect of up to 
3,868,180 shares, representing approximately 10% of the offering.
The legal address of GHG PLC is No. 84 Brook Street, London W1K 5EH, United Kingdom. 
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 the following shareholders owned more than 3% of the total outstanding shares of the Group. 
Other shareholders individually owned less than 3% of the outstanding shares.

2. Basis of preparation
Basis of preparation 
In accordance with the exemption permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the separate income statement of GHG is not 
presented as part of these accounts.
The Company’s and Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by the European Union (“EU”), and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless  
otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, land and office buildings 
classified as property and equipment and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. These consolidated financial 
statements have been presented in thousands of Georgian lari (GEL), except otherwise stated.
Going concern 
The GHG’s Board of Directors has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the 
resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future for a period of at least 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. 
Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
Reclassifications
During year ended 31 December 2015 the Group reconsidered the presentation of its consolidated statement of financial position for the purpose 
of more accurate presentation of receivables from healthcare services and payables for share acquisitions. The presentation of comparative 
figures has been adjusted to conform to the presentation of the current year amounts:
Consolidated statement of financial position
As previously 
reported Reclassification As reclassified
Receivables from healthcare services 43,814 (549) 43,265
Other assets 20,274 549 20,823
Payables for share acquisitions 13,694 (529) 13,165
Accounts payable 8,081 510 8,591
Other liabilities 11,487 19 11,506
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation 
of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, except for the adoption of the following new Standards effective 
as of 1 January 2015 that did not have any impact on Group’s financial statements:
• Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions;
• Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle that includes amendments to IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 8, IAS 16 and IAS 24;
• Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle that includes amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of GHG and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015. Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Control is 
achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in 
assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the 
three elements of control. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the Group and to the non-controlling 
interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of 
the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 114 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Financial statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets 
acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is 
recognised in profit or loss. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation 
of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in either profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the 
contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that 
is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Refer to Note 20.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, current accounts and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within three months 
from the date of origination, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are free 
from contractual encumbrances.
Receivables from healthcare services
Receivables from healthcare services are recognised initially at the transaction price deemed to be fair value at origination date. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. The carrying value of healthcare 
receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any 
impairment loss recorded in the consolidated profit or loss.
Financial assets
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified either as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or 
available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case 
of assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its financial 
assets upon initial recognition. The Group does not have any financial assets designated as available-for-sale or at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired or originated.
Equity investments classified as available-for-sale are those that are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit 
or loss.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. These 
investments are initially recognised at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the investment. All transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the investment. Subsequent to initial recognition, these investments 
are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
As part of its risk management, the Group uses foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage exposures resulting from changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. Such financial instruments are measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when it is negative. Gains and losses resulting from the derivative contracts are included in the consolidated profit or loss 
in net gains/(losses) from foreign currencies.
Allowances for impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit 
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the 
interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss.

Assets carried at amortised cost
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result 
from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not the foreclosure is probable.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and 
individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists 
for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk 
characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and 
for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring  
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss  
is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the  
reversal date.
When an asset is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for impairment. Such assets are written off after all necessary 
procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
decrease the charge for impairment of financial assets in the consolidated profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, if applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the following 
conditions are met:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset but has 
assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; and
• the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the 
asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset that is measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Borrowings
A borrowing is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires and if its terms are substantially modified.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. Income and expense will not be offset in the profit or loss unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or 
interpretation. The Group has not offset any of its assets and liabilities or income and expenses.
Insurance contracts
Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk at the inception of the contract or those where at the inception of 
the contract there is a scenario with commercial substance where the level of insurance risk may be significant. The significance of insurance risk 
is dependent on both the probability of an insured event and the magnitude of its potential effect.
Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime, even if the 
insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Insurance premiums receivables
Insurance premiums receivable are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost. The carrying value of insurance 
premiums receivable is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, 
with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated profit or loss.
Insurance contract liabilities
The provision is recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged, and is brought to account as premium income over the 
term of the contract in accordance with the pattern of insurance service provided under the contract. At each reporting date the carrying amount 
of unearned premium is calculated on active policies based on the insurance period and time until the expiration date of each insurance 
policy. The Group reviews its unexpired risk based on the historical performance of separate business lines to determine the overall change in 
expected claims. The differences between the unearned premium reserves, loss provisions and the expected claims are recognised in the 
consolidated profit or loss by setting up a provision for premium deficiency.
Deferred acquisition costs
Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) are capitalised costs related to the issuance of insurance policies. They consist of commissions paid to agents, 
brokers and some employees. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. 116 

Fair value measurement
The Group revalues derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date and investment property, land and office buildings at each balance sheet 
date if their fair value differs materially from carrying value. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in 
Note 38.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best 
interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment except for land and office buildings are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.
Included in hospitals and clinics category are buildings in which referral hospitals, community hospitals and ambulatory clinics are placed.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated profit or loss as an expense.
Following initial recognition at cost, land and office buildings are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation 
less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are performed frequently enough 
(market value changes are monitored at least once in a year) to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its 
carrying amount.
If an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity in other reserves. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation 
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the 
decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any 
credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the 
amount accumulated in other reserves in equity.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is  
restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred  
to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated  
useful lives:
Years
Office buildings 100
Hospitals and clinics 100
Furniture and fixtures 5-10
Medical equipment 5-10
Computers 5
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses unless they qualify  
for capitalisation.
An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognising of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the consolidated profit or loss in the period the asset is derecognised.
Assets under construction comprises costs directly related to construction of property and equipment including an appropriate allocation of 
directly attributable variable and fixed overheads that are incurred in construction. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as similar 
property assets, commences when the assets are ready for use.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the related leased asset. The asset’s residual value and useful life are reviewed, and 
adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.

Inventory
Inventory comprises of medical supplies and nonmedical supplies and is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of  
inventory is determined on a weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring inventory and bringing it to its existing 
location and condition.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the 
consolidated profit or loss when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs comprise interest expense calculated using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising from foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the year in 
which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in Georgia.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes are 
provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting 
purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Georgia also has various operating taxes that are assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are included as a component of general and 
administrative expenses.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include computer software and licences.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite 
lives are amortised over the useful economic lives of such assets of between four to 10 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit 
level. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues 
to be supportable.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recorded as an expense as incurred. Software development costs 
(relating to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software) are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group can 
demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to 
use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete and the ability to measure 
reliably the expenditure during the development. Other software development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can 
be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as an asset 
but only when it is virtually certain that it will be received. 118 

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based compensation transactions
Senior executives of the Group receive share-based compensation, whereby employees render services as consideration for the equity 
instruments of BGEO or GHG. Share-based compensation plans announced by BGEO and GHG include both equity-settled and cash-settled 
transactions. Share-based compensation plans are recognised as either equity (in case of equity-settled plans) or liability (in case of cash-settled 
plans). The former is credited directly to equity, while the latter is included in accruals for employee compensation. 
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the date of 
the transaction. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the 
award (the “vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.  
The consolidated profit or loss charge for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of 
that period.
Cash-settled transactions
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date based on market quotations. This fair value is expensed 
over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up 
to, and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in salaries and other employee benefits.
Equity
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination, are 
shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is 
recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting date. 
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but before the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Income and expense recognition
Healthcare services revenue
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to 
the entity. Revenue is presented net of corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of detailed bills with 
counterparties (mostly with the State). Proposed corrections and rebates are identified by the customers (mostly by State) only upon or 
subsequent to the official act of acceptance for the invoices submitted by the Group. The proposed corrections are further discussed by the 
Group with the respective counterparties and either agreed upon and recognised or further disputed, sometimes through a litigation. Corrections 
and rebates may arise only subsequent to official submission of the invoice by the Group and the official acceptance of the invoice by the 
counterparty. The Group’s gross revenue (before deducting its corrections and rebates) is based on the official invoices submitted to and formally 
accepted by the customers (State, insurance companies, provider clinics and individuals).
Healthcare services revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for providing inpatient and outpatient services 
and includes the following components:
• Healthcare services revenue from State – The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the State 
programmes based on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare services revenue from insurance companies – The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various 
insurance companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare services revenue from out-of-pocket and other – The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on the 
completion of the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group. Sales are usually in cash or by credit card. Other revenue from 
medical services includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, which the Group has contractual relationship with. Sales of services 
are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered and are calculated according to contractual tariffs.
Interest income 
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest-bearing financial assets classified as AFS, interest income is recorded using 
the effective interest rate (EIR). The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial 
instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest income is included in finance income 
in the statement of profit or loss.
Net insurance premiums earned
Insurance premiums written are recognised on policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage. 
Premiums written reflect business incepted during the period, and exclude any sales-based taxes or duties. Unearned premiums are those 
proportions of the premiums written in a period that relate to periods after the reporting date. Unearned premiums are computed on a monthly 
pro rata basis.
Unearned premium reserve
The proportion of written premiums attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as unearned premium. The change in the unearned premium 
reserve is taken to the consolidated profit or loss in the order that revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, the amount of 
expected future benefit payments.

Income and expense recognition continued 
Cost of healthcare services
Cost of healthcare services rendered represents expenses directly related to the generation of revenue from healthcare services rendered, 
including but not limited to salaries and benefits of medical personnel, materials and supplies, utilities and other direct costs.
Net claims incurred
Insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the period, whether reported or not, including the related handling costs and 
other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous periods. Claims handling costs include internal and external costs 
incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims, such as salaries of general practitioners. Internal costs include all direct 
expenses of the claims department and any part of the general administrative costs directly attributable to the claims function.
EBITDA
The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of statement of comprehensive income. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortisation and is derived as the Group’s Profit before income tax expense but excluding the following line items: depreciation 
and amortisation, interest income, interest expense, net losses from foreign currencies and net non-recurring (expense)/income.
Net non-recurring (expense)/income
The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature. Any type of income or expense may 
be non-recurring by nature. The Group defines non-recurring income or expense as an income or expense triggered by or originated from an 
extraordinary economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and ordinary business course of the Group and is caused by 
uncertain or unpredictable external factors.
Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency and functional currency of all 
the Group’s components. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Georgian Lari at official 
exchange rates declared by the National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”) and effective as at the reporting date. Gains and losses resulting from the 
translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated profit or loss within net losses from foreign currencies.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a transaction in a foreign currency and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the 
transaction are included in net losses from foreign currencies in the consolidated profit or loss. The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 
2015 and 31 December 2014 were 2.3949 and 1.8636 Georgian Lari to 1 US Dollar, respectively.
Standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations relevant to the Group that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under 
IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
goods or services to a customer.
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new revenue standard is applicable to 
all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is 
required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of 
IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and 
replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new 
requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. The 
adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, but no impact on the classification 
and measurement of the Group’s financial liabilities.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating 
a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, a revenue-
based method cannot be used to depreciate property and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible 
assets. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to 
depreciate its non-current assets.
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their 
separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity method in its separate financial statements  
will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in its separate financial statements, 
they will be required to apply this method from the date of transition to IFRS. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments will not have any impact on the Group’s consolidated  
financial statements. 120 

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective continued
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative 
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. The 
amendments clarify: 
• The materiality requirements in IAS 1 
• That specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated 
• That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements 
• That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a single line 
item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss 
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial position 
and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with 
early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases 
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases with an effective date of annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 results in 
lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standard in a manner similar to the way in which finance leases are currently 
accounted for under IAS 17 Leases. Lessees will recognise a right of use asset and a corresponding financial liability on the balance sheet. The 
asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the financial liability measured at amortised cost. Lessor accounting remains substantially 
the same as in IAS 17. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on its financial statements. 
IAS 12 Income Taxes
In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related 
to debt instruments measured at fair value and clarify recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, to address diversity in practice. 
Entities are required to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. These 
amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle 
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. They include: 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
Assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of either through sale or distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing from 
one of these disposal methods to the other would not be considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There 
is, therefore, no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. This amendment must be applied prospectively. 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
(i) Servicing contracts 
The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity must 
assess the nature of the fee and the arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement in IFRS 7 in order to assess whether the 
disclosures are required. The assessment of which servicing contracts constitute continuing involvement must be done retrospectively. However, 
the required disclosures would not need to be provided for any period beginning before the annual period in which the entity first applies 
the amendments. 
(ii) Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements 
The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless  
such disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent annual report. This amendment must be  
applied retrospectively. 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
The amendment clarifies that market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is 
denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in that 
currency, government bond rates must be used. This amendment must be applied prospectively.

4. Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements necessitates the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements. These estimates and assumptions 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the reporting date as well as affecting the reported income and 
expenses for the period. Although the estimates are based on management’s best knowledge and judgement of current facts as at the reporting 
date, the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Impairment of receivables from healthcare services
The impairment provision for receivables from healthcare services is based on the Group’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer 
accounts. If there is a sign of deterioration in an individually significant customer’s creditworthiness, the respective receivable is considered to be 
impaired. Key criteria for defining the signs of such deterioration is the customers’ debt services quality measured by the numbers of days in 
arrears (i.e. The number of days for overdue payments). Based on the respective analysis of the current and past debt services of the customers, 
the Group determines whether or not there is an objective evidence of an impairment. If yes, then the proper provision rate is applied which 
reflects the credit risk associated with that particular category of debt services. If not, then the respective accounts receivable are assessed 
collectively, as a good quality, in a total pool for the good credit quality receivables, based on loss given default and the number of days overdue, 
which practically implies an immaterial amount of overdue days.
For collective assessment purposes the management’s judgment is that historical trends can serve as a basis for predicting incurred losses and 
that this approach can be used to estimate the amount of recoverable debts as at the reporting period end.
Actual results may differ from the estimates and the Group’s estimates can be revised in the future, either negatively or positively, depending upon 
the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure. The amount of allowance for impairment of the healthcare 
receivables as at 31 December 2015 was GEL 7,829 (2014: GEL 5,157). Refer to Note 10.
Goodwill impairment test
Significant accounting judgments and estimates related to the goodwill impairment test are presented in Note 12.
Impairment of insurance premiums receivable
The Group regularly reviews its insurance premiums receivable to assess impairment. For accounting purposes, the Group uses an incurred loss 
model for the recognition of losses on the impaired insurance premiums receivable. This means that losses can only be recognised when 
objective evidence of a specific loss event has been observed. The model for identification of the impaired amounts and their further provisioning 
is mostly based on the number of days in arrears and is very similar to the model used for the analysis and impairment of the receivables from 
healthcare services described above.
For collective assessment purposes the management judgement is that historical trends can serve as a basis for predicting incurred losses and 
that this approach can be used to estimate the amount of recoverable debts as at the reporting period end. For specific assessment purposes 
the management takes into account financial performance including key ratios and cash position of the counterparty.
Actual results may differ from the estimates and the Group’s estimates can be revised in the future, either negatively or positively, depending upon 
the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure. The amount of allowance for impairment of insurance premiums 
receivable as at 31 December 2015 was GEL 2,692 (2014: GEL 2,255). Refer to Notes 9 and 31.
Current income tax recognition 
The current income tax charge is calculated in accordance with Georgian legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date. Reinvestment of profits in medical business is free from taxation in accordance with Georgian tax legislation. Judgement is applied to 
assess and determine the portion of the current year profit that the Group will reinvest in its core economical activities during the next three 
years. The probable future reinvestment amount of current year profit is based on the medium-term business plan (three years following the 
current year) prepared by the management. Further details on taxation are disclosed in Note 13.
Claims liability arising from insurance contracts
For insurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the 
expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of time before the 
ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty. Insurance claims provisions are not discounted for the time value of money. The carrying 
amount of the claims incurred but not yet reported as at 31 December 2015 was GEL 1,650 (2014: GEL 1,603). Refer to Note 16. 122 

The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in the Tbilisi healthcare market by acquiring Deka. Management considers that the 
deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
Since acquisition, Deka has recorded GEL 1,089 and GEL 193 of revenue and profit respectively. Full year revenue and profit of the acquired 
entity were GEL 2,289 and GEL 313 respectively. 
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group would have recorded GEL 240,265 and GEL 23,737 of revenue and 
profit respectively.
The net assets presented above are estimated provisionally as at the issue date. The Group continues thorough full examination of these net 
assets and if identified, proper adjustments will be made to the net assets and amount of the goodwill during the 12-month period from the

If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group would have recorded GEL 239,525 and GEL 23,697 of revenue and 
profit respectively.
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of the business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the 
positive synergy that is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations. For the tax legislation purposes goodwill is recognised on a stand-
alone balance of a company only subsequent to the legal merger of the relevant cash generating unit. Until then goodwill as an asset does not 
exist separately for tax purposes, rather its full amount is part of the historical cost of the investment on the company’s balance sheet. 
Subsequent to the merger, for the tax legislation purposes, full amount of the goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset per the tax code and 
is subsequently amortised applying the algorithm provided by the tax code. Such amortisation is fully deductible for the tax purposes.

6. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two operating segments based on the products and services – Healthcare services and 
Medical insurance. All revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Group result from Georgia.
Healthcare services are the inpatient and outpatient medical services delivered by the referral hospitals, community hospitals and ambulatory 
clinics owned by the Group throughout the whole Georgian territory.
Medical insurance comprises a wide range of medical insurance products, including personal accident insurance, term life insurance products 
bundled with medical insurance and travel insurance policies, which are offered by the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary Imedi L.
Management monitors the operating results of each of the business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance, as in the table below, is measured in the same manner as profit or loss in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis as with transactions with third parties.
More than 50% of the Group’s revenue is derived from the State. However, management believes that the government cannot be considered as a 
single client, because the customers of the Group are the patients that receive medical services and not the counterparties that pay for these 
services. Therefore, no revenue from transactions with a single external customer amounted to 10% or more of the Group’s total revenue in the 
year ended 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2014.

The Group’s largest receivable is from the State, representing amounts receivable under the Universal Healthcare Programme (“UHC”) introduced 
by the State in March 2013. Through the UHC, the State provides basic healthcare coverage to the entire population, including more than two 
million people who previously lacked any medical insurance and purchased healthcare services only on an out-of-pocket basis. Currently fully 
operational, the implementation of UHC took place in several stages:
• March 2013. Urgent inpatient and limited outpatient healthcare was offered free of charge for individuals who were previously not covered by 
State or private insurance programmes (accounting for approximately two million people, including children above the age of six and adults);
• July 2013. UHC was extended to cover intensive therapy, planned surgeries, treatment of oncology diseases (including radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy and hormone therapy) as well as childbirth expenses;
• April 2014. UHC superseded the State Insurance Programme (SIP) – the first of two existing state insurance programmes that had provided 
healthcare coverage to “economically vulnerable” citizens since 2007;
• September 2014. UHC superseded the second SIP (under the Decree N°165) that covered pensioners, children under six and students.
A summary description of UHC is as follows:
• UHC is fully financed by the Georgian Government and administered by the Social Service Agency. In most cases beneficiaries have an annual 
limit of 15,000 Lari per incident. This threshold limits the services to which a patient can have access, resulting in the need for co-payment for 
most critical elective services;
• UHC beneficiaries are eligible to select a healthcare provider of their choice, as long as it is enrolled in the programme;
• Any provider, private or public, is eligible to participate in the programme;
• The actual prices that are charged to patients by healthcare providers are not regulated by the State. However, the reimbursement scheme 
(i.e. The amount paid by the State to healthcare providers) differs depending on the types of service:
 – The capitation method is used for elective outpatient services;
 – Emergency medical care tariffs are based on the minimum historic prices under the previous State medical insurance programmes,  
with the possibility of changes over time;
 – For elective inpatient services, the amount reimbursed by the State is based on the average of the lowest 25th percentile of the prices 
charged by countrywide providers, with the patient making a co-payment for any excess charges;
UHC reimbursement scheme for the selected services in Georgia is as follows:
Service Reimbursement from the State
Scheduled ambulatory service 70%
Service of a family doctor and basic laboratory tests 100%
Emergency inpatient services 70/100% with a limit for a single accident of 15,000 Lari
Scheduled surgeries and associated tests 70%; annual limit – 15,000 Lari
Treatment of oncology diseases 80%; annual limit – 12,000 Lari
Childbirth 500 Lari; caesarean section – 800 Lari 128 

The Group pledges its office and hospital buildings and assets under construction as collateral for its borrowings. The carrying amount of the 
buildings and assets under construction pledged as at 31 December 2015 was GEL 322,076 (2014: GEL 212,903).
The Group engaged an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of its land and office buildings. Fair value is determined by reference to 
market-based evidence. The most recent revaluation report for the Group’s buildings was dated 31 December 2015. If the land and office 
buildings were measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts of the buildings as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 would be 
as follows:

In calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) following assumptions were made: 
• A moderate, stable 3% growth of real GDP was assumed based on the Government’s forecasts.
• Further synergies between insurance and healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage.
• Growth of other (non-state funded) insurance business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth.
Management believes that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount CGUs will not result in an 
impairment of goodwill.
The Group performs goodwill impairment test annually as at 31 December. The latest impairment test performed by the Group was as at 
31 December 2015. The Group did not identify impairment of goodwill as at 31 December 2015.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections 
based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering from a one to three-year period.

Georgian legal entities must file individual tax declarations. The statutory corporate tax rate was 15% in year ended 31 December 2015 and 
31 December 2014.
The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates. Reconciliation of the income tax expense based on statutory rates with 
actual is as follows:
Year ended 
31 December 
2015
Year ended 
31 December 
2014
IFRS income before tax 23,608 14,510
Statutory tax rate 15% 15%
Theoretical income tax expense at the statutory rate 3,541 2,177
Correction of prior year declaration (1,588) –
Non-taxable income (2,702) (1,034)
Non-deductible expenses 740 103
Income tax (benefit)/expense (9) 1,246
Non-taxable income mainly comprises amount of utilised investment tax credit. Refer to Note 4.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax asset originating from tax loss carryforward in the Company’s separate accounts. The Group does not 
expect taxable profits in the Company’s separate accounts for the foreseeable future which would enable to utlise the tax loss. Accordingly, in the 
absence of a recognition of a deferred tax asset, there is no impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 of the 
future reductions in the UK corporation tax rate. 130 

Deferred income tax liabilities (3,265) 1,293 (6,908) (8,880) 3,017 (13,443) (19,306)
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable 
entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Georgia currently has a number of laws related to various taxes imposed by State governmental authorities. Applicable taxes include value added 
tax, corporate income tax (profits tax), and a turnover based tax, amongst others. Laws related to these taxes have not been in force for 
significant periods in contrast to more developed market economies. Therefore, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few precedents 
have been established. This creates tax risks in Georgia that are substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more 
developed tax systems.
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains that 
relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive issues. The Group’s operations and financial position will continue to 
be affected by Georgian political developments, including the application and interpretation of existing and future legislation and tax regulations. 
Such possible occurrences and their effect on the Group could have a material impact on the Group’s operations or its financial position 
in Georgia.

22. Commitments and contingencies
Legal
In the ordinary course of business, the Group and the Company are subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes that the 
ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results of 
future operations of the Group and the Company.
Taxation
Georgian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities. Recent 
events within Georgia suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments 
and as a result, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged. As such, significant 
additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. It is not practical to determine the amount of unasserted claims that may manifest, if 
any, or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for five calendar 
years preceding the period of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax, currency and 
customs positions will be sustained.

Regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are set by the ISSSG and are applied to Imedi L solely on a stand-alone basis. The ISSSG requirement 
is to maintain a minimum Capital of GEL 1,500, of which 80% should be kept in current accounts. A bank confirmation letter is submitted to 
ISSSG on a quarterly basis in order to prove compliance with the above-mentioned regulatory requirement. Imedi L regularly and consistently 
complies with the ISSSG regulatory capital requirement.
Earnings per share are calculated based on the assumption that GHG existed from 1 January 2015 and therefore the shares, although issued in 
November 2015, are assumed to be outstanding from beginning of the year. For the purpose of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per 
share the Group used Profit and total comprehensive income for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company of GEL 19,651 (2014: 
GEL 10,207) as a numerator and number of shares outstanding as at 31 December 2015 of 128,181,820 (31 December 2014: 28,334,829) as

by the Group’s ultimate parent, BGEO and the Group’s share-based compensation is reviewed, approved, awarded and then settled by BGEO, 
through the EECP and the Trustee.
During 2015 and 2014 different individuals from the top management of BGEO acted as CEO of the Group. Respective individuals are referred to 
as “the CEO” in the paragraphs that follow. Due to the fact that the Group does not expect payments of any dividends in the subsequent years, 
they were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value of the plans. 
GHG plans
In January 2015 the Board of Directors of BGEO resolved to award 175,000 ordinary shares of GHG to the CEO of the Group. In April 2015 the 
Board of Directors of BGEO resolved to award 159,000 ordinary shares of GHG to three executives. The shares awarded to a four-year vesting 
period, with continuous employment being the only vesting condition for both awards.
The Group considers 1 January 2015 and 29 April 2015 as the grant dates for the awards of CEO and other executives, respectively. The Group 
estimates that the fair value of the shares awarded was GEL 2.18 per share as of respective grant dates. Respective fair value was estimated 
using appropriate valuation techniques based on market and income approaches. As at 31 December 2015, no shares have been vested.

36. Capital management 
Capital under management consists of share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings including profit or loss of the current year, 
revaluation and other reserves and non-controlling interests. The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies 
and approach to managing the risks that affect its capital position.
The capital management objectives are as follows:
• To maintain the required level of stability of the Group thereby providing a degree of security to the shareholders as well as insurance 
policyholders for the insurance arm;
• To allocate capital efficiently and support the development of business by ensuring that returns on capital employed meet the requirements of 
its capital providers and of its shareholders;
• To maintain financial strength to support new business growth and to satisfy the requirements of the shareholders, regulators as well as 
insurance policyholders for the insurance arm.
Some operations of the Group are subject to local regulatory requirements within the jurisdiction where it operates, currently Georgia only. Such 
regulations prescribe approval and monitoring of certain activities. They also impose certain restrictive provisions for the insurance arm, such as 
insurance capital adequacy and the minimal insurance liquidity requirement, to minimise the risk of default and insolvency and to meet unforeseen 
liabilities as they arise.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 and year ended 31 December 2014 the Group complied with all of regulatory requirements as well as 
insurance capital and insurance liquidity regulations, in full.
The Group’s capital management policy for its insurance business is to hold the least required amount of the regulatory capital and, also, to hold 
sufficient liquid assets to cover statutory requirements based on the directives of ISSSG. Regulations of ISSSG require that an insurance 
company must hold liquid assets of at least 75% of its unearned premium reserve, net of gross insurance premiums receivable, and 100% of its 
loss reserves. Assets eligible for inclusion in liquid assets are: cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from credit institutions, loans issued, 
investment property as well as other financial assets, as defined by ISSSG. Amount of such minimal liquid assets is called “Statutory Reserve”.
The Statutory Reserve requirement for Imedi L as at 31 December 2015 equals to the minimal amount of liquid assets of GEL 9,565 (2014: 
GEL 5,714). The insurance company is fully compliant with the requirement by holding actual GEL 10,607 (2014: GEL 7,379) of total eligible 
liquid assets. 138 

37. Risk management
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to 
risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each individual within the 
Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to insurance risk, credit risk, liquidity risk 
and market risk. It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. They are 
monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process.
Risk management structure
Management Board
During 2014 year Aldagi had the responsibility to monitor and manage the entire risk process within the respective GHG components on a regular 
basis, by assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies and procedures as well as 
respective guidelines and controlling their implementation and performance of relevant departments and committees. During the 2015 year, these 
functions were carried out by management of the Group.
Internal Audit
During the 2014 year risk management processes throughout the Group were audited annually by the internal audit function of Aldagi that 
examined both the adequacy of the procedures and the Group’s compliance with the procedures. Internal Audit discusses the results of all 
assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. During the 2015 year, these functions 
were carried out by the internal audit function of the Group.
Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected 
losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models. The models make use of probabilities derived 
from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is the 
Base Case (forecast under normal business conditions) and the other two are the Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the 
worst-case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events that are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business strategy and 
market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected industries. 
In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risks types 
and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks. This information is 
presented and explained to the Management Board and the head of each business division. The reports include aggregate receivables exposures 
and credit exposures, their limits, exceptions to those limits, insurance contract liability positions and their limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, 
market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile. Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the levels of liquidity, 
credit positions, receivables positions and allowance for impairment on a monthly basis. The Management Board receives a comprehensive risk 
report once a month. These reports are designed to provide all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.
Risk mitigation
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures to net currency position, 
insurance liabilities risks, interest rates and credit risks.
The Group actively uses a collective financial responsibility approach to individual healthcare customers arising from the provision of healthcare 
services to out-of-pocket customers, to manage the respective individual debtors arising from healthcare services falling out of the scope of 
the UHC.
Insurance risk
The risk under an insurance contract is the risk that an insured event will occur including the uncertainty of the amount and timing of any resulting 
claim. The principal risk the Group faces under such contracts is that actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying amount of 
insurance liabilities. This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid that are greater than originally estimated 
and subsequent development of long-term claims.
The Group primarily uses its loss ratio and its combined ratio to monitor its insurance risk. Loss ratio is defined as net insurance claims divided by 
net insurance revenue. Combined ratio is the sum of loss ratio and expense ratio. Expense ratio is defined as insurance related operating 
expenses excluding interest expense divided by net insurance revenue. The Group’s loss ratios and combined ratios were as follows: 
31 December 
2015
31 December 
2014
Loss ratio 83.4% 87.7%
Combined ratio 96.7% 99.5%

The Group issues the following types of insurance contracts: health, term life bundled with health, personal accident and travel insurance. The 
table below sets out concentration of insurance contract liabilities by type of contract:
Year ended 
31 December 
2015
Year ended

Healthcare 2,412 2,481
Term Life 721 348
Travel 222 146
Personal accident 11 1
Total 3,366 2,976
For these insurance contracts the most significant risks arise from lifestyle changes, epidemic as well as changes in loss frequency and increases 
in prices of medical services. These risks vary significantly in relation to the location of the risk insured by the Group and the type of risks insured.
The above risk exposure is mitigated by diversification across a large portfolio of insurance contracts. The variability of risks is also improved by 
careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategies. The Group establishes underwriting guidelines and limits that stipulate who may 
accept risks, their nature and applicable limits. These limits are continuously monitored. Strict claim review policies to assess all new and ongoing 
claims, as well as the investigation of possible fraudulent claims are in place. The Group also enforces a policy of actively managing and promptly 
processing claims, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable future developments that can negatively impact the Group.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual 
obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties 
and for product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. Also, the Group establishes and regularly 
monitors credit terms by types of debtors, which is a proactive tool for managing the credit risk.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular analysis of debt service and aging of receivables, Counterparty limits are established in combination with 
credit terms.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take 
corrective action. 140 

Included in past due but not impaired category are the receivables and financial assets that are overdue for not more than 30 days or are 
overdue more than 30 days but have not been impaired due to objective reasons. Otherwise those receivables and financial assets that are 
overdue for more than 30 days are considered as impaired. The Group does not have a credit rating system to evaluate impaired loans.  
Therefore, impairment charges and allowance are based on the number of days overdue and the history of past performance by each time 
bucket of overdue exposures.
Liquidity risk and funding management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet all its payment obligations when they fall due under normal or stress 
circumstances. To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its capital, manages assets with liquidity  
in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates daily monitoring of expected cash flows and  
liquidity needs.
The Group manages the maturities of its assets and liabilities for better matching, which helps the Group additionally mitigate the liquidity risk. The 
major liquidity risks confronting the Group are the daily calls on its available cash resources in respect of supplier contracts, claims arising from 
insurance contracts and the maturity of borrowings.
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into their relevant maturity groups based on the remaining period at the reporting date 
to their contractual maturities or expected repayment dates.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.
The Group has exposure to market risks. The Group structures the levels of market risk it accepts through a Group market risk policy that 
determines what constitutes market risk for the Group. 142 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2015  Financial statements
37. Risk management continued
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the financial instruments or the future cash 
flows on financial instruments. The Group has floating interest rate borrowing linked to LIBOR and NBG short-term loan refinancing rates and is 
therefore exposed to interest rate risk.

Currency risk
The Group is exposed to effects of fluctuation in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.  
The Group’s principal transactions are carried out in Georgian Lari and its exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily with respect  
to US Dollars.
The Group’s financial assets are primarily denominated in the same currencies as its liabilities, which is the functional currency of the Group 
entities – Lari. Most of the Group’s operations are denominated in Lari too. This fact mitigates the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
operationally. The main foreign exchange risk arises from US Dollars denominated borrowings that are partially hedged through cash deposits 
with banks, also denominated in US Dollars and the foreign currency swap contracts with the Group’s counterparties.

As part of its risk management, the Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposures resulting from changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to perform, operational 
risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all 
operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks. 
Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, 
including the use of internal audit. 144 

Operating environment
The Group’s business in concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and regulatory 
infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically 
associated with those in developed markets (including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and 
undeveloped debt and equity markets). However, over the last few years the Georgian government has made a number of developments that 
positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, taxation 
and regulatory systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax Code and procedural laws). In the view of the 
Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future stability of the Georgian 
economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures 
undertaken by the Government. However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in  
the world.
38. Fair values measurements
Fair value hierarchy
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and 
risks of the asset or liability. The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly;
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data;
The following tables show analysis of assets and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed by level of the fair value 
hierarchy. It also includes a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments that are carried in the 
financial statements. The table does not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities:

The Group only carries land and office buildings at fair value (level 3). Refer to Note 11.
The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments and property that are recorded at fair value using valuation 
techniques. These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
Property and equipment, investment property
Property and investment property at fair value consist of land and buildings, for which fair value is derived by certain inputs that are not based on 
observable market data. The value of these assets is measured using the market approach or the cost approach. The market approach uses 
prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable land and buildings respectively. The cost 
approach reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of the asset.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments that are not already 
recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity (less than three months) it is assumed that the carrying 
amounts approximate their fair value. This assumption is also applied to variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they 
were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits 
is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity. 146 

40. Events after reporting period
In January 2016, the Directors of GHG undertook a reduction of capital in order to create distributable reserves for GHG. It was the intention of 
GHG’s Directors that the maximum amount of distributable reserves should be created. GHG Directors implemented a Court approved reduction 
of capital which reduced the original nominal value of GHG shares. GHG shares had an original nominal value of GBP 0.1 per share. Following the 
reduction of capital the nominal value of GHG shares was reduced to GBP 0.01. The reduction of capital is a legal and accounting adjustment 
and did not, of itself, have any direct impact on the market value of GHG shares. 
In January 2016, the Group early redeemed several borrowings from commercial banks thereby reducing balance of outstanding borrowings to 
GEL 69.6 million from GEL 117.2 million as at 31 December 2015.
In March 2016 the Group signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding, subject to relevant regulatory approvals, to acquire a 100% equity 
stake in JSC GPC (“GPC”), one of the three leading pharmaceutical retailers and wholesalers in Georgia.  148 

Business Model
Halfords has core competencies in marketing, branding, store 
retailing, distribution and international sourcing, which allow value 
to be generated to meet market needs. Since 2010, these 
competencies have been leveraged in Car Servicing, when we 
acquired our Autocentres business.
Our focus on range follows our strategy of life on the move and 
encompasses being:
 ■ the Friend of the Motorist;
 ■ the Best Cycle Shop in Town; and 
 ■ the Starting Point for Great Getaways. 
This is delivered through our Car Maintenance, Car 
Enhancement, Leisure, and Car Servicing categories through 
which Halfords has grown market share, consolidating 
fragmented markets with a national store and centre network, 
and strong brand management. 
Evolving buyer trends have been met by developing a dynamic 
web offer which has enabled the Company to leverage average 
transaction values and drive many web customers into stores, as 
well as combining halfords.com and halfordsautocentres.com to 
offer a Group-based solution. 
With the evolution of more compact and complex vehicles, the 
reduced interest in self-service or Do It Yourself (“DIY”), and an 
escalating main dealer service price list, Halfords has augmented 
the retail offer with Do It For Me (“DIFM”) in-store fitting services. 
This increases the average transaction value, is margin accretive 
and allows store colleagues to upsell and attach accessories to 
the sales whilst improving customer service and loyalty. 
The successful expansion of our Retail offer through in-store 
services drove the decision, in 2010, to invest in the Car Service 
category given similar market drivers to our successful Car 
Maintenance retail category. Halfords runs the largest chain of 
UK car service centres providing service, repair and MOTs.
Our operations are designed to be best in class so that we can 
leverage our market-leading positions through our supply chain. 
We source from suppliers around the world who manufacture 
products to our designs and specifications. Our distribution team 
use their specialist knowledge to group and ship products in line 
with the sales plan of our Retail operation and market demands. 
Our internal operations draw from best industry practice.
We also create value for our customers by keeping our cost 
structure as efficient as possible. The size of our operation 
means that we achieve advantages of scale and run our back 
office functions cost-effectively.
As a retailer, Halfords makes a profit from the combination of 
low-cost sourcing and supply chain coupled with excellent 
marketing and a national store network. These skills are 
leveraged in the Car Service sector by running an efficient service 
offer which profits from scale and efficiency. Halfords provides 
services more affordably than most franchised garages and more 
comprehensively than many independent garages.
Our brand is one of our greatest strengths and our strategy is to 
leverage this as we grow our Group. We want to provide a single 
face to customers so they can connect with the Halfords brand 
across our offer and through new products, services and 
channels. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Segmental Summary
The Halfords Group operates through two reportable 
segments: “Retail” and “Autocentres”. 
The business has three strategic pillars, Friend of the 
Motorist, Best Cycle Shop in Town and the Starting 
Point for Great Getaways, which span Retail and 
Autocentre operations.
Halfords Retail manages its business in the United 
Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and its 
product ranges are marketed through a national network 
of stores and through an innovative multi-channel offer 
which combines website promotion with direct delivery  
or collection from store, backed up by in-store services.
Halfords Autocentres provides car service, repair and 
MOTs to both retail and fleet customes throughout the 
UK. The Autocentres proposition provides customers with 
an unrivalled value and service offer from a trusted brand 
delivering dealership quality service at more affordable 
garage prices.
Halfords’ marketing expertise is used to promote both 
businesses through a multitude of broadcast, narrowcast 
and traditional media presenting our valuable services 
which facilitate life on the move for our customers. 
That’s helpful, that’s Halfords.
Halfords Autocentres employs approximately 1,700 staff and 
is the UK’s leading independent Car Servicing and repair 
operator offering maintenance, service, MOT and repair 
services at competitive prices and excellent standards of 
customer service. Halfords Autocentres trades from 260 Car 
Servicing centres and online through the  
www.halfordsautocentres.com websites.

Chairman’s Statement
This has been a challenging year for the UK consumer and 
Halfords was not immune to this difficult trading environment. 
Our customers have tightened their purse strings in response to 
increased taxes, an uncertain employment landscape and a lack 
of confidence in the face of recessionary conditions for much of 
the year. Our automotive customers were particularly hard hit by 
continued rises in fuel prices to unprecedented levels and by 
further increases in motor insurance which, in turn, was reflected 
by a decrease in miles driven in the UK. There were, however, 
some bright spots and we made good progress in our key 
growth areas, Car Maintenance parts fitting, Autocentres and 
Cycling, where the market continued to grow as more people 
recognised both the pleasure and beneficial health aspects of 
cycling.  
Against this backdrop, Group revenue declined by 0.8% with 
Retail down 2.3%, partly offset by strong growth from 
Autocentres where revenue grew by 12.9%. An adverse mix 
effect and input cost pressures for Retail and an increase in lower 
margin tyre sales by Autocentres resulted in an overall 100 basis 
point decrease in the Group’s gross margin. Our Retail cost base 
was closely managed but upward pressure on occupation, 
staffing and support costs, albeit mitigated by lower warehouse 
and distribution costs, resulted in a 3.6% rise in operating costs, 
whereas those of Autocentres rose in line with revenue growth. 
As a result, Group underlying profit before tax was down 26.6% 
to £92.2m.
A pleasing feature of the year was the Group’s continued robust 
cash flow performance with free cash flow, before dividends and 
capital transactions, of £70.4m being generated. This enabled 
the Board to recommend an unchanged final dividend of 14.0 
pence per share which would amount to 22.0 pence for the year, 
1.53 times covered by earnings per share of 33.7 pence and 1.6 
times by free cash flow. In addition, a share buyback programme 
was initiated in April 2011 with £62.3m being outlaid in the 
period. In total, £106.5m was returned to shareholders in the 
period and, with a Net Debt:EBITDA ratio of 1.1 at 30 March 
2012, the Group’s financial position remains sound.
During the year, management embarked upon a deep and 
wide-ranging review of the business, its strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities and threats. The Board has been an integral part of 
this process; contributing, challenging and supporting the output. 
The resultant vision for Halfords to “Help and Inspire our 
Customers with their Life on the Move” is underpinned by three 
pillars of the strategy:
 ■ the Friend of the Motorist
 ■ the Best Cycle Shop in Town
 ■ the Starting Point for Great Getaways
The underlying shift in emphasis of the strategy is recognition of 
the changes in customer preferences and the opportunities it 
presents for Halfords. The strategy plays to the strengths of 
Halfords, recognises and addresses the opportunities and 
challenges and underscores the uniqueness of the Group’s range 
of products and services, its heritage and strong brand. 
Importantly, it sets out a clear direction of travel for all of our 
stakeholders. The strategy will seek to  accelerate the transition 
of Halfords from a “traditional retailer to a contemporary provider 
of products and services”. 
Targeted investments in the key enablers of the strategy — our 
Retail store and Autocentre portfolio, IT and operating systems, 
web offerings, marketing and, most importantly, in our people 
— have been and are being mapped out and will commence in 
the year ahead. However, the transition will unfold more fully over 
the years ahead to ensure that we have a business that is fit for 
purpose for many, many years to come.
The backbone of the business and the key to the success of 
Halfords is, and will continue to be, our service ethic and our 
service offerings, backed by the very best product ranges. We 
will be relentless in our pursuit of service excellence and the 
mantras “Helpful” and “Trust”. Without this, our strategy and 
customer proposition will not resonate with our customers. 
Management will strive to ensure that every member of the 
Halfords Group is attuned to this message. I am sure that the 
12,000 colleagues in our Retail and Autocentres businesses and 
Head Office will rise to the challenge. In this regard, the Board 
thanks them for their dedication in this difficult trading year and is 
confident that they will continue to focus on delivery of the very 
best products and services to our customers.
This year, our Chief Executive, David Wild, set out to build a 
management team of contemporary skills and experience that 
would be best suited to face the challenges ahead. He has 
succeeded in doing so and the Board would like to thank David 
and his team for managing a difficult trading environment with 
some skill whilst dedicating much time and effort to crafting the 
strategy and plans for the future. Lastly, I would like to thank my 
Board colleagues for their support and for their passion to help 
Halfords achieve the very best for its shareholders.
“The key to the success of Halfords is, and will 
continue to be, our service ethic and our service 
offerings backed up by the very best product 
ranges .”

Since the beginning of the year, economic conditions have remained 
difficult and the uncertain and worrying situation in the Eurozone has 
cast a cloud over the UK economy. In addition, the record rains in April 
and early May have dampened the normal early spring spending on 
Leisure products which has affected our business. Nevertheless, we 
believe that our colleagues will be able to meet the inevitable 
challenges in the year ahead and that the execution of our strategy 
means Halfords is in good stead to grow the business in the years 
thereafter.

Market Review
The Halfords business operates through its Retail stores, Autocentres and 
websites in the UK and ROI. We continue to grow market share in our core 
market sectors where we have leading positions in attractive markets. 
Our unique proposition differentiates Halfords from its competition and creates 
value for customers through a combination of range, price and quality, delivered 
through our multi-channel offer by our colleagues who extend expert advice 
and service.
Halfords’ store and autocentre footprint covers the UK (United 
Kingdom) and ROI (Republic of Ireland) with the majority of 
locations around highly populated urban locations. The Retail 
store portfolio includes 467 stores with a mix of 402 
superstores (7,000–10,000 sq ft, 10,000 lines), 34 compact 
stores (approximately 4,000 sq ft, 6,000 lines) and 31 metro 
compact stores (small format, approximately 4,200 lines). The 
Autocentres business has increased to 260 centres. Both the 
Retail and Autocentres businesses have a comprehensive 
online offer: the Retail website covers 16,000 SKUs and the 
Autocentres website offers booking and location tools.
The Halfords vision to help and inspire customers with their life 
on the move is strategically split into three pillars. These 
“strategic pillars” are delivered through our core categories of 
Car Maintenance, Car Enhancement, Car Servicing, and 
Leisure, and enable internal communication and collaboration, 
enhanced decision making and marketing focus to augment 
returns.
Friend of the Motorist
With approximately 32 million cars in the target market, and 
many now of increasing age, Halfords is uniquely placed to 
provide help to our customers, delivering a wide range of car 
replacement parts (we stock 98% of the UK car parc’s bulb 
requirements) and a comprehensive assortment of in-car 
motoring ancillary ranges from navigation and audio to 
performance styling. At the same time the stores offer wefit/
werepair service where for a small charge products such as 
bulbs, wiper blades and batteries will be fitted to customers’ 
vehicles. If a more comprehensive repair service is required 
then our autocentres offer a quality MOT, service and repair 
service for all makes and models of vehicle at affordable prices.
Whilst economic factors of fuel, maintenance and insurance 
costs coupled with job uncertainty have placed value pressure 
on consumers, it seems that time pressures and decreasing 
levels of skills to perform DIY tasks are pushing consumers 
towards a “Do It For Me” (“DIFM”) level of service with a 
premium on value for money. We believe that within the 
aftercare market there is substantial growth opportunity. The 
bulbs, blades and battery market is worth c.£950m and 
Halfords Retail stores currently has only a 9% share. The 
Service and Repair market is a needs-driven market worth  
c.£9bn, of which Halfords Autocentres has only a 1% share. 
These low market share positions provide Autocentres with 
material opportunities to consolidate a fragmented market 
under a strong brand coupled with an improved penetration of 
fleet sales. Meanwhile, the stores provide a unique capability to 
expand the fitting offer through market awareness campaigns 
and attracting customer segments that have not previously 
considered Halfords.

Leveraging Technology
With wide-ranging store and online offers, Halfords has also 
recognised and begun to adapt to market buying behaviour. 
Mobile devices are increasingly being used to research and 
purchase online and barcodes enable customers to access 
comprehensive online resources whilst shopping. 
As customers buy more online and market expectations of 
delivery times for goods bought online become quicker we will 
continue to invest in our IT and Web infrastructure. In March 
2012 we launched a revised Order & Collect service providing 
next day delivery. In many instances this service works with 
delivery to store, allowing customers to collect at a convenient 
time and still get build, fitting and advice offered 
simultaneously.
Summary
Over the years Halfords has evolved from its humble 
beginnings in 1892, as a cycle shop in Leicester, into a national 
chain of retail stores that have been seen to support the use of 
the motor car with needs driven purchases. Recently the 
Company evolved further to support Do It For Me Car 
Maintenance through its acquisition of our Autocentres 
business and the Leisure category is becoming more important 
to the growth of Halfords.
Best Cycle Shop in Town
The UK cycling market is estimated to be worth £1.4bn and 
has been growing at a rate 5% p.a. for the last five years. This 
long-term trend is expected to continue with additional interest 
being created by the 2012 Olympic Games. Economic drivers 
make cycling more attractive with consumers still under 
financial pressure, in addition to the health and family leisure 
benefits.
Cycling provides significant opportunities for sales growth 
through higher levels of participation in cycle models and 
brands and by attracting wider consumer groups. In addition 
to cycle sales, there is material opportunity to capture share in 
the parts, accessories and clothing (“PACs”) products, in 
particular thorough increased ranges offered online.
The Halfords cycle proposition offers an end-to-end solution 
for cyclists: through its own brand cycles of Trax, Apollo and 
Carerra and its branded Boardman and Pendleton ranges.  
This offers something for everyone at a variety of price points; 
through PACs products where research has revealed that 
Halfords has a lower participation than in bikes which 
represents a growth opportunity both in store and online; and 
through repair and servicing where, as with motoring, cycling 
customers expect high levels of service. Consequently, 
Halfords offers customers build, service and repair services at 
price points and a breadth of range, which provides 
exceptional value. 
Starting Point for Great Getaways
Halfords has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to consolidate 
fragmented markets with a comprehensive offer. Leisure travel 
is another market where Halfords provides a unique 
combination of products and solutions. The economic drivers 
for holidays in the UK remain in place. There is an increase in 
“staycation” holidays and in the demand for an active leisure 
time. Our market share growth continues to be seen across 
roof boxes and camping.
The Halfords getaway proposition offers solutions for car 
journeys and campsite holidays including Accessories (e.g. 
maps, safety jackets and first aid kits), Travel Solutions (e.g. 
roof boxes, cycle carriers and trailers) and Camping (e.g. tents, 
sleeping bags and cooking sets). 
These categories represent opportunities to expand market 
share through increasing awareness that Halfords is the natural 
destination when planning a getaway.

Our strategy is based upon our desire to maximise returns for our shareholders. 
Each of our business units is tasked to deliver against an overall business plan and 
is focused on delivering our strategy. In doing this, we have identified a number 
of measures that are important to the success of the business as a whole through 
which the Board and Senior Management measure performance.

Group Strategy
Our Group strategy is built on the Halfords vision to help and 
inspire our customers with their life on the move.
Group Strategy Description
The Group’s key aim is to maximise returns for our 
shareholders. We do this by creating real value for our 
customers within the products and services we sell while 
operating our business as a good corporate citizen. 
We have an ongoing strategy to drive growth from our core 
business. In Retail this means our 467 stores, Halfords.com 
and product categories in which we hold leading market 
positions and in our Autocentre business through our 260 
Autocentres and halfordsautocentres.com. 
In driving this growth we continue to place ourselves as the 
No.1 destination for products that enhance our customers’ use 
of their car, their bikes and their touring activities. We aim to be 
the Friend of the Motorist by providing the products, services 
and expertise required to take the hassle out of motoring and 
making driving more enjoyable. We are able to encourage our 
customers to do it for themselves and we are able to do it for 
them. We are dedicated to providing the right level of service to 
our customers, from stocking in-store and online a 
comprehensive assortment of car parts, through a price 
competitive, 7 days a week, on-demand fitting service, to a full 
service and repair offer through the national coverage afforded 
by our Autocentres.
With over 100 years’ heritage in cycling, our service, expertise, 
brands and product range are unsurpassed and we will 
continue to offer these products and services whether it be to 
customers who are purchasing their first bike or a top-of-the-
range Boardman racing bike. Through our desire to be the 
Best Cycle Shop in Town, we aim to build on our service and 
brand credentials as well as providing a wide range of parts, 
accessories and clothing, contributing to the growing 
popularity of cycling as a healthy and environmentally friendly 
form of transport. 
With the development of our own range of camping equipment 
(Urban Escape) and roof boxes (Exodus), we help our 
customers make the most of their journeys and their time 
outdoors and we have become the Starting Point for Great 
Getaways. With the demand for a more active leisure time and 
the desire for the enjoyment of simple family pleasures, such 
as camping, Halfords offers a range of great “getaway” 
products from travel accessories, travel equipment and 
camping solutions in order to help our customers make the 
most of their time outdoors and to help them get there.
In order to consolidate our position as the Friend of the 
Motorist, the Best Cycle Shop in Town and the Starting Point 
for Great Getaways, we will continue to offer a unique range of 
products, which are constantly innovated and extended. They 
are matched by an unparalleled honest and trustworthy service 
delivered by our well-trained, enthusiastic and knowledgeable 
colleagues in-store, at the autocentres and online thereby 
helping our customers, from novices to enthusiasts, to work 
out exactly what they need. Our unique store fitting service and 
competitive autocentre repair service gives customers the 
choice of having us do it for them or doing it themselves. We 
deliver convenient and value solutions to our customers, where 
they can get what they need when they need it, through our 
extensive store network with market-leading coverage, open  
7 days a week, and 24/7online, with a market leading multi-
channel offer available to order or reserve. Our autocentre 
network can deal with planned and emergency work alike. 
We provide our customers with solutions that offer real value 
by balancing high quality products with a competitive 
combination of range, price and service and in the autocentres 
we provide dealership quality services at independent garage 
prices. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

needing to obtain more fixed cost

People Powering the Next Generation
FY 2012 saw the development of a new People agenda for the 
Group with the arrival of the new Group HR Director, Jonathan 
Crookall. The four key focus areas are:
 ■ Recruiting the right people to support our service culture and 
future growth
 ■ Training and developing people to deliver expertise, advice 
and service
 ■ Managing talent to provide succession for key roles and 
career opportunities for colleagues
 ■ Establishing an engaging culture, based on a clear set of 
values 
Recruiting the Right People to Support our Service Culture 
and Future Growth
During the year we improved our recruitment processes and 
focused them more on selecting colleagues with an attitude that 
supports service and our “helpful” agenda. We established 
partnerships with recruitment suppliers and initiated a project to 
improve our recruitment website and applicant tracking. The new 
website launches in the summer and will align with our consumer 
branding, attracting colleagues who have a helpful approach and 
great potential for the future. We will also be better able to target 
candidates who are best suited to retail and our particular 
product groups.
Training and Developing People to Deliver Expertise,  
Advice and Service
We continued to invest in colleague training, focusing on 
technical skills to support increased fitting and the growth in 
cycling. All colleagues were involved in a programme called 
Flying Start, which provided the skills and confidence needed  
to develop further the ability to engage with every customer in 
store, re-emphasising the importance of a great interaction with 
customers and our overall “helpful” message. 
In our Autocentres business our apprentice training programme 
went from strength to strength with the establishment of a new 
external partnership with the specialists ProVQ. More than 180 
new apprentices started our latest scheme in support of the 
growth in the Autocentres business.
Luke Tomkins, 19, was named Halfords Autocentres Apprentice 
of the Year after seeing off competition from fellow apprentices 
from around the country in the network’s annual skills 
competition.
The competition, hosted at training provider ProVQ’s state-of-
the-art workshop facilities near Shrewsbury, saw the ten talented 
young technicians compete against the clock over a number of 
tasks, including a vehicle safety inspection and various fault 
diagnosis challenges. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Luke impressed the judges with his consistent technical 
competency, expertise and ability to maintain a cool head under 
pressure before being declared overall winner.
Bill Collins, technical training manager  
for Halfords Autocentres, said:
“Halfords Autocentres runs the largest motor technician 
apprentice scheme in the UK. Our Apprentice of the Year 
competition is a chance to celebrate the fresh talent we have  
in the business and to showcase their skills.”
 
Managing Talent to Provide Succession for Key Roles and 
Career Opportunities for Colleagues
We have a good track record of developing colleagues from the 
shop floor into management positions. This year we formalised 
our approach to tracking talent in stores and autocentres, and 
provided specific development programmes to grow the skills 
required to make the next level. Our graduate programme 
continues to provide us with a pipeline of talent for our teams in 
Commercial and Marketing given the scarcity of quality talent in 
these critical areas.
Establishing an Engaging Culture, Based on a Clear Set  
of Values
In FY12 we built on the success of the “Helpful” campaign by 
creating a broader culture change programme based on a new 
set of Halfords values (see page 13). Over 800 people across the 
Company were involved in creating the six values and defining 
the behaviours that underpin them. The values were launched at 
our national conference and continue to be a key action area. We 
are rolling out a full colleague engagement survey in June to 
assess how best we can further develop colleague engagement 
in support of our drive for improving the customer experience. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Chief Executive’s Review
Introduction
The last year continued to be a challenging time for the UK and 
ROI consumer sector. People had less disposable income and 
managed their discretionary spend tightly. Motorists particularly 
were affected by higher fuel prices and insurance costs. 
Halfords’ response has been to help customers by creating value 
through the quality and price of our products and the expertise 
and service of our colleagues. Our significant growth areas of 
Cycling, Fitting Services and Autocentres have all performed 
strongly. 
We also continued our store portfolio refresh programme, 
invested for the future in IT infrastructure, introduced new 
products and developed our team. We have done this whilst 
managing costs sensibly. 
The progress in our growth areas both demonstrates how we are 
evolving Halfords from a traditional out-of-town retailer to a 
significant service provider and creating the route to strengthen 
our business further. We are planning to take advantage of these 
opportunities in the year ahead.
Review of Trading
In what has been a tough environment for customers the Group 
generated an underlying profit before tax of £92.2m and 
continued cash generation for shareholders through good cost 
management and margin control with free cash flow of £70.4m 
after taking into account taxation, capital expenditure and net 
finance costs.
Group revenues were £863.1m, down 0.8% overall (Retail 
£752.3m; Autocentres £110.8m). 
Within Retail, revenues across the year on a like-for-like basis 
(“LfL”) were down 2.7%. 
Sales of Car Maintenance products at -4.5% LfL, suffered as 
motorists drove fewer miles and reduced their spending on 
vehicles where possible. The lack of a prolonged spell of winter 
weather, as in the preceding year, also reduced demand for cold 
weather products like de-icers, screen wash and batteries.
The demand for “Do It For Me” fitting continues to build and our 
wefit services have seen another year of strong growth. We now 
fit 26.2% of the bulbs, blades and batteries we sell, as we build 
on Halfords’ unique customer offer and more customers look to 
us for expert help with basic Car Maintenance. 
“In the year ahead we plan to develop this vision to take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by our key growth 
areas and accelerate our transition from traditional retailer 
to a contemporary provider of products and services.”

The decline in Car Enhancement sales continued as the markets 
for Sat Nav and audio products contract. We have also seen falls 
in sales of Performance Styling and Car Cleaning products 
reflecting the pressure on motorists spending and the changing 
nature of the auto accessory market. 
In Leisure we saw strong growth throughout the year, up 5.0% 
LfL, driven by increases in our cycling revenues through our 
relaunched ranges. 
Halfords.com business, representing c.9% of total Retail sales, 
had a less buoyant year. While we had significantly more visitors 
to our site, fewer of these converted to sales. Cycle Accessories 
and in-car entertainment products performed well, but the sales 
of Sat Navs and child seats declined. During the year we have 
invested in better technology, site information and deals. 
Sales at our Autocentres grew strongly by c.6% LfL and c.13% 
overall, driven by the growing awareness of the Halfords brand in 
the garage servicing sector and recognition by motorists of the 
value we offer. This performance is especially strong when 
compared to the overall auto aftercare market. 
Strategy
Vision
Our customers lead busy lives and each year they make 
thousands of essential journeys. They need to keep moving for 
work and family and they want to travel for their holidays and 
enjoy active leisure time. 
Halfords’ products and services are an essential part of the 
everyday life of millions of people; and we are evolving our offer 
in line with the changing nature of our customers’ needs. 
Our vision is to Help and Inspire Customers with their Life 
on the Move. 
In the year ahead we plan to develop this vision to take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by our key growth areas 
and accelerate our transition from traditional retailer to a 
contemporary provider of products and services. 
We have carried out detailed research to map our areas of 
strength against the requirements and aspirations of our 
customers. This work has identified, and confirmed, that we have 
a significant opportunity to grow in the medium to long term by

Chief Executive’s Review continued
building on and evolving our current offering and service 
capability. We have identified three areas where customers 
specifically want our help and which provide opportunities for 
growth and the development of our business.
These three strategic pillars are the Friend of the Motorist, the 
Best Cycle Shop in Town and the Starting Point for Great 
Getaways. 
In each of these areas Halfords can create value for our 
customers through a unique blend of the quality, innovation and 
the price of our products and the expertise and service of our 
colleagues.
Strategic Pillars
The Friend of the Motorist 
The last year has been a particularly challenging time for drivers 
who have faced higher costs. Halfords is uniquely placed to be 
the Friend of the Motorist by providing end-to-end solutions for 
their auto aftercare needs. Through the Car Maintenance parts in 
our Retail stores, in-store fitting services and Autocentres, we 
can provide real value through our products, services and the 
expertise required to take the hassle out of motoring and make 
driving more enjoyable. We can help motorists look after their 
cars, or we can take care of their cars for them.
We stock the widest selection of replacement car parts and 
accessories of any retailer. We can help the motorists who do 
their own maintenance find the right part for their make and 
model and offer alternative price points through our good, better 
and best ranging. 
Halfords also helps motorists with motoring consumables like 
screen-wash, de-icers and car-washing products, plus we are 
the market-leading destination for Sat Navs, Car Audio and 
Performance Styling. While the market for these products is 
declining, we have extended our leadership position and these 
sales continue to contribute to our overall performance.
There is a strong trend towards “Do It For Me” in Car 
Maintenance and Halfords has seen a growing demand for our 
wefit services. The foundation of our fitting proposition is the 
fitting of car bulbs, windscreen blades and batteries (“3Bs”), by 
our trained in-store colleagues. During the year some 2 million 
wefit jobs were completed and 26.2% of all 3Bs sold were also 
fitted. This compares with 23.5% fitted in FY11.
The 3Bs market, selling both product and fitting, is estimated to 
be worth £950m and Halfords only has a small percentage share 
of the market while garages and dealerships have a 75% share. 
Our offer is unique, 7 days a week on-demand fitting at the most 
competitive prices, so there is good potential to win sales and 
grow revenues. Fitting is also a high margin revenue stream and 
an economically favourable one, as labour costs are based on 
retail wage rates as opposed to the mechanics’ rates that 
garages and dealers charge. 
Our strategy is to maintain our DIY parts proposition while driving 
awareness and sales of our fitting capability. We have set 
stretching targets to increase uptake and this year we are 
budgeting for extra marketing, new point-of-sale materials, extra 
colleague hours and training. We are confident that because of 
the historic strong performance in this area, and the extra 
resources we are committing, that fitting is a significant avenue of 
growth for our business.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 30 March 2012
Online version 
halfords.annualreport2012.com
The final element of being the Friend of the Motorist is delivered 
through our Autocentres. We provide MOTs, car servicing and 
repairs and this is a natural extension of Halfords’ retail service 
offer. 
This has been a year of significant progress for Halfords 
Autocentres. As at 30 March 2012, we have 260 autocentres 
and since rebranding we have actively developed our offer and 
promoted Halfords Autocentres through a national radio 
campaign, online marketing and national TV advertising. 
The results have been extremely encouraging and we have seen 
strong sales growth throughout the year as we win new 
customers. Our progress during a period when motorists are 
cutting back is a clear sign that the Halfords brand is increasingly 
viewed as the destination for all auto aftercare needs and as the 
Friend of the Motorist. 
In the year Bill Duffy was promoted to CEO of Halfords 
Autocentres, and Simon Benson recruited as Operations 
Director. We have also relocated our Autocentres Head Office 
from Olton to our Group Head Office site in Redditch; this is 
already bringing benefits in cross-functional working.
The long-term growth opportunity of this business remains 
compelling. There are 32m cars on the UK’s roads and the  
auto aftercare market is large and worth £8bn – £10bn. 
Competition is fragmented; there are around 24,000 garage 
outlets in the UK but numbers are in long-term decline due to 
economic factors. Halfords Autocentres has a good opportunity 
to grow in this environment due to the strength of our proposition 
and the potential to leverage our brand. 
We are developing and investing in our customer relationship 
management. Car MOTs and servicing are linked to the age and 
mileage of vehicles and this lends itself to advanced data 
management systems. A key way we can help customers is to 
anticipate their vehicle’s needs and make the right marketing 
offer to take the stress out of vehicle maintenance and attract 
them to use our autocentres. 
We intend to build on success through the roll-out of new 
autocentres. During the year we opened 20 new autocentres and 
we are targeting up to 30 more in FY13. Further growth 
opportunities exist from fleet customers and accelerating tyre 
sales. We will also continue to invest in growing awareness and 
developing our proposition through innovative products. For 
example our recently launched brakes-4-life offers customers 
free replacement brake parts once they have bought and had 
these parts fitted at Halfords. 
Linking all the elements of our auto aftercare offer together 
means that we can provide all aspects of car maintenance for 
our customers. Our products, services and value, backed by our 
trusted brand, offer real help to drivers and underpin our ambition 
to be the Friend of the Motorist.
The Best Cycle Shop in Town
Our research shows that the cycle shop and its web offer are 
central to the enjoyment and experience of cycling. We recognise 
that although we are the biggest provider of cycles to the UK 
market, at a local level and online we are not necessarily always 
the best cycle shop in every town. This must be our aspiration.
The core of our strategy to be the Best Cycle Shop in Town is 
Halfords’ own and exclusive ranges of cycles. We address the 
whole cycle market from entry level to high performance. 
Our great value Trax range, that is sold boxed for self-assembly, 
gives Halfords a competitive offer against supermarkets and 
other non-specialist outlets. 
Apollo is the UK’s best-selling cycle brand and offers value, 
quality build and good components. 
Carrera provides performance specification and contemporary 
design without the price tag associated with global brands. 
Our exclusive Voodoo range is designed by Joe Murray, the 
award-winning American mountain biker, and is a premium 
product for the serious mountain biker. 
Top of the Halfords’ cycle range are Boardman cycles, designed 
exclusively in collaboration with Halfords by former Olympic 
champion Chris Boardman. This range has been widely 
acclaimed for its leading designs, construction and price 
competitiveness and is endorsed by world famous riders such as 
Alistair Brownlee, the reigning World Triathlon champion.
During the year we redesigned and relaunched many of our 
cycles, including the entire Carrera range of 22 cycles and the 
Voodoo range of 10 cycles. It meant that at Christmas 2011 
broadly half of our cycles were newly designed. 
We will continue to develop and improve our existing brands and 
introduce new ones that offer value and appeal to our 
customers. A good example of this is the Carrera Virago, a 
carbon-fibre road racer for under £1,000, a very competitive 
price for such a quality performance cycle. It has been extremely 
positively reviewed by both the mainstream media and 
specialised cycling press. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6
Business Review 30
In addition, to take full advantage of the heightened interest in 
the Olympics, we have introduced limited edition, in British 
colours, Carrera cycles. We have also launched an exclusive 
range of ladies cycles under the Pendleton brand, designed by 
Olympic and World champion cyclist Victoria Pendleton. These 
are aimed at women who want to incorporate some cycling into 
their everyday routine. 
Our innovative and competitively priced ranges mean that 
Halfords is uniquely positioned to compete strongly at all levels of 
the cycle market, providing customers with one of the best 
selections of designs and prices in any cycle shop.
In addition to cycles, we stock a wide range of cycle parts and 
accessories from locks and lights to high visibility jackets and 
cycling helmets. The Parts, Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) 
market is estimated to be worth £615m annually and we have a 
lower share of this market than our share of the cycle market. 
This offers Halfords a significant opportunity to grow in this 
higher margin area. A high proportion of PACs sales occur online 
so an important part of our strategy for growth will be to improve 
our range and order fulfilment for these products online. We are 
planning to develop this category to capture an increased share 
of this market. 
We also support our cycle offer through the advice and service of 
our colleagues; c.95% of the cycles we sell we also build and we 
offer a free six-week first service. Our Bike Care Plan that 
provides repairs, free of labour charge, is another opportunity to 
develop a service based revenue stream. 
In the last year we have grown cycling sales by c.10%, and 
gained share in a growing market. This demonstrates the 
strength of the Halfords brand and our cycling offer.
The cycle market is estimated to be currently worth £1.4bn. We 
now plan to take advantage of this opportunity to drive further 
growth in this category through the combination of great service, 
reliable maintenance and repair, the best value bike range in the UK 
and new ranges of PACs. Our ability to deliver our biggest ranges to 
our customers next day is a winning formula within our strategy to 
be the Best Cycle Shop in T own.
The Starting Point for Great Getaways
As well as essential travel, our customers also want to enjoy their 
active leisure time and use their cars to go on trips. Our range of 
products and services is designed to equip people for their 
journey and help them make the most of their time out of doors. 
A great example is our exclusive ranges of Exodus roof boxes. 
These significantly increase the carrying capacity of a car. They 
create extra space for luggage and other holiday essentials and 
leave more room in the vehicle for the family. We also supply the 
roof bars and cycle carriers and have trained colleagues ready to 
fit everything for customers while they wait. 
We stock all the products motorists need to reach their 
destination: tyre pumps, warning triangles and high visibility 
jackets. At our autocentres we can check and service cars 
before they set off on long journeys. 
Halfords’ offer extends beyond the journey. We also stock  
tents and a whole range of camping and outdoor equipment. 
These items provide the basis for the holiday itself. Halfords is 
helping with great value offers, like our 4-person family tent  
pack, which contains a tent, sleeping bags, airbeds and a  
pump for less than £100.

It is predicted that this year more families than ever will holiday in 
Britain or look for lower cost ways of spending their vacation 
time. Thousands will come to Halfords as the starting point for 
their great getaway and catering for this demand provides a clear 
avenue for future growth.
In summary, through a focus on our three strategic pillars we 
plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth over the medium 
term. In the year ahead we intend to invest an additional c.£6m 
of Retail operating expenditure to create growth in these 
strategic areas. Of the total, £3.5m will be spent in support of our 
ambitions in fitting, £1.0m to enhance our multi-channel offer to 
complement our range and product development plans and 
£1.5m on training, capability and customer relationship 
management. These drivers will be broadly profit neutral in  
FY13 and will contribute to growth in top line and profitability 
from FY14.
Enablers
To deliver our strategic pillars we are focused on five key areas of 
our business which are central to improving our customer 
proposition and hence the progress of our business.
Portfolio
Our stores and our autocentres are the key ingredient of our 
multi-channel customer proposition. Their location and layout are 
central to how we deliver our ambition and our promise. 
We have 467 retail stores and 260 autocentres trading 
throughout the UK and Ireland. Approximately 90% of our 
customers live within a 20-minute journey of our stores. 
Through our store refresh programme we refurbished and 
reconfigured over 80 stores during the year. The sales uplifts 
achieved at these stores represent a good return on the invested 
capital and ensures a short payback period. Over 100 stores 
across the estate have now been refreshed over the last two 
years.
In London our High Street format stores provide a potential route 
for further expansion in an area where there is a shortage of 
suitable superstore opportunities.
We have had considerable success during the year in our 
negotiations with landlords in reducing occupancy costs. Within 
our store portfolio our lease expiry profile means that we have 
c.130 leases expiring over the next five years, which provide the 
opportunity to accelerate our work on reducing occupancy costs.
The nature of the shopping trip is changing as customers 
combine online shopping, stock checking and research with 
more traditional store visits. At Halfords, our stores must also 
facilitate our fitting and cycle repair services. Stores in the future 
will need to combine all these elements to provide a seamless 
experience. To test ideas that could provide future solutions and 
an enhanced shopping experience for our customers we have 
opened three laboratory stores. These will be used to test 
concepts and, if successful, it may be appropriate to include 
some of these concepts in future store designs. In the meantime 
our store refresh programme is on hold pending the feedback 
from these laboratory stores.

Web
Our commitment is to be a true multi-channel retailer, so that we 
seamlessly integrate our web offer with our in-store experience. 
Our development work is aimed to join together all aspects of the 
shopping trip and to leverage within that the growing power and 
use of the web as part of it. Enhancing our online offer and 
further extending our multi-channel presence is an investment 
priority. 
To drive our ambition we have appointed a dedicated Digital 
Director, Clive West, reporting to me. He is responsible for all 
aspects of our online offer from the online site to the delivery 
process for orders.
The launch of the mobile version of our site has been very 
successful. It enables our customers to research and purchase 
online while they are on the move. Mobile traffic and revenues 
experienced significant growth and almost a fifth of all visits and 
over 10% of our online sales are now through these devices. 
The introduction of the Halfords App and offering quick response 
(“QR”) codes at the point of sale are other mobile innovations 
that Halfords has introduced to enhance the shopping 
experience for our customers. Customers can scan barcodes 
and access rich content like videos and product information, or 
get help in finding the right part for their make and model of 
vehicle. We have experienced over 370,000 visits to our App last 
year and over 15,000 QR codes were scanned. 
We have also made considerable progress in enhancing our  
IT infrastructure and improving our on-site experience. We 
continue to develop the site with additional functionality aimed  
at improving our customer journey. We are focused on the entire 
customer journey from accessing the site to order fulfilment.
Our product mix lends itself to a multi-channel offer as customers 
often want further advice, a demonstration or fitting. Online 
purchasing patterns reflect this, with 86% of sales on Halfords.
com reserved and then collected from a store. We recently made 
a further improvement to this service. Customers who buy an 
item online before 6.00 pm from the vast majority of Halfords 
16,000 online product range can now choose to collect it the 
next day from their local store for free, even if that store does not 
normally stock the product. Direct delivery to home represents 
14% of our online sales and we also continue to focus on 
improving this proposition for our customers. We now offer free 
delivery on a wide range of products as well as Saturday delivery. 
The Halfords Autocentres website has provided a significant 
route to grow our Autocentres business. In the fragmented 
garage sector the relaunched website, with improved 
functionality, has provided a point of difference and resonated 
with customers. The revenue derived from online bookings was 
up by c.40%. Online bookings now account for 25% of all 
Autocentres bookings with 7% of bookings coming from the 
Halfords.com Retail site. Further integration of the Retail and 
Autocentres websites is a focus. The Autocentres website has 
also successfully supported our ambition in tyre sales, with online 
tyre sales up 170% in the year.  
Operations
While the sales performance has been challenging, the Group 
has made significant operational progress this year. We have 
focused on enhancing customer service, reducing costs and 
continuing to build a solid platform for future growth. 
Our new Distribution Centre at Coventry, equipped with 
state-of-the-art logistics technology, has operated smoothly and 
is a major contributor to good availability in our stores. One 
innovation has been the commissioning of 24 new double-
decker lorry trailers. These can carry extra product, which helps 
decrease road miles and saves fuel.
To reduce the costs of goods not-for-resale we have 
implemented new processes. Some contracts have been 
renegotiated with specifications and suppliers changed. We have 
also appointed a new Head of Procurement responsible for 
goods not-for-resale buying to continue our focus on driving 
down costs in this area. One innovation is a new process for the 
recovery of the 3,000 tonnes of waste cardboard from our stores 
to our distribution centres, where it is baled and sold for 
recycling.
To fulfil our ambitions in fitting we are actively recruiting and 
training new colleagues. We have also put in place new 
programmes for customer engagement to improve the in-store 
experience and the help we offer people when they visit a 
Halfords store.
Autocentres continued to develop and enhance the technical 
expertise of colleagues. This meant executing the tyre sales 
opportunity whilst developing compelling offers such as 
brakes-4-life. Additional investment in centre capability was 
complemented by trials of extended hours and Sunday 
openings.
Marketing
Our new marketing campaign “that’s helpful, that’s Halfords”  
has helped build awareness of the value we offer through great 
prices, quality and innovative products with the expert service of 
our colleagues. Our Christmas campaign was critically acclaimed 
and developed this theme highlighting the lasting value of 
Halfords’ products like cycles which provide pleasure for years. 
Our summer campaign demonstrates how Halfords has helped 
customers for many years make the most of their holidays. Using 
the strapline, The Best Trips Last a Lifetime, it focuses on 
how customers use our products to make the best of their 
summer holidays.
We also extended our national advertising of Autocentres from 
radio to TV with a series of idents around the motoring 
programmes on the Dave channel. These illustrate the delighted 
response of motorists who have been helped by Halfords 
colleagues.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

People
Our colleagues, in all areas of our business, are of paramount 
importance to help our customers. Their passion and abilities are 
central to the delivery of our strategic objectives and I am 
extremely proud of their commitment and enthusiasm.
In addition, their expert knowledge, advice and service 
differentiate us from our competition, especially the online pure 
plays, and generate attractive levels of return. In the year we 
have invested in extra training for colleagues through our 
programmes to encourage higher levels of engagement with 
customers. We are also investing in extra training to increase  
the number of colleagues who carry out fitting and cycle  
repair services.
We track our success in customer service through Empathica 
customer surveys and our detailed quarterly customer research; 
these show that increasingly customers recommend our service 
to others.
Values are central to all successful organisations and this year we 
have more clearly defined the central tenets of the way we want 
to work together. We launched these at our first Company-wide 
managers’ conference. The values are:
 
Strategic Pillars
Enablers
We help and inspire
our customers with their
life on the move

Values
In the year ahead we are running an engagement survey for all 
our colleagues which will help us to understand how to support 
and offer the best training possible.
As well as the appointments already mentioned, my Executive 
team has been completed during the year with the promotion of 
Kevin Thomas as Retail Director and the appointment of 
Jonathan Crookall as Group HR Director. 
I would like to thank all our colleagues for their hard work and 
their immense contribution to the progress of our business.
Summary and Outlook
Halfords continues to be highly profitable and strongly cash-
generative, and is maximising its performance in a demanding 
retail environment.
While this is a challenging time, Halfords has delivered significant 
growth in Leisure, including cycles, fitting services and 
Autocentres throughout the past and prior years. This 
demonstrates how we are evolving our business from a 
traditional out-of-town product retailer to a significant service 
provider.
Some other areas of the business like Car Enhancement are 
shrinking while others like DIY Car Maintenance are mature and 
have been affected by the pressures on motorists and the 
reduction in mileages being driven.
The strong performance of Halfords’ growth areas is proof of the 
relevance of our offer in the busy lives of our customers. By 
Helping and Inspiring our Customers with their Life on the 
Move we play a vital role for millions of people. Our three 
strategic pillars — the Friend of the Motorist, the Best Cycle Shop 
in Town, and the Starting Point for Great Getaways — give us an 
attractive route to evolve our business over the longer term. 
We plan to take advantage of these opportunities and to 
accelerate the transition through strategic investments in the year 
ahead. We anticipate that this will contribute to growth in our 
sales and profits in the medium term.

All above items are shown before non-recurring items unless otherwise stated.
The “FY12” accounting period represented trading for the 52 
weeks to 30 March 2012. The comparative period “FY11” 
represented trading for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011.
Group revenue in FY12, at £863.1m, comprised Retail revenue of 
£752.3m and Autocentres revenue of £110.8m. This compared 
to FY11 Group revenue of £869.7m, comprising Retail revenue 
of £771.6m and Autocentres revenue of £98.1m. Group 
revenues decreased by 0.8%, but when excluding the 
discontinued Central European revenues in the comparable 
period, the decrease was restricted to 0.5%.
Group gross profit at £472.8m (FY11: £485.0m) represented 
54.8% of Group revenue (FY11: 55.8%). This reflected a decline 
in UK/ROI Retail business of 140 basis points (“bps”) and a gross 
margin of 65.9% (FY11: 66.3%) in the Autocentres business. 
Total operating costs before non-recurring items increased to 
£375.6m (FY11: £356.9m), of which Retail represented £307.0m 
(FY11: £296.7m), Autocentres £66.4m (FY11: £58.0m) and 
unallocated expenses £2.2m (FY11: £2.2m). Unallocated 
expenses represented amortisation charges in respect of 
intangible assets acquired through business combinations (the 
acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres Ltd in February 2010), 
which arise on consolidation of the Group. Non-recurring income 
during the year of £1.9m represented the release of the Focus 
lease guarantee provision, recognised as a non-recurring cost in 
FY11, resulting from the better-than-anticipated settlements in 
the period. 
Net finance costs for the period were £5.0m (FY11: £2.5m). 
Group profit before tax and non-recurring items for the 52 weeks 
to 30 March 2012 was down 26.6% at £92.2m (FY11: £125.6m).
Group profit before tax for the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012 after 
non-recurring items was £94.1m (FY11: £118.1m), down 20.3%.

Gross profit for the UK/ROI business at £399.8m (FY11: 
£419.9m) represented 53.1% of sales, a 140 bps decline on the 
prior year (FY11: 54.5%). This reflected the continued focus on 
the delivery of cash returns within the business, increased levels 
of promotional participation by our customers, reduced sales of 
higher-margin ranges and the impact from our focus on efficient 
stock clearance. The effect of these, together with the adverse 
results of product cost inflation, was partially offset by the 
continuing increased penetration of our unique, high-margin 
wefit and werepair propositions and continued focus on 
maximising product-sourcing efficiencies.
Operating costs for Retail before non-recurring items were 
£307.0m (FY11: £296.7m), up 3.6%. In FY11, UK/ROI operating 
costs before one-off store occupancy and support cost savings 
were c.£300m. Based on this, the underlying increase in UK/ROI 
Retail operating costs in the period was restricted to 2.3%. The 
increase reflected higher store and support costs, offset by 
savings in warehouse and distribution costs.

and utility costs, and included the revenue costs associated with 
83 store refreshes in the period.

Business Review 36
Warehouse and distribution costs fell by 5.8%, driven by the 
expected improvements in efficiency being delivered following the 
move to the new Distribution Centre in Coventry in July 2010. 
Under the old distribution network, costs would have been 
approximately £3.8m higher than those reported. 
The increase in support costs predominantly reflected our 
investment in colleagues ahead of FY13 through ensuring we 
have the right resources to drive sustainable growth in the key 
areas. As an example of this, we recently appointed our first 
Digital Director to maximise the multi-channel opportunity ahead 
of us. We also invested in store colleague training and 
engagement to ensure we are equipped to drive additional 
in-store service revenues at our Company-wide managers’ 
conference. We also invested during the year to obtain a better 
understanding of our markets, customers and future growth 
opportunities. No Head Office performance bonus for the period 
was accrued. 
In FY11, the Central European Retail operation generated 
revenue of £1.9m and a loss before taxation of £0.4m, after 
operating costs of £0.5m. The operations were fully wound down 
in FY11, and no revenues or costs associated with this operation 
were recognised during the period.

Autocentres generated total revenues of £110.8m in FY12 (FY11: 
£98.1m), an increase of 12.9% over the prior year, a like-for-like 
increase of 6.1%. Twenty new autocentres opened in the year, 
generating £2.2m of incremental revenue, which took the total 
number of autocentre locations to 260 as at 30 March 2012. The 
increase in revenues from the existing 240 centres reflected the 
benefit of the UK-wide brand relaunch completed in April 2011, 
enhanced media support and growth in tyre sales, an area of 
opportunity for Autocentres. 
Gross profit at £73.0m represented a gross margin of 65.9%, 
down 40 basis points on comparable FY11 levels, driven by 
increased volumes of lower-margin tyre sales, partially offset by 
better parts-buying. 
Before a one-off charge of £0.4m associated with the transfer of 
the Autocentres Head Office from Olton to Redditch (completed 
in April 2012), Autocentres’ operating profit was £7.0m (FY11: 
£7.0m) reflecting underlying operating costs of £66.0m (FY11: 
£58.0m). To secure long-term growth and profitability, investment 
in the business continued. A successful media campaign, 
investment in tyre training, rebrand depreciation and the impact 
of new centre opening activity contributed to the operating cost 
increase. 
Portfolio Management 
The Group continued to manage actively its store and autocentre 
portfolio. During FY12, the Retail business opened three stores in 
London (Wood Green, Ilford, Ealing), closed two metro stores 
(Norwich, Haywards Heath) and refurbished 83 stores. Within 
Autocentres, 20 new centres were opened in the period. 
With the exception of nine long-leasehold and two freehold 
properties within Autocentres, the Group’s operating sites are 
occupied under operating leases, the majority of which are on 
standard lease terms, typically with a five to 15 to 25-year term 
from inception and with an average lease length of around  
seven years.
During the year re-gear negotiations were completed on 14 
stores, resulting in six contracts being exchanged on lease 
extensions, five downsizes and three relocations resulting in 
lower ongoing rental payments.
Focus Leases
At the end of FY11, a non-recurring charge of £7.5m was 
recognised in respect of a provision for property leases for which 
Halfords was guarantor, triggered by the demise of the Focus 
DIY retail chain. At the end of FY12, the provision was £3.1m 
reflecting the settlement and exit of certain leases, resulting in 
non-recurring income of £1.9m during the year, and utilisation of 
the provision in respect of rent, insurance, service charges and 
legal fees incurred.
Finance Costs
Net finance costs were £5.0m (FY11: £2.5m). The higher charge 
in the period reflects a full year of loan facility non-utilisation fees, 
margins and arrangement-fee amortisation expense. A one-off 
benefit of £0.9m interest income was also recognised in the prior 
period relating to the settlement of amounts due from HMRC. 
Weighted average borrowings of £116.7m were £37.6m lower 
than last year.
Taxation
The taxation charge on profit for the financial year was £25.7m 
(FY11: £32.6m), including a £0.9m charge (FY11: £2.1m credit) 
in respect of the tax on non-recurring items. After non-recurring 
items, the full year effective tax rate of 27.3% (FY11: 27.6%) 
differed from the UK corporation tax rate (26.0%) principally due 
to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital 
expenditure, the reassessment of anticipated future tax 
deductions from employee share schemes and other permanent 
differences arising in the period. Before non-recurring items, the 
full year effective tax rate in FY12 was 26.9%.

Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS before non-recurring items was 33.7 pence (FY11: 
43.2 pence), a 22.0% decrease on the prior year. Basic EPS 
after non-recurring items for the period was 34.2 pence (FY11: 
40.7 pence). Basic weighted average shares in issue during the 
year were 199.9m (FY11: 210.4m). During the year 18,084,113 
shares were acquired by the Company via the share buyback 
programme commenced in April 2011. Of these, 12,634,493 
have been cancelled, with 5,449,620 converted to treasury 
shares to be used by the Group to satisfy existing and future 
employee share schemes. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 14.0 pence per 
share (FY11: 14.0 pence), which, in addition to the interim 
dividend of 8.0 pence per share (FY11: 8.0 pence), generates a 
total dividend of 22.0 pence (FY11: 22.0 pence). This reflects the 
Board’s recognition of the importance of dividends to 
shareholders and the continuing cash-generative capabilities of 
the business. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting 
the final dividend will be paid on 3 August 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 6 July 2012.
Capital Expenditure
Capital investment in the period totalled £19.7m (FY11: £22.8m) 
comprising £15.2m in Retail and £4.5m in Autocentres. 
Consistent with prior periods, management has continued to 
adopt a prudent approach with regard to capital investment and 
has focused on investments generating material returns. 
Within Retail, £11.5m was invested in stores, and included 
£1.2m in three new London stores, together with two completed 
store relocations. It also included £10.3m of investment in 83 
store refreshes, the rightsizing of two stores, other expenditure 
covering general maintenance and the investment in three 
laboratory store formats opened recently. Additional investment 
in Retail infrastructure included a £2.4m investment in IT 
systems, including further development of the online customer 
proposition, £1.0m in logistics and £0.3m in central facilities.
A further £4.5m (FY11: £6.2m) was invested in Autocentres 
predominantly to drive the centre roll-out plan and upgrade 
centre equipment, especially in relation to the delivery of the tyre 
proposition. 
Inventories
Group stock held at 30 March 2012 was £146.7m (1 April 2011: 
£147.6m), down 0.6% on the prior year. Within this, Autocentres’ 
stock was £1.4m, flat year-on-year. The management of 
inventory remains a key area of focus for the Retail business 
while the Autocentres business model is such that only small 
levels of inventory are held within the autocentres, with most 
parts being acquired on an as-needed basis. 
Cash Flow and Borrowings
The Group has continued its strong track record of cash generation. 
Net cash generated from operating activities in FY12 was £89.7m 
(FY11: £118.4m). Free cash flow of £70.4m is after taking into account 
taxation, capital expenditure and net finance costs. 
Total net bank debt at 30 March 2012 was £127.7m (1 April 2011: 
£91.4m) after cash balances of £10.9m. Further borrowings of £11.5m 
(FY11: £11.8m), in respect of the Head Office finance lease, resulted in 
Group net debt at 30 March 2012 of £139.2m (1 April 2011: £103.2m), 
an increase of £36.0m. At this level net debt to EBITDA (earnings before 
non-recurring items, finance expense, depreciation and amortisation) 
was 1.1 times.
Following a review by the Board of the Group’s capital structure and 
cash-generation capabilities, the Group commenced a share buyback 
programme, with effect from 7 April 2011, with the intention to return 
up to £75m of cash to shareholders over the following 12 months. In 
FY12, £62.3m of shares were bought back via the purchase of 18.1m 
shares. As at 29 May 2012, a further £0.9m of shares were purchased 
in the new financial year. 
Given the return to more normalised levels of gearing the Board  
has resolved to bring the current buyback programme to an end and 
does not intend to undertake any further buyback activity in the new 
financial year.
Financial Risks
Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
 ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
 ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
 ■ Invest surplus cash; 
 ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
 ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director. 
The Finance Director controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the 
Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to 
monitor the performance of the treasury function. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved 
policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level 
of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a 
competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of 
the Group.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6
Business Review 38
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective 
are as follows:
Market Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to 
interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed 
further below. Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products 
being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject 
to price fluctuation. The Group mitigates this risk by negotiating 
fixed purchase costs or by maintaining flexibility over the 
specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to 
meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the 
Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial 
covenants. The Group’s borrowings are currently subject to 
floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor 
movements in the swap market. 
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of 
capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce 
debt. Between June 2006 and September 2009, the Group 
managed its capital structure partly through a share buyback 
scheme. A separate buyback scheme was initiated on 7 April 
2011.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. 
These ratios are:
 ■ consolidated EBITDAR (earnings before non-recurring items, 
finance expense, depreciation, amortisation and rental costs) 
to consolidated total net interest payable plus rent; and
 ■ consolidated total net borrowings to consolidated EBITDA.
Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum 
credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at  
30 March 2012 was £28.6m (1 April 2011: £15.5m).
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, 
direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with 
most of the trade being in US dollars. The Group’s policy is to 
manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the 
business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget 
costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of 
the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the 
translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities 
of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012, the foreign exchange 
management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase 
between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange 
transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is 
performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts 
and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension 
scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future 
liabilities in respect of such a scheme. The Group operates a 
number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to 
meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that 
there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the 
cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. 
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at £30m, such that 
under the Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 
£270m of the £300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts 
in place for key suppliers detailing the payment terms, and for 
providers of debt the Group ensured that such counterparties 
used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A’ credit rating at the 
time of refinancing (November 2010). Ancillary business, in the 
main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group. 
At the year-end four of the banks within this group maintained a 
credit rating of ‘A’ or above. The counterparty credit risk is 
reviewed in the Treasury Report, which is forwarded to the 
Treasury Committee and the Group Treasurer reviews credit 
exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each 
month by the Group Treasurer to determine whether there are 
sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and 
through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there 
are no significant breaches, which would lead to an “Event of 
Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the club bank 
agent. There have been no breaches of covenants during the

Business Review 40
Risks and Uncertainties
Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and uncertainties that could 
impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy. 
These risks are accepted as being a part of doing business and the 
Board recognises that the nature and scope of these risks can change 
and so regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the 
systems and processes to mitigate them. 
The Corporate Governance report on pages 74 to 81 describes the 
systems and internal control processes through which the Directors 
identify, assess, manage and mitigate risks.
Report and Review
The Executive Committee and the Board consider the 
risks reported within the Risk Register and review and 
monitor new risks and all mitigating actions to ensure 
that the status of risk mirrors the levels of risk that the 
Board is willing to take in achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
Key Risks and Uncertainties
Senior Management colleagues assess risks on a department-by-department 
basis using a variety of techniques to identify risk. The likelihood and impact 
of these risks are considered and scored against a recognised framework 
dependent upon their effect on the achievement of our corporate strategies.
Mitigation
Responsibility for taking the necessary actions to manage risk is 
delegated to appropriate colleagues in the business, with Executive 
manager sponsor involvement. The Risk Register is monitored and 
updated with current and ongoing mitigation on a regular basis.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Strategy
Economic
The economy is a major influence on consumer spending. 
Trends in employment, inflation, taxation, consumer debt 
levels and interest rates impact consumer expenditure in 
discretionary areas. Changes in Government policies may 
also affect our consumers’ ability to benefit from our 
products and services.
The Group mitigates these risks by focusing on 
maintaining the “defensive” characteristics of its “needs 
driven” product groups and by ensuring that its stores 
and centres are the key destination for its core 
products and services. We also ensure that we have 
representation with Governmental decision-makers in 
the areas supporting our core categories.

Business Strategy
The aim of the Group’s business strategy is to deliver long-
term value to our shareholders. The Board understands 
that if the strategy and vision are inappropriately 
formulated and communicated and that the necessary 
resources are not put in place then the business will suffer.
The budgetary and planning process aims to deliver 
the Group’s growth targets and business plans are 
developed to ensure these targets are achieved and 
that they are resourced appropriately. Regular access 
to industry experts and monitoring of performance 
against plan is carried out by both the Executive 
managers of the Company and the Board to ensure 
targets are being achieved and that they remain 
relevant to and focused on the Group Strategy.

Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The 
Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying 
sizes and faces competition from UK retailers, in both 
stores and online, as well as international operators. The 
Car Servicing market is a service-based market with a 
number of different-sized providers where “Trust” is 
extremely important to customers. Failure to compete with 
competitors on areas including price, product range, 
quality, service and “trustworthiness” could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial results.
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK retailers, 
both in-store and online, and from the national 
car-servicing network and seeks to continually 
strengthen its “own-brand” and “sub-brand” retail offer 
and develop opportunities to differentiate the Halfords 
offer and deliver an honest and trustworthy service.
Marketing 
Web
Compliance
The Group operates in an environment governed by 
legislation, standards and codes in areas including, but 
not limited to, trading, advertising, product quality, health 
and safety, hazardous substances and data protection.
The Group has a Quality Assurance and a Commercial 
Regulatory team that manage legal and regulatory 
control processes both in-house and externally to 
advise and take action on existing and emerging risk 
management issues. Our various Codes of Practice 
regulate our behaviour in our dealings with all 
stakeholders including customers, suppliers and 
colleagues and our attitudes toward such areas as the 
environment and ethical trading. 
Operations
Changing Customer Preferences
Some of the products that Halfords sells, particularly in 
the Car Enhancement category, are subject to rapidly 
changing consumer preferences. Products such as 
children’s cycles face competition from alternative 
products (such as games consoles) and some of the 
products that the Group sells are non-discretionary in 
their nature and predicting future trends is difficult.
Halfords has recruited experienced, knowledgeable 
colleagues who can identify and interpret trends and 
consequently respond in a timely manner to changes in 
consumer preferences. Colleagues also monitor 
developments in alternative products and our forecasts 
reflect the latest assumption in these areas. We are 
continually looking at ways of moving into new 
merchandising opportunities to mitigate technology 
changes and to improve forecasting and planning to 
ensure we meet our customers’ changing needs.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Strategy
Reputation
The Halfords name is a key asset of the business and as 
the largest operator in its markets, expectations of the 
Group are high. Failure to protect the Group’s reputation 
and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. 
This could result in a decline in the customer base and 
affect the ability to recruit and retain good people.
Ultimately the protection of Halfords’ brand and 
position in its core markets will be sustained by unique 
and extensive product offerings and a multi-channel 
approach to sales in our stores and a high-service-
based customer proposition in our stores and 
autocentres. This is complemented by quality training 
from accredited Automotive Technician training to 
Cytech (Cycles), RoSPA, and the Institute of 
Mechanical Industries training, ensuring that colleagues 
at both stores and centres are capable of supporting 
the Halfords brand.
Operations

People 
Reliance on Foreign Manufacturers
Halfords sources a significant proportion of the 
merchandise it sells in its stores from outside of the UK, 
either directly or via third-party suppliers. Consequently, 
the Group is subject to the risks associated with 
international trade (particularly those which are common in 
the import of goods from developing countries) including, 
but not limited to, inflation, currency fluctuation, the 
imposition of taxes or other charges on imports, the 
exposure to different legal standards, the burden of 
complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing 
foreign government policies and natural disasters.
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics 
before the Group procures products from any new 
country or supplier. The Group’s strong management 
team in the Far East has been recruited locally and 
understands the local culture, market regulations and 
risks and we maintain very close relationships with 
both our suppliers and shippers to ensure that 
disruption to production and supply are managed 
appropriately.
Operations
Product and Service Quality
The Board recognises that the quality and safety of both 
our products and services in our stores and autocentres 
is of critical importance to us and that any major failure 
will affect consumer confidence. We recognise that if our 
products are seen to be or perceived to be of poor 
standard or of poor value for money then customers will 
look to obtain these from our competitors. There is also 
the risk that our service proposition fails due to 
inconsistent levels of service at individual stores and 
individual centres.
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its position as 
the store or centre of first choice in each of the 
markets that it serves. Halfords continues to invest in 
both its existing estate to ensure that it remains 
contemporary and in constant product innovation to 
meet customer needs. In addition, the Group’s market 
leading in-store wefit proposition provides a range of 
services at a lower cost to our customers than that 
provided by competitors. Our Autocentre business 
continually seeks to provide innovate solutions for their 
customers, such as brakes4life. We also have an 
established training infrastructure to ensure that our 
colleagues receive ongoing product and service 
training. In our centres the training of our technicians to 
provide high quality motor vehicle repairs is enhanced 
through an apprenticeship programme and accredited 
Automotive Technician training. Sixty per cent of our 
centres workshop colleagues hold a Motor Industry 
qualification.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems  
and Infrastructure
In common with most businesses, Halfords is dependent 
on the reliability and suitability of a number of important IT 
systems where any sustained performance problems, 
particularly with regard to stores, centres or warehouse, 
multi-channel and distribution systems, could potentially 
compromise our operational capability for a period of time. 
With ambitious growth plans for our multi-channel offer, 
our trading capacity could be affected by internal and 
external systems’ resilience and interdependencies.
Extensive controls are in place to maintain the integrity 
of our systems and to ensure that systems changes 
are implemented in a controlled manner. Halfords’ key 
trading systems are hosted within a secure data centre 
operated by a specialist company remote from our 
Head Office. These systems are also supported by a 
number of disaster recovery arrangements including a 
comprehensive backup strategy, and a hotlink secure 
data centre hosted outside the UK, with an additional 
access to a further data support centre elsewhere in 
the UK in case of a major incident.

Dependence on Key Management Personnel
The success of the Group’s business depends upon its 
senior management closely supervising all aspects of its 
business, in particular, the operation of the stores and 
autocentres, including the appropriate training of in-store 
and centre colleagues, and the design, procurement and 
allocation of merchandise. Retention of senior 
management is especially important in the Group due to 
the limited availability of experienced and talented retail 
executives. 
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on page 82 details the 
strategies in place to ensure that high calibre Executives 
are attracted and retained. The Group looks to improve 
its senior manager cadre through operating a talent 
management process to help individuals achieve their 
full potential within Halfords and to ensure that 
appropriate succession plans are in place to meet the 
future needs of the business. At a junior level the Group 
continues to invest in graduate programmes and store/
centre colleague training and development.

Strategies related to our 
Corporate Responsibility
We believe effective management of our Corporate Responsibility 
(“CR”) makes good business sense. In doing so, we will seek to 
ensure that Halfords, which is a household brand, has a positive 
impact on the communities and environment in which we work, 
be it through our operations, products and services or through 
our interactions with our customers, colleagues and suppliers. 
We are proud of our business and we see CR as a core business 
consideration as it derives strategic, commercial and reputational 
benefits. We aim to achieve standards of responsible care across 
a number of key areas, including customers, trading, health & 
safety, the environment, employee welfare and the community.
We are committed to ensuring we do the right things and our  
aim is to continually improve our management of the social, 
environmental and economic issues within our control or 
influence these throughout the business and our wider supply 
network. “That’s helpful, that’s Halfords” is not just for our 
customers, but is about how Halfords acts and reacts to ensure 
sustainability of both the environment in which we operate and 
our own business model.
The Group annually reviews its ongoing CR commitments to 
ensure it meets the needs of the markets and communities in 
which we work and that the associated Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”) accurately reflect the Group’s success or 
otherwise in implementing its policy. 
Following the review conducted last year by Business in the 
Community (“BITC”) the Group continued to follow its “ACTING 
RESPONSIBLY” policy during the period to 30 March 2012.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

However, the Company has a strong cost control ethos and is 
keenly bottom line driven with clear profit ambitions and the 
thinking hierarchy at present is “cost first”. It is therefore essential 
that any CR programme should be shown to be intricately linked 
to achieving business success and enhancing the business’s 
value proposition. 
Halfords has always prided itself on behaving responsibly to all 
stakeholders, and CR forms an integral element of this 
relationship by demonstrating the Company’s honesty, reliability 
and trustworthiness in respecting customers, employees, 
investors and the environment. However, we acknowledge that in 
the past our community investment activities have been informal 
and not driven by a clear community investment strategy that is 
aligned to our business strategies.
In order to address this the Company has involved itself with the 
Prince’s Trust “Seeing is Believing” activities and visited a number 
of charities to see how Halfords might be able to make a positive 
contribution to communities in which our stores operate. All the 
charities that we met with worked with individuals from 
disadvantaged backgrounds including homelessness, young 
people NEET (“not in education, employment or training”) or 
ex-offenders. In the many discussions that we had with the 
young people that we met, it was obvious that whilst they were 
appreciative of all offers of help, what they really wanted was a 
real opportunity to get a job. This has led to discussions with a 
Social Enterprise company, Bikeworks, as to how Halfords might 
introduce a Work Inclusion programme for NEET individuals. This 
is discussed in more detail on page 49.
As in 2011 we continue to report on our activities under the 
headings used by BITC in their 2010 report, and we have aligned 
these with our Group strategy on page 12.
Our commitments are translated into actions and KPIs are used 
to assess success against our internal targets. Paul 
McClenaghan, Commercial Director, takes the lead in ensuring 
that the policy supports the strategic objectives of the business. 
The Halfords Executive management monitors performance with 
regard to these objectives and targets via an internal report. It is, 
however, the Board’s responsibility to ensure that the Group 
operates in a responsible manner, and thus the Board reviews 
the policy and our performance against that policy annually.
In the Future
Halfords will continue to work towards improving its management 
of the social, environmental and economic issues that are within 
its control and will continue to work with BITC to ensure that we 
focus on the core areas of Corporate Responsibility whilst at the 
same time being proud custodians of the Halfords brand and its 
impact on its stakeholders. It makes good business sense that 
we ensure the right and proper interaction between our 
Company, our stores and our products, and our customers, their 
communities and their environment. We hope to build on our 
cycle repair work inclusion programme to help us deliver a quality 
repair service in-store and we will report more on the success of 
this initiative next year.

Employer of Choice
The development and delivery of Halfords’ customer offer both in 
our retail stores and autocentres would not have been possible 
without the unfailing support and commitment of our colleagues 
employed across all our operations. Consequently, we recognise 
that our colleagues are our single most valuable asset and we 
are committed to a fair but robust approach to equal 
opportunities in all areas of our business, with people gaining 
promotion on merit. We have high expectations of all colleagues 
and everyone is required to perform and deliver value. This 
creates an environment that is challenging and rewarding, 
enabling colleagues to develop quickly and pursue new 
opportunities. 
We are committed to being seen as an employer of choice within 
the communities in which we operate. We seek to employ 
people who are passionate about customers, love coming to 
work, strive to achieve their best and enjoy dealing with 
customers and delivering our “helpful” message. 
We recognise and reward high performance and by ensuring 
colleagues have interesting jobs, with real accountability, Halfords 
can provide the opportunity to develop careers. Over the years 
we have worked hard to provide an environment in which people 
are keen to work and our turnover rates both in our retail stores 
and autocentres are monitored on a regular basis. 
Our commitment to our customers means we are able to add 
value to their purchases with our fitting services. This requires the 
majority of our colleagues to be properly trained in the fitting of, 
amongst other products, bulbs, blades, batteries, child seats and 
roof boxes. Our desire to become famous for being “helpful” 
means that FY12 has seen a 20.4% increase in the number of 
our retail staff holding accredited fitting qualifications, whilst  
c.60% of our autocentre workshop colleagues hold a Motor 
Industry qualification. 
To ensure the best and the most consistent garaging servicing, 
Halfords Autocentres also run a Training Academy apprenticeship 
programme, which currently has approximately 140 apprentices. 
All go through a three-year fully funded programme and will 
complete as qualified Technicians with an Institute of the Motor 
Industry NVQ level 3 and a Diploma. In addition, they will each 
complete an Automotive Technician Accreditation (ATA) 
assessment and we provide ongoing development opportunities 
through our IMI accredited Academy of Learning where we can 
deliver a range of both Technical and Management qualifications 
from foundation level voluntary qualifications through to degree 
equivalents.
Diversity 
Halfords has an Equal Opportunities Policy which outlines 
regulatory requirements as well as the organisation’s 
commitments regarding diversity and expectations of staff. The 
current workforce in our stores and autocentres may not always 
be reflective of our community base, but we feel it does reflect 
our customer base and the types of services we provide, with 
26% of our total colleague population being women.
Health & Safety Management
Halfords is committed to high standards of occupational health & 
safety to minimise the risk of injuries and ill health to employees, 
contractors, customers, visitors and others who come into contact 
with the business. Our overall annual incident rate remains below 
the benchmarks of the industries we operate in.

Stores and Customer Service
We market high quality products that we believe meet or exceed the 
requirements of appropriate legislation, international conventions and 
codes of practice. Where external guidance does not exist, we apply our 
own exacting standards. With a complex product range of over 14,000 
items, we interact with our customers every day to ensure that our range 
meets their requirements and that they understand how to use our 
products safely. Halfords has a large number of regular customers who 
see their key drivers of satisfaction being choice of products and brands, 
store environments and ease of shopping, knowledgeable staff with a 
“will-do” helpful attitude and competitive, value-for-money pricing 
together with a reasonably priced service proposition. 
Our autocentres provide value-added services to both the general public 
and large fleet providers alike, and carry out manufacturer-based 
servicing which meets the needs of vehicles still covered under warranty 
as well as our own menu-based servicing options, typically reducing the 
cost of motoring yet maintaining quality. The parts that we fit meet OE 
standards, ensuring that warranties are never compromised and that 
legislative requirements are met. We are the UK’s largest supporter of 
the Automotive Technician Accreditation (ATA) scheme and we work 
proactively to ensure that our technicians are up to date and technically 
competent. 
As well as being monitored by external organisations such as VOSA and 
Trading Standards, we apply our own quality control systems and 
mystery shopper programme to ensure that our customers receive the 
very best service experience.
Products
We continually assess the lifestyle and environmental impacts of our 
products, packaging, procedures and services at all appropriate 
stages, e.g. design, procurement, supply, sale, use and disposal. We 
always promote good practice in the provision of environmental 
communication to customers and colleagues; however, our business 
strategy and product offering is strongly influenced by consumer 
choice. For example in FY12 we sold c.993,000 litres of diluted screen 
wash and only c.540,000 litres of concentrated screen wash, a 
product that has a carbon footprint c.5 times lower than  
its diluted eqivalent.
At a time when the issues surrounding health and obesity have 
become increasingly important, Halfords, as the largest retailer of 
cycling products, actively encourages people to participate in this 
outdoor activity. We currently stock 189 models of bicycles, of which 
82 are aimed at children between three and eight years of age, and we 
continue to market “Cycle 2 Work” schemes that allow employers to 
offer to their employees the use of a bicycle for travelling to work. 
Services
Within our Autocentres business, all of our servicing products are 
aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and helping the motorist get more 
miles per gallon. 
During 2011 we introduced our new brakes4life product. brakes4life 
is a lifetime replacement of brake pads and brake shoes. By 
maintaining brake pads and shoes in good working condition our 
customers can improve fuel efficiency and ensure they can drive the 
car safely.
Supply Chain Transportation
Given that so many of our products are imported, we pay particular 
attention to the carbon footprint that this could create. We continue to 
monitor the airfreighting of our products from suppliers, and only do so 
in cases of extreme urgency. When landed in the UK, the majority of our 
products are shipped via rail to our Distribution Centres in the Midlands.
Marketplace
“We interact with our customers every day 
to ensure that our range meets their 
requirements and that they understand 
how to use our products safely.”

Corporate Responsibility Report continued
The Environment
Our products, stores, offices, and fleet of delivery vehicles have 
direct impacts on the environment. We also understand that 
there are indirect impacts caused by the production and use of 
our products. Our commitment is to understand and to 
continually improve the performance and management of our 
environmental impact throughout the Halfords supply chain. 
In managing our environmental responsibilities, our overall 
objectives relate to the following key areas: 
Fuel Efficiency
During FY12 our fleet of lorries drove over 7,000,000 kilometres 
in delivering product to our stores. To more fully understand our 
impact on Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions, we have 
converted the transport fleet fuel usage to total CO
2
 emissions. In 
FY12, The CO
2
 equivalent usage, calculated based on DEFRA’s 
2011 Freight Transport conversion factor of 2.648, indicates that 
we have used over 6 million tonnes of CO
2
, an 18% reduction 
year-on-year. This has been achieved by better utilisation of our 
Main and Cycling Distribution Centre, resulting in improved 
management of store deliveries and in the use of larger and 
double-decker trailer units, meaning more stock can be carried 
per delivery.
Natural Resources 
We continue to reduce our water usage and over the years have 
invested in “smart” water meters, which helps us to identify water 
leaks at an early stage. In our Retail stores, in FY12 we 
maintained our proud record of reducing water usage year-on-
year with a further 12.4% reduction.
Volumes of waste material recycled versus that sent to landfill have 
increased over the last five years to 81% in 2012.
As motor vehicle servicing centres, our autocentres are 
continually disposing of “motor vehicle” related waste safely. In 
FY12 as well as recycling car batteries we disposed of c.197,200 
tyres (2011: 132,000) and c.876,300 litres of oil (2011: 755,000).
Energy and Reducing CO
2
 Emissions
As we have continued to open new stores and autocentres our 
overall use of gas and electricity has improved as we added 
energy management systems to our properties and implemented 
specific action plans around voltage reduction. This year’s use of 
energy has not been affected by the cold weather periods of 
December 2010 and February 2011 and we have reduced our 
use of energy within the Group’s stores and autocentres, in 
2012, by 10.6%. In Retail where records have been kept since 
2007 we continue to reduce our use of gas and electricity in line 
with our target of between 15% and 20% on a 2007 base.
The following graph represents the energy used by our stores, 
autocentres, head offices and distribution centres.

Halfords’ Work Inclusion Programme
Following the Seeing is Believing visits described on page 45, 
Halfords was introduced to Bikeworks, a social enterprise company, 
specialising in using cycles and cycle repair to engage with 
disadvantaged NEET individuals. 
Bikeworks already run a work-based training programme, over a 
three-month period, that is design to give individuals the technical 
skills and work experience to be ready for employment in the cycle 
industry. The successful trainees gain a bicycle maintenance 
qualification as well as being exposed to a working cycle-retailing 
operation where they develop customer service and team-working 
skills. 
Halfords has, therefore, entered into a partnership with Bikeworks to 
create and deliver a programme that not only meets the Company’ s 
CR community objectives but also supports the Company’ s “Best 
Cycle Shop in T own” strategy by creating a programme of Cycle 
Repair training for people from disadvantaged backgrounds and, 
where appropriate, employing them in Halfords stores, delivering a 
knowledgeable, skilful and competitive cycle repair service.
Plans for this partnership were finalised in March 2012, and from  
1 April 2012 Halfords has committed to not only sponsoring 
Bikeworks to deliver out-reach “Build-a-bike” courses and to deliver 
the “Cycle into Work” course to a number of individuals, but we 
have also committed to employing the best, in Halfords stores local 
to each individual. In FY13 we aim to employ a minimum of 10 
individuals in the London area through this Work Inclusion 
Programme.
Accessibility
Our stores serve their local communities with our products and 
expert services and we are conscious that all, irrespective of 
disability, should be able to access both our stores and our online 
offering. We treat our responsibilities very seriously and we are 
committed to ensuring that all of our customers are able to access 
our products and services with the minimum of effort. We are 
committed to ensuring that both customers and colleagues have 
acess to our facilities and we have taken various actions in order to 
fulfil our responsibilities, including in 2011 working with the 
Employers Disability Forum to deliver training to some of our Head 
Office and store colleagues. 
Ethical Trading
We place great importance on the selection of our suppliers and 
how they interact within their own local communities and, where 
appropriate, we will visit manufacturing sources to verify that 
effective quality procedures are in place and that supply chain 
costs are minimised. We are always striving for improvement and 
we believe it is important that our suppliers are responsive to 
feedback from our customers and store colleagues. Halfords 
recognises that the development of close supplier partnerships is 
essential for the ongoing provision of an innovative and “value-for-
money” product offer. Halfords has a Sourcing Code of Conduct 
(“the Code”), which can be viewed on the Company’s website 
(halfordscompany.com). 
 
Charity of the Year
Our policy on charitable giving is to concentrate on working with 
one main charity over a two-year period. Since April 2011  
we have partnered with Cancer Research UK. 
Apprenticeships
The Group is aware of the need to provide employment 
opportunities within local communities and our Autocentres have 
the largest independent Apprentice Scheme in the motor industry. 
The scheme has been in operation for over 20 years and we have 
never failed to offer employment to apprentices who complete the 
three-year scheme. 
Industry Forums
Halfords retail values opportunities to work closely with trade 
associations, research institutes, standards authorities, universities 
and government organisations to improve performance standards 
and safety. During the year we have worked with ProMOTe to 
challenge proposed changes to MOT testing and the Plain 
English Campaign who awarded their “Crystal Mark” to both our 
brakes4life brochure and our “Helpful MOT” Guide.

Transforming our Business
As a company we want to play to our strengths — leveraging our infrastructure, 
developing innovative channels and creating new routes to market. This will enable 
us to continue to build trusted relationships with our customers.
This leads us to our proposition: “we help and inspire our customers with life on 
the move”. Our proposition is dependent on our ability to have a market-leading 
portfolio of products and services accessible through innovative channel delivery, 
enabled by the core elements of our infrastructure. This combination will drive and 
deliver our future growth.
Improving our infrastructure supports our customer proposition ensuring we continue 
to offer great products and services — at the right price and at the right time.
Simultaneously, our infrastructure provides the business with the ability to improve 
our customer responsiveness and underpin the growth opportunities we have 
identified.
As a result we are simplifying and refocusing our activities around three core 
themes:
Friend of the Motorist 
Best Cycle Shop in Town 
Starting Point for Great Getaways. 
This will allow us to differentiate what we do and set the standards for innovative 
retailing.
The following pages highlight the areas of strength at the heart of our business and 
will continue to provide the strong foundations necessary for executing our strategy 
and delivering on our promises. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

We believe our people are core to enabling our aggressive growth plans 
to be realised. Colleagues continue to play an important role in 
delivering our plans to sustain our success as a retailer and build 
momentum across a challenging retail landscape. 
To succeed it is important that we build and maintain both a qualified 
core and flexible colleague base. Improvements in colleague work 
patterns have optimised shop floor availability of the right people at the 
right time to improve customer experience and deliver on the Halfords 
“helpful” promise.
In addition, we continue to provide a range of training and development 
opportunities designed to improve productivity levels within Halfords 
Autocentres and improve competency in fitting services across the 
Halfords store portfolio. This we believe will drive growth. 
Our people continue to play an important role in ensuring Halfords is 
recognised as being a “Friend to the Motorist”, the “Best Cycle Shop in 
Town”, as well as a “Starting Point for Great Getaways”.
Strengthening Our Team
We continue to strengthen our team at all levels and across all areas of 
the business. We focus on recruiting for attitude, expertise and potential 
as well as the ability to be part of a cohesive and unified “one” team 
approach.
Our appointments range from strategic hires, as well as further 
additions to our operational management teams and specialist retail 
trading, digital marketing, search analysis and analytics teams. Such 
appointments continue to inform and identify new buying and trading 
strategies.
Experienced
Our colleagues are highly experienced in the roles they perform. In 
particular, not only do our people have great experience in product 
knowledge, servicing and fitting but our buyers are highly experienced 
in the markets we source from and supply to. In addition, our property 
team has considerable experience in converting and refurbishing our 
store portfolio. All of this experience contributes to making Halfords a 
retailer of choice.
Engagement
To be the best we have to engage with our colleagues. Our people are 
encouraged to connect, collaborate and exchange ideas, knowledge 
and insights. This informs decision-making and improves our overall 
customer proposition. 
Engagement includes clear communication focused around our core 
values — Think Customer; Be Helpful; Earn Trust; Inspire Others; Aim 
To Win; Work As A Team. 
Examples of engagement across the business include the initiative to 
encourage colleagues within the Centre and at the Distribution Centres 
to “Buddy” or “Adopt” a store — this has proved a great way to get 
people thinking across the business rather than simply seeing things 
from their perspective. In turn, this has led to improving our multi-
channel offerings.
Competencies
There are a number of activities that we believe are essential to ensuring 
that we remain competitive in the market and attractive to our 
customers.

Core competencies in marketing, branding, store retailing, distribution 
and international sourcing ensure we can provide customer offerings 
across a range of price points. Done well, these competencies allow us 
to maintain and improve our margins as well as grow our revenues.
Competencies help to shape the business and have led to a focus on 
“Operational Specialisation” and having a “Least Cost Back Office”.
Values Driven
Developing performance and living the Group values of being helpful 
depends on having trustworthy, honest, well-trained, enthusiastic and 
knowledgeable people who are capable of delivering the plan and living 
our values.
Creating the right culture is all about “the way we do things at Halfords” 
— the way we behave and the values we live and work by. We believe it 
is essential that our people feel engaged, understand their 
responsibilities and are held accountable for their actions. 
Creating the right mind-set ensures that customers have a great 
experience — spending more and returning to Halfords again and 
again. We think it is important to celebrate great performance and to 
never accept poor performance. This requires talented and passionate 
people involved in both frontline service as well as those who work 
behind the scenes.
Development
We have undertaken a number of people-based initiatives to improve 
Group performance, develop a greater commercial focus and drive 
sustainable growth through the development of innovative customer 
offerings. This involves developing capability across our stores, 
autocentres, distribution centres as well as Head Office.
Innovation — whether product or process led — is driven by 
participation, engagement and team effort. This allows us to 
differentiate ourselves in a crowded marketplace.
Right from the start, we induct and train for great customer service. 
Training ranges from a competency framework across the business to 
nationally recognised and accredited training programmes for store and 
Halfords Autocentre colleagues.

We believe that our systems meet our requirements and thus enable us 
to perform and to deliver on our promises to both our investors and our 
customers, providing a solid platform for driving investor returns and 
enabling an enhanced customer experience. 
Our systems provide us with effective tools that work all day, every day. 
As everyone knows, “retail is all about the detail” and our systems allow 
us to see below the surface and work out what is really going on in our 
business and across our multi-channel offering.
By being closer to our business we understand those actions we need 
to take to stabilise and build momentum on gross margin performance 
across the business, reinforcing our growth potential.
We also continue to build resilience into our systems and therefore 
strengthen our business. During the year we transitioned our disaster 
recovery plan; it is now supported in Somerset, UK and replicated in 
Bilbao, Spain.
In terms of customer facing systems, we continue to improve our 
multi-channel strategy that connects our stores with an online presence 
(www.halfords.com and www.halfordsautocentres.com), providing a 
compelling alternative to other online competition.
Change Management
Ongoing systems development including integration and update 
roll-outs, enables the necessary change required in the business to 
ensure scalability of our business model — strengthening the overall 
Halfords proposition.
However, for Halfords it is essential that change is achieved against a 
need to continue to deliver “business as usual” as well as “deliver the 
key enablers” to drive the execution of our strategy.
Systems are embedded to enable improved productivity, increasing our 
ability to respond to the constantly changing retail landscape. Halfords 
continues to strengthen its multi-channel teams and further integrate 
techniques and knowledge within our core retail business.
Sourcing and Inbound Logistics
We are leveraging our supply chain relationships to develop new, 
innovative and exclusive ranges across our store portfolio and online 
interface. Direct, proactive and agile global sourcing arrangements help 
to sustain gross margin improvements.
Increasingly we are sourcing more product directly from the 
international markets. In particular, our offices in Hong Kong have 
continued to investigate and source new sources of supply, building on 
our historic sourcing arrangements developed in the Far East.

All of our suppliers are subject to our Code of Ethics, based on 
auditable procedures consistent with established international 
standards. Virtually all of our products are manufactured to EN, BS and/
or ISO standards including ISO 9001 and 14001. External verification is 
provided by BVQI, an international quality audit company.
Distribution and Outbound Logistics
We continue to upgrade our warehousing, enterprise resource and web 
systems to improve the efficiency of our store logistics and successful 
multi-channel offer.
Our systems are enabling us to compete more effectively. Our 
customers can now order up until 6.00 pm for guaranteed next day 
delivery, representing an attractive and compelling offer for busy, 
time-constrained customers.
Inventory Management
Effective inventory management helps us to achieve more with less, 
reducing our inventory holding costs and ensuring we have the right 
product, in the right place, at the right time. From time to time, surplus 
inventory may accumulate — our integrated systems are three times 
more effective at clearance.
Better availability linked to accurate inventory information (achieved 
through hand-held terminals and labels that scan) improves forecasting 
and leads to increasingly profitable sales. 
“Reserve & Collect” and “Order & Collect” integrate our website with 
store and Distribution Centre inventories. This increases store footfall 
and range opportunities for smaller store formats.
Customer Capture
Our systems and expertise enable us to really understand and gain 
insight into our customers’ behaviour — merging multiple databases to 
achieve a single, holistic customer view; increasingly being able to 
anticipate what our customers want before they know what they want. 
Good customer metrics based on the valuable data we get from our 
customers — both in our stores and online — enable us to talk to 
customers in a more meaningful and focused way. This empowers our 
“Helpful” culture and enhances the customer experience. 
Our dynamic web offer builds on our multi-channel proposition and 
continues to drive customers into our stores, following their research 
powered by our systems, including recommendation functionality based 
on both manual and logarithmic prompts. This allows us to improve 
attachment rates through upgrade and accessorisation opportunities. 
Customers are increasingly attracted by our website promotions that 
combine with the convenience of delivery or collection from store, 
backed up by in-store services. In addition, mobile applications will 
continue to provide many opportunities for assisting in-store customers 
as well as those customers away from store.

We are continuously investing to improve the customer offer. Our major 
initiatives are focused on our people and our systems, including the role 
our distribution centres, autocentres and stores play in creating an 
attractive retail offer.
People
During the year we invested in training and development initiatives 
across the Group. Focused training ensures everything is right first time. 
Investment in our people included “Flying Start” in our stores — a 
training initiative to ensure that our frontline store staff are trained to 
check and fit products on behalf of our customers. 
Systems
Our system focus has been the integration of our multi-channel offer, 
streamlining and standardising processes as well as building capacity 
and resilience into our retail backbone.
As a result, our system upgrades have delivered a “least cost back 
office” as well as enhanced product availability and resulted in more 
accurate order fulfilment. Reductions in inventory holding costs have 
significantly offset ongoing system investment costs.
As our investment has scaled up we have increased our capacity to 
deal with customer orders and to handle order information. This 
increased capacity and increased intelligence around our customers’ 
buying decisions helps us to continue to refine our customer 
proposition.
Linked to our delivery service we made a major investment in the 
launch of a competitive “next day” delivery service for “Order & Collect” 
as well as orders delivered direct to customers. Our system software 
allows us to know exactly where each product is from order to delivery, 
resulting in optimal order accuracy. 
Distribution Centres
Investment in our Coventry Distribution Centre — a 320,000 sq. ft. 
customer fulfilment centre — is an essential part of our “least cost  
back office” strategy. 
For our distribution centres, investment to increase pick accuracy is 
vital in improving product availability for our customers. In addition, our 
colleagues have undertaken more checking of goods-out before 
loading — this improves the integrity of our inventory management 
systems, leading to increased delivery accuracy.
Stores
We are investing in upgrading and revitalising our store formats to 
ensure they remain relevant and attractive to the changing profile of our 
customers. Our test store formats will help to provide feedback on 
future-proofing our store portfolio and will improve the customer offer 
through creating the right environment, encourage more effective 
communication around the purchasing decision and ensure that our 
service, people and products reflect customers’ needs. In addition, we 
increased our Halfords Autocentres footprint, with investment in 20 new 
autocentres.
Multi-channel Offering
As we attract new customers it may be that our website is their first 
contact with our brand — we therefore need to make it user-friendly 
and engaging. We are therefore investing to make our online channel 
informative and intuitive, combined with good functionality to 
complement the physical presence of our stores.

Our market leading positions across multiple product categories such 
as Sat Nav, Audio and DAB radio roll-out (where we hold No. 1 sales 
positions) provide us with an opportunity to continue to consolidate a 
largely fragmented market.
Our operations provide access to unrivalled economies of scale, 
achieved through our extensive national coverage. Our coverage is 
supported by a number of elements including our distribution centres, 
store footprint, store and multi-channel experience.
Distribution Centres
Having reconfigured our distribution network in 2010 to include a 
state-of-the-art central distribution centre in Coventry, we are well 
placed to meet the needs of our extensive store footprint.
Store Footprint
Halfords maintains an extensive network of great-looking stores, 
providing a strong and resilient presence on both the high street and  
at prime locations within retail parks with high footfall. “Rightsizing”  
of our store portfolio will ensure that our store presence is an enabler  
of growth.
Our store network has a national footprint, driving Group revenues. It 
also enables us to differentiate our multi-channel offering as the network 
provides additional availability, accessibility and service — configured to 
meet the local demographic needs of our national customer base.
We combine our strong retail heritage with technological developments, 
offering a strong retail footprint both offline and online, providing our 
customers with an increasingly tailored customer service.
Store and Multi-channel Experience
Our stores are well run and provide dynamic, optimum space for 
delivering our customer proposition. To provide a great offer we are 
making our stores more family friendly, listing more relevant ranges and 
providing a differentiated service designed to make our customers feel 
more engaged. Our added expertise and service are difficult for 
competing online players and supermarkets to compete against.
Stores act as a consolidation point, drawing in web customers with the 
“Reserve & Collect” and “Order & Collect” online propositions as well as 
facilitating our retail service offering of checking, building and fitting 
products.
Further, our online offering allows us to target categories that customers 
are happy to transact with online. As a result, some of our online ranges 
are 600% bigger than our in-store ranges — attracting those customers 
who are savvy online shoppers.

Our brand continues to create domestic growth opportunities. At the 
heart of our brand story are our brand values. These values support the 
brand in the marketplace and allow us stand out in our key core 
categories. Brand extension leverages our previous brand successes 
and allows us to tap into new product categories and new product 
ranges.
Brand Strength and Values
Our brand is one of our greatest strengths. We have leading positions in 
attractive markets, with many of our brands holding No. 1 sales 
positions in the UK.
The quality of our products and services continues to drive our 
credibility. Our brand remains trusted in the minds of our customers, 
underpinned by strong customer relevance and satisfaction. 
Brand visibility has been further enhanced following the re-branding of 
Halfords Autocentres, ongoing reinvigoration of our store portfolio and 
innovative web promotions — providing a high profile both online and 
offline. As a result, c.9% of all sales are conducted online and 86% of 
these are collected from our stores.
Brand Extension
We continue to leverage the Halfords brand into new categories and 
new product ranges, including the extension of the Halfords brand 
name into the servicing arena, supporting our aspirations to expand the 
brand in the automotive aftercare market. We believe such initiatives will 
deliver customer awareness benefits, resulting in better footfall and 
utilisation.
Effective promotion of our brands via our multi-channel offer will 
continue to change our revenue mix towards higher value, more 
profitable products, services and opportunities.
Brand Management
We have strong brand and category management, ensuring that 
Halfords remains a natural destination for customers. This will provide a 
catalyst for growth as we continue to find reasons and offerings to bring 
customers back to us.
Brand management combined with effective customer marketing 
significantly enhances customer awareness and increases demand for 
our products and services. National TV and radio advertising 
campaigns continue to support awareness of the Halfords brand.
Our brand management provides a single face to customers so they 
connect with the Halfords brand across our offer and through new 
products, services and channels. Creating a single view of the customer 
for Halfords will enable us to increase relevancy in marketing and build 
a greater understanding of our customers.
Our brands enable us to offer products at multiple price points and 
specifications to appeal to a diverse customer base. Sub-brands 
include Carrera, Voodoo and Boardman within the cycle category.

Customer Values
Customers want value, personalisation and to trust the advice and 
service they receive. At Halfords we have a reputation for providing 
unparalleled honest and trustworthy products and service. A 
comprehensive range of support services makes Halfords a natural 
destination for those whose “life is on the move”.
Customer Centric
To respond to customer values, we think about our customers and put 
them first. As a customer facing business, we know our customers and 
aspire to give them the treatment and service they want and deserve.
We understand that journeys are at the heart of work and family life — 
we combine great products, expert advice and service to help our 
customers with their “life on the move”.
We recognise that our customers are time poor and increasingly 
intimidated by and impatient to “do it themselves”. As cars and 
products become increasingly sophisticated there is a reluctance and 
lack of expertise to “do it yourself” and as a result customers simply 
want convenience and immediacy provided by someone they can trust.
Proactive Customers
Our customers’ pursuit of value, personalisation and trust has been 
further empowered by the Internet. More and more customers check 
availability online before they visit our stores. Proactive customers get 
what they need when they need it.
Proactive Halfords
The needs of our customers continue to change and evolve and we 
encourage our customers to be active rather than passive. We want 
them to get involved rather than be indifferent. We want them to feel 
included rather than excluded.
At Halfords we help and inspire our customers, improving the customer 
experience — whether they contact us or we contact them, Halfords 
can be counted on as a friend in times of need. We have a progressive 
approach to service, fitting many of the products we sell. This often 
results in “trading up” and “accessorising” the transaction.
Understanding and acting on customer feedback is at the heart of what 
we do — our next generation of customer service is a direct response 
to the feedback we have received from customers.
“Helpforce” — a multi-channel, customer services team is geared up to 
cater for the future needs of our customers and stores, putting “that’s 
helpful, that’s Halfords” at the heart of our business. “Helpforce” 
involves a direct customer and store facing team of experts driving all 
store queries through one point of contact.
Customer Proposition
Halfords provides a unique range and service proposition, involving 
further advice and fitting services to customers that range from novices 
to enthusiasts. This approach results in a good segment sales mix 
offering — building competency and capability in higher margin 
segments such as our service lines.
Evolving our customer offer, using a competitive combination of range, 
price and service to augment our retail offer, provides a convenient, 
value-based solution. A consistent customer experience that is 
customer ready, customer friendly and customer driven leads to 
improved customer service and loyalty.
Relationship Management
Our customer relationship management is based on treating our 
customers as individuals and helping to provide them with a solution. 
This involves helping our customers to make informed product/service 
choices — our knowledgeable and experience-intensive customer 
support process increases our service innovation and penetration rates.
For instance, service innovation has boosted average transaction values 
as well as pulling in new customer segments. This has allowed us to 
differentiate our offering based on our “wefit”, “wecheck”, 
“weassemble”, “werepair”, “weservice” propositions.

Our Aim
We aim to be the No. 1 destination for products and services that 
enhance customers’ use of their car. Our range comprises retail Car 
Maintenance and Car Enhancement products, augmented with in-store 
services delivered through our range of “Do It For Me” offers or through 
our dedicated autocentres. Halfords Autocentres provide a range of 
services catering for the Car Maintenance market — services, MOTs 
through to complete vehicle maintenance packages. 
In short, we aim to take the hassle out of motoring for our customers 
while maintaining and growing service advantage that provides growth 
opportunities that appeal to our investors.
Market Trends
Sophisticated car production is causing a channel shift amongst 
customers from a Do It Yourself (“DIY”) to a Do It For Me (“DIFM”) 
attitude.
Global sourcing opportunities provide economies of scale and close 
supplier relationships that the fragmented independent garages are 
unable to benefit from.
A growing and ageing car parc as cars last longer and consumers are 
reluctant to “trade in for new” is underpinning growth in the UK 
automotive aftercare market — currently estimated to be worth 
between £8bn and £10bn. It is a fragmented industry and that means 
that any consolidation and/or compelling offer has the ability to “move 
the needle” and provide a “step-change” in terms of growth 
performance for the Group.
Our Position
Halfords is a natural destination retailer for products in the Car 
Maintenance and Car Enhancement categories as well as being a 
leading chain of UK car service centres providing garage service, auto 
repair and MOTs. Our position is likely to further improve as we look to 
extend the range and services that we provide as a Friend of the 
Motorist.
Our Offer
Through our Halfords Autocentres we have an opportunity to 
consolidate a fragmented market under a strong brand delivering an 
homest and trustworthy service. Our retail stores provide us with the 
opportunity to deliver car-related products and to extended our services 
to cater for both the retail and fleet customer, providing a unique 
combination of product and service.

Governance 70
Principal Activities
Halfords Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in England 
with registered number 04457314, and its registered office is at Icknield 
Street Drive, Washford West, Redditch, Worcestershire, B98 0DE.
The principal activities of the Group are: the retailing of automotive, 
leisure and cycling products, from 467 retail stores (2011: 466); and Car 
Servicing and repair from 260 autocentres (2010: 240). The principal 
activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
Business Review
The Chairman’s Statement on pages 6 to 7, and the Business Review 
on pages 10 to 49, including the Finance Director’s Report on pages 34 
to 38, provide a review of the business and progress against Key 
Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) during the year, descriptions of possible 
future developments, and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group, and form part of this Directors’ Report. Environmental 
considerations are reviewed within the Corporate Responsibility Report 
on pages 44 to 49 which also forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Corporate Governance
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 74 to 81 forms part of this 
Directors’ Report.
Profits and Dividends
The Group’s results for the year are set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 96.
The profit before tax on ordinary activities was £94.1m (2011: £118.1m) 
and the profit after tax amounted to £68.4m (2011: £85.5m).
The Directors propose that a final dividend of 14.0 pence per ordinary 
share be paid on 3 August 2012 to shareholders whose names are on 
the register of members at the close of business on 6 July 2012. This 
payment, together with the interim dividend of 8.0 pence per ordinary 
share paid on 27 January 2012, makes a total for the year of 22.0 
pence per ordinary share. The total final dividend payable to 
shareholders for the year is estimated to be £27.9m. Computershare 
Nominees (Channel Islands) Limited, formerly Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust 
Limited, trustee of the Halfords Employee Share Trust, has waived its 
entitlement to dividends.
Performance Monitoring
The delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives is monitored by the 
Board through KPIs and the periodic review of various aspects of the 
Group’s operations. The Board considers the KPIs listed on pages 18 
to 21 are appropriate measures for the delivery of the strategy of the 
Group and its two divisions — Retail and Autocentres.
Donations 
During the year the Group contributed £50,000 (2011: £73,000) to 
charities in the UK, including donations to BEN, a charity supporting 
individuals and families linked to the motor industry and associated 
trades. 
The Group’s policy is not to make any donations for political purposes. 
However, the Companies Act 2006 defines the term “donations” very 
widely and, as a result, certain expenses legitimately incurred as part of 
the process of talking to Government at all levels and making the 
Group’s position known are now reportable. Although during the year 
no such expenditure or political donations were made, resolutions were 
passed at the 2011 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) that provided for 
limited authority for such expenditure, such authority remaining valid 
until the earlier of 2 October 2012 or the conclusion of the AGM to be 
held in 2012, and as such the Company will be asking for this limited 
authority to be renewed at the AGM to be held on 31 July 2012.
Colleagues
The Board is committed to high standards of customer care and 
service provision across the business and recognises that the 
involvement of every colleague in this commitment is critical. In 
furtherance of this, the Group has established a framework of colleague 
communications regarding business performance. The Board’s ongoing 
commitment to colleagues’ engagement and development is reinforced 
via training initiatives across the business. Colleague share ownership, 
facilitated via the availability of a Sharesave Scheme, is encouraged to 
further strengthen colleagues’ participation in the development of the 
Group’s business and aligns our colleagues’ interests with those of our 
shareholders. 
The Group is dedicated to the principle of equal opportunity in 
employment and ensures that no applicant or colleague receives less 
favourable treatment on grounds such as gender, marital status, race, 
ethnic origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or age, or is 
disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown 
to be justified. Fair and equitable employment policies are applied which 
seek to promote entry into, and progression within, the Group. The 
basis for all appointments is personal ability and competency relevant 
to the specific job criteria.
Full and fair consideration is given to employment applications by 
disabled persons wherever suitable opportunities exist, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities. Training and career development 
support is provided where appropriate. Should a colleague become 
disabled efforts are made to ensure their continued employment with 
the Group and retraining provided if necessary.
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements  
of Halfords Group plc (the “Company”) together with its subsidiary 
undertakings (the “Group”) for the period ended 30 March 2012.

blowing policy and associated procedure which enables them to report

wrong or of malpractice occurring and remaining unreported. In 
addition, the Group takes a zero-tolerance approach to matters of 
discrimination, harassment and bullying in all aspects of its business 
operations, whether in relation to gender, race, national origin, disability, 
age, religion, sexual orientation or similar. Appropriate policies and

Corporate Governance Code guidelines, all those persons holding

themselves for re-election at the AGM on 31 July 2012. 
Directors’ Interests
The Directors’ interests in shares and options over shares in the 
Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
82 to 91. 
In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, each Director 
has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she has, or 
could have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational conflict). These 
interests were considered and approved by the Board in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association and each Director informed 
of the authorisation and the terms on which it was given. 
Directors’ Indemnities 
During the year the Company maintained liability insurance for its 
Directors and officers. The Directors of the Company, and the Directors 
of each of the Company’s subsidiaries, have the benefit of an indemnity 
provision in the Company’s Articles of Association. The indemnity 
provision, which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision as 
defined by section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, has been in force 
throughout the year.
Directors’ Responsibilities
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements can be found on page 94.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
The Directors of the Group have taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the Group’s Auditors in connection with 
preparing their report and to establish that the Auditors are aware of 
that information and so far as the Directors are aware there is no such 
information of which the Group’s Auditors are unaware. The Directors 
are responsible for maintaining the integrity of financial information 
which includes the Annual Report, together with other financial 
statements, presentations and announcements on the Company’s 
Corporate and IR website. Legislation in the UK concerning the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any formal code or standard on payment 
practice, but agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions 
when orders for goods and services are placed, and includes the 
relevant terms in contracts, where appropriate. These arrangements are 
adhered to when making payments, subject to the terms and 
conditions being met by suppliers. The number of trade creditor days 
outstanding at the period end for the Group was 59 days (2011: 59 
days). The Company is a holding company and had no trade creditors 
at the end of the period ended 30 March 2012.
Contractual or Other Arrangements
The Directors consider that there are no contractual or other 
arrangements, such as those with major suppliers, which are likely to 
influence, directly or indirectly, the performance of the business and its 
value.

The Takeover Directive
All ordinary shares rank equally with respect to voting rights and the 
rights to receive dividends. Shares acquired through Company share 
schemes and plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have 
no special rights.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements; to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company; to appoint proxies; and to exercise 
voting rights.
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of any 
class of shares and no requirements for prior approval of any transfers. 
None of the shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the 
Company.
There are no known arrangements under which the financial rights are 
held by a person other than the holder of the shares and no known 
agreements on restrictions on share transfers or on voting rights.
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors are 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. In accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all Directors of the Company stand for re-election 
on an annual basis.
Changes to the Company’s Articles of Association must be approved 
by the shareholders in accordance with the legislation in force from time 
to time.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and plan may cause options and awards 
granted to Directors and employees under such schemes and plans to 
vest on a takeover.
The Company has term and revolving credit facilities and under the 
terms of these facilities, the Company is required, in the event of a 
change of control, to give notification to the facility agent and if so 
required by the majority lenders the facilities may be cancelled.
Authority to Purchase Shares
At the 2011 AGM, shareholders approved a special resolution 
authorising the Company to purchase a maximum of 20,583,992 
shares, representing 10% of the Company’s issued share capital at  
22 June 2011, such authority expiring at the conclusion of the AGM to 
be held in 2012. The Directors intend to optimise the Group’s balance 
sheet to enhance shareholder returns and on 7 April 2011 commenced 
a £75m share buyback programme. In the period ended 30 March 
2012, the Company purchased 18,084,133 shares as part of this 
buyback programme (2011: Nil), representing a nominal value of 
£180,841 (2011: £Nil), representing 9.0% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at 30 March 2012. The aggregate consideration 
(excluding stamp duty) paid for its shares was £62.3m.

Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Business Review on pages 10 to 49. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Finance Director’s Report on pages 34 to 38. In 
addition, note 19 to the Group Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
With effect from 5 November 2010 the Group secured a four-year 
£300m revolving credit facility (extendable by a further year) and at  
30 March 2012 the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of £160m 
(1 April 2011: £211m). The Group’s previous and current committed 
borrowing facilities contain certain financial covenants, which have been 
met throughout the period.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should 
be able to operate within the level of its borrowing facilities and 
covenants for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, hence they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Bridge Road, 
Birmingham, B1 2JZ. The notice of the AGM and explanatory notes 
regarding the special business to be put to the meeting will be set out 
in a separate circular to shareholders.

Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
For the period ended 30 March 2012, the Board considers that the Group has complied fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (“the 
Code”). The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council from whom paper and downloadable versions can be obtained via its website: 
www.frc.org.uk. We have outlined in this report how we have complied with the five main principles of the Code using the same headings as the 
main sections of the Code. ••

“As Chairman, I aim to guide my colleagues on the Board to 
deliver effective and accountable leadership for the benefit of 
our shareholders, the Company and other stakeholders. My 
colleagues on the Board and I take seriously our collective 
responsibility for the long-term direction and strategy of the 
Group. We are convinced that a strong framework of corporate 
governance practices contributes to the success and future of 
our business strategy and processes. In the following pages of 
this Corporate Governance Report, we seek to illustrate how 
we have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code through 
the use of committees and delegated decision-making, 
supported by risk management and accountability controls, to 
provide effective leadership to the business.”

Leadership — How the Board Operates — Effective Meetings
During the year the Chairman, supported by the Company Secretary, 
continued the practice of maintaining a rolling 12-month agenda for 
Board and Committee meetings. Agenda items included standing items 
such as progress reports from the Executive Directors and the 
Company Secretary, as well as periodic items such as: updates from 
Committee Chairs, a review of the risk register and internal controls, 
strategy, and succession planning. The annual agenda also establishes 
the time frame for finalisation and circulation of the pre-meeting papers. 
This ensures that the Directors receive the complete information, 
sufficiently in advance of the meeting, such that the Board can make 
effective decisions within the meeting itself. In this manner, the 
Chairman and the Board can have confidence that the yearly cycle of 
meetings allows sufficient time for discussion by the Board of each 
matter, at the most appropriate meeting in the year, enabling them to 
discharge their duties as Directors effectively. Additional meetings were 
also held throughout the year when business needs arise. 
Leadership — How the Board Operates — Decision-Making
The Board is mindful of its duties and responsibilities to shareholders, 
customers, employees and other stakeholders in determining the 
long-term strategy and objectives of the Group. Such duties and 
responsibilities encompass: monitoring the achievement of business 
objectives and management performance; scrutinising the proposed 
contractual relationships of the Group; and safeguarding relationships 
with, and generating value for, shareholders; within the context of a 
sound and robust framework of internal controls and risk management. 
Therefore, specific matters which significantly impact on these areas of 
the business are reserved for the decision of the Board. 
The Board recognises that for productive decision-making at Board 
meetings, as well as within the Group, certain decisions should be 
considered and made by the Board alone, whilst for other matters it is 
appropriate to delegate the Board’s decision-making authority to its 
Committees or management. These arrangements are formally 
recorded in a Matters Reserved for the Board document which is 
reviewed and updated by the Board annually. 
Reserved Matters — for the Board
Decisions specifically reserved for approval by the Board include those 
concerning the bounds of its authority, the strategy and business plan 
of the Group, any changes to the Group’s capital structure, significant 
corporate transactions and assessments of the Group’s risk and control 
processes.
 
Delegated Matters — to Board Committees
The responsibilities of the Board Committees are set out in the 
individual Terms of Reference of each Committee which comply with 
the Code. The contents of these are discussed further within the 
sub-sections that follow on the Committees starting at page 78 and are 
also available on the Company’s website.

Delegated Matters — to Executive Directors
The Executive Directors further delegate their responsibilities, via the 
Group’s Management Structure illustrated below, in line with a 
supporting document: Delegated Authorities. Each Executive Director 
and the Company Secretary has overall responsibility via this document 
for the relevant business function. The procedures for approving 
processes within these functions are clearly outlined establishing how 
and by whom approval of a business decision can be made and the 
required evidence of such approval. Examples of decisions delegated  
in this way are the placement of orders with suppliers, the entering into 
a contract with a web design agency, the appointment of professional 
health & safety advisors and the agreement of new portfolio deals.

Leadership — How the Board Operates — Non-Executive 
Directors
The Non-Executive Directors help the Executive Directors by 
contributing independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s 
deliberations and assisting in the development of the Company’s 
strategy. In addition, they are responsible for monitoring the 
performance of the Executive Directors against agreed goals and 
objectives. Their views are essential in the reporting of performance and 
in the integrity of the financial information, controls and risk 
management processes of the Company. In order to carry out these 
functions appropriately the Non-Executive Directors meet regularly with 
senior management and make periodic site visits and also meet 
separately without the Executive Directors present. Senior managers 
are also regularly invited to Board meetings to make business 
presentations to the Board. 
Leadership — How the Board Operates — Senior Independent 
Director
Bill Ronald is the Senior Independent Director of the Company and as 
such works alongside the Chairman and is available to serve as an 
intermediary for the other Directors if necessary. He is also available to 
shareholders if direct contact with the Chairman, Chief Executive or 
other Executive Directors has failed to resolve the concerns of 
shareholders or for which such contact is inappropriate. As Senior 
Independent Director he also led the annual review of the performance 
of the Chairman. 
In addition, should a Director have a concern over any unresolved 
business he/she is entitled to require the Company Secretary to minute 
the concern. Should the Director later resign over the issue, the 
Chairman will bring it to the attention of the Board. 
Leadership — Board and Committees
During the year the Board scheduled eight meetings and the 
Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committee four, three and five 
meetings respectively.

Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 30 March 2012
Online version 
halfords.annualreport2012.com
The Board considers that it has the right combination of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge to be useful and effective in 
meeting the needs of the business. More than half of the Board are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Dennis Millard was appointed 
Chairman on 28 May 2009 and reappointed on 28 May 2011. At the 
time of his appointment he was considered to meet the independence 
criteria. The other Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board 
to be independent in character and judgement.
This combination of individuals and skills ensures that the Board is 
sufficiently balanced such that no individual or group of individuals can 
dominate decision-making and allows for an effective division of 
responsibilities within the Board and its Committees. The positions of 
Chairman and Chief Executive are held separately. The boundaries of 
their remit for running the Board and the business respectively are 
available on the Company’s Corporate and IR website. Each Director 
devotes sufficient time and attention as is necessary in order to perform 
their duties. 
Diversity
The Board considers itself diverse in terms of the background and 
experience each individual member brings to the Board. To maintain 
this, the considerations to be taken into account in each appointment 
to the Board are stipulated in the Terms of Reference of the Nomination 
Committee which are available on the Company’s Corporate and IR 
website. Specifically, the Nomination Committee must “consider 
candidates on merit and against objective criteria, and with due regard 
for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender” in identifying 
and recommending candidates. 
Currently one member of the Board is female. This appointment was 
made on the basis that Claudia Arney was the best-qualified candidate 
to provide the Board with the necessary support and expertise in 
developing the Group’s online consumer and media strategy. 
The Company is not generally in favour of setting a fixed quota of 
women on the Board. The Nomination Committee will continue to 
recommend appointments to the Board based on the existing balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, on the merit and 
capabilities of the nominee and on the time they are able to devote to 
the role in order to promote the success of the Company. 
Induction and Ongoing Training
Although no new appointments have been made in the year under 
review, an induction programme is maintained for new Directors, which 
is tailored to include briefings on the activities of the Group and visits to 
operational sites. All Directors are members of the Deloitte Academy, a 
training resource that provides support and guidance to boards and 
individual directors. Directors are informed of relevant material changes 
to laws and regulations affecting the Group’s business and their duties 
as Directors. The Company Secretary advises the Board on governance 
matters and is available to all Directors for advice as required. All 
Non-Executive Directors have embarked on a series of head office and 
store visits through the year and feedback is provided at Board 
meetings.
Effectiveness — Board Committees
The Board has established a number of Committees to assist in the 
discharge of its responsibilities. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committees. 
Effectiveness — Board Composition
Throughout the period covered by this report, the Board comprised three Executive Directors, the Chairman and four independent Non-Executive 
Directors who bring to the Board the following key skills, experience, independence and knowledge:

Corporate Governance Report continued
Only the members of each Committee are entitled to attend its 
meetings, although other Directors, professional advisors and members 
of the senior management team attend when invited to do so. The 
Audit Committee will invite the Auditors to certain of its meetings. In the 
cases of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees, no member is 
present when business pertinent to them is under discussion. A 
Treasury Committee, composed of senior members of the finance and 
treasury teams and chaired by the Finance Director, has been 
established to manage the day-to-day treasury needs of the Group. A 
Disclosure Committee composed of a minimum of two Directors has 
been established to approve finalised market announcements prior to 
release. 
When the need arises, separate ad hoc committees may be set up by 
the Board to consider specific issues.
Effectiveness — Directors and their Other Interests
Each Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or 
she has, or can have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational 
conflict). These interests were considered and approved by the Board 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and each 
Director was informed of the authorisation and the terms on which it 
was given. All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the 
Company Secretary regarding any further possible situational conflict 
that may arise so that prior consideration can be given by the Board as 
to whether or not such conflict will be approved.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests of 
the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of the 
Company and options to subscribe for shares in the Company are 
shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 82 to 91. 
Effectiveness — Board Evaluation
In May 2011, the Board undertook an internal evaluation process via: 
one-to-one meetings between the Chairman and the other Directors, 
one-to-one meetings between the Senior Independent Director and the 
other Directors regarding the performance of the Chairman, and Board 
and Committee Evaluation Questionnaires. The collated information 
was reviewed by the Board and the appropriate Committee, and overall 
it was concluded that the performance of the Board as a whole, its 
principal Committees and individual Directors was such that each 
Director performs at the optimum level for the benefit of the Company. 
Following this review and in line with the Code, the Board committed to 
an external evaluation for the period.
The Board engaged Egon Zehnder in April 2011 to facilitate the external 
evaluation of the Board via a series of one-to-one interviews with each 
individual Director. Discussions included: the workings of the Board and 
its Committees; the balance of skills, expertise and personalities on the 
Board; and the need to consider the Board’s composition in light of the 
Company’s strategy of Friend of the Motorist, Best Cycle Shop in Town 
and the Starting Point for Great Getaways. Egon Zehnder are expected 
to report back to the Board on their findings in June 2012.
Effectiveness — Re-election
All Directors on the Board on 30 March 2012 will seek re-election at the 
Company’s AGM on 31 July 2012 in compliance with the Code and the 
Company’s Articles of Association. 
With the exception of David Wild, all members of the Committee are 
considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors. The Code states 
that the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman 
after his appointment and the Board feels it is appropriate, as all Non-
Executive Directors sit on the Committee, that the Committee should be 
chaired by the Chairman of the Group. Senior members of management 
and advisors are invited to attend meetings as appropriate.
Effectiveness — Nomination Committee
Chairman
Dennis Millard
“The Nomination Committee is pleased that the new Board 
members and senior Executives in whose appointment we were 
involved last year have established themselves well in, and are 
providing the fresh insight we anticipated. The Nomination 
Committee continues to take an active involvement in 
succession planning this year with the appointment of a 
number of senior Executives to further boost and complement 
the skills and experience brought by the Board and senior 
Executives.”

“The role of the Audit Committee is key to ensure full 
stakeholder confidence in the financial matters of the business. 
It helps to ensure that financial statements are accurate, and 
that controls, policies and procedures are relevant, up to date 
and adhered to. This is achieved through regular review, 
communication with operational and financial management in 
the business, through the internal audit function, and reviews 
with the external Auditors.”
Read online: halfords.annualreport2012.com/cgr
All the members of the Audit Committee are independent Non-
Executive Directors. David Adams has been the Deputy Chief Executive 
and Finance Director of the House of Fraser Plc and as such is also 
considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Each of the other independent Non-Executive Directors on 
the Audit Committee has, through their other business activities, 
significant experience in financial matters. The Chairman, senior 
members of management and advisors are invited to attend meetings 
as appropriate.
The Audit Committee meets according to the requirements of the 
Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the Audit Committee 
also provide the opportunity for the independent Non-Executive 
Directors to meet without the Executive Directors present and to raise 
any issues of concern with the Auditors. There have been three such 
meetings in the period ended 30 March 2012 and nothing of note was 
reported.

the preparation of the Interim Report and Annual Report and Financial

Committee assists the Board in achieving its obligations under the 
Code in areas of risk management and internal control, focusing 
particularly on compliance with legal requirements, accounting 
standards and the Listing Rules, and ensures that an effective system 
of internal financial and non-financial controls is maintained. The 
ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements remains with the Board. 
The Committee will keep under review the Auditors’ independence 
including any non-audit services that are to be provided by the Auditors. 
The Auditors confirm their independence at least annually. A formal 
policy exists which ensures that the nature of the advice to be provided 
could not impair the objectivity of the Auditors’ opinion on the Group’s 
Financial Statements. This policy was made more robust throughout the 
period and only allows the Auditors to be engaged for non-audit 
services subject to Audit Committee approval being obtained prior to  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

any such appointment. Exceptions to this are the engagement of the 
Auditors for the half-year review, and internal support services in 
respect of management’s annual internal audit plan.
The Audit Committee has approved a formal whistle-blowing policy 
whereby staff may, in confidence, disclose issues of concern about 
possible malpractice or wrongdoings by any of the Group’s businesses 
or any of its employees without fear of reprisal. This includes 
arrangements to investigate such matters and for appropriate follow-up 
action.
Accountability — Internal Control and Risk Management
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control, reviewing its 
effectiveness and ensuring that there is a process to identify, evaluate 
and manage any significant risks that may affect the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives lies with the Board.
The Board and the Audit Committee have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in 
accordance with the Code for the period ended 30 March 2012, and 
up to the date of approving the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements. The internal control and risk management system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The internal audit function principally reviews the effectiveness of the 
controls operating within the business by undertaking an agreed 
schedule of independent audits each year. The Audit Committee 
determines the nature and scope of the annual audit programme at the 
beginning of each calendar year and revises it from time to time 
according to changing business circumstances and requirements. 
Whilst directed by Andrew Findlay, the Company’s Finance Director, the 
internal audit function is independent in action and reporting, with a 
direct line of communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. The 
findings of the independent audits are reported initially to Executive 
management and any necessary corrective actions are agreed. 
Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed with, the 
Audit Committee along with details of progress against action  
plans as appropriate.
Currently, the Company has engaged KPMG to support the internal 
audit process. The plan and scope of work for the future is determined 
by the Halfords Group Executive management team and the Audit 
Committee. KPMG act as a resource to allow managerial access to 
appropriately skilled individuals. KPMG do not perform a management 
role. It is the intention of the Company to move towards a greater 
internal resourcing of the Internal Audit function, and recruitment is 
under way for a suitable qualified Head of Internal Audit, who will build a 
team to carry out this work.
The assessment and control of risk are considered by the Board to be 
fundamental to achieving corporate objectives. An ongoing process for 
identifying and evaluating the significant risks faced by the Group and 
the effectiveness of related controls has been established by the Board 
to ensure an acceptable risk/reward profile across the Group. The key 
elements of this process are:
 ■ a comprehensive system of monthly reporting from key Executives, 
identifying performance against budget, analysis of variances, major 
business issues, key performance indicators and regular 
forecasting;
 ■ well-defined policies governing appraisal and approval of capital 
expenditure and treasury operations;
 ■ reviews of key business risks and of management’s controls and 
plans to mitigate these risks; and
 ■ an annual corporate governance confirmation made to the Board 
by all senior Executives on the effectiveness of the identification of 
major risks and of the monitoring of internal controls within their 
areas of responsibility. 
As part of this process, the Board has established a Risk Management 
Group to oversee the implementation of the risk management 
framework, co-ordinate risk management activities throughout the 
business, and to report to the Board and Audit Committee on risk 
issues. The Risk Management Group is chaired by the Company 
Secretary and includes senior managers from Store Operations, 
Business Systems, Health & Safety, Human Resources, Finance, Store 
Assurance, Business Services, Multi-channel, Logistics, and Supply 
Chain functions. During the financial period to 30 March 2012 and up to 
the date of this report the Risk Management Group considered the 
Company’s Risk Register and its alignment with the Company’s key 
strategic objectives, reporting the findings to the Board. The Board 
considered its appetite for risk in relation to the top 25 risks determining 
that the risks and mitigating actions were appropriate to the level of risk 
that was both acceptable to, and incumbent within, a FTSE 250 
business. More information on the Company’s key risks and 
uncertainties is shown on pages 40 to 43.
All members of the Remuneration Committee are considered to 
be independent Non-Executive Directors. Executive Directors  
attend Remuneration Committee meetings at the invitation of the 
Committee Chairman.

Relations with Shareholders
During the period ended 30 March 2012 Bill Ronald served as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director. The Senior Independent 
Director is available to meet shareholders upon request if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or 
the Executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
The Board recognises the importance of establishing and maintaining 
good relationships with all of the Company’s shareholders and Bill 
Ronald has indicated his willingness to meet with any shareholders as 
they request. During the period under review the Chief Executive, 
Finance Director, Chairman and Remuneration Committee Chairman 
have met with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of significant developments and report to the Board 
accordingly on the views of these stakeholders. 
Each of the other Non-Executive Directors is also offered the 
opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders and would do 
so if requested by any major shareholder. The Company’s investor 
relations programme includes formal presentations of full year and 
interim results and meetings with individual investors as appropriate. 
Independent feedback from these meetings is provided to the Board. 
The Company Secretary is also charged with bringing to the attention 
of the Board any material matters of concern raised by the Company’s 
shareholders, including private investors.
The Interim Report and the Annual Report and Financial Statements are 
the primary means used by the Board for communicating during the 
year with all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board also recognises 
the importance of the Internet as a means of communicating widely, 
quickly and cost-effectively and a Corporate and Investor Relations 
website is maintained to facilitate communications with shareholders. 
Information available online includes copies of the full and half-year 
financial statements, press releases and Company news, corporate 
governance information and statements and the Terms of Reference for 
the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. 
The Board is committed to the constructive use of the AGM as a forum 
to meet with shareholders and to hear their views and answer their 
questions about the Group and its business. The AGM of the Group is 
to be held on Tuesday, 31 July 2012 at the Hyatt Regency Birmingham, 
Bridge Road, Birmingham, B1 2JZ. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, 
Nomination and Audit Committees will be present at the AGM and will 
be in a position to answer questions relevant to the work of those 
Committees. It is the Company’s practice to propose separate 
resolutions on each substantial issue at the AGM. The Chairman will 
advise shareholders on the proxy voting details at the meeting.
The Company’s financial calendar and other shareholder information is 
set out on page 135.

Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee and of the Board is to 
provide remuneration packages for Executive Directors and other senior 
managers in the Group which:
 ■ Align management’s interests with those of shareholders by 
incentivising management to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy 
and enhance shareholder value.
 ■ Provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive 
remuneration through variable-based pay.
 ■ Provide upper quartile rewards compared to other general retail 
companies of a similar size, but only if above upper quartile 
performance is delivered.
 ■ Enable the Group to attract and retain management of the calibre 
required to run the business and drive exceptional shareholder 
value creation.
The Board reviews this policy and whether remuneration arrangements 
appropriately reflect this policy annually. 
During the year and the period to the date of this report the 
Remuneration Committee, supported by Deloitte LLP:
 ■ Considered the Group’s remuneration policy.
 ■ The Committee considered the broad policy continued to be 
aligned with the strategy and long-term success of the 
business.
 ■ The Committee considered whether the remuneration 
arrangements, including variable, performance-based 
elements, continue to be structured to ensure associated 
performance remains aligned with the strategic objectives of 
the Company and incentivises managers.

 ■ Consideration was given to the appropriateness of the 
performance conditions of the Company’s Performance Share 
Plan. The Committee considers that the performance measures 
that applied to the 2011–14 scheme continue to be appropriate 
for the business and therefore these measures will also apply 
for the 2012–15 scheme. During the year the Committee 
assessed TSR and EPS performance for the 2009–2012 
scheme. These targets were not meet and therefore this award 
will not vest.
 ■ The 2011/12 bonus was based 80% on Profits Before Tax 
(“PBT”) and 20% on Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) performance.   
During the year neither the PBT or the EPS targets were met 
and therefore no bonus will be paid to Executive Directors in 
respect of 2011/12 performance. 
 ■ Consideration was given to the targets for the Executive 
Directors’ and senior managers’ short-term bonus 
arrangements for 2012/13. The Committee considered that the 
target range previously used was too narrow in the context of 
expected performance for 2012/13 and therefore determined 
that a range of 92% (zero payout) to 106% (full payout) was 
more appropriate.
 ■ The Committee also considered the measures used for the 
bonus and agreed that the 80% PBT, 20% EPS arrangements 
would be replaced, with future payments being based 75% on 
PBT and 25% on a number of key non-financial metrics linked 
to the strategy and operation of the business. These metrics 
have been selected in order to support the enhancement of 
strategic pillars (see page 4) which the Committee ultimately 
believes will lead to the creation of shareholder value.
 ■ When determining bonus payouts for 2012/13, in addition to 
considering performance against targets, the Committee will 
also consider the underlying performance of the business  
and performance against strategic initiatives. It retains the 
discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to 
ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the  
context of performance and value delivered for shareholders. 
Discretion shall in all cases only be exercised within the agreed 
boundaries and maxima.
 ■ The Committee also considered whether it would be 
appropriate to disclose a single figure for the total of each 
Director’s remuneration. It was decided that at this time, that as 
there was no agreed basis for calculation of this figure, that any 
disclosure could be misleading. We will, however, keep this 
under review as regulations and market practice develop.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Note 1
In October 2011, a Group-wide salary review was undertaken which 
took into account remuneration trends, candidate quality and job 
location in markets in which the Group had recently recruited. With 
respect to the Executives, the salary review also considered executive 
remuneration market trends and benchmarking. The salary increases 
from 1 April 2012 recommended by the Committee, and approved by 
the Board, are detailed below alongside the average percentage 
increase awarded across the Group. The Committee was mindful to 
ensure that no Director received an increase in excess of the average 
across the Group of 2%. The Chief Executive received 2%, an increase 
to £517,650, the Finance Director also received 2%, an increase to 
£280,500. The Commercial Director’s salary remained at £290,700.
Note 2
Under the PSP , conditional rights to receive shares or nil cost options 
over shares are awarded to participants. PSP Awards have been made 
in every year since 2005.

During 2008/9 the Company changed its pension arrangements to 
prepare for the Government’s introduction of Personal Accounts. The 
Halfords Pension Plan moved from a defined contribution scheme to a 
contract-based plan, where each member has their own individual 
pension policy which they monitor independently. For each member 
could also benefit from salary sacrifice arrangements. Both schemes 
were open to the Executive Directors, who each receive a pension 
contribution of 15% of base salary per annum. The Group’s 
contributions during the year are shown in the table on page 90. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6
Governance 86
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
As outlined above, the remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a 
substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is 
variable and performance-related. By linking the remuneration of the 
individual Executive Director to the performance of the Company, the 
Board seeks, as far as possible, to motivate that individual towards 
superior business performance and shareholder value creation, and to 
only pay rewards when these goals have been realised. Performance 
measures are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration 
arrangements are transparent to Directors, shareholders and other 
stakeholders. 
The chart above seeks to illustrate the overall balance between fixed 
and variable remuneration within the current remuneration policy.
Executive Directors’ Service Agreements
Term
The Company’s policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, 
and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, 
the Company and shareholders. Failure should not be rewarded and 
the departing Executive’s duty to mitigate loss should be fully 
recognised. The Committee periodically reviews the Group’s policy on 
the duration of Directors’ service agreements, and the notice periods 
and termination provisions contained in those agreements. Whilst the 
Company is aware that companies are encouraged to consider notice 
periods of less than 12 months, the Committee believes that the current 
policy, whereby notice periods contained in Executive Directors’ service 
contracts should be limited to 12 months (other than in exceptional 
circumstances, such as for the purposes of recruitment), is more in line 
with the Company’s overall remuneration policy that is designed to 
attract and retain high calibre Executives.

Paul McClenaghan 9 May 2005 12 months
(1)    Andrew Findlay was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2011 
and his service agreement was effective from that date.
Early Termination
No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be 
terminated by notice from an Executive Director or for lawful early 
termination by the Company.
The Company may terminate any of the above service agreements by 
giving not less than 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination 
(other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance 
with the terms of the service agreement) the Company may (but is not 
obliged to) pay to the Executive Director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal 
to the annual value of the Executive Director’s then salary, benefits, 
pension contributions and on-target bonus (calculated on a pro rata 
daily basis) which he would have received during the contractual notice 
period, the sum of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments. 
Mitigation in Termination
In such instances the Executive Director shall use their best endeavours 
to secure an alternative source of remuneration, thus mitigating any loss 
to the Company, via the provision of his services as expediently as 
possible in the prevailing circumstances and shall provide the Board 
with evidence of such endeavours upon their reasonable request. If the 
Director fails to provide such evidence the Board may cease all further 
payments of compensation. To the extent that the Executive Director 
receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of 
services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the 
payments shall be reduced by the amount of such sums. 
Change of Control 
The service agreements of Executive Directors do not provide for any 
enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the 
Company. 
External Directorships
The Group is supportive of Executive Directors who wish to take on a 
non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to 
broaden their experience and they are entitled to retain any fees they 
may receive. David Wild was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of 
Premier Foods on 7 March 2011 and in the period ended 30 March 
2012 he received £57,000 in fees (7 March to 1 April 2011: £4,750).

Remuneration for Senior Managers
As for Executive Directors, it is the Company’s policy that a substantial proportion of remuneration should be performance related in order to 
encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and 
Company performance. Basic salary is targeted at normal commercial rates for comparable roles and is benchmarked on a regular basis. Bonuses 
of up to 100% of salary can be earned on the same basis as the Executive Directors. 
Senior Executives immediately below the Board also benefit from participation in the PSP , with other key senior managers participating in the CSOS.
Share Plans — Summary
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Directors’ interests with those of shareholders, 
the Committee is aware of shareholders’ concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. Therefore, when reviewing 
remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. Halfords intends to comply with 
the ABI guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans. The current 10 year shareholder dilution is 2.60% [2011: 4.31%].

Halfords Company Share Option 
Scheme (“CSOS”)
May 2004 Used to reward employees 
below the Board and it is 
not the current intention to 
grant awards under the 
CSOS to Executive 
Directors (other than in 
exceptional circumstances).
The CSOS is a market value option plan which incentivises 
senior management to grow the share price. Options are 
granted at an exercise price not less than market value at the 
date of grant and are normally subject to performance.  
Currently, vesting of options is subject to an earnings per 
share hurdle.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme May 2004 An all-employee SAYE 
scheme in which all 
Executive Directors are 
eligible to participate.
During the year the Committee considered the principles 
behind the establishment of the SAYE scheme in 2011 and 
concluded that the current scheme remains appropriate. 
Options are granted at an exercise price not less than 80% of 
market value at the date of grant. Options may not normally 
be exercised until the option holder has completed his or her 
savings contract (normally three or five years) from the date 
of commencement of the savings contract. Executive 
Directors may also join the Halfords Sharesave Scheme. 
During the year awards were granted under the SAYE to 
participating eligible employees in the United Kingdom, 
Ireland and Hong Kong.

See Note 1 below.

The PSP targets are summarised in the table below: 
For the core award, 30% of the award vests for achieving median TSR performance compared to the comparator group described below and EPS 
growth of RPI plus 4% per annum. The full core award vests for achieving upper quartile TSR and EPS growth of RPI plus 11% per annum. For the 
award multiplier, the TSR element will only vest if TSR performance is between upper quartile and upper decile. For the EPS element the multiplier 
will only apply if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 11% per annum, with the maximum multiplier only being achieved if EPS growth equals RPI plus 16% 
per annum. For the core award and the multiplier straight-line vesting applies between each of these points.

Governance 88
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
TSR and EPS performance will be assessed on an independent basis. 
However, to ensure that the PSP continues to support sustainable 
performance, the multiplier for one measure will only be applied if 
performance is at least at the threshold level for the other measure. For 
example, if TSR was above upper quartile the TSR multiplier would 
generally only apply if EPS growth exceeded RPI plus 4% per annum, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determined otherwise.
The companies included in the TSR comparator group for awards 
granted in 2011 are as follows:
The comparator group for awards pre-2010 (which did not include the 
performance multiplier) was similar to the above group but did not 
include food retailers.
The Committee believes that the operation of the PSP is appropriate to 
continue to effectively incentivise and retain key Executives in a way 
which is aligned with our long-term strategy and the creation of 
shareholder value. The Committee recognises that a plan that 
incentivises higher levels of performance involves a larger degree of 
inherent risk; however, the Committee believes that the Board 
decision-making process provides appropriate safeguards to ensure 
that this structure does not incentivise Executives to take an 
inappropriate level of risk.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee also recommended the 
reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares. This is in line with 
best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration.
In 2008 and 2009 (the first two years of his tenure) the Chief Executive 
received awards under the PSP of 200% of base salary; these awards 
are not subject to the performance multiplier. On the vesting of any of 
this award David Wild was encouraged to retain shares, so enabling 
him to achieve the shareholding guidelines (see table on page 85). 
Following his appointment, Andrew Findlay was granted a PSP award 
of 225% of salary in August 2011. This award was subject to the 
performance conditions outlined on pages 84 and 87. If exceptional 
performance is delivered then up to 1.5× this award may vest. The 
Committee considered that it was appropriate to grant this enhanced 
award to Mr Findlay to compensate him for awards he forfeited on 
leaving his previous employment.
Details of awards granted to Executive Directors are set out on  
page 91.

Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The Board as a whole, following a recommendation by the Chief 
Executive, determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors. 
Term
None of the Non-Executive Directors has an employment contract with 
the Company. However, each has entered into a letter of appointment 
with the Company confirming their appointment for a period of three 
years, unless terminated by either party giving the other not less than 
three months’ notice or by the Company on payment of fees in lieu of 
notice.
Continuation
The appointments are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 
1985 and 2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association and in 
particular the need for periodic re-election. Continuation of an individual 
Non-Executive Director’s appointment is also contingent on that 
Non-Executive Director’s satisfactory performance, which is evaluated 
annually.
Compensation for Termination
No compensation would be payable to a Non-Executive Director if his 
or her engagement were terminated as a result of him or her retiring by 
rotation at an Annual General Meeting, not being elected or re-elected 
at an Annual General Meeting or otherwise ceasing to hold office under 
the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company. 
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early 
termination of the appointment of a Non-Executive Director.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ■ for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 ■ for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements; and
 ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
a) the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and 
the Group; and
b) the business review includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced.

Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set

been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 ■ the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which We are Required to Report by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
 ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 ■ the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 ■ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ■ the Directors’ statement, set out on page 73, in relation to going 
concern;
 ■ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 74 to 
81 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
 ■ certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration.

Accounting Policies
General Information
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the period 
ended 30 March 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
Statement of Compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“adopted IFRSs”).
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going concern 
basis for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report on page 73, and under the historical cost convention, except where adopted IFRSs require an 
alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and measurement”) and 
share-based payments (IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”). 
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements for the 
current period cover the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011. 
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiary Undertakings 
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated from the 
date that the Group no longer has control. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. EBTs are accounted for under UITF 32 and are consolidated on the basis that the parent has control, 
thus the assets and liabilities of the EBT are included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a 
deduction from equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. All subsidiary undertakings have 
been consolidated.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 30 March 2012 are detailed in note 4 to the Company balance sheet on page 131.
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred. 
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business 
Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of these elements exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
Revenue Recognition
Retail 
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions and 
returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery and on services 
when those services have been rendered.
Car Servicing
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered. 
Promotions and Returns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail price. 
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold during 
the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year-end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced by the value of sales 
returns provided for during the year. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Finance Income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest rate 
method.
Non-recurring Items
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management consider that these items 
should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Earnings Per Share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for 
own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options 
granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation of this 
alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency, and are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial statements of 
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and Balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation 
differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash 
flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate at the date 
that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising 
on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Employee Benefits
i) Pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor independently. 
The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of contributions to the scheme are 
charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
ii) Share-based Payment Transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and incorporate an assessment of relevant market performance conditions. The amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are 
expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of 
original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6
Financials 104
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an entity when 
it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. In 
the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that will 
not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not 
accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is realised or the deferred 
taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity 
dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Intangible Assets
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment charge is recognised in profit or loss for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when calculating 
goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the 
consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of “Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)”. For these acquisitions transaction costs, other 
than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable will be 
recognised in profit or loss.
ii) Computer Software
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits 
beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Software is amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life.
iii) Acquired Intangible Assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, provided they are 
identifiable and capable of reliable measurement. 
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the 
date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
 ■ Brand names and trademarks 2 years;
 ■ Customer relationships 5 to 15 years; and
 ■ Favourable leases over the term of the lease.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.

halfords.annualreport2012.com
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful economic 
lives as follows:
 ■ Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
 ■ Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
 ■ Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
 ■ Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
 ■ Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
 ■ Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
Impairment of Assets
For tangible and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For 
the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating 
units). For goodwill, an annual impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date.
Leases
Finance Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the rental is charged to 
the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. 
Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit of incentives from 
lessors are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Landlord Surrender Payments
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group, that do not represent an 
incentive for future rental commitments, are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further substantial 
acts to complete.
Sublease Income
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised by 
offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognised as finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 17.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Accounting Policies continued
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses. 
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in addition to 
the definition above.
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) Bank borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange contracts. 
ii) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. Own shares consist of shares held 
within an employee benefit trust and are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale 
of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on transactions in own shares held.
iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of 
overseas sourced products. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group uses the derivatives to 
hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The effective 
element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and recognised in the Group Income Statement 
in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. Any element of the remeasurement of the 
derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance 
income or costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than  
12 months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
the estimates. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 30 March 2012
Online version 
halfords.annualreport2012.com
The judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below:
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which includes 
management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill and other 
assets are explained in note 10.
Allowances Against the Carrying Value of Inventories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future demand 
requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to the timing and success 
of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall allowances.
Provisions
Provisions include residual amounts for the Central Europe exit, property related liabilities and other trading liabilities. These provisions are estimates 
of the actual costs of future cash flows and are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be 
accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Assumptions made are detailed in note 17. 
Intangible Asset Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38, 
the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual intangible assets. The 
useful lives of intangibles assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates applicable. 
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 108 to 127.
Adoption of New and Revised Standards
The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they are mandatory for the 
year ended 30 March 2012 but either have no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or are not applicable.
 ■ IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures (revised 2009)” — makes changes to the definition of a related party. This amendment has not had a material 
impact on the Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements.
 ■ IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments” — deals with how entities should measure equity instruments issued in a 
debt for equity swap. This amendment has not had a material impact on the Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements.
 ■ IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements (Amended)” — IAS 1 is amended to clarify that a reconciliation from opening to closing balances is 
required to be presented in the statement of changes in equity for each component of equity. IAS 1 is also amended to allow the analysis of the 
individual OCI line items by component of equity to be presented in the notes. Previously, such analysis could only be presented in the SOCIE.
 ■ IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures (Amended)” — IFRS 7 is amended to add an explicit statement that the interaction between qualitative 
and quantitative disclosures better enables users to evaluate an entity’s exposure to risks from financial instruments.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are mandatory for the year 
ended 30 March 2012, have been adopted in the year. None of these amendments have had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted
 ■ The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements. “IFRS 7 (Amendments)” — The amendments require additional disclosures about transfers of 
financial assets. The amendments also require additional disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around 
the end of a reporting period. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

1. Operating Segments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units offer 
different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies. 
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise Car Servicing and repair performed from autocentres. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believes 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements. 
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

(a) 
  
A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in the prior year. This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential 
liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties 
leased by Payless DIY (subsequently part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward White 
Group. Focus DIY entered into administration in May 2011. In the current year a change in approach to settling the Group’s guarantor 
obligations has resulted in a release of £1.9m of the original amounts provided.
(b)  This represents a tax charge at 26% on all current year non-recurring items plus a prior year tax charge of £0.4m arising from the 
non-deductibility of two payments made to landlords to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under those leases. The prior period 
represents a tax credit at 28% on these non-recurring costs.

The 2011 Budget on 23 March 2011 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 23% over a period of four years from 2011. The 
first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% (effective from 1 April 2011) was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, and 
further reductions to 26% (effective from 1 April 2011) and 25% (effective from 1 April 2012) were substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and 
5 July 2011 respectively.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced a further reduction in the corporation tax rate to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012). This was 
substantively enacted on 26 March 2012. Further rate reductions in future periods will reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 22% over the next  
two years. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 30 March 2012 has been calculated based on future rate of 24% which was substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the 
Company’s future current tax charge and reduce the Company’s deferred tax liability accordingly.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 26% (2011: 28%). 
The effective tax rate of 27.3% (2011: 27.6%) differs from the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure, tax charges arising from the settlement of obligations associated with the Focus lease provision and other 
permanent differences arising in the period.
The tax charge of £25.7m (2011: £32.6m) includes a charge of £0.9m (2011: credit of £2.1m) in respect of tax on non-recurring items, as 
detailed in note 5.
An Income tax charge of £0.3m (2011: £1.1m credit) on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts 
outstanding at the year-end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 30 March 2012 of 14.00p per share (2011: 
14.00p per share), which will absorb an estimated £27.9m (2011: £28.5m) of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 3 August 2012 to 
shareholders who are on the register of members on 6 July 2012.
9. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 20) and 
has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it better 
reflects the Group’s underlying performance.

Included in Computer software are internally generated assets of £0.3m (2011: £0.3m). Product rights of £0.2m, which are fully amortised, have 
been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of £253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the 
Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-
generating units. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the Car 
Servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of 
cash-generating units being Car Servicing. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to (a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships, (b) the workforce, (c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets and (d) operating synergies. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, 
being Retail and Car Servicing. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all 
available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment. 
The key assumptions, to which the group of cash-generating units’ recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use of 
goodwill held at 30 March 2012 and 1 April 2011 are as follows:
Retail Car Servicing
Notes 2012 2011 2012 2011
Discount rate 1 10.5% 14.2% 10.8% 14.9%
Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
Notes: 
1. Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections. 
2. Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a plus or minus 1% change in the discount 
rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
Based on historic default rates and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings, the Group believes that no impairment 
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 include all trade receivables and £2.7m (2011: £2.4m) of other receivables. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

The Central Europe exit provision represents the costs associated with the closure of all seven stores trading in the Czech Republic and Poland. 
Property related provisions consist of costs associated with vacant property, rent reviews and dilapidations. Also included are prior period 
non-recurring costs (note 5) relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into administration 
subsequent to the period end. In the current year a change in approach to settling the Group’s guarantor obligations has resulted in a release of 
£1.9m of the original amounts provided.
Other trading provisions comprises a sales returns provision and a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone cycle 
concept, including closure of stores where necessary.
Restructuring Provisions
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.
Key assumptions within the Central Europe exit provision were the timing of the exit from leases that were contracted into, the timing of 
redundancies and the extent of dilapidation costs. The sensitivities to these assumptions were not considered material due to the time value of 
money being minimal over the period over which the costs would be incurred.
Property Related Provisions
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost 
of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises 
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and the time value 
of money has been incorporated in to the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for loss-making stores and autocentres which management does not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there is expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the 
Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the rent 
payable after the review. 
Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material 
to the provision in total.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties 
arising from events such as lease renewals or terminations.
Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material to the provision in total.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

19.  Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures
Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
 ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
 ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
 ■ Invest surplus cash; 
 ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
 ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director. The Finance Director controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor 
the performance of the Treasury function. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a 
competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are contained in 
note 15.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Market Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The Group 
mitigates this risk by negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply 
chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market. 
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to change 
by plus or minus 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease/increase of £1.2m (2011: £0.9m). 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Online version 
halfords.annualreport2012.com
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not 
present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Between June 2006 and September 2009, the Group managed its capital 
structure partly through a share buyback scheme. A separate share buyback scheme was initiated on 7 April 2011.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios are:
 ■ consolidated EBITDAR (earnings before non-recurring items, finance expense, depreciation, amortisation and rental costs) to consolidated 
total net interest payable plus rent; and
 ■ consolidated total net borrowings to consolidated EBITDA.
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair value of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and  
finance lease obligations, short-term  
deposits and borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these 
instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations. 
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the 
balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at 
intervals of less than one year. 
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright 
contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
 ■ Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 ■ Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 ■ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
2012

Cash and cash equivalents 13.4 2.7

deferred income. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £28.6m (2011: £15.5m) as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between  
75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is performed through the use of  
foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:
30 March 2012 1 April 2011

A strengthening/weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 30 March 2012 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit 
or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be 
reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. 
There are no material movements in the income statement. The movements in equity relate to the fair value movements on the Group’s forward 
contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases. 
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of 
such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there are sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be £270m of the £300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of 
debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A’ credit rating at the time of refinancing 
(November 2010). Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group. At the year-end four of the banks 
within this group maintained a credit rating of ‘A’ or above. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury Report, which is forwarded to 
the Treasury Committee and the Group Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Group Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit 
facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which 
would lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the club bank agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 11. All trade and other payables are due within one year.

Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to 
hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
21.  Share-based Payments
The Group has three share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes: 
1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal 
to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three-year performance 
condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share (“EPS”) over the period is 
not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3.5% per year. In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess 
can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the average 
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. 
2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes 
his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of 
death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the 
Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. 
3. Performance Share Plan
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 
general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted.  20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 30 March 2012

halfords.annualreport2012.com
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model uses the 
Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than 
generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo 
model. 
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in 
proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2009 and 2010 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends 
of 14p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £3.03 per share. Shares awarded in 2009, 2010 and 2011 under the PSP earned 
interim dividends of 8p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £3.19 per share.

Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements for 
the current period cover the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011. The accounts are 
prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards requires an alternative treatment in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. The principal variation to the historical 
cost convention relates to share-based payments. 
A consolidated cash flow statement has been included in the Halfords Group plc consolidated accounts. The Company has therefore taken 
advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised 1996) “Cash flow statements” not to produce a cash flow statement. 
The Company has taken the available exemption not to provide disclosures required by FRS 29 “Financial instruments: disclosures”.
EBTs are accounted for under UITF 32 and are consolidated on the basis that the parent has control, thus the assets and liabilities of the EBT are 
included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a deduction from equity.
Share-based Payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 44 “FRS 20 (IFRS 2) – Group and treasury share transactions” the fair value of the employee services received 
under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertakings’ financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. The 
Company has recognised the fair value of the share-based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is 
based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the remaining vesting 
period. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion of the 
Directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid. 20989.04   13-06-2012   Proof 6

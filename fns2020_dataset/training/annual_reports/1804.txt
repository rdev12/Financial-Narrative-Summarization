The Board is pleased to report good progress in the business.
A	key	focus	for	the	year	was	to	use	Bango	technology	to	introduce	
simpler, lower priced Bango services to improve sales and 
marketing	efficiency .	The	results	have	been	encouraging.	Revenue	
grew	32%	compared	with	the	previous	year	to	£13.76m.	Margin	
earned	on	monthly	fees	grew	36.5%.	Over	the	same	period,	
these changes enabled us to reduce sales and marketing costs by 
approximately	50%.
 
W e	are	now	operating	close	to	break-even	on	a	monthly	basis	and	
with growing sales from a stable cost base and with a strong sales 
pipeline. We are introducing further products and services that 
can be sold using the existing sales and marketing organization.
Today’s mobile phones include web browsers and internet 
connectivity	as	standard.	Millions	of	people	now	browse	for	
information and use search engines on their mobile phones. They 
view advertising and buy content from mobile websites. Those 
website owners want to sell services and content such as music, 
videos, games and alerts globally and incur the lowest possible 
cost of sale. Bango meets those requirements.
When users click to “buy”, the transaction is routed by Bango 
and payment made via the user’s mobile phone bill or alternate 
method. Bango makes this transaction straightforward because our 
software not only connects to the world’s leading mobile network 
operators and other billing providers, but uniquely handles the 
necessary	end	user	screen	flows,	currency	conversions,	taxes	and	
regulatory requirements without extra complexity for the content 
provider.
 
Over	9,000	new	content	owners	signed	up	to	use	the	Bango	
system	during	the	year ,	a	more	than	fivefold	increase	in	sign-up	
rate	over	the	year .	The	value	of	the	Bango	Service	is	demonstrated	
by	the	fact	that	larger	organizations	such	as	Gameloft,	WWE,	EA	
Games,	MTV	and	Paramount	Studios	are	users	of	our	service,	
alongside thousands of much smaller companies and even 
individuals.
Customers	are	staying	with	the	Bango	Service,	moving	from	free	
trials and low end services through our portfolio of services as they 
expand their business and their needs change.
T ransaction	volumes	are	growing.	Overall	user -spend	through	
Bango	grew	by	26%.	Outside	the	UK,	which	is	our	longest	
established	market,	user	payment	activity	grew	faster	at	59%	year	
on year.
 
The traditional way to supply, market and monetize mobile content 
was	through	SMS	and	MMS.	The	move	to	an	internet	model	brings	
benefits	to	the	consumer	in	terms	of	usability	and	transparency ,	
and to the content provider in terms of marketing opportunities. 
For this reason the mobile operators are now starting to actively 
push	the	migration	from	SMS	to	the	mobile	web.	Bango	stands	to	
benefit	from	this	move	from	SMS	to	the	web	due	to	our	leading	
position in that market and the ease of moving to the mobile web 
with our product line.
Bango is a well positioned business that enjoys increasing 
opportunities for growth in revenue in this rapidly expanding 
market. We look forward to providing a further progress update at 
the half year.

Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement 06
C E O ’ s 	 s t a t e m e n t	
I	am	pleased	to	report	that	in	the	year	ended	March	2008	
we	made	significant	progress	towards	ensuring	that	Bango	is	
financially	self-sufficient	and	able	to	take	full	advantage	of	the	
growth in the mobile web. It has been a year of focusing our 
people	and	technology	to	become	more	efficient	and	operating	
where market demand is growing fastest, and on getting the 
business	to	profitability	and	cash-flow	positive.
Improving sales productivity 
In	my	last	Annual	Report	I	stated	that	we	would	strengthen	our	
self-serve	product	proposition	to	enable	us	to	drive	down	our	
customer acquisition costs and grow sales and margins without 
increasing expenditure.
 
The results have been encouraging. Compared to the previous 
financial	year ,	we	are	pleased	to	report	revenue	growth	of	32%	to	
£13.76m.	Margin	earned	on	monthly	fees	grew	36.5%.	Over	the	
same	period,	our	new	product	line-up	enabled	us	to	reduce	sales	
and	marketing	costs	by	approximately	50%.	
Product	releases	during	the	year	included	a	range	of	simplified,	
lower cost products including Bango Payment World, Bango 
Advantage	UK,	Bango	Payment	UK/USA/España	and	the	Bango	
Button.	In	particular ,	Bango	Payment	UK	enabled	businesses	
anywhere in the world to launch commercial Payforit services 
within	minutes,	for	below	£300	per	month.	
A	new	web	sales	team	was	established	to	drive	customers	through	
a	“self-serve”	sign-up	at	Bango.com,	worldwide,	at	significantly	
lower	cost	than	previous	sales	motions.	Our	regional	teams	in	
Germany ,	Spain,	US	and	UK	were	replaced	by	a	small	worldwide	
corporate sales team selling to accounts anywhere in the world 
that have more complex requirements.
 
Bango’s technology and the mobile web have global reach, but 
take-up	rates	and	content	provider	activity	vary	by	country	–	
depending on the emergence rates of the mobile web in those 
countries. During the year, the emergence of mobile search and 
mobile advertising from Google, Yahoo! and others has increased 
the	opportunities	for	cross-border	marketing	by	content	providers.	
This enabled us to centralize our marketing to these content 
providers	and	deliver	a	consistent	message	worldwide.	Localized	
marketing	in	the	UK,	Spain	and	Germany	was	centralized	into	a	
multilingual team with one common message worldwide and a 
common sales motion irrespective of the location of the business.
 
Marketing	investment	shifted	from	“face	to	face”	activity	at	
events and seminars to web based marketing, webinars, referral 
programs, blogging and search engine optimization. These work 
worldwide and make us more easily contactable by anybody 
wanting to reach mobile phone users through the mobile web, 
where	our	technology ,	especially	for	identification,	payment	
collection or analytics, is of value.
Growing transaction volumes 
Content	access	fees	grew	32%	to	£11.72m.	As	indicated	in	
our interims, the margin earned on payment transactions is now 
around	9%,	reflecting	our	desire	to	keep	our	transaction	fees	down	
to	the	1-2%	level	for	the	largest	content	providers	and	our	ability	
to	charge	up	to	30%	for	very	low	volume	customers.	
Bango	Analytics	now	also	drives	“paid	for”	transactions,	generally	
paid for “per thousand”, to align with the way website owners 
buy	advertising	that	they	measure	with	analytics.	Bango	Analytics	
transactions and sales started in the last six weeks of the year, but 
revenue	contribution	from	these	was	not	significant.		
Driving towards profitability and cash generation 
After	a	year	of	significant	marketing	and	development	investment	
last	year ,	our	plan	for	the	year	was	to	drive	towards	profitability	
and	cash	generation.	As	a	result	of	our	cost	reductions	and	
increasing	sales,	we	reduced	losses	(at	EBITDA	level)	down	from	a	
£240K/month	average	in	the	last	financial	year	to	£144K/month	
average	in	our	first	half	and	then	to	£93K/month	average	in	the	
second	half,	with	continued	progress	towards	break-even	during	
the	final	months	of	the	half	year .
While	increasing	sales	will	drive	profitability ,	we	believe	there	
are	still	opportunities	to	improve	our	efficiency ,	to	enable	us	to	
capitalize	on	market	growth	from	a	position	of	financial	strength.	
Bango currently has no borrowings and the Directors believe the 
Company	has	sufficient	resources	to	meet	its	current	financial	
needs. However, the Directors further believe that additional 
capital	could	be	deployed	to	beneficial	effect.	For	example,	Bango	
has recently accelerated the timing of cash payments to some 
content	providers,	for	a	fee,	to	enable	faster	re-investment	by	
them in search engine marketing with Google, Yahoo! or others. 
Consequently a number of initiatives are under active evaluation 
and further announcements will be made as appropriate.
Product development 
In	February	2008,	we	launched	Bango	Analytics,	a	new	product	
that enables businesses of all sizes to get a better return from 
their investment in marketing and advertising campaigns on the 
mobile	web.	Our	unique	technology	captures	valuable	data	about	
mobile users responding to campaigns and presents it in an easy 
to	use	form	to	enable	informed	decision-making.	
It is a widely held view within advertising agencies that the 
inability to measure the effectiveness of mobile marketing is 
holding	back	investment.	Bango	Analytics	is	the	first	product	
available to meet this need. We already have a number of case 
studies at www.bango.com. 
Gartner	(IT)	forecasts	the	mobile	advertising	market	to	grow	
to	£5.5	billion	in	global	revenue	in	2011,	up	from	less	than	
£500m	a	year	in	2007.	T ools	such	as	Bango	Analytics	which	can	
improve the return on this investment should be able to attract a 
significant	part	of	this	expenditure.	
Being	first	to	market,	exploiting	our	8	years	of	technology	
development and with an established initial customer base, and 
low costs of sale, Bango is well positioned to capitalize on this 
growth. We have packaged our unique technology for a new set 
of	customers	–	those	that	use	the	mobile	web	for	marketing	or	
customer engagement rather than for selling digital content.
 
CEO’ s	statement 07
We continued development of our Payment products and the 
evolution	of	our	integration	and	Management	tools	to	improve	
usability and effectiveness. We also launched a number of product 
initiatives to reduce barriers to using the mobile web and Bango 
technologies, and to attract prospects to sign up at the  
www .bango.com	website.	These	included	W AP .com,	Bango	Button,	
Bango2Go,	check.wap.com	and	Bango	Optimized.	The	number	
of customers converting from free trials to paid for products has 
shown that this process is working. 
System	availability	was	excellent	during	the	year	–	with	less	than	
two	hours	lost	in	total	during	the	year	(99.98%	availability).	W ith	
transaction volumes constantly increasing, scalability at low cost 
and	without	service	outage	is	vital.	Our	R&D	team	has	steadily	
increased the capacity of the Bango system to stay ahead of 
demand	without	significant	capital	expenditure.
 
During	the	year ,	third	party	action	caused	us	to	lose	A T&T	USA	
billing	for	11	weeks	and	several	weeks	US	credit	card	processing.	
These outages took considerable time and energy to rectify, but 
have resulted in better processes and relationships going forward. 
Financial performance 
Revenues	grew	32%	to	£13.76m	(£10.43m	FY07)	and	gross	
profit	grew	12%	to	£2.77m	(£2.46m).	Revenue	from	outside	the	
UK	grew	by	over	57%	to	£3.08m	(£1.96m)	and	accounted	for	
22.4%	(18.7%)	of	total	revenue.
Content provider revenues, mostly recurring monthly fees, grew 
by	28%	during	the	year	to	£1.97m	(£1.5m).	Margin	on	these	
revenues	grew	by	36.5%	to	£1.72m.	(£1.26m	FY07).	Stable	
delivery costs mean that as content provider revenues grow, the 
gross margin improves.
Content	access	fees	grew	by	32%	compared	with	FY07	and	
accounted	for	85.2%	(85.0%)	of	total	revenue	in	the	year	at	
£11.72m	(£8.86m),	delivering	£1.02m	(£1.17m)	of	gross	
margin.	The	change	in	gross	margin	percentage	from	13.2%	
in	FY07	to	8.7%	in	FY08	was	a	result	of	Bango’ s	decision,	as	
reported	in	October	2007,	to	lower	transaction	fees	for	larger	
content provider customers.
 
Revenue	and	margin	from	services	to	mobile	network	operators	
remained at low levels and are not an important part of the 
business.
 
Sales	of	Bango	Analytics	products,	launched	6	weeks	from	year	
end,	did	not	make	a	significant	contribution	to	revenue	in	the	
period under review.
Operating	expenses	(excluding	share	based	payments)	decreased	
by	20%	to	£4.4m	(£5.5m)	as	a	result	of	significant	improvements	
in	sales	and	marketing	efficiencies.
 
The	loss	before	tax	was	£1.83m	(£1.57m	before	share	based	
payments),	improved	by	45%	compared	with	the	loss	of	£3.32m	
(£2.92m	before	shared	based	payments)	in	FY07.
The	cash	outflow	from	operations	was	£0.87m	(£2.82m)	about	
£0.7m	better	than	the	loss	before	tax	and	share	based	payments,	
as	a	result	of	limited	capital	expenditure	(£22k	in	the	year)	and	
stronger management of debtors and creditors.
 
Outlook and strategy for FY2007/8 
We have established an effective and scalable business in an 
early stage market. Growth is continuing and current performance 
indicators are favorable. With largely predictable and stable 
operational	costs,	our	focus	for	the	year	to	March	2009	is	to	
increase the number of customers using our system with a stable 
cost base.
The market continues to develop broadly in the way we envisage. 
The	predictions	made	in	last	year’ s	Annual	Report	have	almost	
all proved accurate, with Bango starting to see the anticipated 
benefits.	A	year	ago,	the	mobile	web	was	seen	by	many	as	a	
novelty. Today it is seen as an important and growing driver of 
consumer usage of mobile devices.
Work with Google during 2007 led to new contracts with large 
content providers and some of these have now started to generate 
early revenues.
Our	new	Bango	Analytics	product,	released	in	February	2008,	is	
first	to	market	and	is	receiving	excellent	reviews.	While	there	was	
little	contribution	from	this	product	in	FYE	March	2008,	we	do	
expect sales from this product in the coming year, through our 
existing sales and marketing organization.
 
Our	goal	is	now	to	deliver	sustained	profitability	and	positive	
cash-flow .	The	significantly	reduced	cost	of	customer	acquisition	
achieved this year, before the market has entered a fast growth 
phase, should enable us to capitalize on market growth from a 
position of strength.
 
On	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	would	like	to	express	my	gratitude	to	
Bango’s partners and employees for their continued support. 
Working with mobile operators, content providers, billing 
companies and other commercial partners and investors, we look 
forward to increasing success in the year ahead.

Products
Businesses worldwide depend on Bango to power their mobile web 
products and services. 
Bango products enable content providers to deliver on two critical 
areas of their mobile business: identifying and tracking people 
as they browse and interact with mobile websites and marketing 
campaigns	(Bango	Analytics);	and	charging	for	content	so	that	
it can be purchased worldwide by customers from their mobile 
phone	(Bango	Payment).		
Bango Analytics
As	more	mainstream	web	brands	deliver	a	mobile	presence,	the	
demand for information on visitors and the ability to place a value 
on the marketing campaigns these brands run becomes “mission 
critical”.	A	number	of	these	mobile	websites	will	also	generate	
revenue by charging third parties for advertising on their sites. 
For them, accurately tracking visitor numbers is fundamental to 
valuing their advertising inventory. For all of these needs Bango

information.

The Group is committed to following the applicable employment 
laws in each territory in which it operates.  The Group is 
committed to fair employment practices including the prohibition 
of all forms of discrimination and attempts as far as possible to 
give equal access and fair treatment to all employees on the basis

Directors’ report 13 
 
Directors’ report 
 
Directors’ responsibility 
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with 
both reports of the auditor set out on pages 16 and 39, is made in 
order to distinguish for shareholders the respective responsibilities 
of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial 
statements. 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. 
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year.  Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and separate parent 
company financial statements under United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).  The financial statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 
 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently. 
 
 Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent. 
 
 State that the Group financial statements comply with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and that the 
parent financial statements are prepared under United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
 
 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and the Group and to enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985.  They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
 
In so far as the Directors are aware: 
 
 There is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company's auditors are unaware. 
 
 The Directors have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. 
 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group's 
website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
 
Auditor 
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor for 
the ensuing year will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985.

Group. 
 
 Review the Group’s internal financial controls and risk 
management systems. 
 
 Make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the 
shareholders for their approval in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor and to approve the

auditor.

external auditor’s findings. 
 
 Review and monitor the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit 
process.

external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
 
 Report to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of 
which it considers that action or improvement is 
required. 
 
 Ensure a formal channel is available for employees and 
other stakeholders to express any complaints in respect 
of financial accounting and reporting. 
 
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function, 
which the Board considers appropriate for a Group of Bango’s size. 
The Committee is scheduled to meet twice each year and at other 
times if necessary. The Audit Committee will review risk 
assessments and the need for an internal audit function on a 
periodic basis. 
 
Internal control procedures 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of these systems. These systems are designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,  
 
 The business plan is updated on a periodic basis to take 
into account the most recent forecasts. On a monthly 
basis, actual results are compared to the latest forecast 
and market expectations and presented to the Board on 
a timely basis. 
 
 Regular reviews by the Board and by the senior 
management team of key performance indicators. 
 
 A limited number of senior management are able to sign 
cheques and authorize payments. Payments are not 
permitted without an approved invoice. 
 
 Reconciliations of key balance sheet accounts are 
performed and independently reviewed by the finance 
team. 
 
 A disaster recovery plan and back-up system is 
documented and in place. 
 
The Board in conjunction with the Audit Committee keeps under 
review the Group’s internal control system on a periodic basis.  
 
Communications with shareholders 
The Board recognizes the importance of regular and effective 
communication with shareholders. The primary forms of 
communication are: 
 
 The annual and interim statutory financial reports and 
associated investor and analyst presentations and 
reports. 
 
 Announcements relating to trading or business updates 
released to the London Stock Exchange. 
 
 The Annual General Meeting provides shareholders with 
an opportunity to meet the Board of Directors and to ask 
questions relating to the business. 
 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
and to provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
 
The key features of the Group’s internal controls are described 
below: 
 
 A clearly defined organizational structure with 
appropriate delegation of authority. 
 
 The approval by the Board of a one year budget, 
including monthly income statements, balance sheets 
and cash flow statements. The budget is prepared in 
conjunction with senior managers to ensure targets are 
feasible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Remuneration Committee report 15 
 
Remuneration Committee report 
 
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman and both 
Non-executive Directors. 
  
The Committee’s main role and responsibilities are as follows: 
 
 To review, and determine on behalf of the Board, the 
specific remuneration and incentive packages for each of 
the Group’s Executive Directors. 
 
 To review, and make recommendations to the Board in 
respect of, the design of remuneration structures and 
levels of pay and other incentives for employees of the 
Group, including share option awards and any 
adjustments to the terms of share ownership and share 
option schemes. 
 
 To be responsible for reporting to the Group’s 
shareholders in relation to remuneration policies 
applicable to the Group’s Executive Directors. 
 
The Committee may invite the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Finance Officer to attend meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on proposals 
relating to the remuneration of the Chief Finance Officer and of 
other senior executives of the Group. The Chief Executive Officer 
is not involved in setting his own remuneration. 
 
The Committee may use remuneration consultants to advise it in 
setting remuneration structures and policies. The Committee is 
exclusively responsible for appointing such consultants and for 
setting their terms of reference. 
 
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed and approved by 
the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group’s 
registered office. 
 
Remuneration policy 
The Group’s policy on remuneration is to provide a package of 
benefits, including salary, performance-related bonuses and share 
options, which reward success and individual contributions to the 
Group’s overall performance appropriately, while avoiding paying 
more than is necessary for this purpose. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account remuneration 
packages of comparable companies when making 
recommendations to the Board. 
 
Performance-related elements of remuneration are designed to 
align the interests of Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders and accordingly are set as a significant proportion of 
total remuneration. 
 
Share options 
The Group considers that active participation in a share option 
plan is an effective means of incentivizing and retaining high 
quality people. Directors and employees are eligible to participate 
in the scheme. Further details of the option plan and outstanding 
options as at 31 March 2008 are given in note 7 to the financial 
statements.

Report of the independent auditor to 
the members of Bango PLC 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Bango PLC for 
the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the principal 
accounting policies, the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and notes 1 to 
22. These Group financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. 
 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Bango PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.  To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
statement of Directors' responsibilities. 
 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you whether in 
our opinion the information given in the Directors' report is 
consistent with the financial statements.  The information given in 
the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented 
in the CEO’s statement that is cross-referenced from the business 
review section of the Directors’ report. 
 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors' 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.  
 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman's 
statement, the CEO's statement, the Directors' report, the 
Corporate Governance statement and the Remuneration 
Committee report.  We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Group financial statements.  Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
financial statements.  It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial 
statements. 
 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 
 The Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 March 
2008 and of its loss for the year then ended. 
 
 The Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
 
 The information given in the Directors' report is 
consistent with the financial statements.

 Notes to the financial statements 21 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
 
1  General information 
Bango PLC (“the Company”) was incorporated on 8 March 2005 
in the United Kingdom. The Company is domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. The address of the registered office of the Company, 
which is also its principal place of business, is given on page 11. 
The Company’s shares are listed on the Alternative Investment 
Market of the London Stock Exchange ("AIM"). 
 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 
(including the comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2007) 
were approved by the Board of Directors on 31 July 2008. 
 
2  Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention. 
 
The Group has prepared its Annual Report in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 1985.  IFRS requires the use of 
certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements 
are disclosed in notes 3.18. 
 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (GBP) 
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out in notes 3.14. 
 
3  Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated. 
 
3.1  Basis of consolidation 
On 9 June 2005 Bango PLC acquired the entire issued share 
capital of Bango.net Limited by way of a share for share exchange.  
As the shareholders were the same before and after this 
transaction, the share for share exchange qualifies as a common 
control transaction and falls outside of the scope of IFRS 3, 
Business Combinations.  
 
No goodwill has been recorded and the difference between the 
parent company's cost of investment and Bango.net Limited's 
share capital and share premium is presented as a merger reserve 
within equity on consolidation.  
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and all entities controlled by it after 
eliminating internal transactions. Control is achieved where the 
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of a Group undertaking so as to obtain economic benefits from its 
activities. Undertakings’ results are adjusted, where appropriate, 
to conform to group accounting policies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2  Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Residual values and useful economic 
lives are assessed annually.  Depreciation is provided to write off 
the cost of all property, plant and equipment to its residual value 
on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic lives, 
which are as follows: 
 
Leasehold improvements  20% straight-line  
Office equipment   20% straight-line 
Computer equipment 33.3% straight-line 
 
3.3  Intangible assets 
Acquired intangible assets are measured initially at historical cost 
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 
economic lives: 
 
Domain names  33.3% straight-line 
 
3.4  Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets for any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
 
3.5  Loans and receivables 
 
a) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank 
deposits available on demand. 
 
b) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and are 
measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.  Any 
change in their value through impairment or reversal of 
impairment is recognized in the income statement. 
 
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. 
The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference 
between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows. 
 
3.6  Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective 
interest rate method. 
 
3.7 Income taxes 
Current income tax liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal 
authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are 
unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to 
the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which 
they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year. All changes to 
current tax assets or liabilities are recognized as a component of 
tax expense in the income statement, except where it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity.   
 
22 Notes to the financial statements 
 
Notes to the financial statements
 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on 
temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements with their respective tax bases. In addition, 
tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income 
tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred 
tax assets. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability unless the related transaction is a business combination 
or affects tax or accounting profit.  Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint 
ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences 
can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will 
not occur in the foreseeable future.  In addition, tax losses 
available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits 
to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.  
 
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax 
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be 
offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to their respective period of realization, provided 
they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. 
 
Deferred tax is recognized as a component of tax expense in the 
income statement, except where it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity. 
 
There is no income tax liability unpaid at the balance sheet date. 
 
3.8  Operating lease agreements 
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of 
the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are 
charged to the income statement net of any incentives received 
from the lessor on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease. 
 
3.9  Revenue recognition 
End users make a prepayment to the Group prior to accessing 
chargeable mobile internet content. 
 
Content access fees are received from end users and are 
recognized as revenue at the time at which end users access 
chargeable mobile internet content. 
 
Where there has been no activity on an end user account for a 
period of 90 days, the balance remaining is released to revenue in 
accordance with the end user terms and conditions, because of 
operating policies of mobile network operators relating to number 
reissue. 
 
Revenue from the sale of licences to content providers and service 
contracts is recognized in the financial statements over the period 
of the contract. 
 
Revenue from services provided to mobile phone operators and 
content providers are recognized in the financial statements over 
the period of the contract. 
 
3.10  Employee benefits 
All accumulating employee-compensated absences that are 
unused at the balance sheet date are recognized as a liability. 
 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an expense in the period to which they relate.   
 
3.11  Share-based payment transactions 
The Group issues equity settled share-based compensation to 
certain employees (including Directors). Equity settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, 
based upon the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually 
vest. These estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of options expected to vest differs from 
previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognized in the current period. No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognized in prior periods. 
 
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. 
 
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, as 
a minimum an expense is recognized as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognized for any increase in 
the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as 
measured by the date of modification. 
 
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it had vested on the due date of the cancellation, and any expense 
not yet recognized for the transaction is recognized immediately. 
However, if a new transaction is substituted for the cancelled 
transaction, and designated as a replacement transaction on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new transactions are 
treated as if they were a modification of the original transaction, 
as described in the previous paragraph. 
 
Share-based payment transactions are shown separately in the 
Consolidated income statement.   
 
3.12  Operating loss 
The operating loss is stated before investment income and finance 
costs. 
 
3.13  Foreign currencies 
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Exchange gains and losses are included in the income 
statement for the period. 
   
 
Notes to the financial statements 23 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
 
3.14  Segment reporting 
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group services or 
operating geography.  The primary segmentation is by type of 
service, with a secondary segmentation by geography.   
 
3.15  Financial instruments/liabilities 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of  
its financial liabilities. 
 
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments 
(including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt 
instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial 
liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the 
balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to 
financial liabilities are included in the income statement. Finance 
costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on 
the outstanding liability. 
 
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any 
terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is 
classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions 
relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity. 
 
3.16 Share capital and reserves 
 
Share Capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued 
by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs. 
 
Share premium 
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the 
fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue. 
 
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve represents the difference between the parent 
company's cost of investment and a subsidiary’s share capital and 
share premium where a group reorganisation qualifies as a 
common control transaction. 
 
Other reserve 
The other reserve represents equity-settled share-based employee 
remuneration until such share options are exercised. 
 
3.17  Research and development  
Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred.  An internally-generated 
intangible asset arising from the Group's development activities is 
recognized only if all of the following conditions are met: 
 
 Completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible 
so that it will be available for use or sale. 
 The Group intends to complete the intangible asset and 
use or sell it. 
 The Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible 
asset. 
 
 The intangible asset will generate probable future 
economic benefits.  Among other things, this requires 
that there is a market for the output from the intangible 
asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be 
used internally, the asset will be used in generating such 
benefits. 
 There are adequate technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and to use or sell 
the intangible asset. 
 The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset 
during its development can be measured reliably. 
 
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortized on a straight-
line basis over their useful economic lives. Where no internally-
generated intangible asset can be recognized, development 
expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it 
is incurred. 
 
3.18  Significant accounting estimates and judgements 
 
Share options 
Share options are granted on a discretionary basis and vest evenly 
over a three year period.  The fair value of options granted is 
determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which 
requires a number of estimates and assumptions.  The significant 
inputs into the model are share price at grant date, exercise price, 
expected option life, expected volatility and the risk free rate.  
Volatility is measured as the standard deviation of expected share 
price returns based on a statistical analysis of competitors’ share 
prices. 
 
Trade receivables 
Trade debtors are stated net of a provision for bad and doubtful 
debts, based on the Group’s best estimate of the likelihood of 
recovery on a specific basis.   
 
Deferred tax 
A deferred tax asset is recognized where the Group considers it 
probable that a tax credit will be received in the future.  This 
specifically applies to tax losses and to outstanding vested share 
options at the balance sheet date. The Group estimates what 
proportion of those outstanding share options are likely to be 
exercised and a related tax credit received in the future.  The 
asset recognized is also dependent on the year end share price. 
 
3.19  Accounting developments 
IFRS 7 (‘Financial Instruments Disclosures’) was issued by the 
IASB in August 2005 for application in accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and has been adopted by 
the European Commission. The new or revised disclosures have 
been adopted by the Group for reporting in 2008.  All disclosures 
relating to financial instruments including all comparative 
information have been updated to reflect the new requirements.  
The first-time adoption of IFRS 7 has not resulted in any prior 
period adjustment of cash flows, net income or balance sheet line 
items.

Notes to the financial statements 
 
Trade and other receivables are usually due within 30-60 days and do not bear any effective interest rate.  All trade receivables are 
subject to credit risk exposure.  However, the Group does not identify specific concentrations of credit risk with regards to trade and 
other receivables as the amounts recognized resemble a large number of receivables from various customers. 
The fair value of these short term financial assets is not individually determined as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of 
fair value.  There is no difference between fair value and book value.

Trade debtors consist of numerous accounts with no significant individual balances.  Provision for impairment has been made where the 
debt is not considered likely to be recoverable, although successful recovery can take over twelve months where a debtor has agreed a

Employee share options 
The Group issues share options to Directors and to employees under either an HM Revenue and Customs approved Enterprise 
Management Incentive (EMI) scheme or an unapproved scheme. Employees resident overseas are eligible to participate in the scheme 
but their options do not qualify as HM Revenue and Customs approved.  
 
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the date of grant. Options vest 
evenly over a period of one to three years following grant date. If share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
 
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

 The weighted average share price at date of exercise of options exercised during the year was 33 pence (2007: 36 pence). 
 
 The fair value of options granted outstanding was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Significant inputs into the model 
include a weighted average share price of 84 pence (2007: 84 pence) at the grant date, the exercise prices shown above, weighted 
average volatility of 71% (2007: 81%), dividend yield of nil, an expected option life of five years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 
4.69% (2007: 4.74%). 
  
 The volatility of the Group's share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of volatilities of share prices of companies in 
the Peer Group on the corresponding dates. The volatility of share price of each company in the Peer Group was calculated as the 
average of standard deviations of daily continuously compounded returns on the Company's stock, calculated over 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years 
back from the date of grant. This method estimates volatility of the companies' share prices over a period commensurate with the 
option's expected life. Furthermore, this method is designed such that it gives proportionately more weight to recent historical returns, 
which are likely to reflect current volatility better due to the argument of volatility persistence.

Basic loss per share are calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year.

------------------------------- ------------------------------- 
Basic and diluted loss per share (6.82) (12.40) 
============== ============== 
 
 (b) Diluted 
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.  
 
At 31 March 2008 options over 2,727,626 (2007: 2,456,638) ordinary shares were outstanding.  Given the loss for the year these 
options are considered to be anti-dilutive. Such options could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future. 
 
There were no actual or potential share transactions occurring after the balance sheet date that would have significantly changed the 
number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the year if those transactions had occurred before the 
end of the reporting period.

19  Credit risk analysis 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying 
amount of financial assets recognized at the balance sheet 
date, as summarized in note 18. 
 
The Group continuously monitors defaults of customers and 
other counterparties, identified individually or by group, and 
incorporates this information into its credit risk controls.  
Where available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings 
and/or reports on customers and other counterparties are 
obtained and used.  The Group’s policy is to deal only with 
creditworthy counterparties. 
 
The Group’s management considers that all the financial assets 
that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under 
review are of good credit quality including those that are past 
due.  See note 6 for further information on financial assets that 
are past due. 
 
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or 
other credit enhancements. 
 
In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group is not 
exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. 
 
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial 
assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are 
reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.     
 
20  Liquidity risk analysis 
The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring 
cash outflows due in day-to-day business.  Liquidity needs are 
monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-
week basis, as well as on a monthly basis.  Long-term liquidity 
needs are identified on a quarterly basis. 
 
At 31 March 2008 the Group has contractual maturities which 
are summarized in Note 8 Commitments. 
 
21  Market risk analysis 
 
21.1 Interest risk sensitivity  
The Group has no borrowings on which it is subject to interest 
rate risk. 
 
21.2 Foreign currency sensitivity 
Foreign exchange risk is not considered material.  
 
22  Post balance sheet event 
On 31 July 2008 the Company issued an additional 1,345,000 
ordinary shares of 20 pence each.  The gross proceeds of the 
issue were £450,575 and £440,575 after expenses.    
 
Report of the independent auditor to the members of Bango PLC 39 
 
Report of the independent auditor to 
the members of Bango PLC 
 
We have audited the financial statements of Bango PLC for the 
year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the principal 
accounting policies, the balance sheet and notes 1 to 8.  These 
parent company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.  
 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Bango PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of 
Directors' responsibilities. 
 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors' report is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements.  The information given in the Directors’ 
report includes that specific information presented in the CEO’s 
statement that is cross-referred from the business review 
section of the Directors’ report. 
 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors' remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent 
company financial statements.  This other information 
comprises only the Chairman's statement, the CEO's statement, 
the Directors' report, the Corporate governance statement and 
the Remuneration Committee report.  We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information. 
 
 
 
 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in 
the preparation of the parent company financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed. 
 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error.  In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the parent company financial statements. 
 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 
 The parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
company's affairs as at 31 March 2008. 
 
 The financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
 
 The information given in the Directors' report is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements.

standards and law. 
 
The principal accounting policies are summarized below. They 
have all been applied consistently throughout the year. 
 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for 
impairment. 
 
Share based payments 
The Company issues equity settled share-based compensation 
to certain employees (including Directors). Equity settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in 
the book value of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries, 
based upon the Company’s estimate of the shares that will 
eventually vest. These estimates are subsequently revised if 
there is any indication that the number of options expected to 
vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognized in the current period. 
No adjustment is made to any expense recognized in prior 
periods. 
 
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the 
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
 
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, 
as a minimum an expense is recognized as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognized for any 
increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the 
modification, as measured by the date of modification. 
 
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it had vested on the due date of the cancellation, and any 
expense not yet recognized for the transaction is recognized 
immediately. However, if a new transaction is substituted for 
the cancelled transaction, and designated as a replacement 
transaction on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and 
new transactions are treated as if they were a modification of 
the original transaction, as described in the previous paragraph.

Cape’s recent 
restructure created four 
distinct geographical 
business units. 04 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Revenues grew 45.2% in 2008 to £622.7 million (2007: 
£428.8 million) with Group operating proﬁ t before other items
(1)
 
growing by 68.0% to £65.0 million (2007: £38.7 million). Group 
operating proﬁ t increased by 46.6% to £52.5 million (2007: 
£35.8 million).
The Group is ﬁ rmly positioned in the downstream energy 
infrastructure sector with some 70% of Cape’s 2008 revenues 
generated from capital and maintenance expenditures by 
customers in the power generation, oil and gas and 
petrochemical industries. Cape’s customers principally comprise 
a diverse set of the world’s largest integrated and independent 
energy companies and major international engineering 
contractors engaged in multi-year projects in the sector. Through 
its Australian acquisitions, Cape now also provides its services to 
the mineral resources sector. Cape’s speciality multi-disciplinary 
services such as the provision of common user access systems, 
insulation, ﬁ re protection, abrasive blasting, refractory, cleaning 
and other essential services are required on an ongoing basis 
throughout the lifecycle of large industrial assets. 
Despite the reported growth, 2008 was a year of consolidation for 
the Group with the completion of the regional structure and the 
repositioning, restructuring and integration of the three Australian 
acquisitions. The Group is now well on the path to having a fully 
integrated industrial services business in Australia providing the 
full range of Cape services.
Debt reduction
The Group’s net debt (excluding Scheme cash) reduced by 
12.5% to £165.5 million in the year (2007: £189.2 million) only 
£0.5 million outside of the guidance range of £160.0 million to 
£165.0 million signalled at the half year. The Group’s net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA
(3)
 of 2.1 times (2007: 4.0 times) 
provides adequate headroom compared with the Group’s 
covenanted level. 
Private equity interest
The Board received approaches from a number of interested 
parties and entered into discussions with a view to generating 
further shareholder value through an offer for the Company. 
The Board concluded that the likelihood of an acceptable offer 
being received in a reasonable timeframe, avoiding a prolonged 
and distracting period of uncertainty, was low. As announced 
on 16 February 2009, all these discussions were therefore 
terminated.
Move to the Main Market
The Company is no longer considering a move to the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange as a short-term objective.
People
Cape continues to invest in the recruitment, development and 
retention of high quality management teams. In 2008, we 
welcomed several new senior executives to the Group all of 
whom bring with them proven track records, technical expertise 
and the depth of specialist knowledge necessary to deliver 
Cape’s increasing range of services across its enlarged 
geographic span. 
This has been another milestone year for Cape and 
the fourth consecutive year of signiﬁ cant growth. 
It reﬂ ects a full year contribution from the acquisitions 
in 2007 as well as continued organic growth from 
the underlying business.
Chairman’s statement 05 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
The Group’s investment in ensuring the safety of our people in 
2008 increased signiﬁ cantly with the launch of the Golden Rules 
and CapeSafe programmes throughout the business combined 
with speciﬁ c investment in the acquisitions to bring them into line 
with Cape standards. Cape is committed to providing the safest 
work environment for our people. 
Cape delivered over 41 million man hours in 2008 (2007: 
33 million). On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their continuing dedication and commitment, and 
the Executive Board and regional management teams, under 
whose leadership the business is evolving and again delivering 
a record ﬁ nancial performance.
Board
I replaced David McManus as Chairman at the Company’s 
AGM in June 2008. David remains on the Board of Cape and is 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Richard Bingham 
joined the Board in June 2008 as Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer.
Outlook
With 70% of our revenues from the downstream energy, power 
generation and later cycle production markets our business is 
only partially impacted by lower energy prices. The higher levels 
of activity seen in the second half of 2008 have continued into 
2009. We believe that demand for energy over the medium term 
across our enlarged and now established footprint will present 
good opportunities for further growth.
In this environment the Group’s focus will continue to be on 
optimising the efﬁ ciency of Cape’s bundled services model, 
maximising free cash ﬂ ow generation and continued net debt 
reduction. With scheduled debt repayments for 2009 of 
£15.0 million the Board remains conﬁ dent that the Group’ s 
debt servicing obligations can be more than met from operating 
cash ﬂ ow.
I am conﬁ dent that our strategy will continue to deliver positive 
results in the current market conditions.

A strong ﬁ nancial performance in 2008
Revenues were up 45.2% (24.1% from organic growth) at 
£622.7 million (2007: £428.8 million) with revenues from 
outside the UK now exceeding 50% of total Group revenues. 
Cape is now a recognised international industrial services 
provider with a presence in the large majority of the 
world’s major hydrocarbon processing and power 
generation markets.
Operating proﬁ ts before other items were up 68.0% (39.8% 
from organic growth) at £65.0 million (2007: £38.7 million), 
with the operating margin before other items increasing to 
10.4% (2007: 9.0%).
Progress with Australian acquisitions
Notable progress has been made with the integration, 
restructuring and repositioning of the three Australian 
acquisitions completed towards the end of 2007, into a single 
multi-disciplinary industrial services business trading under 
the Cape brand. We are now bidding and winning major 
contracts under the Cape name and have continued to 
invest in the key areas of health, safety, environment and 
quality, business development and information systems. 
Over the full year the combined revenues of the three 
businesses have been broadly ﬂ at. However margins in 
the second half recovered strongly under Cape’s newly 
appointed Australian management team.
Cape now has a presence in what is recognised as the 
second largest growth market for LNG exports in the 
world behind only Sub-Saharan Africa. The planned and 
announced construction of between nine and eleven new 
LNG liquefaction trains makes Australia a key market for 
Cape. Recent investments in coal seam gas projects by 
ConocoPhillips, BG, Petronas and others provide an excellent 
medium-term opportunity for Cape’s Australian business.
Cash generation and debt reduction
The Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow
(2)
 of £74.7 million (2007: 
£19.4 million) reﬂ ects a strong operating cash conversion
(2) 
of 115.3% (2007: 51.1%). Net cash inﬂ ow from operating 
activities was £48.2 million (2007: £6.9 million). 
At 31 December 2008, Cape had net debt excluding Scheme 
Funds of £165.5 million (2007: £189.2 million) including cash 
balances of £33.3 million (2007: £20.1 million). The Group’s 
balance sheet gearing has reduced to 67.2% (2007: 104.7%) 
and the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA
(3) 
has fallen from 
4.0 times to 2.1 times.
Strategy continues to deliver
With a clear focus on the downstream energy and mineral 
resources infrastructure markets, Cape’s broadened 
geographical and sector spread have provided a platform 
across which to sell both its core and additional services. 
Whilst we have seen low commodity prices impacting on some 
of our customers’ investment decisions, our strategy continues 
to be underpinned by the following key market drivers:
–  increasing levels of maintenance and capital spending 
to maintain, extend the life and decommission an ageing 
energy infrastructure in the UK;
–  an increasing trend on the part of Cape’s major 
customers to outsource non-core services and to 
look for cost effective bundled service proposals. 
These customers increasingly seek to outsource 
multi-disciplinary services for both maintenance and 
capital projects to a smaller number of professional 
suppliers with larger scale operations that can provide 
a single source solution;
–  a strong position in higher growth international markets 
such as the Gulf/Middle East and Far East/Paciﬁ c Rim 
following the Australian acquisitions;
Chief Executive’s review
Cape made signiﬁ cant progress in 2008 building on 
the reorganisation and acquisition activity undertaken 
in 2007. This progress is reﬂ ected in the year on year 
growth in both revenues and operating proﬁ ts.  13 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
 –  a strong reputation in growing market segments such 
as the LNG producing/exporting market where there 
is a long list of projects announced in all Cape’s key 
overseas regions and in particular Australia; and
–  a demand on the part of blue chip clients to work with 
safe suppliers who have a proven track record and 
access to local workforces, with the ability to train their 
employees to exacting standards.
Safety
Cape’s accident frequency rate performance of 0.08 per 
100,000 hours worked has exceeded management’s target 
and is world class within the sector. The primary international 
benchmark measure of safety performance is Lost Time 
Incidents (LTI) per 100,000 hours worked, and this has shown 
a further 20% improvement against the excellent performance 
achieved last year. Once again Cape’s safety record was 
recognised with a number of industry awards in 2008, all of 
which are detailed in the Health, safety and the environment 
report on page 24.
Key Performance Indicators
The Group monitors the performance of the business using a 
range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on a monthly and 
annual basis. These include adjusted Group operating proﬁ t 
margin, return on managed assets, operating cash conversion 
and LTI frequency rate. Deﬁ nitions and analysis of the KPIs 
are shown on page 90.
Outlook
Current activity levels remain high with strong demand for 
our broadening range of essential industrial services. Recent 
contract wins in the UK have reinforced our market leading 
position in the region. In the medium term we expect demand 
in the UK to continue to increase as our clients’ maintenance 
and decommissioning requirements for their ageing assets 
becomes more evident.
Cape’s overseas markets are more project dependent; our 
strategy is to offer services throughout asset lifecycles, 
and I am pleased that year on year revenue from repeat 
maintenance contracts has increased. In the majority of our 
overseas businesses we remain a small player in very large 
markets. Activity levels have remained high into the ﬁ rst 
quarter of this year, particularly in the UK and Gulf/Middle 
East, and again highlight the beneﬁ t of Cape’s downstream 
and production asset focus. We are conﬁ dent that with 
Cape’s ability to offer cost effective bundled solutions, 
throughout asset lifecycles, across our enlarged footprint, 
means that the Company is well positioned to continue to 
deliver positive growth.

OPERATING REVIEW
Cape’s speciality multi-disciplinary services are required on 
an ongoing basis throughout the lifecycle of large industrial 
infrastructure assets. Cape supports the construction of new 
facilities, as well as the maintenance, extension of life and 
decommissioning of existing facilities both onshore and offshore. 
Clients choose Cape for its proven ability to:
–  provide a multi-discipline, ‘bundled services’ solution with 
a single point of contact and management responsibility 
for an increasing array of complementary multi-
disciplinary services;
–  deliver the highest standards of safety performance 
often in harsh industrial environments; and
–  supply and manage large numbers of skilled 
operatives and volumes of equipment for large 
and complex projects.
These services often form a critical part of ongoing 
maintenance of our customers’ facilities. The successful 
execution of recurring maintenance helps Cape’s customers 
avoid unplanned down-time and ultimately optimises the 
efﬁ ciency of their facilities.
 
For project work, Cape is typically commissioned by major 
Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracting 
companies including Chiyoda, Foster Wheeler, KBR, Parsons 
Fluor Daniel and Saipem. The market thus refers to Cape as 
a ‘tier 2’ service provider. Once a build project is completed, 
Cape is well positioned to secure long-term maintenance and 
campaign contracts that follow, typically contracting directly 
with the plant operator as ‘tier 1’ for these essential non-
mechanical and non-electrical maintenance services. 
 
The Group’s operations are organised on a geographical 
basis with four regions:
UK Region
Revenues in the UK increased by 14.4% to £309.0 million 
(2007: £270.1 million) and reﬂ ect Cape’s ability to continue to 
grow market share in a mature competitive environment. The 
business also beneﬁ ted from a full year contribution from the 
environmental services division. 
 
Operating proﬁ ts before other items increased by 25.6% to 
£27.0 million (2007: £21.5 million) with operating margins 
before other items widening to 8.7% (2007: 8.0%).
 
Cape’s UK business has over 4,500 employees and 
expended over 11 million man hours in 2008 (2007: 9.8 
million). With 28 facilities located strategically throughout the 
country and in excess of 38,000 tonnes of access equipment 
Cape has one of the largest stockholdings within the UK. In 
addition, Cape UK applied over 1.2 million metres of insulation 
to our UK clients’ pipe-work systems in 2008.
Cape segments its UK operations into three market facing 
business units:
– onshore industrial services; 
– offshore industrial services; and
– environmental services.
The forward order visibility in the UK is favourable given that 
a typical contract arrangement is of three to seven years 
duration. The forward order book value closed 19% ahead 
of year end 2007 levels and has increased by a further 26% 
since the year end. The UK Region’s forward order value 
is based upon actual committed orders with initial contract 
order values, deﬁ ned by the clients’ maintenance and outage 
programmes. Over 83% of the UK Region’s budgeted 2009 
revenues have been secured. 
Operating and 
ﬁ nancial review 15 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Onshore industrial services
Revenue from onshore industrial services in the UK grew 
14.2% in 2008 to £194.2 million (2007: £170.0 million). Cape 
further consolidated its position as the market leader in 2008 
and currently services in excess of 50 large industrial sites. 
 
Over half of the UK onshore revenue in 2008 was derived 
from the power generation segment (which includes gas, 
nuclear and coal ﬁ red power stations). Cape currently 
provides services at 27 of the UK’s 50 major power stations* 
(2007: 23) and supports over 50% of the UK’s total power 
generation capability (2007: 43%).
 
Cape currently supplies services at EDF’s two coal power 
stations at West Burton and Cottam as well as the recently 
announced new ﬂ eet-wide seven year contract across British 
Energy’s (BE) eight nuclear stations, and also their only coal 
ﬁ red station at Eggborough. 
 
Cape provided services at ﬁ ve of the UK’s 12 oil reﬁ neries 
in 2008 including the largest oil reﬁ nery in the UK, the 
ExxonMobil owned reﬁ nery at Fawley, Southampton where 
it has recently agreed a new seven year contract. 
 
Major projects in 2008 included South Hook LNG, Sabic 
LDPE and BE’s Heysham site. 
Offshore industrial services
Offshore revenues grew by 13.3% in 2008 to £88.6 million 
(2007: £78.2 million) reﬂ ecting additional works at Shell’s 
St Fergus and Mossmorran gas plants and BP’s Schiehallion 
Floating Production, Storage and Ofﬂ oading (FPSO) vessel. 
All offshore revenue is derived from the offshore natural 
resources (oil & gas) market with the vast majority of the 
income generated from statutory maintenance activities.
Cape currently operates on 45 offshore installations plus 
various partly manned and partly unmanned units. Cape’s 
offshore revenues have grown steadily during the past ﬁ ve 
years reﬂ ecting the need to service the industry’s ageing 
North Sea assets.
Environmental services
In 2008 Cape DBI and Endecon generated revenues of 
£26.2 million (2007: £21.9 million) from specialist ‘heavy end’ 
industrial cleaning in both the onshore and offshore markets 
with many common clients such as BP, Chevron, Exxon, 
Dow, Corus and BASF.
 
Heavy end industrial cleaning involves cleaning of 
contaminated tanks, vessels, pipes, drains, heat exchangers 
and surfaces as well as waste handling and site support 
services.
 
Contracts include a 10 year contract with Scottish Power 
Generation Ltd for industrial cleaning and surface preparation 
at the principal power generating stations at Longannet and 
Cockenzie on the River Forth in Scotland.

Gulf/Middle East Region
The region enjoyed another year of strong growth in 2008 
with revenues growing by 69.4% to £112.0 million (2007: 
£66.1 million). Although the region’s performance beneﬁ ted 
from exchange movements, this represents a particularly 
impressive performance coming after the 62.8% revenue 
growth achieved in 2007. Operating proﬁ ts increased by 
86.3% in 2008 to £23.1 million (2007: £12.4 million). 
 
Cape has been operating in the Gulf/Middle East for over 
30 years and now has operations in over 20 locations 
throughout all six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, 
with its strongest presence in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu 
Dhabi. Cape ended the year with 4,800 employees in the 
region (2007: 3,900), and delivered 19 million man hours in the 
year (2007: 13 million). While the region holds an inventory of 
over 37,000 tonnes of access equipment, the major service 
provided continues to be insulation services, including 
refractory lining and ﬁ reprooﬁ ng.
 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi again accounted for 
85% of 2008 revenue. The high level of investment in the 
infrastructure and energy sectors in the Middle East during 
2007 continued into 2008 and has been focused on the 
petrochemicals sectors. We have also seen signiﬁ cant 
investment in Qatar in the LNG sector and expansion of its 
downstream oil and gas reﬁ ning capability.
 
Cape’s strategic decision during 2006 to invest in the region 
continued with capital expenditure of circa £10 million in 2008 
again increasing our access capability in the region. Access 
revenues grew from around 12% of overall revenue in 2007 to 
more than 30% in 2008.
Whilst the vast majority of the region’s revenues are generated 
from the oil and gas/petrochemical sectors, Cape also 
provides services to power/desalination, steel, aluminium, 
chemical and cement plants. Cape provides services at 
50 of the 80 large scale industrial complexes in the region 
requiring signiﬁ cant ongoing maintenance, shutdowns and 
capital programmes.
 
Apart from the refractory market, where Cape is recognised 
as the dominant service provider in the Gulf with over 50% 
market share, the market for Cape’s services is highly 
fragmented with many local small companies offering single 
discipline services. 
 
The region’s order book closed the year 49% up on year end 
2007 levels. Since the year end the region’s order book has 
beneﬁ ted from additional packages on the Kayan project and 
shutdown works in Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Some 85% of the 
region’s budgeted 2009 revenues have now been secured.
CIS, Mediterranean & North Africa Region 
Cape’s revenues in the region, which are largely project driven, 
increased by 15.5% year on year to £54.4 million (2007: £47.1 
million) whilst operating proﬁ ts increased by 20.8% to £5.8 
million (2007: £4.8 million). 
 
With 1,000 employees, the region delivered over 5.2 million 
man hours in 2008 (2007: 6.1 million). The region holds an 
inventory of 4,000 tonnes of access equipment and the major 
services provided are access, coatings and insulation. 
CIS
Revenues from Cape’s operations in the CIS countries 
reached £46.3 million (2007: £42.7 million) and included the 
Sakhalin 2 LNG project and extensive onshore and offshore 
operations in Kazakhstan. The Sakhalin 2 build project was 
completed on time with over 7.5 million man hours executed 
without a Lost Time Incident (LTI). Cape has secured a four 
year maintenance contract at the plant. The proposed third 
train has been postponed until 2010-2011.

User access systems utilised in Saudi Arabia were provided entirely from within the 
Cape Group; the work is guaranteed to Cape’s usual high standards. 17 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
In Western Kazakhstan, we successfully completed extensive 
works at Tengiz with Parsons Fluor Daniel. Substantial awards 
have been secured on the Karabatan project and the initial 
work on the expansion project at Karachaganak.
It is anticipated that Cape’s revenues in the CIS will reduce in 
2009 reﬂ ecting completion of the Sakhalin 2 project but this 
will be offset to a large extent by our business units in the 
Caspian where Cape’s major activities will be in Actau, the 
offshore base for the Kashagan project and at Atyrau, the 
onshore Kashagan base. 
Mediterranean & North Africa
The ﬂ edgling Mediterranean and North Africa operation 
generated revenues of £8.1 million in 2008 (2007: £4.4 million). 
Cape’s activities in 2008 included support services for 
ExxonMobil’s Adriatic LNG project and shutdown projects 
for BG in Tunisia and ELNG in Egypt.
 
Cape has again targeted the oil and gas sector and in 
particular the LNG segment. Africa’s LNG export capacity 
is already more than a quarter of the world total, and this 
is projected to double over the next ﬁ ve years. Cape is 
actively targeting the North African states of Algeria, Egypt 
and Libya where ﬁ ve signiﬁ cant new LNG projects have 
been announced. Cape estimates the potential value of the 
available work on these projects at in excess of £150 million. 
Given the extensive lead times on projects of this scale, we do 
not expect any signiﬁ cant contribution from any major project 
awards in North Africa in 2009. Project deferrals in North 
Africa have also been announced in recent months by BG at 
its Hasdrubal plant in Tunisia and by Sonatrach at its Arzew 
LNG plant in Algeria.
 
Cape’s forward order book in the CIS, Mediterranean & 
North Africa region is currently ahead of year end 2007 
levels with over 60% of 2009 budgeted revenues secured.

Far East/Paciﬁ c Rim Region
Cape generated revenues of £147 .3 million (2007: £45.5 million) 
from its operations in this region in 2008 with an operating 
proﬁ t before other items of £16.1 million (2007: £3.4 million). 
For operational management purposes the region is currently 
segmented into two separately managed geographic territories:
–  Australia, with a head ofﬁ ce based in Perth; and
–  Asia based in Singapore and with operations in 
Thailand, the Philippines, New Caledonia, Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Brunei.
Australia
Revenues in 2008 were £117.6 million (2007: £26.0 million) 
with full year operating proﬁ ts before other items of £12.3 
million (2007: £1.3 million). This result reﬂ ects the full year 
contribution from the three Australian acquisitions:
–  TCC Group, a privately owned blasting, painting and 
coatings contractor based in Western Australia; and
–  Concept Hire and PCH Group, two previously ASX listed 
commercial and industrial scaffold hire businesses with

The integration, restructuring and repositioning of these three 
operations into a single multi-disciplinary industrial services 
business trading under the Cape brand is continuing with 
signiﬁ cant investment in health, safety, environment and 
quality management, extension of service offering, marketing 
and re-branding and information systems. 
Over the full year the underlying Australian revenue growth 
of the three acquired businesses has been broadly ﬂ at. The 
combined revenues of £113.3 million (excluding revenue from 
the discontinued Blackadder business) in 2008 compares 
with their combined full revenues in 2007 of £107.1 million. 
The full year operating margin before other items of the 
acquired businesses of 10.9% (excluding Blackadder) reﬂ ects 
the strong margin recovery in the second half to 13.5% and 
the progress made by Cape’s Australian management team. 
 
Cape has a workforce in Australia of over 1,250 staff trading 
from 19 locations throughout the country including newly 
established facilities at Darwin and Mackay. Cape now 
provides services at over 50 large industrial sites for mineral 
resources clients such as Alcoa, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, 
FMG, Minara Resources and Iluka, major oil and gas clients 
including BP and Woodside Energy as well as the commercial 
construction market. Cape’s operations in Australia have been 
organised into four geographic regions managed from key 
facilities in Perth, Karratha (WA), Melbourne and Brisbane. 
With over 50,000 tonnes, Cape has one of the largest stocks 
of access equipment in Australia. 
Whilst the global recession and fall in commodity prices has 
had a signiﬁ cant impact on the outlook for the Australian 
economy, with project deferrals in the resources sector 
announced in the last six months, we remain conﬁ dent that 
positive growth will be achieved in 2009 as our bundled 
services offering gains momentum.
LNG production represents one of the most important 
growth sectors for Cape. With plans to add over 50 million 
tonnes per year of new LNG export capacity within the next 
ﬁ ve years (Source: Petroleum Economist LNG Data centre), 
Australia is recognised as the second largest growth market 
for LNG export in the world behind only Sub-Saharan Africa. 
The planned construction of between nine and eleven new 
production trains makes Australia a key market for Cape. 
With its acquisition of PCH and TCC, Cape has been involved 
in the construction of all of Australia’s six existing LNG 
production trains including ﬁ ve at the NW Shelf JV, including 
the recently completed ﬁ fth train, as well as the single train 
Darwin LNG plant. 
With the current Pluto LNG project in progress, Woodside 
are expected to announce a ﬁ nal investment decision on a 
second liquefaction train (Pluto 2) expansion early in 2010. 
Similarly, recently conﬁ rmed gas reserves are more than 
sufﬁ cient to support Chevron’s proposed two LNG train 
Wheatstone development and front end engineering and 
design is expected to commence in the second half of 2009.
In addition to the production of LNG from conventional natural 
gas, Australia is ideally placed to produce liqueﬁ ed gas from 
lower quality coal seam methane in Queensland. With ﬁ ve 
proposed projects and substantial recent investments from 
ConocoPhillips, Petronas and BG in local operators Origin, 
Santos and QGC, Queensland is identiﬁ ed as a potential high 
growth market for Cape.

Asia
Revenues in Asia grew by 52.3% in 2008 to £29.7 million (2007: 
£19.5 million) bolstered by the PCH acquisition, with operating 
proﬁ ts increasing by 81.0% to £3.8 million (2007: £2.1 million). 
Cape has a workforce of over 1,700 in Asia and delivered 4.5 
million man hours in 2008 (2007: 3.8 million). Trading from six 
locations, with its strongest presence in Singapore, Thailand, 
the Philippines and New Caledonia, the PCH acquisition 
boosted the Cape inventory of access and formwork 
equipment in Asia by 12,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes.
The oil and gas sector represents the largest source of revenue 
for Cape in Asia, with 50% of 2008 revenues generated from 
services both onshore and offshore. Cape has maintained its 
excellent reputation in Asia having participated in some of its 
largest ﬂ agship projects in 2008 including the following projects 
related to the oil and gas sector:
– ConocoPhillips FPSO Project (Singapore);
– Woodside Pluto LNG Project (Thailand);
–  Shell Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) Project (Singapore); 
and
– CUEL Offshore Fabrication (Thailand). 
Cape’s offshore maintenance projects in the region included 
the Bayu-Udan offshore facilities in the Joint Petroleum 
Development Area (Timore Leste/Australia) and the Shell 
Malampaya Offshore Platform (the Philippines).
 
In the mineral resources sector Cape continues to provide 
services to the Goro Nickel Project (New Caledonia) and the 
FRP Fabrication Project (the Philippines).
 
Once again Cape’s safety record in the region was recognised 
with an award from Esso Thailand for the safest contractor on 
site on the Sup 5 project Esso Sriracha reﬁ nery 2008.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Cape’s adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 
24.5% in 2008 to 30.0 pence (2007: 24.1 pence). Basic 
earnings per share increased by 2.7% to 26.7 pence 
(2007: 26.0 pence).
Operating and free cash ﬂ ow
The Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow
(2)
 of £74.7 million (2007: 
£19.4 million) represents a strong operating cash conversion
(2)
 
of 115.3% (2007: 51.1%). Net cash inﬂ ow from operating 
activities was £48.2 million (2007: £6.9 million). The working 
capital inﬂ ow in the second half of £5.4 million was insufﬁ cient 
to recover the ﬁ rst half outﬂ ow with a full year working capital 
outﬂ ow of £2.9 million (2007: £29.9 million outﬂ ow).
 
Capital expenditure net of disposals in the year (including 
assets acquired on ﬁ nance lease) amounted to £23.5 million 
(2007: £29.9 million). This investment was weighted heavily 
towards the ﬁ rst half and was predominantly Middle East 
focused. With slower growth forecast and the extensive 
amounts of equipment acquired through the Australian 
acquisitions, the capital investment programme 
is expected to be substantially reduced going forward. 
Cape generated free cash ﬂ ow of £26.9 million in the second 
half of 2008 giving rise to full year free cash inﬂ ow 
of £23.7 million (2007: outﬂ ow of £21.7 million).
Capital structure and debt reduction
The Group’s primary sources of liquidity are cash ﬂ ow from 
operations and borrowings under its syndicated banking 
facilities. The Group’s primary uses of cash are debt service 
and capital expenditure.
 
At 31 December 2008, Cape had net debt excluding Scheme 
Funds of £165.5 million (2007: £189.2 million) including cash 
balances of £33.3 million (2007: £20.1 million).
 
Cape entered into a ﬁ ve year syndicated Senior Credit 
Facility totalling £220.0 million on 3 September 2007. 
Borrowings under the facilities are available to fund the 
Group’s working capital requirements, capital expenditures 
and other general corporate purposes and will terminate on 
3 September 2012. Some £20.0 million was repaid during 
2008 and the remaining facilities comprise:
–  a £75.0 million fully amortising term loan with bi-annual 
repayments totalling £15.0 million in 2009 increasing to 
£20.0 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012;
–  a revolving credit facility of £80.0 million with expiry on 
3 September 2012; and
–  an overdraft and ancillary facility of £45.0 million with 
expiry on 3 September 2012.

Of the revolving credit facility some £43.9 million is 
denominated in US and Australian dollars and these foreign 
currency borrowings provide a partial hedge for the Group’s 
net investment in non sterling denominated entities.
 
The Group’s balance sheet gearing has reduced to 67.2% 
(2007: 104.7%) and the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA
(3)
 
has fallen from 4.0 times to 2.1 times.
 
Total equity at 31 December 2008 totalled £246.2 million 
(2007: £180.7 million).
Debt ﬁ nancing costs
The ﬁ nance charge amounted to £18.0 million (2007: £6.2 
million) and included £15.5 million (2007: £5.5 million) of bank 
interest charges. The Group’s effective average interest rate 
in 2008 was 8.1% (2007: 5.3%). 
 
Interest rate risk exposure is managed through a balance of 
ﬁ xed and variable rate funding. At 31 December 2008 the 
Group had ﬁ xed 70.6% of its interest cost on borrowings 
over the following 12 months. 
Exceptionals and impairment
The Group recognised exceptional charges of £0.6 million 
in the second half of 2008 giving rise to a full year charge of 
£4.1 million (2007: £0.3 million). These charges relate to the 
restructuring and integration of the Australian acquisitions 
and relocation of the Group’s head ofﬁ ce from Wakeﬁ eld to 
Stockley Park.
The Group completed a goodwill impairment test based 
on value in use calculations which estimate the recoverable 
amounts of the Group’s Cash Generating Units (CGU). 
The test demonstrated that no impairment was necessary.
Foreign exchange
The Group’s results are impacted by the effect of retranslating 
foreign currency at different average rates from year to year. 
In 2008 the results beneﬁ ted from the strengthening of the US 
dollar and the Australian dollar. The table below sets out the

Pensions
The Group’s main pension arrangements are on a deﬁ ned 
contribution basis. Although closed to new members in 
2001, the Group continues to operate a UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
scheme which had 73 active members and 2,030 deferred or 
pensionable members as at 31 December 2008. The scheme 
had a surplus of £10.1 million (2007: £12.6 million) at the year 
end. However this has been restricted to £nil in accordance 
with IFRIC 14 (2007: restricted to £nil). 
IDC and Scheme costs
Scheme funds reduced by £1.6 million (2007: reduced by 
£1.0 million) to £37 .5 million (2007: £39.1 million). During the year 
a total of £3.4 million (2007: £3.0 million) was paid to asbestos 
related claimants who are primarily former employees of 
Group companies. During the year the Scheme fund received 
interest income of £2.0 million (2007: £2.2 million). 
 
Whilst Cape has a continuing obligation to top up the Scheme 
fund to the extent that the triennial actuarial assessments 
show that there is a shortfall in the Scheme funding 
requirement, the most recent review carried out 
in early 2008 showed that the Scheme was fully funded for 
13 years from 31 December 2007. Consequently there is 
no requirement to top up the Scheme funds at this time.
The net charge to the income statement for industrial 
disease claims was £5.7 million (2007: £1.6 million) and reﬂ ects 
a number of factors including an increase in the standards 
applied following review by the Judicial Standards Board. 
Tax charge and effective tax rate
The tax charge for the year on continuing operations before 
other items was £12.2 million (2007: £8.4 million), with an 
underlying tax rate of 25.3% (2007: 24.9%). The tax charge 
again beneﬁ ted in 2008 from a reduction in deferred tax 
liabilities of £3.3 million (2007: £2.8 million) arising from the 
rebasing of assets following the Australian acquisitions giving 
an effective tax rate for the Group of 15.6% (2007: 16.4%).

The primary international benchmark for safety is the 
measurement of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100,000 hours 
worked and this key indicator has once again reduced 
signiﬁ cantly, by around 20%, from the levels demonstrated 
in 2007. We actively invest in the training of our employees to 
ensure they hold their own safety and the safety of others in 
the highest regard. 
The 2008 LTI performance of 0.08 per 100,000 hours worked 
exceeded management’s target and is world class within the 
sector. All Cape’s staff continue to strive towards our ultimate 
goal of zero incidents or accidents and zero harm to the 
environment.
During 2008 Cape launched several new initiatives designed 
to help the Group continue to improve its health, safety and 
environmental performance. These included:
–  Eight Golden Rules: introduced Group-wide to 
establish concise HSE principles, in order to protect 
the health and safety of our employees and others who 
could be affected by our operations. These rules are 
designed to set Group performance expectations and 
ensure that employees understand their obligations to 
uphold Cape’s safety philosophy.
–  KPIs established: HSE KPIs have been established 
for use across the Group to measure both leading 
and lagging indicators. These have been designed 
to encourage business areas to proactively manage 
performance and direction. Cape’s goal is to be 
demonstrably and reputably the safest company 
within our industry sector.
–   MyOSH: the Group-wide launch of a single internet-
based global HSE reporting and analysis system. This 
system is designed to aid the accurate and expedient 
  reporting of accidents and incidents and enable Cape’s 
health and safety teams to improve working practices 
and procedures.
–  A Health and Safety Conference was held in June as 
part of an initiative to integrate Cape’s newly-acquired 
Australian companies into the Group’s health and safety 
principles. The conference focused on the continuing 
improvement of Cape’s performance and provided 
an opportunity for staff from across Cape locations to 
share best practice.
 
–  Cape operates in over 28 countries 
worldwide. The diverse nature 
of our workforce is one of our great strengths but 
this also provides challenges when communicating 
the Group’s expectations of health, safety and 
environmental performance. We have therefore 
introduced a speciﬁ c safety brand – Capesafe – to 
spearhead Cape’s HSE communications. This ensures 
that all safety information, instruction and training is 
presented under a common theme. Materials are 
reproduced in nine different languages to ensure clear 
and concise communication to all Cape workers.
–  Quality Management System: A new quality 
management system has been developed to set the 
structural framework for Cape’s worldwide operations. 
This follows the successful integration and consolidation 
of one common set of health, safety and environmental 
policies and procedures during 2008. The new system 
will be implemented in 2009.
–  Adoption of SA8000: Social Accountability 
International’s SA8000:2001 standard is perceived as 
the only recognised international standard designed to 
demonstrate appropriate minimum standards of 
Our Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE)
performance made substantial gains across 
our worldwide operations, as measured by a 
range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 
Health, safety and
the environment 10.15am Fawley Reﬁ nery, UK
Safe and 
secure
The Group’s investment in ensuring 
the safety of our people in 2008 
increased signiﬁ cantly with the launch 
of the Golden Rules and CapeSafe 
programmes throughout the business. 
Cape is committed to providing the 
safest work environment for our 
people and seeks to beneﬁ t the 
communities where we operate, 
through work and activities that 
provide local social beneﬁ ts.

Cape’s accident frequency rate

continued
  human rights. All our facilities are audited to ensure 
that they meet this standard as a minimum. This audit 
is particularly important in locations where Cape has 
to provide its own workers with accommodation, such 
as the Middle East and Far East. Employee welfare is 
vital to Cape and supports our goal to be seen as a 
responsible employer. This is a particularly important 
factor in markets where the requirement for staff 
outstrips local supply.
–  Measurement of Carbon Footprint: To support our 
ongoing commitment to reduce environmental impact 
and our ultimate goal of zero environmental harm, we 
have, under the auspices of the Carbon Trust, audited 
our UK facilities to measure Cape’s carbon footprint. 
Although our overall impact has been assessed as 
minimal, a number of initiatives have been established 
to reduce current levels. These initiatives will be 
progressively implemented over the next three years 
under a programme of rolling improvements.
Recent awards and recognition
Cape’s market-leading health, safety and environmental 
performance is demonstrated by several awards and 
certiﬁ cations. 
Cape has been awarded a Health and Safety 5 star Award 
from the British Safety Council (BSC), their highest recognition 
of superior performance. Representative country operations 
in the UK, the Far East and Middle East were selected for 
audit and assessment by the BSC.
Our worldwide operations hold accreditation against a 
number of international standards for health, safety and 
quality, resulting in the award of 23 certiﬁ cates of conformity 
for ISO 9001 (Quality systems), 14001 (Environmental) and 
OSHAS 18001 (Health and Safety). In 2008 our external 
accreditation coverage for ISO 9001 and OSHAS 18001 
was extended to cover our Kazakhstan operations. 
In 2008 Cape actively developed a quality management 
system to encompass the new complement of inspection 
services that we offer. We expect this activity to be fully 
accredited to the appropriate ISO 17020 standard in 2009.
We have received various commendations and awards for our 
performance on a number of contracts including Technip in 
Abu Dhabi and Shell and its partners in Sakhalin.
Training 
Cape has continued to invest in its workforce by providing 
world class training facilities and courses to internationally 
recognised standards. We continually enhance and update 
our capabilities to ensure that we can provide combined 
competent services to our clients. Training recognition within 
the last 12 months includes:
–  International Rope Access Training Association (IRATA) 
approval in the UK;
–  Construction Industry Scaffolders’ Record Scheme 
(CISRS) certiﬁ cation for scaffolders in the Philippines; 
and
–  extensive training and recertiﬁ cation (to CISRS) of 
scaffolding workforce in the UK.
Cape’s expertise in health, safety and technical capabilities 
is also recognised through regular requests to provide 
commercial training packages. Our Philippine operations 
have recently been awarded a prestigious contract to provide 
‘Safety Passport’ training to all personnel working on Shell’s 
facilities in the country. 
In 2009 Cape plans to develop the existing training capacity in 
Australia, extend rope access capabilities to provide certiﬁ ed 
inspection services and expand our existing training portfolio 
within the Philippines.
11am Eggborough, UK
Health and safety excellence is at the heart of our business. The nature of 
the industrial services operating environment requires exacting health and 
safety controls. Potential impact
Exposure to energy industry
Cape’s clients are either in, or are dependent upon, the 
energy and petrochemical sectors. Cape’s earnings therefore 
depend on long-term energy demand particularly oil, gas and 
electricity.
Cyclical downturns could lead to declines in demand for 
Cape’s services.
Competitive environment
Losing certain key customers could have an adverse effect 
on Cape’s revenues, particularly where these customers have 
several contracts with Cape.
In certain markets the Group has an estimated market share 
of 30% or more. In these markets, the Directors believe that 
competition law issues could restrict the Group from making 
material acquisitions.
Contracting risks
The eventual value of contracts may be lower than expected. 
Many of Cape’s contracts are term maintenance contracts 
and do not guarantee revenue levels.
Fixed price contracts expose Cape to potential cost overruns. 
External factors
Operating activities may be affected by factors outside 
our control. These include climatic conditions, industrial 
conditions, technical failures, labour disputes, unusual or 
unexpected geological features, environmental hazards, 
delays to government actions, delays in construction, 
availability of material or parts and shipping, and import 
or customs delays.
Mitigation
Cape is ﬁ rmly positioned in the downstream energy 
infrastructure, power generation and later cycle production 
markets. These markets are less impacted by cyclical downturns 
than upstream, exploration segments.
Cape has a broad customer base and geographic footprint and 
has avoided high cost of production markets such as Canada.
Most contracts cover a multi-year engagement and are for work 
of a long-term nature. Cape therefore has limited exposure to 
ﬂ uctuations in the spot price of any one energy product, or its 
short-term demand.
Cape’s wide range of essential services ensure it can serve 
customers’ needs through the lifecycle of the asset, whether 
related to installation, maintenance or decommissioning.
Cape’s top 20 customers accounted for 45% of Group 
revenues in 2008, with the largest customer accounting for 
9% of Group revenues. Cape has a broad customer base and 
seeks to maintain a balanced customer concentration.
Cape has developed long standing relationships with customers 
based on service quality, reliability, reputation and safety. This 
supports revenue retention and growth through ongoing contract 
awards and renewals.
Cape operates a stringent contract review process with clear 
authority limits governing the acceptance of contracts.
Cape seeks to avoid large ﬁ xed price contracts with the 
majority of its contracts being cost reimburseable or 
scheduled rates.
These external factors are normally likely to affect a speciﬁ c 
location, customer relationship or a single contract. Cape’s 
business is diverse by geography, number of clients, 
range of services and exposure to industries. This portfolio 
diversiﬁ cation reduces Cape’s overall exposure to these risks.
Risk is an unavoidable facet of any business activity. Cape faces 
a number of risks in undertaking its operations around the world. 
Cape has a risk register which is used to identify and review risks 
and assist with the planning of measures to mitigate known risks.
This review of the risks and uncertainties faced by the Group 
is not exhaustive and there may exist risks that have not been 
identiﬁ ed by the Directors. New risks may also emerge and the 
likelihood of known risks occurring and the impact they may have 
upon the Group may change from time to time.
Risks and uncertainties
27 Cape plc Annual Report 2008 Risks and uncertainties
continued
Potential impact
Geopolitical factors
Changes in the political environment in certain regions may 
result in Cape, or its clients, losing control of operations, or 
loss of commercial or legal protections.
Financial risk and controls
Failure to achieve satisfactory returns on investments.
Inadequate ﬁ nancial controls leading to lack of integrity or 
loss of ﬁ nancial data.
Other ﬁ nancial risks including foreign exchange and interest 
rate exposure are fully documented in note 21 to the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Health, Safety, Environment and Quality
A failure to maintain the highest Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE) standards could result in injury to 
our employees or others involved in our operations.
Customers require high levels of performance. Failure to 
deliver HSE excellence could result in a material loss of 
customers and/or damage to Cape’s reputation and 
the environment.
Mitigation
Cape maintains a broad geographic footprint and has sought 
to acquire businesses in safe and politically stable countries.
Cape’s policy is to avoid markets/regions which it assesses 
as high risk.
Risk is mitigated by a strong senior management presence in 
each region and regions operate to strict guidelines set 
by Group. 
Local legal counsel are regularly engaged to ensure 
compliance with local legislation and advise on any potential 
changes in legal or regulatory framework.
Cape carries out detailed assessments and review of 
investments including external legal and ﬁ nancial diligence 
where appropriate.
Cape has recruited high quality and experienced ﬁ nance, 
internal audit, tax and treasury teams based at the Group’s 
head ofﬁ ce in Stockley Park and in the regions.
Cape’s investments in systems and resources with 400 
people in full time HSE roles across the Group, has resulted 
in signiﬁ cant reductions in accidents, working days lost and 
environmental incidents.
Occupational health and safety performance continues to be 
in the upper quartile of comparable companies, with a Lost 
Time Incident (LTI) frequency rate of 0.08 per 100,000 hours 
worked, for the Group as a whole.
Cape introduced Eight Golden Rules in 2008, as concise 
HSE principles, to protect the health, safety and welfare 
of our employees and others who could be affected by 
our operations.
Cape introduced a new safety brand, CapeSafe, to ensure 
that all safety information was presented consistently to 
staff across the world, regardless of their local custom 
or language.
See pages 24 to 26 for further information on Cape’s 
HSE initiatives.
28 Cape plc Annual Report 2008 29 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Potential impact
Risks relating to the Scheme of Arrangement and other 
asbestos-related matters
A number of Cape’s subsidiary companies used asbestos 
in their manufacturing activities until the 1970’s and receive 
claims mainly from former employees who have contracted 
various diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos.
Employee claims were mostly insured from the mid 1970’s 
and fully insured from 1981 onwards.
Asbestos-related unpaid claims are estimated and therefore 
inherently uncertain.
External factors (e.g. legislation changes, new types of claims) 
could result in a requirement for Cape to make an annual 
top-up payment. This could constrain Cape’s ability to fund 
growth in the business.
Senior management and staff
The loss of key senior management or employees, may 
adversely affect Cape’s business.
Cape’s ability to successfully operate and grow the business 
is largely dependent on its ability to attract and retain high 
quality personnel. An inability to attract and retain well-
qualiﬁ ed personnel could materially adversely affect Cape’s 
business, operating results or ﬁ nancial condition. 
Mitigation
A Scheme of Arrangement was implemented in 2006 to 
provide both claimants and Cape and its shareholders greater 
certainty over the funding of future asbestos claims and 
related cash ﬂ ows.
An independent actuary estimates the number and value 
of unpaid and future claims on a triennial basis. In addition, 
Cape closely monitors claims levels, which are currently 
as expected.
Any annual top up payment required is restricted to a 
proportion of Cape’s free cash ﬂ ow.
While the level of future claims is impossible to predict with 
certainty, the inherent uncertainty over actual claims levels 
should decrease over time as further information and data 
is available. 
Cape’s regionalised organisational structure provides 
considerable management autonomy and opportunity for 
senior personnel to develop within the business.
Annual performance appraisals are conducted to assess 
executives’ performance and to discuss career goals and 
succession planning.
Senior executive remuneration is reviewed against market 
data provided by specialist remuneration consultants to 
ensure awards are competitive.
Long-term incentive plans are in place to encourage the 
retention of the key management group.  30 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

Gains made by Directors on Share Options
On 3 April 2008, Martin May exercised options over 400,000 
ordinary shares at an exercise price of 60 pence per share. 
The share price at the date of exercise was 255 pence. Of the 
400,000 shares exercised, 100,000 shares were sold and the 
balance of 300,000 shares are included in the balance above. 
The gains made on exercise were £780,000.
On 3 April 2008, Michael Reynolds, who served as a Director in 
the period 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2008, exercised options 
over 100,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of 60 pence 
per share. The share price at the date of exercise was 255 pence 
and the gains made on exercise were £195,000.
Following his resignation from the Board on 31 May 2008, 
Michael Reynolds exercised options over 100,000 ordinary 
shares at 120 pence per share, and 150,000 ordinary shares 
at 176 pence per share, both under the EIP. The option over 
150,000 ordinary shares exercisable at 269 pence per share 
lapsed. Following his resignation, Michael Reynolds also 
exercised options over 4,131 ordinary shares at 135 pence 
per share under the Sharesave Scheme; the balance of 
7,794 options under this Scheme has lapsed.
The middle market price of the shares on 31 December 2008 
was 50 pence and the range during the 12 months ended 
31 December 2008 was 23 pence to 289 pence.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has provided qualifying third party indemnities 
to Andrew Gillespie, Claire Craigie and Benjamin Whitworth in 
their capacity as ofﬁ cers of two Group companies that were 
put into liquidation on 6 January 2006.
The Company did not provide any qualifying third party 
indemnities to any of its Directors in the year.
Supplier payment policy
The supplier payment policy for Group companies is to agree 
terms and conditions for business transactions with suppliers. 
Payment is then made subject to these terms and conditions 
being met. The Company did not have any amounts owed to 
trade creditors at the end of the year (2007: nil). The Group had 
£43.4 million of trade payables at the end of the year (2007: 
£30.1 million) which represented 60 creditor days (2007: 59).
Treasury policy
The Group’s policy on treasury and ﬁ nancial risk (see note 21) 
is set by the Board and is subject to regular reporting and 
review. The main risks faced by the Group relate to foreign 
currency risk and liquidity risk.
A signiﬁ cant proportion of the Group’s business is conducted 
overseas. The Group is therefore subject to exchange rate 
risk when translating the results and assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries into Sterling. Where signiﬁ cant transactional 
exchange rate risks are identiﬁ ed, then appropriate currency 
contracts are used to hedge these transactions.
The Group’s committed facilities all carry interest rates based 
on LIBOR and therefore the Group is exposed to interest rate 
movements. As at 31 December 2008, 70.6% of the Group 
borrowings were hedged.
Employment policies
The companies in the Group operate within broadly 
prescribed personnel and employment policies. Each 
company develops procedures which are most appropriate 
to the circumstances within which it operates. The Group’s 
training, career development and promotion policies provide 
equal opportunities for all employees.
Employment of disabled persons
It is Group policy to permit, wherever practicable, the 
employment of disabled persons and to provide appropriate 
opportunities for their training, career development and 
promotion. Where employees have become disabled in the 
service of the Group, every effort is made to rehabilitate them 
in their former occupation or in some suitable alternative.
Employee involvement
The Group continues its practice of keeping all employees 
informed on matters affecting them and the Group, so that 
a common awareness amongst all employees is developed 
in relation to the ﬁ nancial and economic factors that affect 
the performance of the Group. Where applicable, the Group 
consults employees or their representatives on a regular basis 
so that the views of employees can be taken into account in 
making decisions that are likely to affect their interests.
Senior management is kept abreast of developments in 
ﬁ nancial, commercial and personnel matters and this enables 
it to ensure that employees at the operational level are kept 
informed. The Group operates pension schemes for the 
beneﬁ t of eligible employees in the UK and overseas. The 
funds of the pension schemes are administered by Trustees 
and they are held separately from Group funds.
In 2006, the Group reintroduced a Save As You Earn scheme 
(the Sharesave Plan) for eligible employees. The Directors 
believe that share ownership among employees encourages 
team effort and will contribute to the ultimate success of 
the Group.
Health and safety
The Group has issued a policy statement on its commitment 
to a safe working environment for all employees. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the implementation of the Group 
policy on health and safety within his area of responsibility. 
During the year, Group operations throughout the UK and the 
rest of the world, were subjected to internal and third party 
audits to monitor compliance with Company procedures and 
statutory requirements. 34 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial 
statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The 
Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the proﬁ t or loss of the 
Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
–  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
–  state that the Group ﬁ nancial statements comply with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and with 
regard to the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements 
that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the ﬁ nancial statements; and
–  prepare the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualiﬁ cations as necessary. 
The Directors conﬁ rm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on page 30, conﬁ rms that, to the best of their knowledge:
–  the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the Group; and
–  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group, together with a description 
of the risks and uncertainties that it faces, set out in 
the Risks and uncertainties review on pages 27 to 29.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Relevant information is deﬁ ned as information needed by 
the Company’s auditors in connection with preparing their 
report. Each Director has taken all the steps (such as making 
enquiries of other Directors and the auditors and any other 
steps required by the Director’s duty to exercise due care, 
skill and diligence) that he ought to have taken in his duty as 
a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Compliance with Combined Code
Cape is committed to achieving high standards of business 
integrity, ethics and professionalism across its worldwide 
operations.
As a company whose shares are traded on AIM, the Company 
is not required to comply with the full requirements of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 
June 2006. However, the Board continues to implement policies 
and procedures designed to comply with the Combined Code 
as far as reasonably practicable and appropriate for a public 
company of its size and complexity.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s Shareholders for 
good governance and the statements set out below describe 
how the principles identiﬁ ed in the Combined Code are applied 
by the Group.
The Board
The Board has responsibility for the overall management and 
performance of the Group and is responsible for formulating, 
reviewing and approving the Company’s long-term objectives, 
budgets and commercial strategy. 
The Company has established properly constituted Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination committees of the Board 
with formally delegated duties and responsibilities. Decisions 
concerning the direction and control of the business are made 
by the Board, and a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally 
reserved for the Board is in place.
At 1 January 2008, the Board comprised an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman (David McManus), two Executive 
Directors (Martin May, Chief Executive, and Michael Reynolds, 
Group Finance Director) and two other Non-Executive Directors 
(David Robins and Sean O’Connor). 
On 31 May 2008 Michael Reynolds resigned from the Board, 
and on 1 June 2008 Richard Bingham was appointed as an 
Executive Director and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. David McManus 
stepped down from the role of Chairman at the conclusion of the 
2008 Annual General Meeting on 1 1 June 2008, remaining as a 
Non-Executive Director, and Sean O’Connor was appointed Non-
Executive Chairman in his place.
An agreed procedure exists for Directors in the furtherance of 
their duties to take independent professional advice. Newly 
appointed Directors are made aware of their responsibilities 
through the Company Secretary. The Company does not make 
any provision for formal training of new Directors although 
a detailed induction process takes place which includes 
discussions with senior managers and familiarisation visits to the 
Company’s operations. 
No individual or group of Directors dominates the Board’s 
decision making. Each of the Non-Executive Directors is 
independent of management and has no cross-directorships 
or other signiﬁ cant links which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of his independent judgement. Collectively, the Non-
Executive Directors bring a valuable range of expertise in assisting 
the Company to achieve its strategic aims. 
All Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the 
ﬁ rst opportunity after their initial appointment to the Board and 
to re-election thereafter at intervals of not more than three years. 
(For biographical details of the Directors please see page 30.)
The Company has a separate Chairman and Chief Executive 
each with their own responsibilities. The Chairman is responsible 
for the effective running of the Board and the Chief Executive is 
ultimately responsible for all operational matters and the ﬁ nancial 
performance of the Company. 
Meetings with Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman holds meetings as required with the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision which includes:
– Group strategy and policy;
– Group corporate and capital structure;
– ﬁ nancial reporting and controls;
– communication with shareholders;
–  Board membership and other senior management 
appointments; and
– material transactions.
Other matters are delegated to Board Committees, individual 
Directors or senior management where appropriate. In addition, 
the Board receives reports and recommendations from time to 
time on any matter which it considers signiﬁ cant to the Group.
Board meetings
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in 
a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties. This includes detailed monthly management accounts and 
an analysis of the Group’s actual performance against budget 
and the previous year.
The Board usually meets formally not fewer than eight times a 
year. Informally, Board members meet more often.

Board committees
The Board delegates certain powers to designated 
committees. The terms of reference for the principal 
Committees can be obtained by contacting the Group 
Company Secretary at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce or 
viewed on the Company’s website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has formal Terms of Reference which are 
approved by the Board. The Audit Committee is responsible 
for exercising the full powers and authority of the Board in 
accounting matters, ﬁ nancial reporting and internal controls. 
Its primary responsibilities are to monitor the quality of internal 
controls and ensure that the ﬁ nancial performance of the 
Company is properly measured and reported on. It receives 
and reviews reports from the Company’s management and 
auditors relating to the interim and annual accounts and the 
accounting and internal control systems in use throughout the 
Company. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year 
and has unrestricted access to the Company’s auditors. 
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors, 
each of whom has ﬁ nancial experience in a large organisation. 
During the year, the Audit Committee comprised David 
Robins (Chairman), and David McManus. At the invitation 
of the Committee, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer, Group Company Secretary, Group Financial 
Controller, Director of Internal Audit and the Company’s 
external auditor may attend meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has formal Terms of Reference 
which are approved by the Board. Its principal responsibility 
is to determine the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive Directors, to 
consider and determine all elements of the remuneration of 
those Directors and to review Board performance. No Director 
takes part in any discussion concerning his own position. The 
Committee also determines and recommends the grant of 
share options under the Company’s Performance Share Plan.
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors 
and, during the year, comprised David McManus (Chairman), 
David Robins and Sean O’Connor. 
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, Group HR Director, Group Company 
Secretary and external advisers may attend meetings.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has formal Terms of Reference 
which are approved by the Board. It is responsible for monitoring 
and formally reviewing the performance, composition, balance 
and expertise of the Board as a whole and making an appraisal 
of the contribution of individual Directors, including a review of 
their time commitment and attendance records. The Committee 
also considers succession planning for the Board and Group 
senior management. When necessary the Committee prepares 
a description of the role to be ﬁ lled and engages external 
consultants to administer a detailed search and the generation 
of a shortlist of suitable candidates. Any recommendations for 
appointments or replacements are brought before the Board 
and in exercising this role, the Directors have regard to the 
recommendations put forward in the Combined Code.
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors 
and, during the year, comprised Sean O’Connor (Chairman), 
David McManus and David Robins. At the invitation of the 
Committee, the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, Group 
HR Director, Group Company Secretary and external advisers 
may attend meetings.
The Nomination Committee met speciﬁ cally during the year 
to consider the appointment of a new Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, 
Richard Bingham and to approve the appointment 
of Sean O’Connor as Chairman.
Relations with shareholders
The Company values the views of all its shareholders and 
recognises their interests in the Company’s strategy and 
performance. The Chief Executive has the responsibility for 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
the Board is fully aware of major shareholders’ views and 
opinions. The Chief Executive, along with the Chairman and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer are available to meet shareholders for 
this purpose.
The Annual and Interim Reports are mailed to all 
shareholders. These reports, together with regular trading 
updates, signiﬁ cant contract wins and health and safety 
achievements are published via the Regulatory Information 
Services and on the Company’s website at capeplc.com. 
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting at which the Chairman and Chief 
Executive give an account of the progress of the business 
over the year and provides an opportunity for shareholders 
to ask any questions they may have. The Board attends this 
meeting and is available to answer questions from those 
shareholders present.  38 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Audit, internal control and risk management
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the 
auditors in connection with the Annual Report and Accounts 
are explained on page 34.
Following the publication of guidance for Directors, Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, 
the Board conﬁ rms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing any signiﬁ cant risks 
faced by the Group. A formal process is now in place and 
is regularly reviewed by the Board in the light of the Turnbull 
Guidance and the subsequent Flint Report. The Directors 
are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such a system can 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives.
The Directors consider proper risk management to be crucial 
to the Group’s ongoing success. They give a high priority 
to ensuring that adequate systems and structures are in 
place to measure, analyse and limit exposure to risk. The 
Directors have established key procedures to ensure that 
internal controls are effective and are commensurate with a 
group of this size. A key control procedure is the day to day 
supervision of the business by the Directors. Other internal 
control procedures and reviews for effectiveness by the Board 
continue to be developed.
The Director of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit 
Committee and will meet regularly with the Audit Committee 
in the absence of management. In addition, a procedure has 
been introduced by which employees may, in conﬁ dence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of 
ﬁ nancial reporting or other matters.
Audit and auditor independence
An additional responsibility of the Audit Committee is to 
keep under review the scope and cost effectiveness of the 
external audit. This includes recommending to the Board 
the appointment of the external auditors and for reviewing 
the scope of the audit, approving the audit fee and, on an 
annual basis, satisfying the Committee that the auditors are 
independent. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are retained to perform audit 
and audit-related work on the Group, the Company and the 
majority of Group companies. 
Deloitte LLP are retained to provide all UK and overseas tax-
related advice. It is now Group policy to keep audit and tax 
advice separate.
The Audit Committee monitors the nature and extent of 
non-audit work undertaken by the auditors. It is satisﬁ ed 
that there are adequate controls in place to ensure auditor 
independence and objectivity. The matter is kept under review 
and is a standing item on the agenda for the Audit Committee 
reports. Periodically, the Audit Committee monitors the 
cost of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors. The Audit 
Committee considers that it is in a position to take action if at any 
time it believes that there is a risk of the auditors’ independence 
being undermined through the award of this work.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year under 
review appears in note 9 on page 55.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Cape plc
We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial statements of Cape plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance 
sheet, the Consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement, the Consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense and the related 
notes. These Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements of Cape plc for the year ended 31 December 2008. 
That report is modiﬁ ed by the inclusion of an emphasis 
of matter.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in 
the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report 
includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Chairman’s 
statement, Chief Executive’s review, Operating and ﬁ nancial 
review, Five year ﬁ nancial summary and Risks and uncertainties 
review cross referred from the Business review and Group 
results section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Director’s 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group 
ﬁ nancial statements. The other information comprises only 
the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Directors 
report and all of the other information listed on the contents 
page. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
–  the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 
December 2008 and of its proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ows for the 
year then ended;
–  the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; 
and
–  the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent 
with the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Emphasis of matter – Contingent liability for industrial 
disease claims
In forming our opinion on the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which is 
not qualiﬁ ed, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures 
made in note 32 to the Group ﬁ nancial statements concerning the 
impact of, and accounting for, potential future claims for industrial 
disease compensation. An independent actuarial estimate of the 
range of certain potential liabilities has been performed. However, 
given the wide range of the estimates and signiﬁ cant degree of 
uncertainty surrounding them, it is not possible for the Directors 
to quantify, with sufﬁ cient reliability, the amount required to settle 
future claims and accordingly claims are generally accounted 
for on the basis of claims lodged or settlements reached and 
outstanding at the balance sheet date. However, if it were possible 
to assess reliably the present value of the amount required to 
settle future claims such that this was provided in the balance 
sheet, there would be a materially adverse effect on the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial position.

Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense
for the year ended 31 December 2008 44 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations as adopted by the European 
Union and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 1985.
The accounts for the Parent Company, Cape plc, have been 
prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. The Company 
accounts are presented in separate ﬁ nancial statements on 
pages 83 to 89. 
Impact of new International Financial Reporting 
Standards – Adopted for 2008
The following interpretations became mandatory for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008: 
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, 
provides guidance on whether share based transactions 
involving treasury shares or involving group entities (for 
example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted 
for as equity-settled or cash-settled share based payment 
transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the parent and 
group companies. This interpretation does not have an 
impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements. The Company’s 
accounting policy for share based compensation arrangements 
is already in compliance with the interpretation. 
The following interpretation became mandatory for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008, but is not 
relevant to the Group’s operations: 
IFRIC 12, ‘Service concession arrangements’.
The following interpretation was early adopted in the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2007, 
and continues to be applied by the Group: 
IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset, 
minimum funding requirements and their interaction’, provides 
guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the 
surplus that can be recognised as an asset. It also explains 
how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory 
or contractual minimum funding requirement. 
Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments 
that are not yet effective and not yet adopted by the Group
The following interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards published by the IASB will become effective for 
future ﬁ nancial reporting periods and have not yet been 
adopted by the Group:
IAS 23 (Revised) ‘Borrowing costs’: Effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The deﬁ nition 
of borrowing costs has been amended so that interest expense 
is calculated using the effective interest method deﬁ ned in 
IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’, 
eliminating the inconsistency between IAS 39 and IAS 23.
IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of ﬁ nancial statements’: Effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
A revised presentation, which requires separate presentation 
of owner and non-owner changes in equity by introducing the 
statement of comprehensive income.
IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business combinations’: Applicable to 
business combinations occurring in accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The revised standard still 
requires the purchase method of accounting to be applied to 
business combinations but will introduce some changes to 
existing accounting treatment. 
IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidation and separate ﬁ nancial 
statements’: Effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2009 and applied retrospectively, with certain 
exceptions. This requires the effects of all transactions with 
non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is 
no change in control. Such transactions will no longer result 
in goodwill or gains and losses. When control is lost, any 
remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value 
and a gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss. 
IFRS 2 (Amendments) ‘Share based payment’: Effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. 
This provides a deﬁ nition of vesting conditions and speciﬁ es 
the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions. 
IAS 32 (Amendments) ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of ﬁ nancial statements – Puttable ﬁ nancial 
instruments and obligations arising on liquidation’: Effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This 
requires entities to classify puttable ﬁ nancial instruments and 
instruments, or components of instruments that impose on the 
entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share 
of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation as equity, 
provided the ﬁ nancial instruments have particular features 
and meet speciﬁ c conditions.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’: Effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The new standard 
replaces IAS 14.
IAS 19 (Amendment) ‘Employee beneﬁ ts’: Effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. 
This amendment makes a number of changes to accounting for 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes, including clariﬁ cation of recognition 
of plan amendments, amendment to the deﬁ nition of return 
on plan assets, distinction between long-term and short-term 
employee beneﬁ ts, and to align the standard with IAS 37 
‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’.
IAS 39 (Amendment) ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’: Effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2009. This amendment makes a number 
of changes to accounting for ﬁ nancial instruments, including 
clariﬁ cation of movements into and out of the fair value 
through proﬁ t and loss category, amendments to deﬁ nitions, 
clariﬁ cations to the effective interest rate to be used on 
cessation of fair value hedge accounting and to align the 
standard with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. 
IAS 1 (Amendment) ‘Presentation of ﬁ nancial statements’: 
Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009. This amendment clariﬁ es the disclosure of 
held-for-trading assets and liabilities between current and 
non-current assets and liabilities. 
There are also a number of minor amendments to IFRS 7, 
‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, IAS 8, ‘Accounting policies, 
changes in accounting estimates and errors’, IAS 10, ‘Events 
after the reporting period’, IAS 18, ‘Revenue’ and IAS 34, 
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 45 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
‘Interim ﬁ nancial reporting’, which are part of the IASB’s 
annual improvements project published in May 2008. 
IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’: 
Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2008. This clariﬁ es the accounting treatment in 
respect of net investment hedging, including the fact that 
net investment hedging relates to differences in functional 
currency not presentation currency, and hedging instruments 
may be held anywhere in the Group.
None are expected to have a material impact on the results or 
ﬁ nancial position of the Group.
Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments 
that are not yet effective and not relevant to the Group
The following interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published by the IASB will become 
effective for future ﬁ nancial reporting periods but are not 
relevant for the Group’s operations: 
IFRS 1 (Amendment) ‘First time adoption of IFRS’
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer loyalty programmes’
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the construction of real estates’
IFRIC 17 ‘Transfers of non-cash assets from owners’
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of assets from customers’
2. Accounting policies
The Group’s key accounting policies are set out below. These 
policies have been prepared on the basis of the recognition 
and measurement requirements of IFRS standards in effect 
that apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2008.
Basis of consolidation
(a)  A business combination is recognised where separate 
legal entities or businesses have been brought together within 
the Group.
  
 Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power 
to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies. This is generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting 
rights, except in certain countries where legal restrictions over 
ownership of shares by non-domicile entities exist. In such 
situations management consolidate entities as subsidiaries 
where the Group has effective control over the ﬁ nancial and 
operating policies. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They 
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
 
 The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations made by the Group. The cost of a 
business combination is measured as the fair value of the 
assets acquired, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs 
directly attributable to the business combination.
 
 Contingent consideration is included in the cost of a business 
at the acquisition date only if the consideration is probable 
and can be reliably measured, and is discounted using an 
appropriate discount rate. If the future events upon which the 
contingent consideration is based do not occur or the estimate 
needs to be revised or if contingent consideration, which has 
not been initially included, does 
become probable and can be reliably measured, the cost of the 
business combination, and any associated goodwill, is adjusted 
accordingly.
 
 Identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
in the business combination are measured initially at their 
fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets 
acquired, the difference is credited to the income statement in 
the period of acquisition.
(b)  The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for 
under the equity method. The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
include the Group’s share of the proﬁ ts or losses of joint 
ventures and the consolidated balance sheet includes the 
investments in joint ventures at cost, including attributable 
goodwill, plus the Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves.
(c)  Minority interests in subsidiaries consolidated by the 
Group are disclosed separately from the Group’s equity and 
income. Losses attributable to a minority in excess of the 
minority’s interest in net assets of the subsidiary are adjusted 
against the interest of the Group unless there is a binding 
obligation on the part of the minority to contribute additional 
investment in the subsidiary.
(d)  Inter-company income, expenses, balances and 
unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated on consolidation.
(e)  All subsidiary undertakings prepare statutory accounts 
to 31 December except DBI Group Limited and its subsidiary 
undertakings which last prepared annual accounts to 30 
September 2008 and Cape Industrial Services Group Limited 
which now prepares accounts to 31 March and last prepared 
annual accounts to 31 December 2007. 
Foreign currencies
(a)   Functional and presentational currency
 Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(‘functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional 
and presentational currency.
(b)  Transactions and balances
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash 
ﬂ ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
 Translation differences on non-monetary ﬁ nancial assets and 
liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
Translation differences on non-monetary ﬁ nancial assets and 
liabilities such as equities held at fair value through proﬁ t or loss 
are recognised as part of the fair value gain or loss.  46 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
continued
2. Accounting policies (continued)
(c)  Group companies
The results and ﬁ nancial position of all Group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
–  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented 
are translated at the closing exchange rate at the date 
of the balance sheet;
–  income and expenses for each income statement are 
translated at average exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect 
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case the income and expenses are translated at the rate 
on the dates of the transaction); and
–  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as 
a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and 
of borrowings and other currency instruments designated 
as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or 
sold, exchange differences that were recognised in equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing exchange rate.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁ able net 
assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit 
for the purpose of impairment testing. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately through the income statement and is 
not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will 
be future economic beneﬁ ts attributable to the asset, the cost 
of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately 
identiﬁ able and there is control over the use of the asset. The 
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the period 
over which the Group expects to beneﬁ t from these assets, 
ranging from three to ﬁ ve years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of 
accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Cost comprises purchase cost together with any incidental 
costs of acquisition. Certain land and buildings are held at 
previous revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation as 
these amounts have been taken as their deemed cost at the 
date of transition to IFRS in accordance with the exemption 
under IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated 
residual value of tangible ﬁ xed assets by equal instalments over 
their estimated useful economic lives with the exception that no 
depreciation is provided on freehold land. The asset’s residual 
values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted 
as appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The following rates 
are applied:
– freehold buildings – 2% per annum;
– leasehold land and buildings – the period of the lease;
–  plant, machinery, ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings – 6% to 33% 
per annum; and
– scaffolding equipment – 1% to 33% per annum.
Investment properties are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
The entity assesses at each reporting date whether an asset 
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group 
makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount. An 
asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ﬂ ows attributable to the asset are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset.
Where the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amounts less an allowance for any amount estimated to be 
uncollectable.
Leases
Finance leases
Where assets are ﬁ nanced by leasing agreements that give 
rights approximating to ownership, the amount representing the 
outright purchase price is capitalised and the corresponding 
leasing commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor. 
The relevant assets are depreciated in accordance with the 
Group’s depreciation policy or over the lease term if shorter. 
Net ﬁ nance charges, calculated on the reducing balance 
method, are included in ﬁ nance costs.
Operating leases
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of these ﬁ nancial statements requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the ﬁ nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Information about such judgements and 
estimations are contained in individual accounting policies. 47 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an 
adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of asset 
or liabilities within the next accounting period are:
–  review of residual lives, residual values, carrying 
values and impairment charges for intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment;
–  estimation of liabilities for pension and other post 
retirement costs;
–  revenue recognition and assessment of construction 
contract performance;
– liabilities in relation to industrial disease claims; and
– recoverability of deferred tax assets.
The carrying value of goodwill has been considered fully in 
note 13.
Compensation for industrial disease
Provision is made for compensation for industrial disease where 
it is possible to estimate the liability with sufﬁ cient reliability. 
This is generally only currently possible in respect of claims 
lodged and outstanding at the period end. Where this is not 
possible, a contingent liability is noted. Beneﬁ t is recognised 
for insurance recoveries for claims provided when they are 
anticipated with virtual certainty.
Provisions
Provisions for liabilities, except for those for industrial disease, 
are made where the timing or amount of settlement is 
uncertain. A provision is recognised when: the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past 
events; it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount has been 
reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 
using a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risks speciﬁ c to the obligation.
Inventories
Inventories which include raw materials and work in progress 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw 
materials are valued based on ﬁ rst in ﬁ rst out method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less selling expenses. Allowance is made for 
obsolete and slow moving items based on annual usage.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value 
added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the Group. Revenue recognition in relation to 
construction contracts is described in the accounting policy 
for construction contracts.
Construction contracts
Contracts are undertaken for customers either on a short 
or long-term basis. For short-term contracts, work done is 
substantially billed as performed and for long-term contracts, 
work is carried out on a substantially ﬁ xed or limited-price 
basis. For short-term contracts, revenue and proﬁ t are 
recognised according to work executed. Amounts taken to 
revenue in respect of work done not billed are included within 
amounts recoverable on contracts. Costs incurred, including 
an appropriate allocation of overheads, in respect of long-term 
contracts are included in work in progress net of progress 
payments received and provisions for foreseeable losses. 
Provision is made in full for any losses as soon as they can be 
foreseen. Any payments on account or provisions for foreseeable 
losses in excess of contract balances are included in trade 
and other payables. Revenue and attributable proﬁ t on long-
term contracts is recognised according to the percentage of 
estimated total contract value completed or the achievement of 
contractual milestones provided that the outcome of the contract 
can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Deferred income taxation
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the full liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, 
or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent income and expenses relating 
to non-recurring transactions that are signiﬁ cant, by virtue of 
their size or nature, and therefore relevant to understanding 
the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance and are shown separately 
to provide a better indication of the underlying results of the 
business.
Employee beneﬁ ts
The Group operates both deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes. 
A deﬁ ned contribution scheme is a pension scheme under 
which the Group pays ﬁ xed contributions into a separate entity. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁ cient assets to pay 
all employees the beneﬁ ts relating to employment in the current 
or prior periods. The pension expense for deﬁ ned contribution 
schemes represents contributions payable in the year. 48 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
continued
2. Accounting policies (continued)
A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme is a pension scheme that is not a 
deﬁ ned contribution scheme. The asset recognised in the 
balance sheet in respect of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme is the 
present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance 
sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. The deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t obligation is calculated tri-annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit method and this valuation 
is updated at each balance sheet date. The present value of 
the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the beneﬁ ts will be paid and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Current and past service costs, ﬁ nance costs and expected 
returns on assets are charged to operating proﬁ t. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from new valuations and from updating 
the latest actuarial valuation to reﬂ ect conditions at the balance 
sheet date are recognised in full in the statement of recognised 
income and expense.
The pension schemes’ deﬁ cits or surpluses, (to the extent that 
any surpluses are considered recoverable), are recognised in 
full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Under IFRIC 14 the recoverability of a surplus must be assessed 
against the minimum funding requirements of the pension 
scheme.
The Group operates gratuity schemes in certain overseas 
countries. These are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 
and accounting follows the same principles as for a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t scheme.
Accounting for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and 
hedging activities
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as forward 
currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks 
associated with foreign currency and interest rate ﬂ uctuations. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at 
their fair value.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity proﬁ les. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
determined by reference to market values of similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁ ed as:
–  fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes 
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; 
–  net investment hedges when hedging the exposure to 
changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net 
assets of foreign operations; and
–  cash ﬂ ow hedges when hedging exposure to variability 
in cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction.
The Group formally designates and documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the 
inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. The documentation also includes identiﬁ cation 
of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the 
nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting the 
exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedge or the cash 
ﬂ ows attributable to the hedged risk. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
ﬂ ows of the hedged items.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to 
the income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising 
from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows:
Fair value hedges
For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is 
adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged; 
the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from 
both are taken to the income statement. For hedged items carried 
at amortised cost, the adjustment is amortised through the income 
statement such that it is fully amortised at maturity. The Group 
discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
Net investment hedges
For net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed 
of or sold. 
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
For cash ﬂ ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement 
when the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as 
a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the amount of the 
consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue costs 
together with ﬁ nance costs are charged to the income statement 
over the term of the borrowings and represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Cumulative preference shares are classiﬁ ed as liabilities. 
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised 
in the income statement as interest expense.  49 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Borrowings are classiﬁ ed as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet.
Restricted cash relating to the Scheme of Arrangement (see note 
33) is excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the Group cash ﬂ ow statement.
Share capital
Ordinary shares and deferred shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
Share based payments
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain 
employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as 
an expense in the income statement with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair values of these payments are measured at the 
dates of grant using option pricing models, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the awards are granted. The fair 
value is recognised over the period during which employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s estimate 
of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees 
leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based 
performance conditions not being met.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited 
to share capital and share premium.
Segmental reporting
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or 
services within a particular economic environment that are 
subject to risks and returns that are different from those of 
segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group’s primary reporting segment is geographical by 
country of destination. The Group has elected to change this 
from business segment as this reﬂ ects the way management 
review the businesses performance since the reorganisation 
into four regions. 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks: 
market risk (including currency risk, cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk 
and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of ﬁ nancial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance. 
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department 
(Group treasury) under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. Group treasury identiﬁ es, evaluates and hedges 
ﬁ nancial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating 
units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk 
management, as well as written policies covering speciﬁ c areas, 
such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use 
of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and non-derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the United States Dollar and Australian Dollar. 
The primary exposure to the Group in terms of foreign currency 
risk is translation of the subsidiary results. This risk is managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant 
foreign currencies. 
 
Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade 
ﬂ ows is not hedged. The exposure of overseas operating 
subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching 
functional currency income with functional currency costs. 
(b) Cash ﬂ ow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
ﬂ ow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at ﬁ xed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group policy is to 
hedge between 66% and 100% of Group borrowings in order 
to cap the maximum interest rate payable.
The Group reviews its interest rate exposure, taking into 
consideration reﬁ nancing, renewal of existing positions and 
alternative ﬁ nancing and hedging. 
Based on various scenarios, the Group manages its cash ﬂ ow 
interest rate risk by using ﬂ oating to ﬁ xed interest rate swaps. 
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting 
borrowings from ﬂ oating to ﬁ xed rates. Generally, the Group 
raises long-term borrowings at ﬂ oating rates and swaps them 
into ﬁ xed rates that are lower than those available if the Group 
borrowed at ﬁ xed rates directly. Under interest rate swaps, the 
Group has entered into transactions to exchange, at speciﬁ ed 
intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between ﬁ xed 
contract rates and ﬂ oating rate interest amounts calculated by 
reference to the agreed notional amounts.
(c) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or 
counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivables 
from customers and deposits with ﬁ nancial institutions.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the 
individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has 
an established credit policy under which each new customer 
is analysed for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard 
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The 
Group’s review includes external ratings, and in some cases 
bank references. 
(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet 
its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufﬁ cient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 
damage to the Group’s reputation. 50 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

12. Earnings per ordinary share
The basic earnings per share calculation for the year ended 31 December 2008 is based on the earnings after tax attributable 
to equity shareholders of £30.6 million (2007: £26.9 million) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 25 pence shares 
of 114,537,257 (2007: 103,351,141).
The diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended 31 December 2008 is based on the earnings after tax of 
£30.6 million (2007: £26.9 million) divided by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary 25 pence shares of 116,381,373 
(2007: 105,449,927).
Share options are considered potentially dilutive as the average share price during the year was above the average exercise prices.

The adjusted earnings per share calculations have been calculated after excluding the impact of amortisation, exceptional items, 
IDC related costs and interest income, the tax impact of these items and an exceptional tax credit received in the year on the 
consolidation of PCH in Australia which was acquired during 2007. 
Options are dilutive at the proﬁ t from continuing operations level and so, in accordance with IAS 33, have been treated as dilutive 
for the purpose of diluted earnings per share. Diluted loss per share is lower than basic loss per share in respect of discontinued 
operations because of the effect of losses on discontinued operations. 57 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Cash-Generating Units (CGU) identiﬁ ed according to country of operation. All goodwill relates 
to Industrial Services.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated by geographical area is as follows:
      2008 2007
      £m £m
UK      16.2 16.7
Gulf/Middle East      0.7 0.7
Far East/Paciﬁ c Rim      165.6 140.2
      182.5 157.6
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂ ow 
projections based on ﬁ nancial budgets approved by management covering a ﬁ ve year period. Cash ﬂ ows beyond the ﬁ ve year 
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.  58 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

13. Intangible assets (continued)
 The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are:
     United  Gulf/Middle  Far East/
     Kingdom East Paciﬁ c Rim
Growth rate     3.0% 3.0% 3.3%
Discount rate     7.9% 7.4% 10.5%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
Management determined budgeted gross and net margin based on past performance and its expectations of market 
development for each CGU, the net margins achievable depend on the services being performed. The discount rates used are 
pre-tax and reﬂ ect speciﬁ c risks relating to the relevant segments. 
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill. The directors have 
concluded that in the case of both the UK and Middle East goodwill there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
which would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use. In the case of Cape Australia, it is reasonably possible 
that a change in key assumptions could occur which would lead the carrying value to exceed the value in use. The recoverable 
amount exceeds carrying value by £24.6 million. If the discount rate or growth rate assumptions used in the model were changed 
to 11.3% or 2.7% respectively then carrying amount and value in use would be equal.

Bank borrowings
The bank loans and overdrafts of £174.1 million (2007: £189.4 million) are secured by ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating charges over the assets of the 
Group. Bank loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £2.8 million (2007: £3.5 million). The Group incurred issue costs of 
£3.9 million in respect of the ﬁ ve year facility entered into in September 2007 (amended December 2007 and July 2008) under which 
amounts were drawn down to part fund the acquisitions in Australia. These issue costs together with the interest expense are allocated

21. Financial instruments 
Disclosures in respect of the Group’s ﬁ nancial risks are set out 
below. Numerical disclosures in respect of ﬁ nancial instruments 
are set out below and on page 61 in note 20 ‘Borrowings’.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks: 
market risk (including currency risk, cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk 
and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of ﬁ nancial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance. 
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury 
department (Group treasury) under policies approved by the 
Board of Directors. Group treasury identiﬁ es, evaluates and 
hedges ﬁ nancial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s 
operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall 
risk management, as well as written policies covering speciﬁ c 
areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit 
risk, use of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and non-derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
(a) Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US Dollar and Australian Dollar. 
 
The primary exposure to the Group in terms of foreign currency 
risk is translation of the subsidiary results. This risk is managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant 
foreign currencies. No sensitivity analysis has been performed 
for the purposes of these accounts as under IFRS 7 translation 
related risk is not taken into account.
 
Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade 
ﬂ ows is not hedged. The exposure of overseas operating 
subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching 
functional currency income with functional currency costs. 
Group management has completed a sensitivity analysis on 
the exposure of the Group to reasonable movements in the 
main functional currencies used by the subsidiaries and 
conclude that the impact on proﬁ t and equity is minimal. 
 
Cash ﬂ ow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
ﬂ ow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at ﬁ xed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group policy is to hedge 
between 66% and 100% of Group borrowings in order to cap 
the maximum interest rate payable.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group’s debt was denominated in 
Sterling, US Dollar and Australian Dollar and was all at a ﬂ oating 
rate. In January 2008 the Group put in place interest rate swaps 
for both the US Dollar denominated debt and a proportion of the 
Sterling debt.
The Group reviews its interest rate exposure, taking into 
consideration reﬁ nancing, renewal of existing positions and 
alternative ﬁ nancing and hedging. 
Based on various scenarios, the Group manages its cash ﬂ ow 
interest rate risk by using ﬂ oating to ﬁ xed interest rate swaps. 
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting 
borrowings from ﬂ oating to ﬁ xed rates. Generally, the Group 
raises long-term borrowings at ﬂ oating rates and swaps them 
into ﬁ xed rates that are lower than those available if the Group 
borrowed at ﬁ xed rates directly. Under interest rate swaps, the 
Group has entered into transactions to exchange, at speciﬁ ed 
intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between ﬁ xed 
contract rates and ﬂ oating rate interest amounts calculated 
by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on the 
impact of reasonable movements in interest rates on Group 
proﬁ t and equity and consider that the impact is negligible. 
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer 
or counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s 
receivables from customers and deposits with ﬁ nancial 
institutions.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by 
the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has 
an established credit policy under which each new customer 
is analysed for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard 
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The 
Group’s review includes external ratings, and in some cases 
bank references. 
 
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet 
its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufﬁ cient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 
damage to the Group’s reputation.
(d) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other 
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends payable to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets 
to reduce debt. 64 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements

21. Financial instruments (continued)
(e)  Accounting for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging activities
On inception derivatives are accounted and measured at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value. The gain or loss 
on remeasurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated hedging instrument when it is 
recognised in equity. The accounting treatment of derivatives classiﬁ ed as hedges depends on their designations, which occurs 
on the date that the derivative contract is committed to. The Group designates derivatives as:
–  a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment (‘cash ﬂ ow hedge’);
–  a hedge of the net investment in a foreign entity (‘net investment hedge’); and
–  a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability (‘fair value hedge’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and 
the hedging instrument and demonstrates the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, to show that the 
hedge will be effective on an on-going basis. Testing the effectiveness of the hedging instrument is performed bi-annually. 
Gains or losses on cash ﬂ ow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. Where the forecast transaction 
results in a ﬁ nancial asset or liability, the gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassiﬁ ed to the income statement in 
the same period as the asset or liability affects income or expenditure. Where the forecasted transaction or commitment results in 
a non-ﬁ nancial asset or a liability, then any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the cost of the related asset 
or liability. If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity 
are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure. 
For the portion of hedges deemed ineffective or transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any change in 
assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement. Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, 
any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction 
is recognised in the income statement. However, where the Group applied cash ﬂ ow hedge accounting for a forecasted or 
committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is 
transferred to the income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings that are regarded as highly effective, 
the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity. If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity with any ineffective portion recognised in the income 
statement. On disposal of the foreign operation gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to the Income Statement.
The Group has not entered into any fair value hedges.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and other borrowings with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to 
approximate to their book values. In the case of the bank loans and other borrowings due in more than one year, the fair value 
of ﬁ nancial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ﬂ ows at the current market 
interest rate available to the Group for similar ﬁ nancial instruments.

Trading derivatives are classiﬁ ed as a current asset or liability. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classiﬁ ed as a non 
current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, 
if the maturity of the hedge item is less than 12 months.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
(i) Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2008 were £109.5 million 
(2007: £13.0 million). 
At 31 December 2008 the main ﬂ oating rates were GBP LIBOR, USD LIBOR and Australian inter bank rate. Interest rate swaps 
were in place which swapped ﬂ oating LIBOR amounts for ﬁ xed rates. UK LIBOR was swapped for a ﬁ xed rate of 5.145% on 
£90 million of the sterling debt and US LIBOR was swapped for a ﬁ xed rate of 3.23% on $30 million of USD denominated debt. 
On 22 December 2008 the Group entered into a basis swap for a period of six months whereby the end result is that the Group 
pays a ﬁ xed rate of 4.945% (5.145% less 20bps) on the GBP hedged portion of the debt. 65 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
21. Financial instruments (continued)
(ii) Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 were £4.8m (2007: £nil).
Gains and losses recognised in other reserves in equity (note 29) on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 
2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the 
income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain or loss is included in the initial 
recognition of a ﬁ nancial asset in which case recognition is over the lifetime of the asset.

The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme and a deﬁ ned contribution scheme for employees within the UK and provides 
pensions for employees of overseas companies in accordance with local requirements and practices. The assets of both the 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution schemes are held in trustee administered funds. The latest valuation of the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t scheme was assessed by independent qualiﬁ ed actuaries as at 6 April 2007 using the projected unit method. The 
valuation showed that the assets of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme had a market value of £132.4 million and was 100% funded. 
Included within the assets balance is an amount of £65.6 million in respect of insurance policies covering pensioner liabilities.
Some of the Group’s overseas subsidiary undertakings operate leaving indemnity schemes as required by local laws and 
regulations. These schemes are unfunded. The provision for leaving indemnities is based on the number of years service and 
the current salary of the employee. 
The pension expense in the period for the deﬁ ned contribution pension scheme of £2.7 million (2007: £1.7 million) equalled the 
Group contributions to the scheme. 
The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme disclosures of the Group in this note also include ﬁ gures relating to a small scheme held by a 
subsidiary undertaking.

Deferred taxation has not been provided in the event of the distribution of the unappropriated proﬁ ts or reserves of certain 
overseas subsidiary undertakings as the Group does not currently intend to make such distributions.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £15.9 million (2007: £6.4 million) available for offset against 
future proﬁ ts, subject to agreement with the tax authorities. The losses carried forward are in certain entities and can only be 
utilised against future proﬁ ts of those entities. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as there is 
uncertainty in respect of its future recoverability. In particular, £10.4 million of the balance relates to losses arising in the Australian 
consolidated group which are subject to strict recognition rules. The Group is still determining whether the losses can be 
recognised and if so, the extent to which they can be recognised.
Advance corporation tax written off to date amounts to £1.7 million (2007: £1.7 million) and is available for offset against future 
United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities subject to certain conditions being met. The future beneﬁ t of advance corporation tax 
has not been accounted for in the provision of deferred taxation as its recoverability is uncertain. 69 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

Due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of settlement all provisions have been classed as non current.
(i)  The provision for industrial disease represents the expected costs of settling notiﬁ ed claims. It is anticipated that most of 
these claims will be paid within the next two years. The charge to proﬁ t for the compensation for industrial disease in the 
year net of insurance recoveries is £5.2 million (2007: £1.2 million). The provision charge is recognised within net operating 
expenses. Insurance recoveries of £2.2 million (2007: £1.1 million) are receivable against certain of these claims and are 
included in other debtors within ‘trade and other receivables’ in the Consolidated balance sheet. The basis for the provision 
and the contingent liability in respect of future settlements is described in note 32 (i).
(ii)  Other provisions relate to the decision made in 2002 to sell and close the Calsil business and provisions for property 
dilapidations and national insurance on share options.

The holders have no dividend rights, redemption entitlement or voting rights. On a winding up the holders are entitled to

(d)  plc Scheme Share
The plc Scheme Share is held by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc on behalf of the Scheme creditors.
The rights attaching to the share are designed to ensure that Scheme assets are only used to settle Scheme claims and ancillary 
costs and do not confer any right to receive a distribution or return of surplus capital save that the holder will have the right to 
require the Company to redeem the share at par value on or at any time after the termination of the Scheme.
The share carries two votes for every vote which the holders of the other classes of shares in issue are entitled to exercise on any 
resolution proposed during the life of the Scheme to engage in certain activities speciﬁ ed in the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Company will not be permitted to engage in certain activities speciﬁ ed in the Company’s Articles of Association without the 
prior consent of the holder of the share. 71 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
28. Share capital (continued)
Share based payments
The Group has a savings related share option scheme (‘Sharesave plan’) which entitles employees of the Group to buy shares 
in the Company. Grants of share options under this scheme are offered to employees periodically and the options are usually 
awarded at a 20% discount to the market price at the date the options are offered to employees. These options must be exercised 
within six months of the vesting date.
The Employee Incentive Plan allows the Group to grant options to Directors and senior employees. The Employee Incentive Plan 
carries a non-market based performance criteria. The contractual life of the options is 10 years. The options become exercisable 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to a growth in earnings per share over that period exceeding an average 3% 
compounded annually above the growth in the consumer price index over the same period. Exercise of an option is subject to 
continued employment.
The Performance Share Plan is the award of Ordinary Shares at no cost to the participant and the grant of nominal value options 
to selected employees or Executive Directors of the Group. Awards are made upon the terms set out in the plan and such other 
additional terms as the Board shall determine. Vesting of these shares is subject to Cape plc Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) meeting 
the speciﬁ ed performance criteria over a three year vesting period. The performance criteria is EPS growth of the Retail Price 
Index (RPI) plus 3% for the minimum of 30% of the shares awarded to vest, and EPS growth of RPI plus 10% for all of the shares 
awarded to vest. The contractual life of the options is ﬁ ve years and is subject to continued employment.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in 
the calculation for the current and preceding year are as follows:

The expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility. The expected option life is the average expected period to exercise. 
The risk free rate of return is the yield on a ﬁ ve year zero coupon UK Government bond. The assumed dividend yield is zero.
The shares issued under the Performance Share Plan, which have no exercise price, are deemed to have a fair value equivalent 
to the share price on the day of grant. Therefore the shares granted in April and September 2008 have fair values of 242.5 pence 
and 229.5 pence respectively.

The Group made no acquisitions during 2008 except to acquire the remaining 3.06% of the share capital of PCH Group which 
took place on 17 January 2008.
During 2008 the Group took the opportunity to revisit the provisional fair values assigned to the assets of the ﬁ ve businesses 
acquired during 2007. No changes were made relating to the two UK acquisitions but the alteration of the fair values and the 
additional purchase consideration in the Australian acquisitions are set out below. As a result of the fair value adjustments the ﬁ nal 
goodwill arising on the Australian acquisitions was £148.0m.

32. Contingencies
(i) There is a history of industrial disease claims being lodged 
against the Group for a number of years. Where the Group has 
determined that it is appropriate to do so, settlement has been 
made. Based on this experience, it is likely that similar claims 
will continue to be received for the foreseeable future. However, 
there is signiﬁ cant uncertainty over the number, nature, timing 
and validity of such future claims. This is as a result of, inter alia, 
uncertainties concerning the population that may have been 
exposed to asbestos and that may develop asbestos-related 
diseases, the nature and timing of the diseases that may develop, 
the impact of other factors which might have contributed to the 
claimant’s condition, changes in the legal environment and to the 
typical cost of settlement. These factors affect considerations of 
liability and the quantum of settlements. Experience to date is that 
some of these claims will be at least partially covered by insurance 
policies but the amount of cover will not be known until the details 
of the claims are available.
 In order to provide for the long-term ﬁ nancing of a great majority 
of all future asbestos-related claims likely to be made successfully 
against the Group, Cape plc has put in place the Scheme details 
of which are set out in note 33. The Scheme became effective in 
relation to Cape plc and 12 of its wholly-owned subsidiaries on 14 
June 2006. The Scheme companies are listed in note 33.
 In accordance with the terms of the Scheme, the Directors have 
commissioned independent actuaries to review and provide 
an estimate of certain of the Group’s unpaid and uninsured UK 
asbestos-related claims as at 31 December 2007 . Estimates of 
unpaid asbestos-related claims are inherently uncertain. Although 
the review did not take account of all potential claims against the 
Group, it covers, in the opinion of the Directors, the overwhelming 
majority of all UK asbestos-related claims likely to be made against 
the Group. The actuaries’ central estimate of the aggregate 
projected discounted value, net of insurance recoveries, of the 
unpaid UK asbestos-related claims they reviewed is £74.0 million 
(2007: £74.0 million). This estimate is contained within a range 
of low and high estimates of £48.0 million (2007: £48.0 million) 
and £203.0 million (2007: £203.0 million) respectively, although 
there can be no certainty that the total cost of such claims will fall 
within the range of such estimates. The discount rate applied is 
5%. Claims not covered by the review include, inter alia, overseas 
claims and certain potential claims for reimbursement from 
insurers and others. 
 Given the wide range of the estimates and the signiﬁ cant degree 
of uncertainty surrounding them, the Directors take the view that 
the amount of the Group’s overall obligation cannot be measured 
with sufﬁ cient reliability. Accordingly, the Group provides in the 
income statement each period for the estimated liability in respect 
of industrial disease claims lodged and outstanding at the period 
end. The accounting treatment of claims lodged and outstanding 
has not been changed as a result of the implementation of the 
Scheme. Upon consolidation, the potential liability shown in the 
Group balance sheet remains unchanged as a result of the 
implementation of the Scheme. However, the effect of the Scheme 
is to protect the Group to a signiﬁ cant extent from the risks of 
insolvency of the Scheme companies if there is a signiﬁ cant 
increase in either the number of claims or the quantum of 
damages or costs the Group has to settle or a material 
deterioration in the Group’s trading performance which would 
otherwise have caused the Group to be unable to settle Scheme 
claims payable by it in full. Nevertheless, if it were possible to 
assess reliably the present value of amounts that might be paid in 
future settlements such that this was to be provided in the balance 
sheet, there would be a materially adverse effect on the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial position. There is great uncertainty over the net present 
value of the future claim settlements. These could occur over a 
period of more than 40 years. However, in aggregate they are 
unlikely to exceed the amount of the net assets included in the 
current Group balance sheet. Based on the recent history of 
settlements, the Directors anticipate that, assuming there is no 
material deterioration in the Group’s trading performance nor a 
signiﬁ cant increase in either the number of asbestos-related claims 
or the quantum of damages or costs the Group has to settle, nor 
any signiﬁ cant shortfall in the recoveries that the Directors expect 
the Group to make from its insurers and under third party 
indemnities and the Scheme fund achieves investment returns in 
line with current expectations, the Group will be able to ensure that 
(i) its newly formed subsidiary Cape Claims Services Limited 
(‘CCS’) will be sufﬁ ciently funded to satisfy all Scheme claims 
and (ii) the Group will be sufﬁ ciently funded to satisfy any UK 
asbestos-related claims falling outside the Scheme. Should the 
future pattern as regards timing and quantum of claims 
prove to be materially and adversely different from the historic 
trend, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial position. 
(ii) The Company was the defendant in proceedings brought 
by some 7 ,500 South African residents who claimed that they 
suffered injury as the result of mining activities in South Africa 
undertaken by former subsidiaries of Cape plc. The Company 
entered into an agreement on 13 March 2003 with the claimants 
in the group action and new claimants who had come forward 
in 2002.
 It is possible that claims could arise in the future from claimants 
who were not included in the group action, or who claim they 
have developed an asbestos-related disease since the date of the 
settlement and as a result of the Group’s former mining activities in 
South Africa. There is a signiﬁ cant uncertainty as to whether such 
future claims will be made and as to the number, nature, timing 
and validity of such claims. However, no such claims have been 
received to date.
(iii) Certain companies in the Group continue to be named, 
along with several asbestos ﬁ bre and asbestos product suppliers, 
as defendants in a number of legal actions in North America. The 
plaintiffs in such actions are claiming substantial damages as a 
result of the use of these products. The Company has received 
legal advice in the UK that default judgments obtained in North 
America against Companies within the Group which are not 
present in North America, would not be enforceable in the UK. 
Consequently the Directors believe that the above-mentioned 
matters are unlikely to have a material effect on the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial position. 80 Cape plc Annual Report 2008

(iv) The Company’s subsidiary, Cape Industrial Services Limited, 
together with other companies involved in offshore contracting 
work, is a defendant in proceedings before the Employment 
Tribunal under the Working Time Regulations 1998 brought by a 
small number of employees claiming that their paid annual leave 
should be taken from scheduled working time. If successful, the 
claimants (and other affected employees who are not party to 
the proceedings) could be entitled to compensation. Under the 
terms of certain of its contracts, Cape Industrial Services Limited 
would be entitled to additional payment from its clients. There is 
signiﬁ cant uncertainty as to whether the claimants will succeed 
and, if they do, as to the number of affected employees, the 
amount of any compensation that would be awarded and the 
extent to which it could be recovered under relevant contracts.
(v) There are a number of leasehold properties in respect of 
which the Group is liable for dilapidations, and rent in the event of 
default by its sub-tenants. Given the nature of these arrangements 
it is difﬁ cult to assess the potential liability with certainty and as a 
consequence contingent liabilities may exist. The Directors believe 
that any such contingent amounts would not have a material effect 
on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position.
(vi) The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees 
and bonds entered into in the normal course of business, in 
respect of which no loss is expected.
33. The Scheme of arrangement
On 14 June 2006, the Scheme became effective and binding 
upon Cape plc and the following 12 of its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries:
Cape Building Products Limited
Cape Calsil Systems Limited
Cape Contracts International Limited
Cape Durasteel Limited
Cape East Limited
Cape Industrial Services Limited
Cape Industries Limited
Cape Insulation Limited
Cape Specialist Coatings Limited
Predart Limited
Somewatch Limited
Somewin Limited
The detailed terms of the Scheme are set out in the Scheme itself, 
a copy of which has been ﬁ led with the Registrar of Companies, 
the Articles of Association of Cape and CCS and a number of 
other ancillary agreements. The effect of the Scheme as a whole 
can be summarised as follows:
(a) While Scheme creditors retain their rights against Scheme 
companies, and may bring proceedings against Scheme 
companies for declaratory relief to determine whether they have a 
claim and, if so, of what amount, their rights, subject as provided 
in sub paragraphs (k) and (m) below are only enforceable against 
CCS under the terms of the Scheme guarantee;
(b) CCS was funded in the ﬁ rst instance with a sum of 
£40 million which represented what was considered to 
be a sufﬁ cient sum to discharge CCS’s liabilities to Scheme 
creditors which became payable over at least eight years from 
1 January 2006;
(c) Every three years there is an assessment of the projected 
Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable by CCS 
over the following nine years, by reference to which the Funding 
Requirement, is established;
(d) The use of Scheme funds is restricted to the payment of 
established Scheme claims and Scheme creditor costs;
(e) In the event that an assessment reveals a shortfall between 
the Scheme assets and the Funding Requirement, the Company 
will top up CCS’s funding over the following three years provided 
that sufﬁ cient cash is available, Cape’s obligation being limited 
to 70% of the Group’s consolidated adjusted operational cash 
ﬂ ow (including, for example, adjustments to take account of 
acquisitions, an element of capital expenditure and repayment 
of borrowing facilities); 
(f) Should the Company not be able to meet its top up 
obligation in any one year, it will be required to make good the 
shortfall in the next year, again subject to sufﬁ cient cash being 
available;
(g) Alongside the Funding Requirement there is the Scheme 
Funding Requirement which is assessed every year by reference 
to projected Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable 
by CCS over the next six years;
(h) If at any time the ratio of the Scheme assets to the Scheme 
Funding Requirement (the Scheme Funding Percentage) falls 
below 60%, CCS will have the ability to reduce the percentage 
(the Payment Percentage) of each established claim which it 
pays to Scheme creditors until such time as the Scheme Funding 
Percentage is restored to 60%;
(i) Cape is permitted to pay dividends provided that at the 
time of payment (i) the Scheme Funding Percentage in relation to 
the last preceding ﬁ nancial year was certiﬁ ed to be not less than 
110%, (ii) the Directors of Cape certify that they anticipate that the 
Scheme Funding Percentage for the current and following ﬁ nancial 
year will be not less than 110% and (iii) the Payment Percentage 
has not at any time within the previous 40 business days been 
below 100%. Any distribution which Cape proposes to make to 
its shareholders may not, without the consent of the Scheme 
Shareholder, exceed the greater of (i) 50% of the consolidated 
operating proﬁ ts of the Group for the last preceding Financial 
Year and (ii) the aggregate of any permitted dividends made in 
the preceding ﬁ nancial year. This restriction therefore places a 
cap on the amount of dividends that the Company may pay in 
any one year;
(j) There have been established special voting shares 
(the Scheme Shares) in CCS and Cape which are held by an 
independent third party (the Scheme Shareholder) on trust for 
Scheme creditors. The Scheme Shares have special rights which 
are designed to enable the Scheme Shareholder to protect the 
interests of Scheme creditors; 81 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
33. The Scheme of arrangement (continued)
(k) In the case of certain Scheme creditors (Recourse Scheme Creditors), who are those Scheme creditors whose claims 
are in whole or in part the subject of a contract of insurance (Recourse Scheme Claims) their rights to enforce their Recourse 
Scheme Claims against a relevant Scheme company will revive in certain circumstances. These circumstances are where the 
relevant Scheme company is insolvent or where there has been a speciﬁ ed reduction in the Payment Percentage and if the 
Scheme creditor was able to bring about the insolvency of the relevant Scheme company he would be able to recover greater 
compensation from the FSCS (‘Financial Services Compensation Scheme’) or, in certain circumstances, from a solvent insurer 
than is available from CCS at that time under the Scheme. There will be a speciﬁ ed reduction if either (i) the Payment Percentage 
has been reduced below 100% but above 50% and the Scheme creditor has not been paid in full after 12 months or (ii) the 
Payment Percentage is reduced to 50% or below;
(l) Each Scheme company will agree to hold on trust for any Scheme creditor concerned the proceeds of any policy of 
insurance (or any compensation received from the FSCS) referable to that Scheme claim;
(m) The restriction described in sub-paragraph (a) above will not apply to proceedings to enforce the right to confer under 
sub-paragraph (l) above; and
(n) There are provisions contained in two reimbursement agreements which preserve certain rights of proof by CCS and 
Cape respectively in any insolvency of Cape or any of the other Scheme companies.
 
34. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under IAS 24 not to disclose any transactions or balances between 
Group entities that have been eliminated on consolidation.

(c)  Other related party transactions
There have been no material transactions with related parties during the year. As at the year end there was a balance of 
£0.2 million balance (2007: £0.2 million) owed by Cape Perlite Systems for a transaction which occurred in 2006.
35. Post balance sheet event
There have not been any signiﬁ cant events after the year end. 82 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
We have audited the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements 
of Cape plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These 
Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
of Cape plc for the year ended 31 December 2008. That report 
is modiﬁ ed by the inclusion of an emphasis of matter.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and 
whether the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information 
given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ report includes that speciﬁ c information presented in 
the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Operating 
and ﬁ nancial review, Five year ﬁ nancial summary and Risks and 
uncertainties review cross referred from the Business review 
and Group results section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements. The other information 
comprises only the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s 
review, Directors report and all of the other information listed on 
the contents page. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the Parent Company 
ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
–  the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and 
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
–  the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and
–  the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent 
with the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements.
Emphasis of matter – Contingent liability for industrial 
disease claims
In forming our opinion on the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements, which is not qualiﬁ ed, we have considered the 
adequacy of the disclosures made in note 12 to the Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements concerning the impact of, and 
accounting for, potential future claims for industrial disease 
compensation. An independent actuarial estimate of the range 
of certain potential liabilities has been performed. However, 
given the wide range of the estimates and signiﬁ cant degree of 
uncertainty surrounding them, it is not possible for the directors 
to quantify, with sufﬁ cient reliability, the amount required 
to settle future claims and accordingly claims are generally 
accounted for on the basis of claims lodged or settlements 
reached and outstanding at the balance sheet date. However, 
if it were possible to assess reliably the present value of the 
amount required to settle future claims such that this was 
provided in the balance sheet, there would be a materially 
adverse effect on the Company’s ﬁ nancial position.

1. Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on the going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting 
standards. The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United Kingdom and are therefore 
being presented separately from the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements of Cape plc, which have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 
the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁ t and 
loss account for the year. In accordance with FRS 1 (revised 
1996) and FRS 8 the Company has taken advantage of the 
exemptions not to prepare a cash ﬂ ow statement and not to 
disclose transactions with related parties. FRS 29 ‘Financial 
instruments: Disclosures’ became effective from 1 January 
2008. As the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS 7, the Company is exempt 
from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29. Other new 
accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards 
Board and effective from 1 January 2008 have had no impact 
on the accounts of the Company.
(b) Fixed asset investments
During 2008 the accounting policy whereby investments were 
previously revalued each year has been changed and as such 
investments are now held at cost less impairment. Due to the 
material nature of the affect of the change in policy the 2007 
results have been restated. Details of the prior year adjustment 
are included in note 4 to these accounts.
(c) Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of these ﬁ nancial statements requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the ﬁ nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Information about such judgements and 
estimation is contained in individual accounting policies.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an 
adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of asset 
or liabilities within the next accounting period are:
–  estimation of liabilities for pension and other post 
retirement costs;
– liabilities in relation to industrial disease claims; 
–  liabilities in relation to central provisions; and
– recoverability of deferred tax assets.
 
(d) Compensation for industrial disease
Provision is made for compensation for industrial disease 
where it is possible to estimate the liability with sufﬁ cient 
reliability. This is generally only currently possible in respect 
of claims lodged and outstanding at the period end. Where 
this is not possible, a contingent liability is noted. Beneﬁ t is 
recognised for insurance recoveries for claims provided when 
they are anticipated with virtual certainty.
(e) Provisions
Provisions for liabilities, except for those for industrial 
disease, are made where the timing or amount of settlement 
is uncertain. A provision is recognised when: the Company 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
past events; it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been 
reliably estimated.
(f) Deferred income taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that 
date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to 
pay less, tax in the future. Resultant deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which 
the underlying timing differences can be deducted, or where 
there are deferred tax liabilities against which the assets can be 
recovered. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
 
(g) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the amount of the 
consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue 
costs together with ﬁ nance costs are charged to the proﬁ t and 
loss account over the term of the borrowings and represent 
a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding.
Cumulative preference shares are classiﬁ ed as liabilities. 
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised 
in the income statement as interest expense. 
Borrowings are classiﬁ ed as current liabilities unless the 
Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
(h) Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand include cash in hand, deposits 
held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet. 85 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
(i) Share capital
Ordinary shares and deferred shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
(j) Share based payments
The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and 
recognised as an expense in the proﬁ t and loss account with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair values of these 
payments are measured at the dates of grant using option pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the awards are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the awards subject to the Company’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees 
leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
(k) Pensions
The Group operates two major pension schemes in the UK, one is a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme and the other is a deﬁ ned 
contribution scheme. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered 
fund.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable 
basis and therefore, as permitted by FRS 17, accounts for the plan as if it were a deﬁ ned contribution plan. The consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements include full disclosures of the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan in accordance with IAS 19 which is similar to FRS 17 
(note 24).
Deﬁ ned contribution plan
Payments to the deﬁ ned contribution plan are charged as an expense as they fall due.

The retained loss for the ﬁ nancial year attributable to the Company was £24.0 million (2007: £12.3 million).

4. Fixed asset investments (continued)
In prior years the Company followed a policy whereby investments were revalued each year to the net asset value of the 
Company’s subsidiaries with changes above and below cost dealt with through the revaluation reserve and proﬁ t and loss 
account accordingly. In 2008 the Company Directors made the decision to change this policy to instead hold the investments at 
cost less provision for impairment. As a result comparative ﬁ gures have been restated with the impact of reducing net assets of 
the Company by £103.2m. There is no impact on the proﬁ t and loss account.
The Directors made the decision to change the accounting policy as they believe that the new policy results in the accounts more 
accurately reﬂ ecting the true position of the business.
The change in accounting policy resulted in the following restatement to the 2007 balances:

year net of insurance recoveries is £3.3 million (2007: £0.5 million). The provision charge is recognised within net operating 
expenses. Insurance recoveries of £0.7 million (2007: £0.3 million) are receivable against certain of these claims and are 
included in other debtors in the Parent Company balance sheet. The basis for the provision and the contingent liability in 
respect of future settlements is described in note 32 (i) to the Group accounts.
(ii)  Other provisions relate to the decision made in 2002 to sell and close the Calsil business and provisions for property 
dilapidations and national insurance on share options.

12. Contingencies
(i) Full disclosure in respect of the contingent liability for 
industrial disease claims is detailed in note 32 to the 
Group accounts.
(ii) The Company was the defendant in proceedings brought 
by some 7,500 South African residents who claimed that 
they suffered injury as the result of mining activities in South 
Africa undertaken by former subsidiaries of Cape plc. The 
Company entered into an agreement on 13 March 2003 with 
the claimants in the group action and new claimants who had 
come forward in 2002.
 It is possible that claims could arise in the future from claimants 
who were not included in the group action, or who claim they 
have developed an asbestos-related disease since the date 
of the settlement and as a result of the Group’s former mining 
activities in South Africa. There is a signiﬁ cant uncertainty as to 
whether such future claims will be made and as to the number, 
nature, timing and validity of such claims. However, no such 
claims have been received to date.
(iii) The Company continues to be named, along with several 
asbestos ﬁ bre and asbestos product suppliers, as defendants 
in a number of legal actions in North America. The plaintiffs in 
such actions are claiming substantial damages as a result of 
the use of these products. The Company has received legal 
advice in the UK that default judgments obtained in North 
America against Companies within the Group which are not 
present in North America, would not be enforceable in the UK. 
Consequently the Directors believe that the above-mentioned 
matters are unlikely to have a material effect on the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial position.
(iv) The Company’s subsidiary, Cape Industrial Services 
Limited, together with other companies involved in offshore 
contracting work, is a defendant in proceedings before the 
Employment Tribunal under the Working Time Regulations 
1998 brought by a small number of employees claiming 
that their paid annual leave should be taken from scheduled 
working time. If successful, the claimants (and other affected 
employees who are not party to the proceedings) could be 
entitled to compensation. Under the terms of certain of its 
contracts, Cape Industrial Services Limited would be entitled 
to additional payment from its clients. There is signiﬁ cant 
uncertainty as to whether the claimants will succeed and, if 
they do, as to the number of affected employees, the amount 
of any compensation that would be awarded and the extent to 
which it could be recovered under relevant contracts.
(v) There are a number of leasehold properties in respect of 
which the Company is liable for dilapidations, and rent in the 
event of default by its sub-tenants. Given the nature of these 
arrangements it is difﬁ cult to assess the potential liability with 
certainty and as a consequence contingent liabilities may exist. 
The Directors believe that any such contingent amounts would 
not have a material effect on the Company’s ﬁ nancial position.
(vi) The Company has contingent liabilities in respect of 
guarantees and bonds entered into in the normal course of 
business, in respect of which no loss is expected.

KPIs: deﬁ nitions and analysis
Adjusted operating proﬁ t margin
Deﬁ ned as Group operating proﬁ t before other items expressed as a percentage of revenue. The continued improvement in 
the margin over the last ﬁ ve years represents the change in operations, including the exit from the manufacturing activities and 
increased international operations.
Return on managed assets
Deﬁ ned as Group operating proﬁ t before other items expressed as a percentage of average managed assets**. The 2008 return 
is indicative of the signiﬁ cant investment in the business over the last 18 months, including in Australia with the 50,000 tonnes of 
equipment acquired through the acquisition of PCH and Concept Group.
Operating cash conversion 
This is deﬁ ned as operating cash ﬂ ow divided by Group operating proﬁ t before other items (see note 30 to the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements). Operating cash conversion has been used by the Directors as a key measure to monitor the Group performance over 
the last 12 months and will be closely monitored going forward. The conversion rate in 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of the 
Group in turning proﬁ t into cash.
Lost Time Incidents (LTI)
Number of incidents per 100,000 man hours worked. Cape considers safety as a key part of the Group strategy and the 
improvement in the safety record demonstrates the achievements in this area. 
* Cash conversion has only been considered as a KPI for the last 12 months
** Managed assets are property plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.

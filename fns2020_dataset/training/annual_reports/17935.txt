Chairman’s statement
“The Group is well positioned 
and has exciting prospects going 
forward. We have developed 
a strong, high performance 
culture serving a wide range of 
international customers, with 
a committed workforce and 
absolute integrity in our operating 
procedures. ”
A.M. Thomson l Chairman
Overview
2015 was a year of considerable challenge for the Group. Mixed 
macro-economic conditions persisted throughout the year in 
many of the countries in which we operate. The automotive and 
aerospace markets remained in growth mode, but this was not 
enough to offset the revenue dip, particularly in the energy and 
general industrial sectors. 
I am, however, very pleased to report that the Group, under the 
stewardship of Stephen Harris and his executive team, successfully 
navigated the business through these tough conditions and we 
remain in a strong financial position.
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an important component 
of shareholder returns and is proposing a final ordinary dividend 
of 10.3p, an increase of 5.1%, which will be paid on 3 June 
2016, subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 Annual General 
Meeting. This brings the total ordinary dividend for 2015 to 15.1p 
(2014: 14.4p) costing £28.7m which represents a year-on-year 
increase of 4.9%. Recognising the net cash position of the Group 
the Board is, for the third successive year, recommending a 
supplemental distribution by way of a special dividend, also payable 
on 3 June 2016, amounting to 10.0p per share (2014: 20.0p) costing 
£19.0m (2014: £38.1m).
Governance and reporting
One of my key responsibilities as Chairman is to promote effective 
governance across the Group thus ensuring that we remain a 
successful and sustainable entity with good governance procedures 
practised across all 24 countries in which the Group operates. To 
enable shareholders to understand how this goal is achieved we 
have provided a corporate governance statement on page 38 of 
this Annual Report. This describes how the governance structure 
underpins the delivery of the Group’s business strategy. On page 
24 we have also outlined the principal risks that may prevent the 
business from achieving its objectives and the actions being taken 
to overcome these potential obstacles.
During the year we commissioned an external evaluation of the 
Board’s performance. The findings confirmed that the Board is 
well balanced with a diverse mix of skills and experience and is 
performing effectively. Nevertheless the report indicates that there 
is scope for improvement and we shall be working to ensure that 
the governance is further improved in 2016.
02 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
Hand-in-hand with good governance goes transparent reporting, 
and during 2015 we have made further changes to the Annual 
Report to ensure that this is achieved. This includes a viability 
statement, which can be found on page 27 of this Annual Report 
and also a complete listing of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. 
In part these are mandated by changes in UK reporting regulation, 
others arise through changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
code, and sometimes by proactively adopting best practice as it 
evolves.
The drive for ongoing improvement in environmental and 
safety reporting is described in the Corporate responsibility and 
sustainability section of this Annual Report on pages 28 to 34.  
It should be noted that these topics now make up a material part  
of each management committee and Board meeting.
Board matters
It is the responsibility of every Board to ensure that there is an 
appropriate succession plan in place across the business, including 
for the Board of Directors. This is integral to the successful delivery 
of the Group strategy and underpins the effectiveness of the Board. 
During the year the Nomination Committee performed an in-depth 
review of its Board succession plan. 
Raj Rajagopal, the Senior Independent Director, who joined the 
Board in September 2008, will retire after the 2016 AGM. His wise 
counsel has been invaluable throughout the whole period of Group 
transformation. We thank him for his contribution over the last  
eight years and wish him well for the future. We have engaged 
Zygos Partners, a firm of international search consultants, to work 
with us to identify a new non-executive director. We will report to 
shareholders on progress as appropriate.
Ian Duncan, who is a qualified Chartered Accountant, joined the 
Board in November 2014 and assumed the Chair of the Audit 
Committee after the 2015 AGM. Ian is a highly experienced 
independent director having served a number of international 
companies in both executive and non-executive Board positions 
over the last 15 years. I am pleased to report that Ian will become 
our Senior Independent Director following the 2016 AGM in May. 
David Landless, the Group Finance Director, has informed the 
Board of his intention to retire as a director of the Board. David has 
agreed to remain with the Group to ensure a smooth handover to 
his successor and he will oversee the publication of the Group’s 
2016 full year results if the handover has not been completed ahead 
of this date. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank David 
for his dedication and exceptional service to the Group over many 
years and we wish him all the best in the next stage of this career 
as he grows his non-executive director portfolio.
People
Whilst Bodycote has become a large Group operating on a 
global basis, we have tried to maintain the agility of a smaller 
company, with a flat organisational structure and clear lines of 
responsibility, thus enabling us to provide a fast and efficient 
service to our customers. Bodycote is a first-class service business, 
our employees are our ambassadors, and with their continued 
commitment and professionalism we can achieve our ambitious 
plans. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their 
enthusiasm, hard work and commitment throughout 2015. 
Despite the improvement in the overall performance of safety 
across the Group it is with great regret that I have to report that one 
of our employees was seriously injured in an accident at a facility 
in North America in October 2015 and, as a result of these injuries, 
the employee died on 17 February 2016. 
Shareholders
During the year I met with a number of Bodycote’s largest 
shareholders and received positive feedback from them on their 
views of the Group. In the coming year I will maintain this valuable 
dialogue and also look forward to meeting as many shareholders 
as possible at this year’s AGM in May, when there will be an 
opportunity to discuss the Group’s business and future prospects 
with Board members.
Summary
The performance of the Group was resilient throughout 2015. This 
reflects the decisive cost actions taken in the face of weak market 
conditions, together with the delivery of an improved business mix.
The Group is well positioned and has exciting prospects going 
forward. We have developed a strong, high-performance culture 
serving a wide range of international customers, with a committed 
workforce and absolute integrity in our operating procedures. The 
long-term prospects for the Group are encouraging and I remain 
confident that these should ensure an attractive return for both our 
employees and our shareholders over the coming years.

Chief Executive’s review
“The Group delivered a resilient 
performance in 2015. The speed 
and effectiveness of management’s 
actions, in addition to the continued 
focus on improved mix, enabled 
headline operating margins to be 
sustained. ” 
S.C. Harris l Group Chief Executive
Overview
The Group benefits from serving a broad spread of industrial 
sectors and geographies. In 2015 the macro-economics were 
favourable for our aerospace and automotive sectors, but the 
rapid decline in oil prices weighed heavily on our customers in the 
energy sector. The weakness in the energy sector bled over into 
the general industrial markets and was further compounded by 
the slowing growth in China, weakening global demand for many 
commodities and the embargo on global trade with Russia.
The net result for Bodycote was a 7% decline in revenue to 
£567 .2m (2014: £609.1m). However, headline operating profit only 
reduced by 8% to £102.1m (2014: £111 .1m), including negative 
foreign currency translation of £2.3m. 
The potential impact the weakening global demand conditions 
would have on the Group started to become clear early in the year. 
As a consequence, management decided to undertake a series of 
actions to mitigate the situation, some giving immediate benefit, 
while others are aimed at accelerating future growth.
A restructuring programme was announced at the half year, with 
an associated charge of £20m (of which £9m related to non-cash 
impairments) and which focused on our facilities serving the 
oil services and general industrial sectors. By year end we had 
successfully exited the businesses in Brazil and India. Elsewhere 
we have closed five facilities and consolidated poorly performing 
activities within a further six facilities. Closure of an additional five 
facilities will be completed in the first half of 2016. Equipment is 
being relocated within the Group, and in many cases business is 
being transferred to neighbouring facilities.
The speed and effectiveness of management’s actions, in 
conjunction with the ongoing drive for mix and efficiency 
improvements, have been such that the headline margin
1
 has  
been sustained at 18%.
04 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
Improving the flexibility of the Group’s cost base has been a high 
priority for several years. A noteworthy element of this has been 
greater use of temporary labour which can be flexed at little or no 
cost to suit the prevailing workload. Temporary employees were 
reduced by 11% during the year, however at year end, temporary 
and contract labour still represented 12.7% of total employees.
Basic headline earnings per share was 39.5p, a decline of 9.8% 
which reflects the absence of the one-off tax credit the Group 
enjoyed in 2014. Bodycote is reporting another year of strong cash 
generation, with 80% of headline operating profit turned into cash
2
 
(2014: 90%). As a result, the Group continues to be in a strong 
financial position and had net cash of £12.3m at 31 December 2015. 
Return on capital employed remained excellent at 19.0% for the 
year (2014: 20.7%).
Strategic progress
To enhance our future growth we have accelerated investment in 
high growth potential areas, mindful of the Group’s 20% hurdle rate 
for return on capital employed. The increase in capital expenditure 
was driven by the number of greenfield facilities under construction 
along with specific capacity expansion in Specialist Technologies 
and civil aerospace. Nine greenfield sites were under construction 
in 2015, of which four are for Specialist Technologies and three are 
in the targeted expanding markets of Eastern Europe, Mexico and 
China. Additionally, capacity has been expanded at specific existing 
Specialist Technologies and civil aerospace facilities.
Overall capital investment increased by 14% to £61m, 
corresponding to 1 .2 times depreciation.
The strategy of preferential investment in Specialist Technologies 
continues to benefit the Group. While two of these technologies, 
Surface Technology and HIP Product Fabrication, were hard hit  
by the decline in activity in the oil sector, the remaining four 
showed good growth. Average margins continue to exceed 30%  
in Specialist T echnologies.
During the year we launched a new specialist technology in 
the field of ion implantation. We believe it to be the only form 
of ion implantation that is capable of processing bulk material. 
Applications include hardening of materials without temperature 
distortion and the reduction of surface friction in polymers, 
eliminating the need for lubrication. Sales are currently at the  
pilot stage.
The pursuit of operational excellence in the Group is a major 
priority. Part of this effort is a goal to improve the margins in the AGI 
Classical Heat Treatment business to the level we have been able to 
achieve in ADE Classical Heat Treatment. This is particularly the case 
in AGI in Europe where margins have been lower for some years. 
One of the tools used for this is the Bodycote Margin Model which 
employs a job costing methodology and strategic pricing process 
to help facilities drive the mix of work towards higher added value. 
Lean techniques are also being deployed at an increasing rate, 
which help to improve production flows and efficiencies. This 
work, in conjunction with the restructuring actions taken, drove 
the margins in the AGI business up by 90 bps, notwithstanding the 
decline in revenues.
During 2015 we continued to pursue potential acquisitions, although 
none were completed during the year. The acquisition priorities 
are divided into two broad areas. The first is to acquire bolt-on 
activities in Classical Heat Treatment that will enhance our network 
of operations. These will typically be small businesses in Western 
Europe and North America as there are few, if any, suitable targets 
outside of these territories and very few of any scale. The second 
area we look to acquire in is Specialist Technologies. There are few 
potential targets given the rarity of competitors, but some of the 
targets are of a larger scale. We also actively pursue ideas in areas 
adjacent to our existing technologies. The environment in 2016 
looks more conducive to making acquisitions and the Group is well 
placed should sufficiently attractive targets become available. 
Summary and outlook 
The Group delivered a resilient performance in 2015. Automotive 
and aerospace revenues moved ahead. However, the decline in oil 
price combined with downward pressures on our general industrial 
business led to Group revenues falling by 4% at constant exchange 
rates. The speed and effectiveness of management’s actions, in 
addition to the continued focus on improved mix, enabled headline 
operating margins to be sustained. Recognising the Group’s 
net cash position, the Board is recommending a further special 
dividend. 
The Group will continue to follow its strategy of investing in areas 
of robust revenue opportunity, notably in Specialist Technologies 
and in higher growth territories, as well as further enriching  the 
mix towards higher added value services. The Board is confident 
that management’s continued focus on business improvements will 
generate good returns throughout the cycle.

Our technologies
Classical Heat T reatment Specialist T echnologies 
Virtually every type of metal component, whatever its application, 
has received some form of processing before its introduction 
to service to enable it to perform to the required standard and 
last longer. Working to very exacting quality specifications, heat 
treatment uses precisely controlled furnaces to process a huge 
variety of metals and alloys, improving their material properties. 
Bodycote’s Classical Heat Treatments describe a group of mature 
processes such as nitriding, carburising, annealing, tempering (and 
many more) that are used to achieve the desired properties.
Below are a few examples of material properties obtained by heat 
treatment:
Bodycote’s Specialist T echnologies refer to a group of processes 
which require very specialist expertise and technology. In some cases, 
they are proprietary technologies which have undergone extensive 
development and offer unique solutions for a variety of applications.
HIP
Hot Isostatic Pressing Services
Impact resistance and fatigue properties, in particular, are extremely 
sensitive to small amounts of porosity. Through the simultaneous 
application of heat and pressure, the HIP process eliminates internal 
porosity from components, improving fatigue strength, tensile ductility 
and fracture toughness.
Hardness
What is it? The ability of a material to resist deformation, 
scratching and indentation under force.
Why is it important? Improving a material’s hardness through 
heat treatment allows it to resist various types of wear.
HIP PF
Hot Isostatic Pressing Product Fabrication
This method of manufacture combines the HIP process with 
design and production expertise to create a component from 
metal powder. The flexibility of the HIP PF process means 
that combinations of materials can be used to give desired 
properties, enabling metallic compositions that are difficult or 
impossible to forge or cast.
T oughness
What is it? The ability of a material to absorb energy and 
plastically deform without fracture.
Why is it important? Heat treatment can be used to strengthen 
the material and help improve its resistance to impact.
S
3
P
Speciality Stainless Steel Processes
Steel is often chosen for its inherent corrosion resistance, but 
often requires hardening. Standard heat treatments will harden 
the steel, but can negatively impact the corrosion resistance. 
S
3
P technology uniquely hardens stainless steel, nickel-based 
alloys and cobalt-chromium alloys improving mechanical and 
wear properties without adversely affecting corrosion resistance.
Fatigue 
strength
What is it? The stress level at which component failure occurs 
when subjected to repeated stress cycles.
Why is it important? Part failure due to fatigue can have 
catastrophic consequences, particularly if the part is safety 
critical. Through heat treatment, a material’s fatigue strength is 
improved.
LPC
Low Pressure Carburising
A case hardening process used to obtain a hardened surface and 
tough core, giving increased wear resistance and fatigue life, 
with minimal risk of treatment distortion. LPC is a clean process, 
carried out under vacuum, and is an environmentally-friendly 
treatment.
Creep 
resistance
What is it? The measure of a material’s ability to resist high 
temperature deformation.
Why is it important? Some metals and alloys must operate 
at temperatures close to their melting point. Heat treatment 
enables them to perform at higher temperatures with little or no 
movement.
CiD
Corr-l-Dur
®
A proprietary thermochemical treatment for the simultaneous 
improvement of corrosion and wear resistance through the 
generation of a nitride-oxide combination layer. Corr-l-Dur
®
 is an 
environmentally-friendly alternative to the use of hard chromium, 
electroless nickel and other galvanic coatings.
Ductility
What is it? The ability of a material to deform without breaking.
Why is it important? In order to form or shape a complex 
component, good ductility is required. Heat treatment is used to 
soften the material which makes it easy to work as part of the 
manufacturing process.
ST
Surface T echnology
ST incorporates specialised plasma spray, HVOF (High Velocity 
Oxygen Fuel) and thermo-chemically formed coatings to improve 
wear resistance, hardness and durability and is able to surface 
engineer components (including complex shapes and internal 
bores) designed to operate in the most demanding of industrial 
applications.

Adding value – a component journey
ADDING VALUE – A COMPONENT JOURNEY
3D-PRINTED METAL PART
Almost all metal parts built by the additive 
manufacturing process require secondary 
treatments to make them suitable for their 
intended use.
Bodycote provides a complete post-manufacture 
service solution including hot isostatic pressing to 
remove micro-porosity and reduce the extent of 
segregation in the built structure, heat treatment 
to improve material properties, and associated 
quality assurance testing.

BODYCOTE COMPONENT JOURNEYS
This is just one example of how Bodycote brings together the 
huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group 
to provide the vital engineering services our customers need...
For more component journeys visit www.bodycote.com
The metal part is ‘built’ onto a plate in a 
3D printing machine by depositing metal 
powder in layers which are then consolidated, 
for example by use of lasers.

The component will undergo 
any necessary ﬁnish machining 
and dimensional inspection.
  The part next undergoes 
heat treatment to achieve 
full material properties and 
improve the microstructural 
characteristics of the 
component if needed. 
  Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) ensures 
that any porosity within the part is 
removed, thereby reducing the 
variation in mechanical properties 
when compared with the as-built 
part, and improving ductility and 
fatigue strength.
  The part is stress 
relieved in a vacuum 
furnace to minimise 
any distortion.
  Various testing methods are 
used to check that the part 
meets speciﬁcation – these 
may include radiography, 
tensile testing, and 
metallography.
  The component is then 
removed from its build plate 
by electrical discharge 
machining (EDM) to prepare 
for HIP and heat treatment.

Markets
Aerospace, Defence & Energy markets Automotive & General Industrial markets 
Civil aerospace revenues increased in 2015 by 1% at constant 
exchange rates (1% increase at actual exchange rates), reflecting 
increased demand for new generation engines, especially in France, 
and despite continued significant Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM) weakness in the UK. Available seat kilometres grew by 6% 
indicating a continued increase in aircraft flying hours which, in turn, 
resulted in resilient demand for aftermarket parts. Sales into the 
civil aerospace sector account for 18% of Group revenues.
Sales into the defence sector, which accounted for 6% of Group 
revenues, were again soft. 
Demand for the Group’s services in the power generation sector 
were weak, with revenues below 2014 by 9% at constant exchange 
rates (9% decrease at actual exchange rates). 
Revenues in oil & gas were substantially lower in 2015 as a result 
of the fall in crude oil prices. Heat treatment and surface technology 
bore the brunt of the reduction in demand. HIP PF revenues were 
lower than in 2014 but by notably less than the background market 
as new orders continue to be won. Overall revenues were down 
28% (at constant exchange rates) compared to 2014 and by 29% 
at actual exchange rates. Sales into the oil & gas sectors accounted 
for 8% of Group revenue. 
Revenues in car and light truck markets increased year-on-year by 
6% at constant exchange rates (2% at actual exchange rates). The 
increase in revenue was widely spread across the Group, reflecting 
both new contract wins and strong OEM production rates.
Heavy truck sector revenues in North America grew strongly 
again in 2015 and were ahead of the prior year by 9% at constant 
exchange rates (18% at actual exchange rates). In contrast, demand 
in Western Europe was very weak and revenues declined by 10% 
at constant exchange rates, in part driven by a notable programme 
turning end-of-life in Sweden (the decline was 19% at actual 
exchange rates).
Bodycote provides thermal processing services for a wide range 
of capital equipment customers. In 2015, many sectors served 
by Bodycote were badly affected by the heavy declines in most 
commodity prices. This was particularly noteworthy in agricultural 
equipment and in many types of industrial machinery. Overall 
revenues fell by 5% at constant exchange rates (11% decline at 
actual exchange rates).

Within the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) business, our 
customers think and operate globally and increasingly expect 
Bodycote to service them in the same way. Consequently, the 
ADE business is organised globally. This gives Bodycote a notable 
advantage as the only thermal processing company with a global 
footprint and an understanding of operating in all of the world’s 
key manufacturing areas. A number of Bodycote’s multinational 
customers fall within the compass of ADE and Bodycote intends 
to continue to leverage its unique market position to increase 
revenues in these market sectors. The business incorporates the 
Group’s activities in hot isostatic pressing and surface technology 
as well as the relevant heat treatment services, encompassing  
60 facilities in total.
Results
Revenues for the ADE business were £243.5m in 2015 compared 
to £263.0m in 2014, a decrease of 7 .4% (8.1% decrease at constant 
exchange rates). Overall, revenues from the commercial aerospace 
sector remained solid but there have been significantly varying 
levels of demand in different OEM supply chains. Some have 
focused on significant destocking, while others have delivered good 
growth on the back of new engine series and airframes. Defence 
demand has been subdued, resulting in further modest declines in 
revenue. Demand in the energy sector and particularly the oil & gas 
sector, has been very weak. Oil & gas revenues have been most 
depressed in North American heat treatment and in both the USA 
and the UK for Surface Technology. Declines in HIP PF have been 
less severe, despite a number of delays to subsea projects,  
as customers continue to convert to HIP PF from forgings.
Headline operating profit
1
 for ADE was £59.2m (2014: £70.6m) and 
headline operating profit margin reduced from 26.8% to 24.3%, 
demonstrating good cost control in the face of reduced demand. 
In 2015, the Group added capacity in a number of facilities, 
including installation of a new high pressure HIP in the USA. In 
addition initial works have been undertaken to establish a new 
aerospace focused facility in South East Poland. In the coming 
year it is expected that capital expenditure will be slightly above 
depreciation as further capacity and capability are added to support 
anticipated growth in the Group’s Specialist Technologies and other 
high-value offerings. 
Net capital expenditure in 2015 was £17 .4m (2014: £18.4m) which 
represents 0.9 times depreciation (2014: 0.9 times).
Average capital employed in ADE in 2015 was £234.2m (2014: 
£236.3m). The Group continues to invest in high-return projects in 
the ADE business. Return on capital employed in 2015 was 23.0% 
(2014: 26.6%).
Achievements in 2015
The ADE divisions made further progress during the year in gaining 
new agreements with a range of customers and for a variety of 
end uses. In ADE Heat Treatment, new agreements were signed 
with key suppliers to the growing A350 and A320NEO aerospace 
programmes. In Surface Technology, a new agreement was signed 
for the provision of thermal spray coating services for helicopter  
turbine blades.
The HIP division continues to make good progress, with new 
customers choosing to use the Group’s proprietary Product 
Fabrication (PF) technology for the first time. 
Organisation and people
Total full-time equivalent headcount at 31 December 2015 was 
1,785 (2014: 1,898), a decrease of 6.0% compared to the revenue 
decline in ADE of 8.1% (at constant currencies).
Looking ahead
Order books for commercial aerospace OEMs remain strong, and 
destocking at certain OEMs and their supply chains is expected to 
be completed at some point in 2016. We anticipate no near term 
improvement in the oil & gas sector. Defence markets are expected to 
be stable. Bodycote believes it will continue to capitalise on its world 
leading position in the aerospace, defence and energy markets.

During the injection moulding process, the mould must not only form the part, 
but also dissipate the heat at the surface and allow for easy ejection of the 
finished component. Moulding tools often employ vacuum brazing techniques 
with integrated heat treatment. Forming and extrusion dies used in supply chains' 
mass production lines must resist wear and fracture so as to avoid costly 
unplanned shutdown of the process line. In addition, maintaining the surface 
finish is important. Parts may be vacuum hardened and then be given a gas or  
plasma nitriding treatment.

Whilst the Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) marketplace 
has many multinational customers which tend to operate on a 
regionally-focused basis, it also has numerous medium-sized and 
smaller businesses, all of whom are very important to Bodycote. 
Generally, there are more competitors to Bodycote in AGI and much 
of the business is locally oriented, meaning that proximity to the 
customer is very important. Bodycote’s uniquely large network of 
118 AGI facilities enables the business to offer the widest range 
of technical capability and security of supply, while continuing to 
increase the proportion of technically differentiated services that it 
offers. Bodycote has a long and successful history of serving this 
wide-ranging customer base.
Results
AGI business revenues were £323.7m in 2015, compared to 
£346.1m in 2014, a decrease of 6.5% (1 .1% decrease at constant 
exchange rates).
In 2015, overall sales from the automotive sector increased by 
3.6%, at constant exchange rates. Sales into car and light truck 
have again been good in all geographies, with the increase 
reflecting both new contract wins and strong OEM production 
rates. Revenues to heavy truck declined overall, with strong North 
American growth being more than offset by weak demand in 
Europe. General industrial markets have been weak in all territories. 
Headline operating profit
1
 in AGI was £53.4m compared to £54.1m 
in 2014. Headline operating margin increased to 16.5% (2014: 
15.6%) reflecting a further improvement in mix towards higher 
value work along with strong cost control. Revenues from the 
Group’s Specialist Technologies grew well at high margins.
Net capital expenditure in 2015 was £39.8m (2014: £31 .1m), which 
represents 1 .3 times depreciation (2014: 0.9 times). Notable 
projects included the opening of a new facility for S
3
P in France, for 
LPC in Mexico and, in Classical Heat Treatment, new facilities were 
opened in Poland and China.
In 2016 we expect that capital expenditure will be approximately 
1 .2 times depreciation as we continue to expand our Specialist 
Technologies and operations in the rapid growth countries. Return 
on capital employed in 2015 was maintained at 16.0% (2014: 
16.0%). This reflects the continued focus on improving capital 
returns by continuing to target higher added-value work. On 
average, capital employed in 2015 was £304.1m (2014: £301 .8m).
Achievements in 2015
The Group continued to win business across all geographies. In 
both North America and Europe our ability to support automotive 
manufacturers, as they move to newer technologies in pursuit 
of better fuel efficiency and enhanced corrosion performance, 
continues to provide Bodycote with market share gains. A number 
of new contract wins in each of our AGI focused Specialist 
Technologies of S
3
P , Low Pressure Carburising and Corr-I-Dur® 
continues to be a key driver of improved profitability in the AGI 
business.
The AGI business continued to see the benefits of mix 
improvement and market focus. Together with an emphasis 
on improved efficiency these factors have been crucial in the 
achievement of ongoing margin enhancements in this business.
Organisation and people
At 31 December 2015, the number of full-time equivalent 
employees in AGI was 3,331 compared to 3,616 at the end of 2014 
and 1,913 less than its peak in July 2008.
Looking ahead
The AGI businesses will continue to build on the success of 
enhancing margins through capturing high-value work. The focus 
on improving customer service helps drive this effort while the 
prioritisation of existing capacity in favour of higher value work and 
investing in Specialist Technologies provides additional momentum. 
In addition the Group will continue with its strategy of adding to its 
existing footprint in the rapid growth countries.

Group revenue was £567 .2m, a decrease of 6.9%, with revenues 
at constant exchange rates down 4.1% and foreign exchange rate 
movements having an adverse impact of 2.8%. 
Headline operating profit for the year decreased by 8.1% from 
£111 .1m to £102.1m and headline operating margin was 18.0% 
(2014: 18.2%). Headline operating profit at constant exchange 
rates decreased by £6.7m, whilst adverse foreign exchange rate 
movements decreased headline operating profit by a further £2.3m.
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets arises from 
acquisitions in prior years. The charge has increased to £4.2m  
(2014: £3.9m). 
Operating profit was £77 .9m (2014: £107 .0m) after charging £4.2m 
(2014: £3.9m) in respect of the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, £nil (2014: £0.2m) of acquisition costs and reorganisation 
costs of £20.0m (2014: £nil).
Headline operating cash flow
1
 for the Group was £81 .6m (2014: 
£100.0m). This was 80% of headline operating profit (2014: 90%). 
Net capital expenditure was 1 .2 times depreciation (2014: 1 .0 
times) as the Group continued to follow its strategy of investing 
in Specialist Technologies and greenfield facilities in higher growth 
markets. There was a working capital outflow in the year mainly due 
to an increase in receivable days caused by lower than anticipated 
cash collection in December and a decrease in payables, arising 
primarily due to a reduction in accruals for variable staff costs.
After deducting interest and tax, the Group recorded positive free 
cash flow
2
 of £47 .4m (2014: £75.1m).
Exceptional costs
Total exceptional costs charged to the income statement amounted 
to £20.0m (2014: £0.2m). Of this, reorganisation costs amounting 
to £23.8m (2014: £nil) were incurred, offset by a profit on disposal 
of the Group’s Brazilian and Indian operations of £3.8m (2014: £nil). 
Cost savings of £4m as a result of the reorganisation were realised 
in 2015 and a further £6m are anticipated in 2016. In 2015 no 
acquisition costs were expensed (2014: £0.2m). 
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2015 totalled 
£14.7m (2014: £9.4m), £11 .0m is expected to be spent in 2016 
and £3.7m in 2017 and later. All expenditure after the end of 2016 
relates to ongoing environmental remediation, primarily in the USA.

Finance charge
The net finance charge was £2.9m compared to £3.3m in 2014. The 
net interest payable is higher as a result of lower average net cash 
during the year, offset by lower bank and financing charges and a 
lower pension finance charge.

T axation
The taxation charge was £18.8m for the year (2014: £24.4m).
The effective taxation rate of 25.1% (2014: 23.5%) resulted from 
the blending of differing tax rates in each of the countries in which 
the Group operates. The increase in the taxation rate is primarily 
due to more of the Group’s profits deriving from countries with a 
higher rate of tax.
The headline taxation rate for 2015 was 24.4% (2014: 22.7%), being 
stated before accounting for exceptional items and amortisation of 
goodwill and acquired intangibles.
In recent years the Group’s effective tax rate has benefited from the 
use of historical tax losses, the majority of the remaining benefits 
of which are reflected in the 2015 taxation rate. As a result it is 
expected that the underlying Group effective taxation rate will be 
approximately 28% going forward, all other things remaining equal.
Earnings per share 
Basic headline earnings per share (as defined in note 10) decreased 
to 39.5p from 43.8p. Basic earnings per share for the year 
decreased to 29.6p from 41 .7p.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group aims to pay ordinary dividends so that dividend cover 
will be at or above 2.0 times earnings (see note 10). The Board 
may also recommend payment of a supplemental distribution to 
shareholders. The amount of any supplemental distribution will 
be assessed in light of the cash position of the Group, along with 
funding requirements for both organic growth and acquisitions.
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 10.3p 
(2014: 9.8p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 15.1p per share 
(2014: 14.4p). The Board has also recommended a supplemental 
distribution, by way of a special dividend, amounting to 10.0p 
per share (2014: 20.0p). If approved by shareholders, the final 
ordinary dividend of 10.3p per share for 2015 and the supplemental 
distribution of 10.0p per share for 2015 will be paid on 3 June 2016 
to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
22 April 2016.

Net assets decreased by £21 .3m (3.7%) to £549.6m (2014: 
£570.9m). At constant exchange rates, net assets decreased by 
£10.9m (1 .9%). The major movements compared to 31 December 
2014 were a decrease in net cash of £23.4m, an increase in 
goodwill and intangible assets of £3.1m and a decrease in property, 
plant and equipment of £5.0m. 
The decrease in property, plant and equipment was predominantly 
due to additions of £61 .1m offset by depreciation of £48.8m, asset 
impairments of £9.0m, foreign exchange movements of £3.8m, 
disposals of subsidiaries of £1 .0m, transfer of assets to assets held 
for sale of £0.3m and other asset disposals of £3.2m.
The increase in goodwill and intangible assets was due to 
continuing investment of £5.6m in Group IT systems, amortisation 
charge of £5.0m and foreign exchange movements of £2.6m.

Finance Directors’ report continued
Net cash
Group net cash at 31 December 2015 was £12.3m (2014: £35.7m). 
The Group continues to have access to committed facilities at 
competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be the 
most effective means of funding.
Cash flow
The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was £23.6m (2014: 
£21 .3m increase), made up of net cash from operating activities of 
£111 .3m (2014: £131 .6m), less investing activities of £59.9m (2014: 
£54.8m) and less cash used in financing activities of £75.0m  
(2014: £55.5m).
The decrease in net cash flow from operating activities from 
£131 .6m to £111 .3m was driven primarily by the decrease in 
headline EBITDA
3
 from £165.5m to £149.2m and a £6.3m decrease 
in payables. 
Net cash outflows from investing activities increased from £54.8m 
to £59.9m, primarily as a result of greater investment in property, 
plant and equipment in 2015 compared to the prior year. The level 
of net capital expenditure in 2015 was £61 .3m (2014: £53.8m), 
consistent with plans to increase the Group’s capacity in Specialist 
Technologies and in high growth markets.
Net cash outflows used in financing activities increased from 
£55.5m to £75.0m, due primarily to the increase in dividend 
payments, from £45.2m in 2014 to £66.0m in 2015.
There has been a continued focus on cash collection, although 
receivable days at 31 December 2015 increased by two to 62 days 
(2014: 60 days).
Net interest payments for the year were £2.6m (2014: £2.7m).  
Tax payments were £23.2m (2014: £19.0m).
Capital expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £61 .3m (2014: £53.8m). The 
multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was 1 .2 times 
(2014: 1 .0 times). Major capital projects which were in progress 
during 2015 include a new high pressure HIP in the USA, the 
creation of a new S
3
P facility in France, a new LPC facility in 
Mexico, the establishment of an aerospace focused facility in South 
East Poland, and the creation of Classical Heat Treatment facilities 
in Poland and China. The Group also continued to invest in the 
implementation of a new ERP system. As a consequence of the 
timing of these key projects, the value of assets under construction 
has increased by £9.6m, from £42.0m in 2014 to £51 .6m in 2015.
Borrowing facilities
The Group is financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, 
short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases.  
The Group’s funding policy aims to ensure continuity of finance at 
reasonable cost, based on committed and uncommitted facilities 
and loans from several sources over a spread of maturities. 
The Group continues to have access to committed facilities at 
competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be the 
most effective means of long-term funding.
The total undrawn committed facility funding available to the Group 
at 31 December 2015 was £230.0m (2014: £230.0m). The Group 
also has access to a US$10m committed letter of credit facility 
maturing in August 2016.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had the following committed 
facilities:

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising the 
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Board. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain gearing, determined as the proportion of net 
debt to total capital, within defined parameters, allowing movement 
in the capital structure appropriate to the business cycle and 
corporate activity. Due to the net cash position at 31 December 
2015 the gearing ratio is 0% (2014: 0%).
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the UK, 
Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the USA and cash lump 
sum obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the liabilities for which 
are reflected in the Group balance sheet.
The net deficits in these arrangements are as follows:

22 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
UK Scheme liabilities have decreased by £3.4m over the year 
(2014: £103.3m, 2015: £99.9m). This is largely due to a change in 
the actuarial assumptions used to assess the present value of the 
liabilities. Most notably, the discount rate assumption has increased 
from 3.30% in 2014 to 3.50% in 2015 which has resulted in a 
decrease in the liabilities and was only partially offset by an increase 
in the inflation assumptions over the year by 0.10%.
Scheme assets decreased in the year by £0.9m to £101 .4m  
(2014: £102.3m). 
The assumptions used indicate a surplus of £1 .5m. As the Group 
is not automatically entitled to recover this amount it is required 
to recognise additional liabilities under IFRIC14 to reflect existing 
future contractual commitments to the scheme of £4.2m. This 
results in a reported liability of £2.7m.
The liability for the other European Schemes decreased by £0.7m. 
The key reason for the decrease in the deficit in the European 
Schemes is an increase in the discount rate assumptions used in 
most countries due to rises in corporate bond yields over the year.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events that require disclosure  
in the financial statements.
Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report and 
the Group’s viability statement made on page 27 , the directors 
have considered the Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position. This includes an overview of the Group’s financial position, 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a 
combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted 
facilities and overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities 
are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due 
for renewal as set out below. There is sufficient headroom in the 
committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be 
operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2015 were as follows:
■ ■ £230m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 3 July 2019
■ ■ $10m Letter of Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
The December 2015 weighted average life of the committed 
facilities was 3.4 years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable 
potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current committed 
facilities.
The directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to access further funding. The directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Effective management and a robust assessment of risks is essential to the delivery of the Group’s objective of creating superior shareholder 
returns. The Group’s risk framework was reviewed by the Board during 2015 and updated to ensure it continues to meet UK Corporate 
Governance requirements. The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and the review of financial risk has been delegated to 
the Audit Committee. Under the leadership of the Group Head of Risk, Bodycote’s risk management framework is used to identify, report 
and manage its business critical risks. The Risk Committee, established in 2012, continued to meet during the year, attended by senior 
managers from each of the operating divisions. The role of the Risk Committee is to support the Group Head of Risk in identifying critical 
risks, to embed risk management and facilitate the implementation of risk management measures throughout the Group. 
A variety of approaches is used to identify and report risks, which are aggregated first at a divisional level and then at Group level. For each 
business critical risk, assurance activities have been documented in risk assurance maps and these are used to direct assurance activity. 
The Group Head of Risk provides an update to the Audit Committee on the Group’s risk activities at every meeting and a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s business critical risks is presented in December, the Committee concluded that a robust assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks had been undertaken. In addition, the Board examines a specific risk topic at each Board meeting and in 2015 this included a 
discussion on Group risk appetite.
The table below highlights the major risks that may affect Bodycote’s ability to deliver the strategy, as laid out on page 7 . These risks have 
been reviewed throughout the year and they have not materially changed since 2014. In the 2014 Annual Report the Group highlighted the 
risk that Bodycote’s operations could lead to damage to the environment. This is not currently considered to be a material risk to the Group 
but is subject to regular review. Details of the Group’s financial risks (funding, foreign exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks), which 
are managed by the Group’s treasury function, are provided in note 19 to the financial statements. The mitigating activities described below 
will help to reduce the impact or likelihood of the major risk occurring, although the Board recognises that it will not be possible to eliminate 
these risks entirely. Furthermore, there could be risks that may be unknown or that may be judged to be insignificant at present, but may 
later prove to be significant. For this reason business continuity plans have been prepared for all plants to provide for situations where 
specific risks have the potential to severely impact the business.

Markets
Bodycote operates in 24 countries 
and a substantial amount of sales are 
closely linked to the economic cycle 
and the general macro-economic 
environment.
The high proportion of fixed costs in 
the business means that a drop in 
sales will have a significant impact 
on profitability. Sales in the markets 
served by the AGI businesses (64% 
of the total Group) tend to develop in 
line with or ahead of the economic 
cycle, whereas aerospace and 
defence sales (24%) tend to track 
behind the economic cycle. Sales to 
the energy sectors (12%) are closely 
linked to energy prices, which in turn 
can be affected by general economic 
activity. 
■ ■ Bodycote’s presence in 24 
countries across a wide variety 
of end-markets acts as a natural 
hedge to neutralise localised 
economic volatility.
■ ■ There is some flexibility in the 
cost base e.g. by ensuring that 
a proportion of the workforce is 
employed on temporary contracts.
■ ■ Changes in customer demand on 
a local or a Group-wide level are 
responded to quickly.
Loss of key customers
Bodycote benefits from many  
long-term relationships with key 
customers and the damage to, or  
loss of, any of these relationships 
would be detrimental to the Group.
The loss of a key customer could 
adversely affect the Group’s financial 
results and the viability of one or 
more of Bodycote’s facilities.
■ ■ There is no significant customer 
dependency, with the Group’s top 
ten customers accounting for less 
than 15% of sales and the balance 
made up by many thousands of 
customers.
■ ■ There is a continued focus 
on customer service and 
quality processes to maintain 
excellent relationships with 
major customers. Key account 
management is in place 
and customer satisfaction is 
monitored.

Safety and health
The nature of Bodycote’s activities 
presents safety and health risks. 
Bodycote is committed to  
providing a safe work environment 
for its employees but Bodycote’s 
operations, if not properly managed, 
could have a significant impact on 
individual employees. Furthermore, 
poor safety and health practices 
could lead to disruption of business, 
financial penalties and loss of 
reputation.
■ ■ Group-wide health and safety

The Bodycote brand is reliant on the 
repeatable delivery of parts to agreed 
specification to an agreed time.
Deterioration in quality or service 
levels can cause serious long-term 
damage to Bodycote’s reputation 
with financial consequences such as 
the loss of a customer and the cost 
of damages or litigation. Work that

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Risk description Impact Mitigation and control
Relevance to
strategy
Major disruption at a facility
Bodycote’s business processes 
are inherently risky and there is a 
possibility that a major fire or utility 
outage could lead to closure of a 
facility’s operation. In addition a 
number of sites are exposed to 
natural hazards, such as earthquakes, 
flooding and storms.
Any significant incident at a site  
could result in the service to 
Bodycote’s customers from the 
affected site being disrupted.
■ ■ Bodycote has a global network 
of 178 facilities that creates a 
framework to provide back-up 
capability for any affected facility.
■ ■ Business continuity plans 
developed and updated and  
tested annually for all plants.
■ ■ Independent insurer inspections 
to assess hazard and business 
interruption risks.
■ ■ Scheduled equipment 
maintenance and inspections.
Information technology projects
The efficient operation of the 
Group will rely increasingly on the 
proper development and operation 
of its IT systems. Bodycote is 
currently undergoing a Group-wide 
implementation of a new ERP 
system.
Failure to manage the implementation 
of the ERP programme successfully 
could result in cost overruns and, 
potentially, disruption to the business.
■ ■ Project approval and progress 
subject to regular Board review.
■ ■ Project teams made up of 
skilled subject matter experts 
supplemented with third party 
advisers.
■ ■ Best practice project management 
processes in place with assurance 
provided by third parties.
■ ■ Defined disaster recovery planning 
and data backup procedures.
Regulatory risks
Regulatory and legislative 
compliance
The global nature of Bodycote’s 
operations means that the Group 
has to comply with a wide range 
of local and international legislative 
requirements, including anti-bribery 
and anti-competition legislation, 
taxation legislation, employment law 
and import and export controls.
Failure to comply with legislation 
could lead to substantial financial 
penalties, disruption to business, 
diversion of management time, 
personal and corporate liability and 
loss of reputation.
■ ■ Business processes are supported 
by HR policies and the Group Code 
of Conduct alongside training and 
awareness programmes.
■ ■ The “Open Door Line” 
whistleblower facility which is 
managed by a third party.
■ ■ Engagement of local specialists 
to support Bodycote at local, 
divisional and Group level.
■ ■ Regular audit of the effectiveness 
of implemented procedures.

Viability statement
In preparing this statement of viability, the directors have considered the prospects of the Group over the three year period immediately 
following the 2015 financial year. This longer-term assessment process supports the Board’s statements on both viability, as set out below, 
and going concern (on page 23). A three year period was determined as the most appropriate as it is the period covered by the Group’s 
annual strategic planning process, which sets the long-term direction of the Group and is reviewed at least annually by the directors. The 
Board concluded that a period of longer than three years would not be meaningful for the purpose of concluding on longer-term viability, 
given the limited forward visibility of the Group.
The strategic plan considers metrics which enable assessment of the Group’s key performance indicators (including return on capital 
employed, headline earnings per share and headline operating cash flow) in addition to net debt, liquidity and financing requirements.
In conducting the review of the Group’s prospects the directors assessed the three year plan alongside the Group’s current position, 
the Group’s strategy and the principal risks facing the Group (all of which are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 26). This 
assessment considered the impact of the principal risks on the business model and on future performance, liquidity and solvency and was 
mindful of the limited forward visibility that the Group has as it carries a minimal order backlog. The directors’ viability assessment included 
a review of the sensitivity analysis performed on the three year plan, whereby the principal risks, and particularly those related to markets 
and customers (see page 24), were applied to the plan in a number of diverging scenarios. The developed scenarios were designed to be 
plausible, yet severe.
In making this viability statement the directors considered the mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group in the event that the 
principal risks of the Company become realised. The directors also took into consideration the Group’s financial position at 31 December 
2015, with net cash of £12.3m, available committed facility headroom of £230m and a history of strong cash generation.
The directors have assessed the viability of the Group and, based on the procedures outlined above in addition to activities undertaken 
by the Board in its normal course of business, confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2018.

Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers and to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving the management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations are 
sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one of the 
key challenges for management is to ensure availability of appropriately 
qualified people to support its continued growth. Bodycote is fortunate 
to have a competent and committed international team that is well-
respected in technical and business circles. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people both 
at local and Group level. At a local level the Group is committed 
to providing the appropriate skills and technical training which will 
allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in their roles 
and deliver excellent customer service. At Group level a number 
of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive excellence in 
management.
A tool to develop further understanding and skill in the area of 
performance management is in place and is being used globally 
through the management population. Through communication of 
clear messages coupled with skills development, the organisation 
aims to raise the capability of its management population in 
driving performance. This initiative is backed by a performance 
management system which supports the process.
Bodycote’s employment policies are non-discriminatory, complying 
with all current legislation to engender equal opportunity 
irrespective of age, race, gender, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, 
health, disability, marital status, sexual preference, political or 
philosophical opinions or trade union membership. Harassment is 
not tolerated.
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% (2014: 14%) 
and at manager level it is 24% (2014: 27%). Females represent 
18% (2014: 17%) of our total workforce. We will increase female 
representation on the Board if appropriate candidates are available 
when Board vacancies arise.

Core values 
It is not just important what we do, but how we do it and how 
we behave in our Company. How we operate as a Group and the 
behaviours that we expect from all our employees are expressed in 
our Core Values. Our values represent Bodycote and its people and 
our commitment to the Company and the business.
Our Core Values are straightforward and are as follows:
Honesty and T ransparency
We are honest and act with integrity. Trust stems from honesty 
and trust is at the heart of everything we engage in: our customers 
trust us to deliver what we say we will, our colleagues trust us 
to act in their best interests and our suppliers trust us to conduct 
business according to agreed terms. This is not something we take 
for granted. Bodycote lives by a culture of honest and transparent 
behaviour, which is at the core of all our business relationships.
Respect and Responsibility
We manage our business with respect, applying an ethical approach 
to our dealings with those with whom we interact. We respect our 
colleagues, who are all of the employees of Bodycote. Part of our 
respect for our colleagues is our commitment to safe and responsible 
behaviour and our fundamental belief that no-one should come to 
any harm at work. We show respect for our customers, our suppliers 
and our competitors. We respect the communities around us and 
behave as responsible corporate citizens by being compliant with the 
laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business and by 
ensuring that our effect on the environment is minimal. We believe in 
taking ownership for, and being mindful of the impact of, our actions.
Creating V alue
Creating value is the very essence of our business and needs to be 
the focus of our endeavours. We create value for our customers, our 
employees and our shareholders. The realities are harsh. If we do not 
create value for our customers then we have no reason for existence. If 
we do not create value for our employees there will be no-one to create 
value for our customers. Our shareholders rightfully require that we 
ultimately create value for them as they are the owners of the business.
Human rights
Bodycote’s human rights policy is consistent with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact’s ten 
principles.
We prohibit forced, compulsory and underage labour and any 
form of discrimination based on age, race, gender, ethnic origin, 
nationality, religion, health, disability, marital status, sexual 
preference, political or philosophical opinions or trade union 
membership. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to minimise the 
potential for any contravention of these rules.
By publicly posting our human rights policy on www.bodycote.com, 
stakeholders worldwide can alert us to potential breaches of the 
policy. Our internal systems also support compliance with our policy 
and we have a robust Open Door Line for employees to report 
alleged violations of law and/or our policies on a confidential basis 
and in their own language. In the jurisdictions in which we employ a 
majority of our employees, there are laws applicable to many of the 
areas dealt with in our human rights policy.
Customers and suppliers
Bodycote has no significant suppliers who are wholly dependent 
upon the Group’s business and has no significant suppliers on 
which the Group is dependent upon for a substantial part of its 
business. Suppliers are paid in line with contractual and legal 
obligations.
We endeavour to respond quickly to changing customer demand, 
to identify emerging needs and to improve service availability and 
quality. We stay close to our current and potential customers, 
building long-term relationships.
Community
Bodycote seeks to play a positive role in the local communities 
in which it operates by providing employment opportunities, 
and building goodwill and a reputation as a good neighbour and 
employer.
Responsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical 
standard, consistent with an international UK-listed company. 
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal 
interests do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. 
Shareholder employees are advised of and comply with share 
dealing codes.
Bodycote has systems in place that are designed to ensure 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and conformity 
with all relevant codes of business practice. Furthermore, Bodycote 
does not make political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ unfair 
trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within the 
requirements of the applicable laws. Employees are prohibited from 
either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern verbally or in writing and in confidence to an independent 
third party provider, ensuring anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Group Head of Risk, who then passes the matter to 
the appropriate individual in the business to be addressed.
Online training courses in respect of Anti-Bribery and Competition 
Law have been designed and translated into the major languages 
used throughout the Group. All relevant employees have completed 
the interactive courses.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Operational SHE performance
Bodycote is committed to continual improvement in our safety, 
health and environmental performance (SHE). We are committed 
to complying with all local legislative requirements as a minimum; 
and additionally establishing consistent and robust best practices 
at all of our sites to deliver consistently high performance across all 
aspects of SHE management. 
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
inevitably exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of robust safety control systems and 
procedures, and seeks to establish these at all sites. 
Bodycote’s online incident reporting and SHE management tool 
has been operational since 2013. This has enabled more consistent 
and thorough reporting of workplace injuries, near misses and 
unsafe conditions. Following the implementation, there was an 
increase in the lost time injury rate frequency (LTI rate) in 2013 
as sites were better able to record and report incidents. In 2014, 
the LTI rate fell to 1 .7 , re-establishing the previous trend of annual 
improvements in LTI rates in recent years and in 2015 the LTI rate 
has shown a further decline to 1 .5. Although regrettable and not 
acceptable, accidents represent learning opportunities and so 
accurate reporting is an essential part of building a robust safety 
management system.
Despite the improvement in the overall performance of safety 
across the Group we regret to state that one of our colleagues 
was seriously injured in an accident at a facility in North America 
on 22 October 2015 and, as a result of these injuries, he died on 
17 February 2016. Our thoughts and condolences are with his 
family, friends and colleagues. We have investigated the incident 
thoroughly and are cooperating with the relevant authorities in their 
ongoing enquiries.
Accident frequency (lost time injury rate) 
Accident frequency is defined as the number of lost time accidents 
x 200,000 hours (approximately 100 man years), divided by the total 
number of employee hours worked.
In addition to encouraging the reporting of work related injuries, 
Bodycote has sought to encourage the reporting of near misses 
and unsafe conditions. This has worked very well since the 
introduction of the new global incident reporting system and a 
common near miss/unsafe condition reporting system at every 
operational site. This much improved reporting of incidents permits 
us to address hazards before injury occurs. As our database 
continues to develop we will be able to analyse and prioritise our 
safety action programmes more effectively.
All reportable incidents and lost time injuries are reviewed during 
executive management meetings and Board meetings. In addition, 
the executive management team reviews incidents which did not 
result in injury but were considered to have been serious or to 
have had a high potential impact. All serious incidents and high 
potential incidents are also reviewed by the Group SHE Committee 
and are cascaded within the business as appropriate to ensure that 
preventive actions are taken. This system was further strengthened 
in 2015 with actions being tracked via the online incident 
management system.
Environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption, and to re-use heat energy. The ongoing effort 
to lessen the impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
seeking ISO 14001 accreditation at all of its facilities. In addition, 
many of our sites are in the process of obtaining ISO 50001 Energy 
Management Systems Standard.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to reduce the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of 
our customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, 
which is operated around the clock so as to optimise treatment 
processing cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be 
using older in-house technology and running their equipment at 
reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. Working 
with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more easily to 
carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of our customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and by enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in the 
reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering a cost-
effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to manufacture 
new replacement parts, and treated parts often last up to twenty 
times longer than the original.
Whilst thermal processing is an energy-intensive business, it is a 
vital part of the manufacturing chain and its use saves the energy it 
consumes many times over.

Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions resulting from fuel usage 
and the operation of facilities. Scope 2 emissions are indirect 
energy emissions resulting from purchased electricity, heat, steam 
or cooling for own use.
The financial control consolidation approach has been used to report 
the above data. This method aligns with the reporting scope in the 
financial statements. The Group collects electricity and natural gas 
usage information from each facility on a monthly basis. The Group 
then applies the UK Government’s Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published national carbon 
conversion factors to calculate the total tonnage of CO
2
e produced. 
Group operational management actively monitors their monthly 
CO
2
e emissions reported and the Group’s Executive Committee 
reviews the level of CO
2
e emissions on a monthly basis.
All entities and facilities under financial control are included within 
the disclosure. Emissions less than 1% of the Group’s total CO
2
e 
relating to fugitive emissions and owned vehicles are not significant 
and are excluded. As such there are no significant omissions from 
this disclosure.
ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is 
taken very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 
14001 helps to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects 
at Bodycote’s locations. At the end of 2015, 91% of our operating 
facilities had achieved ISO 14001 accreditation (2014: 87%). 
Operational plants which have not yet received accreditation to the 
standard are working towards it, including several of the facilities 
acquired and constructed during 2012–2014. Some older sites, 
which were accredited, have been closed.
The fall in percentage in 2012 was due to the facilities acquired in 
that year which had not obtained accreditation.
Carbon footprint and water consumption 
The absolute energy usage decreased by 5.2%, though sales at 
constant exchange rates decreased by 4.1%. 
The total CO
2
e emissions per £m sales in 2015 were 621 .9 Te (2014: 
as previously reported 610.2 Te; normalised
†
 628.2 T e). 
The Group’s total CO
2
e emission data is based on Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions, as defined by the UK Government’s DEFRA, 
and data relating to this has been calculated to include country-
specific electricity conversion factors.
Water usage per £m sales increased by 8.8%. On a normalised
†
 
basis, water usage per £m sales increased by 5.7%.
In 2015 our EU based operational sites have sought to achieve 
compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU. 
This Directive is transposed into local legislation and requires 
sites to monitor their energy usage and assess energy reduction 
opportunities which are in addition to the ongoing energy saving 
activities on sites. One mechanism for ensuring compliance is 
for sites to become certified to ISO 50001 Energy Management 
Systems Standard. This enables sites to measure energy usage 
consistently and target the most effective ways of reducing 
energy usage. Our sites in France, Germany, Austria, Denmark and 
Netherlands are largely already certified and working on further 
energy management programmes.
In the UK all Bodycote plants were audited by TUV Sud with support 
from npower. As expected this identified that over 97 .5% of total 
energy consumption is at operating sites. Of these, the estimated 
energy savings would be less than 6% in 59% of the operating 
plants, demonstrating that a high level of energy efficiency is 
already well established. The main opportunities identified for 
energy savings in the remaining sites were primarily incorporating 
existing good practice throughout the Group, such as energy 
efficient lighting, increased fitting of variable speed drives on water 
cooling systems, and additional insulation on some furnaces.
One example was energy efficiency lighting which was installed at 
our Skelmersdale Surface Technology plant, producing a saving of 
69.5Te CO
2
e per year with a payback of 1 .3 years. Similar lighting 
has been installed at other sites with the added benefit of improving 
lighting levels and safety, such as Chard, Coventry and Haag-Winden 
which have seen projected savings of 35, 80 and 15 Te CO
2
e each 
year. The TUV/ npower report identified similar savings at other sites 
and will help Bodycote identify cost-effective energy savings.
Another example of best practice identified was the HybridCarb 
generator recently installed at our Rotherham facility, which replaces 
the endothermic generator with a more efficient system that not 
only generates the process gas, but also recycles it for further 
heat treatment, greatly increasing the carburising efficiency. This 
gassing method offers the possibility of saving 90% of the process 
gas during the carburisation cycle, thus reducing the exhausting of 
carbon dioxide (CO
2
) caused during the process-gas burn-off. This 
new unit is currently being assessed for use at other sites, subject 
to establishing the full benefit. A further three units have already 
been ordered for use at our Chard facility.
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
facilities have been introduced. In 2015, the normalised† solvent use 
showed a slight increase of 5.6% compared with the previous year.
Cautionary statement
The Strategic report has been prepared solely to provide additional 
information to shareholders to assess the Group’s strategies and 
the potential for those strategies to succeed.
The Strategic report contains certain forward-looking statements. 
These statements are made by the directors in good faith based on 
the information available to them up to the time of their approval of 
this report and such statements should be treated with caution due 
to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business 
risk factors, underlying any such forward-looking information.

Injecting life into alloy steel – a component journey
INJECTING LIFE INTO ALLOY STEEL - A COMPONENT JOURNEY
  To obtain the correct core 
structure prior to nitriding, 
the part is hardened and 
tempered, to provide the 
necessary toughness and 
impact resistant properties.
 The part is thermal deburred 
to remove any burrs in the 
passageways and to activate 
the surface by neutralising 
the chromium, which helps 
accelerate the diffusion of 
nitrogen into the surface during 
the nitriding cycle, ensuring 
a uniform case depth.
  Controlled gas nitriding 
gives the part very high 
surface hardness with 
minimum distortion, 
providing excellent wear 
and corrosion resistance. 
Due to the nitriding process, minimal finishing 
operations are needed. The part undergoes 
finish grinding and lapping to its final size. 
AUTOMOTIVE DIESEL INJECTORS
Injector part failure due to wear is a costly 
hazard, leading to potential damage to other 
areas of the engine. The diesel injectors shown 
in this example are used in trucks, and each 
truck can have between 6-12 injectors. As part 
of the manufacturing process, the part must 
go through various thermal processing stages 
to enable it to perform to the required 
standard in service.
 Denotes the parts of the component journey undertaken by Bodycote
BODYCOTE COMPONENT JOURNEYS
This is just one example of how Bodycote brings together the 
huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group 
to provide the vital engineering services our customers need...
For more component journeys visit www.bodycote.com
The injector is rough 
machined to within tight 
tolerance of its final 
size, adding fuel ports 
and passageways.
The injector begins life 
either as an alloy steel 
forging or steel bar.

Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s message
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce the Group’s corporate governance report on behalf of our Board of Directors. We are committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance to enhance performance underpinned by our business model. We have sought to manage the 
affairs of the Group not by merely following regimented rules, but by promoting a culture of open and transparent discussion, constructive 
challenge and support in the Board and across the Group. Effective governance starts at the top, with clear roles, responsibilities and 
lines of reporting. Directors have to operate within applicable laws and regulations, which include corporate governance rules. In addition, 
directors have to operate within the mandate given to them by shareholders, for example, in the Company’s Articles of Association. On a 
more practical level the directors operate under agreed Board procedures such as the schedule of matters reserved for the Board, the role 
and descriptions of the Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director, and service contracts and appointment letters. 
The main Group-wide governance documents are our Core Values and the Code of Conduct, which set out the values and standards that 
we expect of our employees. These documents, together with our policies, govern how we conduct our business and set the standards 
that drive performance. Compliance training helps to enforce this. Board oversight, reviews and audits form part of the monitoring and 
supervision process. The important governance developments at Bodycote over the last year are detailed in the governance reporting 
section below.
It is of great importance to me, as Chairman, to ensure that the Board has the right composition. This means having the right balance 
of skills and experience to contribute, and where appropriate challenge, decision making and ensuring that all directors have a good 
knowledge of the Group and the context in which it operates.
I encourage all shareholders to attend the AGM, which will be held at our Macclesfield head office on 27 May 2016. This event provides an 
excellent opportunity to meet the executive and independent non-executive directors.
A.M. Thomson

Governance reporting
Board diversity
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 24 countries and diversity is an integral part of how we do business. The Nomination 
Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant skills, experience, knowledge, 
personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our overriding aim in any new 
appointment must always be to select the best candidate. We have made progress in addressing the issue of Board gender and diversity 
by appointing E. Lindqvist to the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 June 2012. We also appointed I.B. Duncan as a Non-Executive 
Director on 17 November 2014 as part of Board refreshment. We will further address this issue when we discuss Board succession 
planning in the coming year. The Board is kept deliberately small and currently comprises two executive directors, three non-executive 
directors and a non-executive chairman. We believe it is difficult to set targets or timescales for the percentage of women, or any other 
group, on our Board and do not propose to do so.
38 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% (2014: 14%) and at manager level it is 24% (2014: 27%). Females represent 18% 
(2014: 17%) of our total workforce. We will increase female representation on the Board if appropriate candidates are available when Board 
vacancies arise.
The Corporate responsibility and sustainability report contains further details regarding the male and female representation within the 
Group, including Board representation. 
Board evaluation
The Board has undertaken its second external Board Evaluation during 2015. Following a review of proposals from external facilitators, the 
Board appointed ICSA Board Evaluation to facilitate a review of its performance. The facilitator Mr G.A.G. Shepheard (who is independent of 
the Group), met with each director on an individual basis to obtain their views on seven aspects of the Board’s performance and to ascertain 
whether their needs and expectations were being met. The evaluator ensured that pre-defined constituent elements of each topic were 
covered in the discussions and a qualitative score was assigned by each director. The seven topics were as follows:
■ ■ Board responsibilities
■ ■ Oversight
■ ■ Board meetings
■ ■ Support for the Board
■ ■ Board composition
■ ■ Working together
■ ■ Outcome and achievements
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board at its meeting in October 2015 which Mr Shepheard attended and the directors 
discussed the recommendations which are now in the process of being implemented. Additional emphasis will be placed on succession 
planning and certain operational matters. The approach to Board Evaluation included relevant questions to cover the activities of each Board 
committee. The Board is considered to be functional and working well.  Arising from the exercise, the Board has concluded that its focus 
should remain on divisional growth strategies, technology development, risk and sustainability as well as continued training. The overall 
conclusion is that the Board is performing well and high governance standards have been adopted. It is apparent that the Executive is being 
strongly challenged by the Board when appropriate.
As in previous years, the Chairman has assessed the performance of each Board member by conducting individual interviews and we can 
confirm that all directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Executive Directors Messrs S.C. Harris and D.F . Landless were also appraised in February 2016. 
Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the directors carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in September 
2015. The Board is satisfied with the Chairman’s commitment and performance.
T raining
All new directors are subject to a tailored induction programme covering a diverse range of topics including trading, investor relations, 
organisational and legal matters. The Board receives training via ad hoc presentations and papers from advisers and the Group Company 
Secretary. External periodic training on important topics takes place through the Deloitte Academy and during the year the directors 
received training on financial reporting developments and in particular on the viability statement.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior executive leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. 
The plans are reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.
Board refreshment will continue over the coming years.

Core values
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining and maintaining the Group’s values and ensures these are reflected in the 
business practices. This is monitored by the Board at regular intervals. Further details are available on page 31 .
Pre-emption rights
In line with best practice provisions in the Pre-emption Group Statement of Principles, the Board confirms that it does not intend to issue 
more than 7 .5% of the issued share capital of the Group on a non pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period.
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2015, Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in September 2014 (“the Code”).
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2015, Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the Code with the exception of provision 
E1 .1 . As in previous years, the Board has taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director to manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss overall 
strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of communication have 
failed would the Board expect the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) or other non-executive directors to become involved, 
notwithstanding that the Code specifies attendance of the (SID) at meetings with major shareholders. The SID has contacted major 
shareholders and offered to facilitate meetings with them should they have any concerns they wish to discuss. Regular feedback from 
the Group’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all directors. During the year the Chairman met with 
shareholders to discuss governance matters.
Apart from this distinct area, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the Code throughout 2015.
Operation of the Code
Taken together with the Report of the Audit Committee, the Report of the Nomination Committee and the Board report on remuneration 
presented on pages 48 to 73, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in 
the Code.
Leadership
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Group’s strategic objectives, values and standards, and 
ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on eight occasions during 2015, including a specific meeting to review and update the Group’s long-term strategy. The 
Board of Directors comprises six members, of whom four are non-executive directors and two are executive directors, led by the Group’s 
part-time Non-Executive Chairman, A.M. Thomson, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Group Chief Executive is S.C. Harris 
and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is R. Rajagopal. I.B. Duncan chairs the Audit Committee and E. Lindqvist is Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. Brief biographical details of all directors are given on pages 36 and 37 . During the year the Board visited a 
number of UK and overseas facilities, including sites in the UK and Poland. Such events involved meetings with local management and the 
unit workforce to better understand technical and operational performance in countries where Bodycote has a significant presence.

Corporate governance statement continued
Matters reserved for the Board were reviewed during the year and updated where required. Certain defined powers and issues reserved for 
the Board to decide are, inter alia:
■ ■ Strategy;
■ ■ Approval of financial statements and circulars;
■ ■ Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
■ ■ Annual budgets;
■ ■ Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and succession planning;
■ ■ Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and environment, donations;
■ ■ Committees’ terms of reference;
■ ■ Board and committee chairmen and membership;
■ ■ Investments;
■ ■ Equity and bank financing;
■ ■ Internal control and risk management;
■ ■ Corporate governance;
■ ■ Key external and internal appointments; and
■ ■ Employee share incentives and pension arrangements.
In advance of Board meetings, directors are supplied with up-to-date information regarding the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, in addition to the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year results, budgets and 
forecasts. They are also supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and 
details of the safety and health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work. 
Senior management from across the Group and advisers attend some of the meetings to provide updates. The exposure to members of 
senior management from across the Group helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the business, the implementation of strategy and 
the changing dynamics of the markets in which the Group operates.
Where required, a director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Group. All directors have 
access to the Group Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues with the SID. In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all newly appointed directors must submit themselves for re-election. All directors stand for yearly re-election. Non-executive 
directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding three years from the date of first election by shareholders, 
after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 74. The 
Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. All 
non-executive directors serve on each Board Committees.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members serve for a period of six years, which will only be extended in 
certain circumstances. If letters of appointment are extended beyond six years, the fixed term is reduced to one year.
In order that necessary actions can be taken promptly, a Finance Sub-Committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing him, any other non-
executive director), the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director operates between the dates of scheduled Board meetings 
and is authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, tax or investment matters.

Corporate governance statement continued
Proposals for re-election
The Board decided, in line with the Code, that all directors will retire annually and, other than in the case of any director who has decided  
to stand down from the Board, will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM. Accordingly A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless,  
E. Lindqvist and I.B. Duncan will stand for re-election at the 2016 AGM. R. Rajagopal will retire as a Non-Executive Director at the  
May 2016 AGM. The Board recommends to shareholders that they re-elect (or elect) all the directors. In accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code, Board members will serve for a period of six years which may be extended in certain circumstances.
The performance of each director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management policies and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social 
engagement. 
The Board believes that the Group maintains an effective system of internal controls which is in accordance with the FRC’s guidance 
entitled ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors’ (formerly referred to as the Turnbull Report guidance) and, in the view of 
the Board, no significant deficiencies have been identified in the system. The system was in operation throughout 2015 and continues 
to operate up to the date of the approval of this report. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management and from internal 
audit to consider whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The 
Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging these review responsibilities. In September 2014 the FRC issued guidance on ‘Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting’ which replaces the ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors’ currently being applied by the Group. The new guidance was applied in the Group’s 2015 accounting period.
The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix clearly 
sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
The Board with the assistance of the Internal Audit department monitors the Group’s internal financial control system. Internal Audit reviews 
are conducted on the basis of plans approved by the Audit Committee, to which Internal Audit reports are submitted on a regular basis.
Every Bodycote site provides assurance on specified financial and non-financial controls through a control self-assessment process. The 
results are validated by Internal Audit through spot checks and are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition, the President and the Vice 
President of Finance of each division sign a letter of representation annually to confirm the adequacy of their systems of internal controls, 
their compliance with Group policies, relevant laws and regulations, and that they have reported any control weaknesses through the 
Group’s assurance processes. 
During 2015, in compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, management performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual 
Report. Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included a review of the Group’s 
key strategic and operational risks, which is summarised from work performed by the Group Head of Risk and the Group’s Risk Committee 
to identify risks (by means of workshops, interviews, investigations and by reviewing departmental or divisional risk registers). Further 
information regarding the ways in which the principal business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are managed is shown on pages 
24 to 26. No new significant risks were identified as part of this process, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy 
any significant failings or weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.

Investor relations
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively, 
and this has enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy. In addition, internet users are able to 
view up-to-date news on the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users of the website can access 
recent announcements and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a regular basis, Bodycote’s financial 
advisers, corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide the directors with opinion surveys from analysts and investing 
institutions following visits and meetings with the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chairman and SID are available 
to discuss any issues not resolved by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. On specific issues, such as the review of 
remuneration packages, the Group has sought and will continue to seek the views of leading investors.

Directors’ report
The directors are pleased to submit their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Finance Director’s report and all the information contained on pages 36 to 73 
together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Strategic report
The Strategic report is provided on pages 6 to 35 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the Group’s businesses, 
the financial performance during the year ended 31 December 2015, key performance indicators, a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group and information about the use of financial instruments. The Strategic report has been prepared solely to 
assist the shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other 
party for any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have been made by the directors in good faith using information available up to 
the date of this report and such statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and 
business risks. Since the end of the financial year no important events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 10.3p (2014: 9.8p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 15.1p per share (2014: 
14.4p). The Board has also recommended a supplemental distribution, by way of a special dividend, amounting to 10.0p per share (2014: 
20.0p). If approved by shareholders, the final ordinary dividend of 10.3p per share for 2015 and the supplemental distribution of 10.0p per 
share for 2015 will be paid on 3 June 2016 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 April 2016.
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2015 was £33.1m. No shares were issued during the year. At the AGM 
on 23 April 2015 the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase up to 22,046,468 of its own shares. This authority expires at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming AGM to be held on 27 May 2016, at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 24. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by 
a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 38. Under 
the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,023,234.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as 
a whole, and the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.
Directors
The current directors and their biographical details are listed on page 36 and 37 and all served throughout the year. Under the Articles 
of Association of the Company each director must retire from office and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every 
third AGM in order to continue to serve as a director. However, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further increase 
accountability, all directors retired at the AGM in 2015 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going forward all directors will retire 
at the AGM and will stand for re-election by the shareholders, if they wish to continue to serve as directors of the Company. Accordingly, 
those directors retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2016 AGM are A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless, I.B. Duncan 
and E. Lindqvist. R Rajagopal will step down as a director at the 2016 AGM and will not stand for re-election. The service agreements for 
Messrs S.C. Harris and D.F . Landless are terminable by 12 months’ notice. The remaining directors do not have a service agreement with 
the Company and their appointments are terminable by six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and details of the directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 54 to 73. No director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2015. Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) has 
remained in force for the directors for the year ended 31 December 2015 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the benefit 
of the current directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the course of 
their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the 
Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.
Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only 
had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential. 
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a “Situational 
Conflict”) which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one company. In order to ensure that each 
director was complying with the new duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational 
Conflicts affected him or her. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict until 
September 2016 and permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors’ meetings, on the basis that each such 
46 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
director continued to keep Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the 
interests of shareholders. Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman 
or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment of 
employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation in strategy, production, safety and 
health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to the Group 
made by their site and are advised of safety and health issues. Under the Group’s Open Door Line employees’ concerns can be voiced over 
the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 3,600 Bodycote employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, 
which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination. It is the Group’s policy to 
give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, 
and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an 
employee become disabled, the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the employment and arrange appropriate training. An equal 
opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of greenhouse gas emissions are included within the Corporate responsibility and sustainability section of this report. 
Donations
There were no political contributions in 2014 or 2015.
Shareholders
An analysis of the Company’s shareholders and the shares in issue at 18 February 2016 together with details of the interests of major 
shareholders in voting shares notified to the Company pursuant to chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules are given on page 
139.
Auditor
In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor 
is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
■ ■ so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
■ ■ each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The 2016 Annual General Meeting will be held on 27 May 2016 in accordance with the notice being sent to shareholders with this report.

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce the Nomination Committee report for 2015. The Committee’s key objective is to support the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities to ensure there is a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the Board and to 
ensure that effective succession planning processes are in place across the Group. John Biles, former Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and Senior Independent Director (SID), stood down at the 2015 AGM. Ian Duncan has taken over as Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
Raj Rajagopal was appointed SID. The Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that the present and future composition of the Board 
is appropriate for the delivery of the Group’s strategy and that all relevant UK Corporate Governance Code requirements continue to be met.
A.M. Thomson
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board, whose principal purpose is to advise on the appointment and, if necessary, 
dismissal of executive and non-executive directors. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are listed on the Group’s website, include 
all matters required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”). Further information on the Code can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website www.frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are reviewed annually by the Group Company Secretary and the 
Chairman, and any changes are then referred to the Board for approval. No changes were made to the terms of reference during the year. 
Composition of the Nomination Committee
As recommended by the Code, the Chairman of the Board acts as the Chairman of the Committee whose members also comprise the 
directors listed above. To ensure executive input on nominations matters, the Chief Executive is also a member of the Committee. The 
Chairman cannot chair the Committee when it is dealing with either the succession to the 
Chairmanship of the Group or the review of his own performance. Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend the Committee meetings. Other individuals and external 
advisers may be invited to attend for all, or part of, any meeting when it is appropriate. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be an 
independent non-executive director.
The Group Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that is required, from any officer or 
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. In connection with its duties, the Committee is 
authorised by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or other professional 
advice, at the Group’s expense) as it considers necessary, including requests for information 
from, or commissioning investigations by, external advisers.
Director appointment policy and progress
The Committee has developed a formal rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors. Prior to making any appointment, the Committee, having 
evaluated the skills, experience and diversity of the Board, will determine the qualities and 
experience they seek and will then prepare a detailed description of the role with a view to 
appointing the most appropriate candidate. The Committee will use open advertising or the 
services of independent external advisers to facilitate the search.
A long list of candidates will be drawn up, from which an appropriate number will be selected 
for interview. Upon completion the Committee will recommend to the Board the appointment 
of the preferred candidate.
Board succession planning
Upon the retirement of J.A. Biles at the 2015 AGM, he was replaced as Senior Independent 
Director by R. Rajagopal and as Audit Committee Chair by I.B. Duncan who joined the Board in 
2014 in anticipation of this retirement. After eight years as a member of the Board,  
R. Rajagopal will step down in May 2016. The Committee, advised by an international search 
consultancy, is currently engaged in the process of identifying a suitably qualified individual 
to join the Board. A formal announcement will be made once a suitable candidate has been 
appointed.

Main activities of the Nomination Committee
In 2015 the Committee formally met five times and reviewed the composition and skills of the Board, with a view to considering the current 
and future skills and experience that the Board might require.
The Committee discussed succession planning and Board diversity, and reviewed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and other 
senior executives. In particular, the need to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed. 
The Committee considered and authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might arise where a director has fiduciary responsibilities 
in respect of other organisations. The Committee concluded that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee also assigned 
the Chairman to review and agree with the Group Chief Executive his personal objectives for the forthcoming year.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Committee carried out its second external Board Evaluation during 2015. The project 
was undertaken by Geoffrey Shepheard of ICSA Board Evaluation, who presented the report to the October Nomination Committee 
meeting, with both executive and non-executive directors in attendance. Further details of the review can be found in the Corporate 
Governance section of the Annual Report. Recommendations arising from the 2015 Board Evaluation are in the process of being addressed.
In December 2015 the Nomination Committee reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of the process for Board and 
Committee meetings, and best practice for the handling of a number of Board issues including drawing up a training programme for the 
directors. The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed in conjunction with the Model Terms of Reference issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The biographical details of the current directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 . Having 
reviewed their independence and contribution to Board matters, the Committee confirms that the performance of each of the directors 
standing for re-election at the 2016 AGM continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles, including independence 
of judgement and time commitment for Board and Committee meetings. Accordingly the Committee has recommended to the Board that, 
with the exception of R. Rajagopal, all current directors of the Company be proposed for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
As Chairman of the Committee I will be available at the 2016 AGM to answer questions relating to the work of the Committee.

Introduction
The Committee has continued to focus on the integrity of Bodycote’s financial reporting, risk management and internal controls and on 
the quality of the external and internal audit processes. The Committee will continue to keep our activities under review as the regulatory 
environment changes.
Membership
The members of the Audit Committee are all independent non-executive directors. Their biographical details are shown on pages 36 and 37 
and their remuneration on page 71 . The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Audit Committee. In April 2015, J.A. Biles stepped 
down as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
I.B. Duncan was appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee as of March 2015 and was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company on 17 November 2014. The Board considers that I.B. Duncan has recent and relevant financial experience. He qualified as a 
Chartered Accountant with Deloitte & Touche, served as a plc Finance Director (Royal Mail Holdings plc 2006-2010) and has chaired the 
Audit Committee of several other plcs. 
Objective
The Committee’s objective is to provide effective governance over the Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the management and oversight of the Group’s systems of internal control, financial risks and the performance of internal audit 
and the appointment and performance of the external auditor.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee met four times during 2015 and in February 2016 and all members attended all meetings that they were eligible to 
attend. The Committee Chairman also invited the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller 
and Group Head of Risk (who is responsible for internal audit) to attend all meetings. Other executives from the Group were also invited, 
as appropriate, to attend certain meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues. The Committee Chairman also invited the 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), to every meeting. 
I.B. Duncan also held preparatory meetings separately with Deloitte, the Group Financial Controller and the Group Head of Risk prior to 
most Committee meetings to review their reports and discuss issues in detail. The external auditor met with the Audit Committee without 
the executives present.

Main activities of the Committee during the year
As part of the process of working with the Board to carry out its responsibilities and to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee 
generally take place just prior to Board meetings.
At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas:
Financial reporting 
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review with management and the external auditor the 
appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
■ ■ the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
■ ■ the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditor;
■ ■ the clarity of disclosures and compliance with Financial Reporting Standards; and
■ ■ whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance.
Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also 
reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their work. The Committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that 
the scope of the audit was appropriate and that Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work. 
Principal areas of judgement
The principal areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2015 accounts were as follows:
■ ■ Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible fixed assets. The Committee challenged the assumptions, particularly the discount rate 
and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the sensitivity analysis applied and 
the projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill and intangibles and tangible assets. Details of the 
sensitivity analysis applied to key assumptions used in the impairment review are set out in note 11 to the Financial Statements on 
pages 102 and 103. The Committee has concluded that no impairment charge is required in the year, other than those included within 
reorganisation costs.
■ ■ Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions. The Committee received reports, including from professional advisers, and 
challenged the basis and completeness of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions and the appropriateness of disclosures in 
the Report. The Committee discussed with management the key judgements behind all provisions, taking note of the range of possible 
outcomes, and agreed with their recommendations. The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions used in calculating the 
2015 reorganisation charges.
■ ■ Taxation. A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised. The 
Committee reviewed the associated risks and challenged management’s assessment concerning the Group’s key tax risks, noting the 
work of the OECD in respect of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), and management’s forecast of the future taxable profits of the 
relevant businesses.
■ ■ Viability Statement. The Committee challenged the validity of the assumptions used in the preparation of the three year strategic plan, 
used as the basis of the assessment of the longer-term viability of the Group, in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits 
and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to 
consider the impact of certain risks and to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.
■ ■ Going concern. The Committee challenged the validity of the going concern assumption used in the preparation of the Annual Report, 
in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and 
covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.
■ ■ Pension liabilities. Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities. The Committee challenged the 
assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate, life expectancy and the application of IFRIC 14 to the UK pension 
scheme, by considering current norms and the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the assumptions.

Risk management
The Committee reviewed a report at each meeting from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Group’s 
risk management framework. The Committee reviewed changes to the principal risks and mitigating actions identified by management. The 
Committee also received quarterly reports on issues raised via the Open Door Line (an external independent service where employees may 
report matters of concern) and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk.
Internal control
At each meeting the Committee considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls and 
requested certain changes to those controls. The Committee also performed an annual review of the Group’s internal control processes and 
considers the system to be effective and in accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting as issued by the FRC (September 2014).
Internal audit
The internal audit plan for 2016 was presented to the Committee in October 2015 and accepted following discussions and challenge as to 
the scope and areas of focus. At each meeting the Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee on the status of internal audit 
plans for the current year, points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness. The status of 
these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed. The Committee also received reports on actual or suspected 
frauds and thefts by third parties and employees. None had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and 
procedures were altered to minimise the risk of recurrence.
External audit
At the April and October meetings the external auditor presented their audit plans for the interim review and year -end audit respectively. The 
Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components. In 2015 the Committee 
considered carefully the scope in respect of smaller and more remote locations and noted that all local audits are undertaken by Deloitte.
T raining
Updates were presented to the Committee on new accounting developments and any changes in corporate governance requirements that 
may affect the Group. Committee members also attended training briefings by accounting firms and other advisers.
Overview
The Committee examined the 2015 Annual Report and was specifically tasked by the Board to advise it on whether the 2015 Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable. The Committee did this by satisfying itself that there was a robust process of review and challenge to 
ensure balance and consistency. In doing so the Committee examined these processes, which included the allocation of responsibility for 
the preparation of certain sections of the Annual Report to individuals in the head office team and a second person taking responsibility for 
the review process of each section of the Annual Report. Additional reviews were carried out by internal and external personnel including an 
independent legal review.
The Committee also reviewed the Annual Report. Taken as a whole, in the light of their knowledge of the Group and its performance, the 
outcome of the activities described above and based on robust discussion with both management and the external auditor, the Committee 
has concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
strategy, business model, position and performance, and reported to the Board accordingly.
External audit
Appointment
The Committee considers the re-appointment of the external auditor each year and as part of this process considers the independence of 
the auditor and the effectiveness of the external audit process. Having reviewed the performance of Deloitte in 2015, the Committee has 
decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed for the 2016 audit and a resolution to this effect will be put to the 2016 
AGM. The Committee reviewed and agreed the fee for 2016.
The external auditor is required to change the lead partner every five years and other partners periodically in order to protect independence 
and objectivity and provide fresh challenge to the Group. Mr M. Mullins replaced Mrs N. Mitchell as current lead partner in 2015.
Deloitte has been the Group’s auditor for 14 years.
In accordance with the transition arrangements of the Competition and Markets Authority Audit order, the Group has until 2023 to hold a 
competitive tender for external audit services; it is the intention of the Group to hold a competitive tender, at a time which coincides with 
the next change of the lead audit partner.
The Group complies with the provisions of the “Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Order 2014” .
Independence
The independence of the external auditor has been confirmed by Deloitte every half year and was last confirmed in February 2016. The 
Committee considered Deloitte’s presentation and confirmed that it considered the auditor to be independent.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality which 
includes the following aspects:
■ ■ assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and the audit team;
■ ■ audit approach and scope, including identification of risk areas;
■ ■ execution of the audit;
Report of the Audit Committee continued
52 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 24472.04    4 March 2016 10:52 AM    PROOF 5
■ ■ interaction with management;
■ ■ communication with and support to the Audit Committee;
■ ■ insights, management letter points, added value and reports; and 
■ ■ independence, objectivity and scepticism.
An assessment questionnaire has been completed by each member of the Committee, by the Group Finance Director and other senior 
finance executives. The feedback from the process is considered by the Audit Committee and provided to the external auditor and 
management. The full formal questionnaire is completed every three years with key areas being completed every year. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of management in the external audit process by considering timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements and other documents provided for 
review by the external auditor and the Committee.
The Committee considered the FRC Audit Quality Review Team report on Deloitte LLP dated May 2015. If the audit is selected for quality 
review, the Committee understands that any resulting reports will be sent to the Committee by the FRC.
After considering the above matters the Committee felt that the external audit had been effective.
Non-audit services 
The external auditor may be invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to undertake the work. 
However, no contracts in excess of £20,000 can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the 
Committee or, in his absence, another member of the Committee. Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are shown in note 3 on page 99 and 
amounted to 23% of the audit fee.
Internal audit
The internal audit programme is managed by the Group Head of Risk and provides independent assurance over the key financial processes 
and controls in operation across the Group. The Group has engaged Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”) to provide certain internal audit 
services. The Committee reviewed and approved the annual internal audit plan before the start of the financial year and considered it 
appropriate to retain Ernst & Young as an internal audit service provider. The plan takes account of the Group’s strategic objectives and risks 
and provides the degree of coverage deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment. Internal auditors have received self-certification from every 
plant and shared service centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance. A summary of results is 
presented to the Committee. The accuracy of returns is monitored by Internal Audit by verification visits to a random sample of sites.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed and discussed annually with the Group Head of Risk and the Ernst & Young engagement 
partner. The review takes into account the views of directors and senior management on matters such as independence, proficiency, 
resourcing and audit strategy, planning and methodology. The review confirmed that the Internal Audit function was independent and 
objective and remained an effective element of the Group’s corporate governance framework.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of an external review of Board effectiveness which was undertaken in October 2015. Based on this, 
and as a result of the work done during the year, the Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference 
and carried out its responsibilities effectively. On behalf of the Audit Committee:

Chairman’s letter
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 2015 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
Consistent with last year, this report comprises two sections. The first part (Section A) summarises the policy of the Board with regard to 
the remuneration of the directors, which will be put to shareholders for approval at the Company’s 2016 AGM. The second part (Section B) 
describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2014 AGM, was implemented in 2015. This section will be subject to an advisory vote.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
2015 was another successful year for Bodycote. Although we faced strong challenges from the softening of the energy and industrial 
machinery markets and significant fluctuations in the exchange rates used to translate the results of our subsidiaries, the Company has 
made firm progress in the execution of our strategy under the leadership of Stephen Harris and David Landless. 
Our profitability remains good despite these difficult trading conditions, and strong cash generation and return on capital employed has 
been delivered in the year. The external market pressures we face will continue to impact the business over the coming years, in part 
motivating the review of remuneration undertaken by the Committee in 2015, with a revised policy developed to ensure that we are able to 
motivate, reward and retain our exceptional executive team as they work to deliver strong performance for the Company in the years ahead.
Remuneration decisions in 2015
Key decisions made by the Committee in the year included:
■ ■ A salary increase of 2.5% was awarded to S.C. Harris, taking his salary to £511,309 from 1 January 2016. D.F . Landless has also received 
an increase of 2.5%, taking his salary to £326,556.
■ ■ No financial performance targets set for the 2015 bonus plan were achieved, but personal strategic objectives were achieved and annual 
bonus payments of 20% and 26% of base salary for the Group Finance Director and the Group Chief Executive respectively (equivalent 
to 20% maximum opportunity for both), were paid out.
■ ■ The vesting outcome of the Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) award made in 2013 (which had a performance period ending on 31 December 
2015) was determined. As the EPS underpin set at 42p was not achieved, awards made to S.C. Harris and D.F . Landless will not vest.
■ ■ The 2012 Co-Investment Plan (CIP) vested at 100% of maximum in May 2015, reflecting the strong TSR performance of Bodycote over 
the three year performance period.
■ ■ Performance targets were determined for 2016 BIP awards, based on current and stretch performance for the business and the sector, 
together with broker consensus forecasts. Targets have been revised in the context of significant pressures in the sector (particularly in 
the oil & gas market and the tax rate changes which will affect Bodycote in future years), and to ensure the Committee is able to deliver 
upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance. 
■ ■ The calibration of the underpin has also been amended to ensure it represents a baseline affordability threshold below which no vesting 
under the BIP is considered appropriate. The Committee has determined that the underpin should be set at 85% of the threshold EPS 
performance level. 
■ ■ Review of executive remuneration and development of new policy (see below).

New Directors’ Remuneration Policy
In 2015 the Committee undertook an in-depth review of the remuneration arrangements in place at Bodycote, and determined that a 
number of changes should be made to the existing policy (which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM). These changes are set 
out below, and will be incorporated into the revised policy that will be put to shareholders at the 2016 AGM:
1. Removal of the current CIP opportunity in order to simplify our arrangements and improve line of sight for participants.
2. Increasing the existing annual bonus opportunity to 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO. This increase partially 
replaces the value forgone through the removal of the CIP .
3. Introduction of bonus deferral to support alignment with shareholders and with market best practice. From 2018 onwards, 35% of any 
bonus earned will be deferred as shares, with a transitional arrangement operating in 2016 and 2017 to preserve cash flow to participants 
in the initial years of the new policy’s operation.
4. Introduction of clawback into incentives, reflecting the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice.
We believe that the new structure (which is set out in full in Section A of this report) will continue to reward and motivate our executive 
directors, and support the Company in achieving its short and long-term strategic ambitions. In particular, these changes reflect the 
following key drivers:
■ ■ Simplicity: The Committee believes that the previous structure, comprising two long-term elements (CIP and BIP) was excessively 
complex, and reduced transparency for all stakeholders and line of sight for participants. We also recognise that simplicity is a key theme 
for investors, with the use of a single long-term incentive plan viewed as best practice by many.
■ ■ Competitive reward: To allow the Committee to continue to deliver upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance.
■ ■ Retention: The introduction of deferral on the annual bonus provides a retention tool for key management.
■ ■ T o align with corporate governance and best practice: To comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code by introducing clawback 
alongside the existing malus arrangements, and to meet shareholder expectations of bonus deferral and long-term alignment. 
Our proposed amendments to the policy were shared with the Company’s ten largest shareholders, together with the Investment 
Association (IA) and Institutional Shareholder Service (ISS). I was able to talk to many of these stakeholders, and discussed with them 
in depth the rationale for our proposals. We received broadly supportive responses, and through consideration of shareholder feedback 
identified a number of areas in which changes to our initial proposals were appropriate. The Committee is extremely appreciative of the 
input we received from shareholders as part of this process. 
I would also like to thank my fellow Committee members as well as all those who supported the Committee in the year for their support 
throughout this review. As a Committee we are fully committed to continue an open dialogue with our shareholders, and so I would 
welcome your views on any part of our revised remuneration policy.

Section A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Remuneration Policy
Bodycote’s Executive Remuneration Policy is to attract and motivate our senior executive team to execute our strategy and deliver value to 
our shareholders while ensuring the Group pays no more than is necessary.
In order to ensure continued alignment between remuneration and the evolving strategic direction of our business, the Committee has 
determined it appropriate that a revised policy be put to our shareholders for approval. This policy is set out below, with the intention that it 
will apply for three years from the date of the 2016 AGM.
Summary of changes from the 2014 Remuneration Policy 
The table below sets out a summary of the proposed changes under the new Remuneration Policy from the previous Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. It is the intention that the new Remuneration Policy will apply for the three years from the date 
of the 2016 AGM.
Element Summary of changes from 2014 Remuneration Policy
Base salary No change in policy.
Benefits No change in policy.
Pension No change in policy.
Annual bonus Incentive opportunity has been increased from 130% to 200% of salary for the CEO and from 
100% to 150% of salary for the CFO. This increase has been made to replace the opportunity 
previously provided to executive directors under the Co-Investment Plan. 
Mandatory deferral of 35% of any bonus earned into shares for three years from 2018 with phased 
introduction of deferral in 2016 and 2017 .
Introduction of clawback in conjunction with existing malus provisions. 
Bodycote Incentive Plan (‘BIP’) Introduction of clawback in conjunction with existing malus provisions. 
Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) Removed from 2016 onwards (final award was in 2015). 
Shareholding requirement Increased from 100% of salary to 200% and 150% for the CEO and CFO (and other executive 
directors) respectively.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant Plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Executive Remuneration Policy
The table below sets out the key components of executive directors’ pay packages, including why they are used and how they are operated 
in practice.

Base salary
To award competitive 
salaries to attract 
and retain the talent 
required to execute 
the strategy while 
ensuring the Group 
pays no more than is 
necessary.
Base salaries for executive directors 
are typically reviewed annually (or more 
frequently if specific circumstances 
necessitate this) by the Committee in 
December each year.
Salary levels are set and reviewed 
taking into account a number of factors 
including:
■ ■ Role, experience and performance  
of the executive.
■ ■ The Company’s guidelines for salaries 
for all employees in the Group for the 
forthcoming year.
■ ■ The competitiveness of total 
remuneration assessed against FTSE 
250 companies and other companies 
of similar size and complexity, as 
appropriate.
Whilst the Committee has not 
set a maximum level of salary, 
ordinarily, salary increases 
will not exceed the average 
increase awarded to other 
Group employees.
Increases may be above this 
level in certain exceptional 
circumstances, which may, for 
example, include:
■ ■ Increase in scope or 
responsibility.
■ ■ A new executive director 
who is being moved to 
market positioning over 
time.

Benefits
Provides market-
competitive benefits 
at an appropriate  
cost.
The Company provides a range of cash 
benefits and benefits in kind to executive 
directors in line with market practice. 
These include the provision of company 
car (or allowance), private medical 
insurance, short- and long-term sick pay 
and death in service cover. This will also 
extend to the reimbursement of taxable 
work-related expenses, such as travel and 
relocation. 
The provision of other benefits payable to 
an executive director is reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis to ensure 
appropriateness in terms of the type and 
level of benefits provided.
The Company provides a long-term 
savings vehicle into which the executive 
directors may elect to waive a proportion 
of pension allowance.
In the case of non-UK executives, the 
Committee may consider providing 
additional allowances in line with relevant 
market practice.
The Committee has not set 
a maximum level of benefit, 
given that the cost of certain 
benefits will depend on 
the individual’s particular 
circumstances. However 
benefits will be set at an 
appropriate level against 
market practice and needs for 
specific roles and individual 
circumstances.
None
Pension
Provides a market-
competitive benefit 
in order to attract the 
talent required to 
execute the strategy 
and provide a market-
competitive level of 
provision for post-
retirement income.
The Group operates a defined contribution 
scheme. Executive directors are provided 
with a contribution to this scheme or a 
cash allowance of equivalent value. Base 
salary is the only pensionable element of 
remuneration.
The same general approach applies to all 
employees, although contribution levels 
vary by seniority.
Company contribution (or cash 
equivalent) of up to 30% of 
salary.

Maximum opportunity 
under the element Performance measures
Annual bonus
T o incentivise delivery 
of corporate strategy 
on an annual basis 
and reward delivery of 
superior performance. 
The deferred portion 
of the bonus supports 
longer -term shareholder 
alignment.
The level of bonus paid each year is 
determined by the Committee after the year -
end based on performance against targets.
A portion of the annual bonus is paid in cash 
shortly after the financial year -end with the 
remaining portion deferred for three years 
in Bodycote shares (see details below). 
Vesting of the deferred shares is not subject 
to further performance conditions (please 
see the 2016 AGM Notice for a summary of 
the Plan). 
Dividend equivalents are payable in 
respect of the shares which vest.
From 2018 onwards, 35% of any bonus 
earned is deferred into shares for 
three years, conditional on continued 
employment until vesting date.
Transitional treatment applies to deferral 
for 2016 and 2017 . For 2016, any bonus 
earned over 130% of base salary is 
deferred into shares. 
For 2017 , 15% of any bonus paid up to a 
value of 130% of base salary is deferred, 
with bonus earned over 130% also deferred 
in full. The deferral above 130% of salary 
would be capped so that no more than 35% 
of the total bonus is deferred.
Malus provisions apply for the duration 
of the performance period and to shares 
held under deferral.
Clawback provisions apply to cash amounts 
paid for three years following payment. 
Malus and/or clawback may be applied in 
the following scenarios:
■ — Discovery of a material misstatement 
resulting in an adjustment in the 
audited accounts of the Group or any 
Group Company;
■ — The assessment of any performance 
condition or condition was based 
on error, or inaccurate or misleading 
information; 
■ — The discovery that any information 
used to determine the cash payment 
under the bonus or the number of 
shares subject to deferral was based 
on error, or inaccurate or misleading 
information; or
■ — Action or conduct of a participant 
which amounts to fraud or gross 
misconduct. 
The Committee believes that the rules 
of the Plan provide sufficient powers 
to enforce malus and clawback where 
required.
The maximum potential is 
200% of base salary for 
the CEO and 150% of base 
salary for the CFO and other 
executive directors.
At the threshold performance 
level there will normally be 
no more than 30% vesting. 
Awards commence vesting 
progressively from this point 
with maximum performance 
resulting in awards vesting in 
full.
The Committee considers the 
performance conditions selected for the 
annual bonus to appropriately support 
the Company’s strategic objectives and 
provide a balance between generating 
profit and cash to enable the Group to 
pay a dividend, reward its employees 
and make future investments; and 
achieve other strategic goals to drive 
long-term sustainable return.
The weighting of the measures and 
specific targets are reviewed on an 
annual basis to ensure alignment to 
strategy and are set to be in line with 
budget. Information on measures and 
weights that will apply for specific 
years will be included in the relevant 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
At least 70% of the bonus will be 
based on the achievement of Group 
financial targets.
The Committee retains discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to change 
performance measures and targets 
and the weightings attached to 
performance measures part-way through 
a performance year if there is a significant 
and material event which causes the 
Committee to believe the original 
measures, weightings and targets are no 
longer appropriate. 
Discretion may also be exercised in 
cases where the Committee believe 
that the bonus outcome is not a fair 
and accurate reflection of business 
performance. The exercise of this 
discretion may result in a downward 
or upward movement in the amount 
of bonus earned resulting from 
the application of the performance 
measures.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by 
the Committee will be fully disclosed in 
the following year’ s Remuneration Report.
The Committee is of the opinion that 
given the commercial sensitivity 
arising in relation to the detailed 
financial targets used for the annual 
bonus, disclosing precise targets for 
the Annual Bonus Plan in advance 
would not be in shareholder interests. 
Actual targets, performance achieved 
and awards made will be published at 
the end of the performance periods 
so shareholders can fully assess the 
basis for any pay-outs under the annual 
bonus.

Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (BIP) 2016
To incentivise  
delivery of long-term 
strategic goals and 
shareholder value  
and aid retention of 
senior management.
Awards will be granted annually under 
the Bodycote Incentive Plan (please see 
the 2016 AGM Notice for a summary of 
the Plan) subject to a three year vesting 
period and stretching performance 
conditions measured over three years. 
Dividend equivalents are payable in 
respect of the shares which vest.
The Committee retains the discretion 
in exceptional circumstances to adjust 
the vesting outcome or the targets for 
awards as long as the adjusted targets 
are no less stretching. In such an event 
the Committee will consult with major 
shareholders and will clearly explain the 
rationale for the changes in the report on 
remuneration.
Discretion may also be exercised in cases 
where the Committee believes that 
the outcome is not a fair and accurate 
reflection of business performance. The 
exercise of this discretion may result in 
a downward or upward movement in 
the amount of the LTIP vesting resulting 
from the application of the performance 
measures.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of 
the performance period.
Clawback provisions apply to amounts for 
two years following vest. 
Malus and/or clawback may be applied in 
the following scenarios:
■ — Discovery of a material misstatement 
resulting in an adjustment in the 
audited accounts of the Group or any 
Group Company;
■ — The assessment of any performance 
condition or condition was based 
on error, or inaccurate or misleading 
information; 
■ — The discovery that any information 
used to determine the number of 
shares subject to an award was based 
on error, or inaccurate or misleading 
information; or
■ — Action or conduct of a participant 
which amounts to fraud or gross 
misconduct. 
The Committee believes that the rules 
of the Plan provide sufficient powers 
to enforce malus and clawback where 
required.
The maximum face value of an 
award which may be granted 
under the plan in any year is up 
to 175 % of base salary for the 
executive directors.
At the threshold performance 
level there will normally be 
no more than 0% vesting. 
Awards commence vesting 
progressively from this point 
with maximum performance 
resulting in awards vesting in 
full.
Awards vest based on performance 
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee 
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For the 2016 financial year 
the measures for executive directors 
are:
■ ■ 50% ROCE
■ ■ 50% headline EPS
In addition, the vesting of awards may 
only occur if headline EPS is above a 
defined hurdle level.
The Committee considers these 
performance conditions selected for 
the BIP to currently appropriately 
underpin the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Due to the nature 
of the Company’s activities the 
Committee consider ROCE to provide 
shareholders with an appropriate 
measure of how well the Company 
is performing and is being managed, 
while EPS provides a measure of the 
level of value created for shareholders. 
ROCE and EPS are our top two KPIs 
as shown on page 69 of the Annual 
Report.
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures attaching to

measures if it feels this will create

The Board operates a shareholding 
retention policy under which executive 
directors are expected, within five 
years from appointment, to build up a

The CEO and CFO (and other 
executive directors) are 
required to build up a holding of 
200% and 150% of base salary 
respectively.

Legacy awards – 
Co-Investment Plan 
(CIP)
To provide a link 
between short and 
long-term incentive 
arrangements and 
to provide further 
alignment with 
shareholders. 
Final award made in 
2015.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards 
of performance based matching shares 
to participants on an annual basis in 
a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross 
investment made in deferred shares. 
The deferred shares must be held for at 
least three years. The vesting of matching 
shares will be based on share price related 
performance conditions as determined by 
the Committee. 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect 
of the matching shares which vest. 
Executive directors are invited 
annually to purchase shares up 
to 40% of basic salary (net of 
tax) against which performance 
based matching shares are 
granted on a 1:1 basis.
The matching shares are subject to 
an absolute Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) performance measure which is 
expressed as percentage Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (‘CAGR’) in excess 
of CPI:
Threshold performance results in a 
0.5:1 match
Maximum performance results in a 1:1 
match.
Legacy awards – 
Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (‘BIP’) 2006
To incentivise 
delivery of long-term 
shareholder value.
Aids retention of 
senior management.
Final award made in 
2015.
Awards are granted annually under the 
Bodycote Incentive Plan subject to a 
three year vesting period and stretching 
performance conditions measured over 
three years. 
Shares delivered following the vest of 
an award attract additional dividend 
shares calculated on the basis of the 
re-investment back into shares of the 
dividend that would have been received 
had the shares been beneficially held.
The Committee retains the discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to adjust the 
vesting outcome or the targets for awards 
as long as the adjusted targets are no less 
stretching. In such an event the Committee 
will consult with major shareholders and 
will clearly explain the rationale for the 
changes in the report on remuneration.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of 
the performance period and to shares held 
under deferral.
The maximum face value of an 
award which may be granted 
under the plan in any year is up 
to 175% of base salary for the 
executive directors.
At the threshold performance 
level there will normally be 
no more than 0% vesting. 
Awards commence vesting 
progressively from this point 
with maximum performance 
resulting in awards vesting in 
full.
Awards vest based on performance 
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee 
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For recent grants the 
measures for executive directors have 
been:
50% ROCE
50% headline EPS
In addition, the vesting of awards may 
only occur if headline EPS is above a 
defined hurdle level.
Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not 
in line with the policy set out on pages 57 to 65 where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) 
at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being “agreed” at the time the award is 
granted.
Executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors. The Company adopts a policy of 
positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any 
more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to 
participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the executive directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The remuneration package for the executive directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
performance-related components. The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is 
appropriate, clearly supports the Company’s strategic ambitions and does not incentivise inappropriate risk taking and reviews this on an 
annual basis.

The policy on non-executive director (NED) and Chairman fees is set out below.
Element and how it 
supports our strategy Operation of the element
Maximum opportunity under the

Fees for non-executive 
directors
To attract NEDs who 
have a broad range 
of experience and 
skills to oversee the 
implementation of our 
strategy.
The fees for the non-executives are 
determined by the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive.
The fee for the Chairman is reviewed 
by the Board in the absence of the 
Chairman. 
The Chairman and non-executive fees 
are reviewed on an annual basis. When 
reviewing fees, the primary source 
of comparative market data is FTSE 
250 companies and other companies 
of similar size and complexity, as 
appropriate. 
The fees for the Chairman and non-
executives are set a level that will 
attract individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s 
affairs. The fees reflect the time 
commitment and responsibilities of  
the roles. 
The Chairman and non-executive 
directors are not entitled to any pension 
or other employment benefits or to 
participate in any incentive scheme.
Appropriate benefits may be provided 
to non-executives and the Chairman 
from time to time. 
The Company will pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the non-executive 
directors and Chairman and may settle 
any tax incurred in relation to these.
Fees for non-executive directors are  
set out in the statement of 
implementation of policy in the 
following financial year section on  
page 71 .
The Company’s policy is that the 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
receive a fixed fee for their services 
as members of the Board and its 
Committees. The fee structure may 
also include additional fees for chairing 
a Board Committee and/or further 
responsibilities (for example, Senior 
Independent Directorship). 
In line with the Articles of Association, 
accumulative total fees for non-
executive directors are capped at 
£500,000 p.a.
None
Fees retained for external Non-Executive Directorships
To broaden the experience of executive directors, they may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not 
require the Company to pay any more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within 
the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the executive directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating executive director pay policy. However, it does take into 
account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating executive director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.  
The Committee does not use any remuneration comparison metrics.

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of 
shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Company’s AGM 
and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year. Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2016 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the 
Company’s key shareholders and their representative bodies. Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the 
feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When recruiting new executive directors, the Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience 
appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and that offered 
by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity. New executive directors will generally be appointed on 
remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table on pages 62 and 63. Each element of 
remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
Component Policy
General The Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the 
role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s one year policy (up to a maximum of two years). However, 
this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Company’s policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new recruit’s 
existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other 
executive directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other executive director(s). If it is in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially 
including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers’ fees.
Pension Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other executive director(s) 
with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruit’s package as a whole, 
market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for other executives.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy. The executive director 
may be invited to participate in the bonus on a pro rated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term 
incentives
Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy. The executive director may be invited to 
participate in ‘in flight’ BIP awards on a pro rated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in 
respect of his/her recruitment. In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the 
Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary. This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face 
value of any long-term incentive awards. This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, 
and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met. For the avoidance of doubt, 
this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any “buyout” payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
Replacement 
awards
For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and/or share-based payments on 
recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company 
and shareholders. Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer 
and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration. Shareholders 
will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. The Committee may make awards on hiring an 
external candidate to “buyout” awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer. Our approach to this is 
to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them. In 
doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or 
share based, performance related or not, the Company’s recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we 
consider appropriate. If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally 
reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible. We will make the award subject to appropriate malus 
and clawback provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe. 
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal 
promotions
For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is 
transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Shareholders will be informed of any director appointment and the individual’s remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following 
the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new non-executive directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on pages 62 and 63.

The non-executive directors of the Company (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. The non-executive directors are 
appointed by letters of appointment. Each independent non-executive director’s term of office runs for a maximum three year period. 
The initial terms of the non-executive directors’ positions are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the next AGM 
and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the non-executive directors stand for re-election. 
All directors will be put forward for re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
T ermination remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one year’s notice 
by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer. All future 
appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
The Committee will honour executive directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its executive directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid (other than a legacy arrangement for D.F . Landless).

Component Policy
Compensation for 
loss of office in 
service contracts
Currently, under the terms of the executive directors’ contracts, the Company may at its choice, in lieu of giving 
notice, terminate an executive director’s service contract by making a payment equivalent to:
■ ■ One year’s annual base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits (other than annual 
bonus and incentives) and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to the date of notice.
T reatment of cash 
element of the 
bonus under plan 
rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances 
the Committee determines (a “good leaver”), the level of bonus will be measured at the bonus measurement 
date. Bonus will normally be pro-rated for the period worked during the financial year. The Committee retains the 
discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ not to pro-rate the bonus to time. The Committee’s policy is that it will pro-rate bonus for time. It is the 
Committee’s intention to use its discretion to not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate 
business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Under all other circumstances no bonus will be earned on cessation of employment (other than set out above in the 
legacy arrangements for current executive directors). 
T reatment of 
unvested deferred 
bonus awards 
under plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances the 
Committee determines (a “good leaver”), deferred shares may be released to the participant at the normal vesting date.
Under all other circumstances unvested awards will lapse on cessation of employment. 
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation. The Committee’s 
policy is that shares will vest on the original date of vesting. The Committee will make this determination 
depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
T reatment of 
unvested BIP 2016, 
BIP 2006 and CIP 
awards 
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee determines that 
the individual is a good leaver (see above for definition). In instances where the Committee determines that awards 
should not lapse in full, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, pro-rated for time served and subject to 
the achievement of the original performance conditions.
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to measure performance over the original performance period or at the date of cessation. The Committee will 
make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation; and
■ ■ to pro-rate the maximum number of shares to the time from the date of grant to the date of cessation. The 
Committee’s policy is that it will pro-rate awards for time. It is the Committee’s intention to use discretion to 
not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to 
shareholders.
Exercise of 
discretion
In the event that an executive director leaves the Company, the Committee’s policy for exit payments is to consider 
the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually required are 
warranted.
Further, in the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers 
reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their 
statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions. The Committee may also 
include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
Change of control Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in executive directors’ service contracts. S.C. Harris does not 
have a change of control clause. D.F . Landless’ service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered 
best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one year’s remuneration if his employment is 
terminated on a change of control. This provision has been preserved. To the extent that executive contracts are 
renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control 
clauses in service contracts. In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any 
compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of 
employment of any executive director, other than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of 
notice. 
On change of control the awards under the Company’s incentive plans will generally vest subject to performance and 
time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.

Advisers to the Committee
The Committee was until July 2015 advised by Towers Watson on remuneration matters including providing advice on matters under 
consideration by the Committee, updates on good practice, legislative requirements and market practice. Towers Watson’s fees for 
this work amounted to £40,250. Following a competitive tender, in July 2015 PwC was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as 
remuneration committee advisers. PwC’s fees for the year, based on the quantity and complexity of the work undertaken, amounted to 
£25,500. PwC also undertakes tax and accounting work for the Company. Legal advice was provided by Eversheds and fees amounted to 
£1,926. All fees are based on the quantity and complexity of work undertaken. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice 
provided on executive remuneration is objective and independent, and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of these services. PwC 
and Towers Watson have signed up to the Remuneration Consultant Group’s code of conduct.
The Committee also received assistance from the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary, although they do not participate 
in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration. The Committee in particular consulted with the Group Chief Executive and 
received recommendations from him in respect of his direct reports.

This section of the report explains how Bodycote’s Remuneration Policy has been implemented during the financial year.
Base salary
The base salaries of the executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis. As described in Section A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, a 
number of factors are taken into account when salaries are reviewed, principally market level salaries payable in FTSE 250 companies and 
other companies of similar size and complexity, and the individual’s role, experience and performance. The 2015 base salary increases and 
comparative figures can be found in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter.
Base salaries are reviewed in January every year.  
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2015* Salary from 1 January 2016
S.C. Harris Group Chief Executive £498,838 £511,309
D.F . Landless Group Finance Director £318,591 £326,556
*The 2015 increase compares to the average 2015 salary increase across the Group of 2.3%.
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships
To broaden the experience of executive directors, the position of non-executive director may be held in other companies, provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
S.C. Harris has held such a position at Mondi plc since 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of 
£87 ,068. D.F . Landless was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Luxfer Holdings plc with effect from 1 March 2013 and retained fees for 
the year of £50,586. In addition D.F . Landless was given 3,168 of Luxfer American Depositary Receipts valued at $12.23 at the date of grant 
on 29 May 2015. D. F . Landless has been appointed a Non-Executive Director of Innospec Inc. with effect from 1 January 2016. No fees 
have been retained for the 2015 reporting period.
Pension
Following a contractual review of pension provision during 2015, it was decided that D.F . Landless’ salary supplement above the defined 
benefit scheme cap should be increased from 16% to 20%. This was decided in March 2015 with effect from 1 January 2015.
S.C. Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 25% of basic salary. In addition, a death in service benefit of

D.F . Landless no longer participates in the Group’s UK contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes due to him 
prospectively reaching the lifetime limit. Instead D.F . Landless receives a salary supplement of 25% of basic salary up to the defined benefit 
scheme cap and 20% of basic salary above the cap, of which £50,095 was waived during the year. In addition, a death in service benefit of 
eight times basic salary is payable.

Long-term savings vehicle
During the financial year the Group made discretionary contributions into the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan. The plan is entirely cash-
based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives. The Committee considers the plan an essential tool to aid 
retention while recognising the need for executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning. Group contributions are discretionary, 
vary year-on-year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Group. Any risk in relation to the value 
of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants.

Retrospective disclosure of 2014 annual bonus targets
In the 2013 Annual report on remuneration, the Committee communicated its intention to retrospectively disclose information in respect 
of the prior year annual bonus targets. The table below provides details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and 
individual performances in the 2014 financial year.
2014 was another successful year. While our reported revenues decreased by 1 .7%, there was an increase of 4.0% at constant exchange 
rates. Headline operating profit grew by 3.4% and headline earnings per share increased by 6.3%. The actual payout, as a percentage of the 
total award, in respect of Group headline operating profit and Group headline operating cash flow, was 46.5% and 10.0% respectively. The 
targets for Group headline operating profit and Group headline operating cash flow were £128.9m and £93.4m respectively. The Committee 
also assessed the Group Chief Executive’s and Group Finance Director’s performance against their personal objectives, which included 
targets relating to safety, customer service and implementation of major projects. The Committee concluded that personal strategic 
objectives were achieved on target at a level of 16.0% and 14.6% for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively.

2015 Annual bonus 
During the year the Committee has decided, in line with market practice, to disclose information in respect of last year’s annual bonus 
targets. The table below provides the details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and individual performances in 
the 2015 financial year.
The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2015 for executive directors was split 70% in respect of Group headline 
operating profit, 10% on Group headline operating cash flow and 20% on personal strategic objectives. These performance conditions 
and their respective weightings reflected the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be linked both to the overall 
performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence. 
Due to significant pressures particularly in the oil & gas sector, the performance of the Group during the year included headline operating 
profit of £102.1m (8.1% decrease on the previous year, 6.0% decrease at constant exchange rates) and headline operating  
cash flow of £81 .6m (18.4% decrease on last year). No bonus is payable on the financial elements of the performance targets.
The Committee also assessed the performance of both the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director against their personal 
objectives, which included targets relating to safety, focus on preservation and maximisation of value and cash flow as well as 
implementation of major projects. The Committee concluded that personal strategic objectives were achieved at a level of 20% of the 
maximum award for both the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.

Awards with performance periods ending in the year
BIP awards made in 2013 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2015, with 50% of the award subject to satisfaction 
of a ROCE target and 50% subject to a headline EPS target. The threshold and maximum targets along with the vesting schedule are set 
out in the tables below.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period was below 42.0p, then no awards will vest. Over the period, ROCE was 19.0% and 
the headline EPS figure for the year was 39.5p. As the underpin was not achieved, the Committee concluded that the 2013 share award will 
not vest. 
Awards made in the year 
BIP awards with a face value of 175% of salary were granted to both executive directors in April 2015 and will vest in March 2018, subject 
to the achievement of ROCE and headline EPS growth performance targets. The performance period will end on 31 December 2017 . The 
vesting of these awards will be based on ROCE and headline EPS targets summarised in the table below. The Committee has reviewed 
the performance targets and these have been altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching targets which underpin the Group’s 
objectives.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period is below 41 .8p, then no awards will vest. The Committee has decided that the 
ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that over-incentivising on capital employed can lead to 
unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital underinvestment for the business. Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of 
those shares that vest.
The number and value of shares that were awarded to the executive directors during the year is set out on page 72.
Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
Awards with performance periods ending in the year
As described in Section A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target. The CIP awards made in 2012 
had a three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2015. The absolute TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out 
below.
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level

Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute TSR growth of 25.4%. This performance resulted in the TSR targets being achieved 
at a level of 100%. The number and value of shares which vested to each of the executive directors is set out on page 72.

CIP awards were made to both executive directors in May 2015 and will vest in May 2018, subject to the achievement of absolute TSR 
targets summarised in the table below. The Committee reviewed the performance targets and felt that they remain appropriately stretching. 
Therefore, no change has been made to the absolute TSR performance targets used in the previous year. Dividend equivalents will be

Implementation of policy in 2016
In 2015 the Committee undertook an in-depth review of the remuneration arrangements and determined that a number of changes should 
be made to the existing policy (to be approved by shareholders at the May 2016 AGM). These changes are set out below:
1. Removal of the current CIP opportunity in order to simplify our arrangements and improve line of sight for participants.
2. Increase in the existing annual bonus opportunity to 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% for the CFO. This increase partially replaces 
the value forgone through the removal of the CIP .
3. Introduction of bonus deferral to support alignment with shareholders and with market best practice. From 2018 onwards, 35% of any 
bonus earned will be deferred as shares, with a transitional arrangement operating in 2016 and 2017 to preserve cash flow to participants 
in the initial years of the new policy’s operation.
4. Introduction of clawback onto incentives, reflecting the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice.
Base salary is reviewed on an annual basis. The 2016 base salary increases from 1 January 2016 were 2.5% for the Group Chief Executive 
and 2.5% for the Group Finance Director. As 2016 base salary increases for the Group are applied after the publication of this report, the 
comparative figure for 2016 can only be provided in next year’s report. The comparative figure for 2015 is disclosed in the base salary 
section on page 67 . 
For 2016 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors and senior executives will again be 
contingent on meeting targets relating to operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. The Committee has reviewed targets 
for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant for the Group’s business strategy.
The Committee has determined to set the targets for the 2016 BIP awards as disclosed in the consultation exercise. The targets below 
were set in the context of significant pressures in the sector, and to ensure that the Committee are able to deliver upper quartile reward for 
upper quartile performance.

As described in Section A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which executive 
directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect 
of executive directors, the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. For the purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned 
shares will be counted. At the December 2015 Remuneration Committee meeting it was decided to increase the minimum shareholding 
requirement to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 150% of salary for the Group Finance Director. The new shareholding 
requirement will not need to be achieved until five years after the adoption of the new requirement. As at 31 December 2015, the 
Committee is satisfied that executive directors have fulfilled this requirement. At the 31 December 2015 share price, S.C. Harris held 202% 
of salary and D.F . Landless held 223% of salary.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility of directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” . Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
■ ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ ■ make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
■ ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
■ ■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ ■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
■ ■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
■ ■ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
■ ■ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
■ ■ the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
■ ■ the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 25 February 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is

Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” .
Going concern 
and the directors’ 
assessment of 
the principal 
risks that would 
threaten the 
solvency or 
liquidity of the 
Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of accounting on page 23 and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the 
Group on page 27 . 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
■ ■ the directors’ confirmation on page 24 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity;
■ ■ the disclosures on pages 24 to 26 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated;
■ ■ the directors’ statement on page 23 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements;
■ ■ the director’s explanation on page 23 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such 
material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm 
that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
those standards.
Our assessment 
of risks of 
material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. The significant 
risks identified below are consistent with those in the previous year, with the addition of the risk regarding 
Restructuring provisions for this report.
The Audit Committee has requested that, whilst not required under International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland), we include in our report any significant key observations in respect of these assessed risks of material 
misstatement.

To the Members of Bodycote plc
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Impairment of non-current assets
The Group has a significant non-current asset base 
including tangible fixed assets of £429.6m and 
intangible assets (including goodwill) of £175.2m as 
shown in notes 11, 12 and 13 respectively. Current 
macro-economic uncertainties result in a risk regarding 
the carrying value of these assets. Performing an 
impaiment review of these non-current assets requires 
the exercise of significant judgement regarding 
future growth rates, discount rates and sensitivity 
assumptions, as described in note 11 and the key 
sources of estimation uncertainty within the accounting 
policies on page 86.
We challenged the assumptions used in the 
impairment model for intangible and tangible assets. 
As part of our procedures we:
■ ■ considered the appropriateness of the growth 
rate assumptions by comparing them to historical 
trading performance and World Bank historical 
GDP data across the Group’s geographical and 
market segments;
■ ■ assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions 
concerning inputs to the discount rate against 
latest market expectations. In performing our 
procedures, we used our internal valuation 
specialists and third party evidence to assess the 
individual inputs to the discount rates of between 
12.4% and 13.4% applied as described in note 
11; and
■ ■ considered management’s assertions of the 
future utilisation of assets supporting their 
carrying value by reviewing the strategic plan for 
the business by cash generating unit.
Based on the procedures 
performed, no 
impairments were noted 
and we have concluded 
that the assumptions in 
the impairment model 
were appropriate.
Environmental remediation provisions
Given the nature of the Group’s operations and 
potential environmental contamination which could 
have arisen historically, a risk arises in connection 
with the appropriateness and completeness of the 
£13.2m environmental remediation provisions. The risk 
specifically applies to the level of judgement involved 
in calculating the provisions required and to the 
likely period of utilisation, as described in the Critical 
judgments within the accounting policies.
We evaluated the environmental provisions by 
undertaking the following testing:
■ ■ comparing the basis for the recognition of 
provisions against the regulatory and legal 
requirements;
■ ■ assessing the value of the provision recognised; 
and 
■ ■ challenging the status and utilisation of provisions.
As part of our audit procedures we reviewed 
the available third party evidence collated by 
management’s experts and assumptions detailing 
the assessment of environmental liabilities for 
the Group together with correspondence from 
the Group’s internal environmental remediation 
team. We considered the appropriateness of the 
qualifications of management’s experts and have 
benchmarked the Group’s accounting policy against 
comparator companies. We have also considered 
the requirement to discount the balance should 
the impact of doing so be material and audited 
management’s calculation for this assessment.
Based on the results 
of work carried out 
we concur that the 
provision recognised 
by management is in 
accordance with IAS 
37 . We also concur 
with management’s 
assessment that the 
impact of discounting the 
provision is not material.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
T axation – deferred tax assets and tax provisions
The tax risk concerns the judgements and estimates 
applied in the determination of tax balances, in 
particular in relation to the recognition of the £31 .2m 
deferred tax asset balance for which an amount of 
£3.1m is recognised in relation to £14.1m of tax 
losses across the Group based on future profitability, 
as disclosed in note 20 and provisions for liabilities 
attributed to specific uncertain tax positions linked to 
the Group’s corporate arrangements.
We have assessed and challenged the 
appropriateness of management’s assumptions and 
estimates in relation to the likelihood of generating 
future taxable, as opposed to accounting, profits 
to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
by comparing to forecast information and historical 
trends in loss utilisation. In conjunction with our 
taxation audit specialists, we have also assessed 
the assumptions and judgements concerning the 
adequacy of tax provisions for uncertain tax positions 
by viewing the latest correspondence from the 
various tax authorities and drawing on the experience 
of our tax specialists in respect of similar situations.
From the work performed 
we are satisfied that the 
assumptions applied in 
respect of the Income 
Statement and the 
carrying value of amounts 
held on the balance sheet 
regarding current and 
deferred tax balances are 
appropriate.
Pensions – liability assumptions for defined benefit 
schemes
This risk concerns the appropriateness of the actuarial 
assumptions applied in calculating the Group’s defined 
benefit liability of £99.9m (2014: £103.3m) within the 
net defined benefit liability of £2.7m (2014: £1 .0m) as 
shown in note 30. The valuation of the Group’s IAS 19 
liability involves significant judgement as described 
in note 30 and in the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty in the accounting policies, in particular in 
relation to the discount rate, inflation and mortality 
assumptions.
We have assessed the appropriateness of the 
assumptions underpinning the valuation of the 
scheme liabilities. Specifically we challenged the 
discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions 
applied in the calculation by using our internal pension 
specialists to benchmark the assumptions applied 
against comparable third party data and assessed the 
appropriateness of the assumptions in the context of 
the Group’s own position.
From the work performed 
we are satisfied that 
the assumptions 
applied in respect of the 
valuation of the Group’s 
IAS 19 liabilities are 
materially correct and are 
considered to be towards 
the prudent end of our 
benchmarked range.
Restructuring provisions
During 2015 the Group has implemented a significant 
global restructuring programme driven by the fall in 
global oil prices along with widespread softer economic 
conditions, both of which have combined to cause 
a notable fall in demand for many types of industrial 
equipment and machinery. This restructuring has led to 
management recognising a net exceptional charge of 
£20.0m in the Income Statement.
A risk exists regarding the completeness, utilisation 
and validity of the provision as shown in note 23. 
There is also a risk relating to ensuring the appropriate 
classification of these costs in the Income Statement 
as exceptional items in accordance with the Group’s 
policy.
We evaluated the restructuring provisions by 
comparing the basis for the recognition of provisions 
to assess whether the recognition criteria of a 
constructive obligation arising from a past event 
are satisfied, assessing the value of the provision 
recognised and challenging the status and utilisation 
of provisions.
Additionally we have assessed the disclosure of the 
costs incurred within the Income Statement to assess 
whether those costs described as exceptional are in 
accordance with the Group’s policy for exceptional 
costs as per note 5.
From the work performed 
we are satisfied that the 
provisions recognised 
were complete, valid and 
appropriately utilised and 
appropriately presented 
as exceptional costs.

Our application  
of materiality
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by 
the Audit Committee discussed on page 50 and 51 .
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or 
influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £4.8m (2014: £4.9m), which is below 5% of adjusted 
pre-tax profit, which has been determined to be the most stable basis of underlying performance 
(2014: 5% of pre-tax profit), and below 1% (2014: 1%) of equity. The adjustment to pre-tax profit 
relates to the adding back of exceptional restructuring costs of £20.0m in order to use an underlying 
pre-tax profit base for materiality. There were no such exceptional costs in 2014.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of £0.15m (2014: £0.145m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

 Full audit scope 91%
 9% Review at group level
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on this assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at thirteen 
countries, being USA, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Netherlands, Czech Republic, 
Turkey, Singapore, China and Mexico. Consistent with the prior year and as agreed with the Audit 
Committee, the smaller components in territories such as China, Singapore and Mexico have 
remained in scope and we have maintained the scoping levels in territories such as Netherlands, 
Luxembourg, Germany and Turkey.
In 2015 we have continued to have direct Group oversight, leadership and control over the 
components of the Group accounted for in the US Shared Service Centre (‘SSC’) and in conjunction 
with our Czech component audit team we jointly audited the components of the Group accounted for 
at the Prague SSC.
As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 86% 
(2014: 86%) of revenue, 99% (2014: 97%) of profit before tax and 91% (2014: 88%) of net assets. 
Our audit work at each location was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual 
entity which was lower than Group materiality. Component materiality ranged from £0.5m to £2.5m 
(2014: £0.5m to £2.9m).
The Group audit team continued to follow a program of planned visits that has been designed so that 
a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the locations included as full scope for the 
Group audit at least once every three years and the most significant of them at least once a year.
In years when we do not visit a significant component we include the component audit team in our 
team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, attend close meetings by conference call and review 
documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of 
specified account balances.

Scope of the audit 
of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 December 2015
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and 
are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s report on page 23.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair 
value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2015
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors have made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which 
are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
T axation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax 
provision, deferred tax provisions and income statement in the period in which such determination is made.
Provisions for environmental liabilities
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in 
other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. The provision is reviewed annually. Due to the significant uncertainty 
associated with the future level of such environmental liabilities, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the 
provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be incurred. The directors take account of the advice of experts in 
quantifying the expected costs of future remediation.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed 
below.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £140.0m (2014: £138.4m). Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of impairment are set out on pages 
87 and 90.
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with 
actuarial assumptions, which are set out in note 30. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit schemes are 
set out on pages 88 and 89.
Provisions for restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts 
that are both necessarily required by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group. Uncertainty arises in the 
estimation of site clean up and dilapidation costs. The Group has to make a subjective assessment of the cost involved based on previous 
experience, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in a wholly accurate prediction of the 
actual costs that may be incurred.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

Bodycote Annual Report 2015 - back.indd   86 04/03/2016   16:02:51 24472.04    4 March 2016 9:11 AM    PROOF 5
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group Company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on the completion of services rendered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established. 
Other operating income represents scrap sales, rents receivable and other operating income.
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
■ ■ exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see page 92); and
■ ■ exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the 
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
The Group considers exceptional items to be those which derive from events or transactions which are considered significant for separate 
disclosure by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
These items include, but are not limited to, impairment charges, reorganisation costs and profits and losses on disposal of subsidiaries and 
other one off items which meet this definition.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement 
benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect 
of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement 
of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net interest 
is calculated by applying a discount rate to the defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
■ ■ current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
■ ■ net interest expense or income; and
■ ■ remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 3) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost.
Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 7).

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined 
benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of 
refunds from the schemes or reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 10% – 20%
Plant and machinery 5% – 20%
Motor vehicles 20% – 33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance 
with relevant IFRSs.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
■ ■ deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits respectively; and
■ ■ liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at 
fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Years
Software 3 to 10
Non-compete agreements 4 to 5
Customer relationships 10 to 15
Amortisation is recognised within administration expenses.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.

Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
■ ■ significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or
■ ■ default or delinquency in payments.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, 
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes 
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within

Hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges.
Note 19 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance 
with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation and the effect of the adjustment is material in relation to the financial statements, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve.

General information
Bodycote plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Acts 1948 to 1980. The address of the registered 
office is given on page 37 .
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
Information on the Group’s objectives, policies and processes are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the Foreign Currencies accounting policy on 
page 88.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has applied IFRIC 21 Levies for the first time in the year. IFRIC 21 addresses when a liability to pay a levy imposed by a 
government should be recognised.
In addition, the following amendments have been adopted in the year:
■ ■ IFRS 1 “Clarification of the meaning of ‘effective IFRSs’”
■ ■ IFRS 3 “Clarification of the scope exclusion for joint ventures”
■ ■ IFRS 13 “Clarification of the scope of the portfolio exemption”
■ ■ IAS 40 “Clarification of the relationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40”
■ ■ IAS 19 “Defined benefit plans: employee contributions”
■ ■ Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle (Dec 2014)
■ ■ Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 cycle (Dec 2013)
The above interpretations and revised standard have not had any material impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements or 
the disclosures required.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
■ ■ IFRS 9 Financial instruments
■ ■ IFRS 14 Regulatory deferral accounts
■ ■ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
■ ■ IFRS 16 Leases
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 The application of the investment entities exemptions
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interest in joint operations
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements
■ ■ Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (Sep 2014)
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
■ ■ IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments;
■ ■ IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue disclosures and is unlikely to impact significantly the financial statements; and,
■ ■ IFRS 16 will impact the recognition, measurement and disclosure of operating leases. It is considered that a material amount of lease 
assets and liabilities will require recognition on the Group balance sheet. It is anticipated that finance charges will require reclassification 
in the Group income statement.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.

2. Business and geographical segments 
The Group has 178 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services. The range 
and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief 
operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six operating 
segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business areas, as follows:
■ ■ ADE – Western Europe;
■ ■ ADE – North America;
■ ■ ADE – Emerging markets;
■ ■ AGI – Western Europe;
■ ■ AGI – North America; and
■ ■ AGI – Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Group’s two key business areas, 
ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements. Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and 
purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have 
shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector. Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI 
is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

Acquisition costs – 0.2 
20.0 0.2 
Reorganisation costs of £23.8m (2014: £nil) relate to restructuring initiatives in Europe, Brazil, USA and India. This has been driven by 
the fall in global oil prices along with widespread weakness in industrial production, both of which have coincided to cause a notable 
fall in demand for many types of industrial equipment and machinery, affecting a number of plants.
Reorganisation costs include £11 .9m of net restructuring charges (see note 23) and £2.4m of net restructuing environmental charges 
(see note 23), together with asset impairments amounting to £9.5m (see note 3).
Restructuring initiatives announced during the first half of the year and their associated costs have been reviewed during the second 
half. As a result of this review and the decision to expand the scope of the restructuring actions, there has been a net increase of 
£0.1m to the total exceptional items reported at 30 June 2015.
Bodycote Brazil was sold on 25 September 2015 and Bodycote India was sold on 11 September 2015. Further details are disclosed in 
note 25. No acquisition costs have been expensed in the year (2014: £0.2m).

11. Goodwill (continued)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s 
operating segments as follows:
2015 
£m 
2014
£m
ADE:
 Western Europe 26.4 26.5 
 North America 46.2 45.4 
 Emerging markets – – 
AGI:
 Western Europe 18.1 18.6 
 North America 43.7 42.1 
 Emerging markets 5.6 5.8 
140.0 138.4 
The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those 
calculations are the discount rates and growth rates in respect of future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units. 
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate. The rates used to discount 
the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 12.4% (2014: 12.3%) and 13.4% (2014: 14.3%). The recoverable amount 
is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecasted for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cash flows in 
perpetuity.
The forecast sales reflect management’s expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected profit 
margin reflects management’s experience of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales. As outlined in the 
Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and 
market sectors. Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.0% (2014: 3.0%), being the historical weighted 
average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in. Growth rates by cash generating unit range from 2.75% to 6.0%. 
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value, the cash 
generating unit is considered to be individually significant. The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North 
America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units. The long term growth rates applied to cash 
flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for these significant cash generating units are shown 
below:

 North America ADE Heat Treatment 43.6 3.2 12.4 
 North America AGI Heat Treatment 43.6 3.2 12.4 
The Group has conducted sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating 
unit. A decline in sales of 11 .2% per annum in perpetuity would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being 
reduced to its carrying value. The directors do not believe such a decline to be likely.
Declines in long-term growth rates of 32.1 percentage points and 6.9 percentage points for North America ADE Heat Treatment and 
North America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units, respectively, would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for these 
cash generating units being reduced to their carrying values. The directors do not believe such declines to be likely.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2015.

Year ended 31 December 2015
16.  Other financial assets (continued)
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 19.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £19.4m (2014: £17 .2m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 37 days, with a range from 14 days to 70 days.

At 31 December 5.9 5.5 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £8.6m (2014: £8.3m). 
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of 
the expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
(i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. No overdrafts are secured.
(ii) At 31 December 2015 the Group’s principal borrowing facility had drawings of £nil (2014: £nil) under a Revolving Credit Facility of 
£230m. This unsecured facility commenced on 3 July 2014 and matures on 3 July 2019. The multi currency drawings under this facility 
carry an interest rate of between 1 .05% and 1 .90% above LIBOR (the applicable margin at 31 December 2015 was 1 .05%).
At 31 December 2015 the Group had available £230.0m (2014: £230.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. All borrowings are 
classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Forward foreign exchange contracts 3.8 – 5.6 –
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2015 or 2014.
In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be 
classified as level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 
1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

19. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities 
of the contracts.
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow 
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within 
Group policy. However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Financial risk management
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board. 
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury 
personnel. The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to 
minimise risk for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no 
significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a 
centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each 
December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt / cash 
is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt / cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term 
loans in excess of one year) to exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £75m).
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had a revolving credit committed borrowing facility of £230.0m (2014: £230.0m) which, together 
with net cash of £12.3m (2014: £35.7m), resulted in available funds of £242.3m (2014: £265.7m). The Group also uses uncommitted 
short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group 
manages longer-term liquidity through its committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets. As at 31 
December 2015 the Group’s principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates:
■ ■ £230m Revolving Credit Facility 3 July 2019 (3.5 years)
■ ■ $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 (0.7 years)
The facilities were undrawn at the end of the current and previous year.
Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 2015, the 
Group had gross cash of £16.2m (2014: £38.5m).

19. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest 
rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to 
achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but 
exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the 
Group’s reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time 
to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2015, 4% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2014: 9% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash). The 
average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 1 .2 years (2014: 2.2 years).
Currency risk
Bodycote has operations in 24 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets 
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
91% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 35%, USD 37% and SEK 7%).  Cumulatively over the year, sterling 
rates moved such that the sales for the year were £16.9m lower than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2014.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group 
will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt 
in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange 
movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign 
currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though approximately 
91% of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are 
limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis
To represent management’s best estimate of a reasonable range of potential outcomes, the Group has measured the estimated charge 
to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates 
or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2015, for all 
financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only. The sensitivity analysis 
excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments;
■ ■ changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are 
recognised at their fair value; and
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments. 
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable 
net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2015 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.1m (2014: £0.4m). 
There is no significant impact on equity in the current or previous year.
Currency sensitivity
Taking the 2015 sales by currency, a 10% weakening / strengthening in the 2015 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling 
would have given rise to a +£57 .4m / -£46.9m movement in sales respectively.  The impact on headline operating profit is affected by 
the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies. However, taking the 2015 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening / strengthening in 
2015 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£10.9m / -£8.9m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time 
deposits and money market funds. The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where applicable) and 
through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Group policy 
is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A- / A3 or better. However, acquired businesses 
occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in 
particular in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £40.1m (2014: £71 .7m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £14.1m (2014: £10.4m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future 
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of the remaining £26.0m (2014: £61 .3m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating 
to future profitability. The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of £nil (2014: £0.2m) relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries 
has not been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint 
ventures are insignificant.

The restructuring provision relates to the costs associated with the closure of a number of Heat Treatment sites. The net increase in 
restructuring and restructuring environmental provisions of £14.3m relates to costs associated with the Group’s withdrawal from Brazil, 
together with new restructuring initiatives announced, primarily in Europe. Asset impairments of £9.5m have also been recognised.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, 
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into 
Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme 
from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years. 
Whilst the Group’s use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to 
contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities. In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or 
legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future. However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what 
extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above. Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

On 30 June 2015, the Group announced its decision to withdraw from its operations in Brazil. Subsequent to this decision, on 25 
September 2015, the Group sold 100% of its interest in Bodycote Brasimet Processamento Termico Ltda (“Bodycote Brazil”). The 
decision to exit the Group’s activities in Brazil is the consequence of a prolonged and substantial reduction in demand in the business’s 
core markets. 
During the year, Bodycote Brazil contributed £4.0m (2014: £7 .7m) to Group revenue and contributed a headline operating loss of £1 .8m 
to Group results (2014: loss of £2.9m). Closure costs incurred during the year were £6.4m (2014: £nil). Bodycote Brazil is disclosed 
within the Emerging Markets - AGI operating segment.
On 11 September 2015, the Group also sold 100% of its interest in Bodycote Metallurgical Services India Pvt. Ltd (“Bodycote India”) 
due to the company delivering returns below those considered acceptable to the Group. During the year, Bodycote India contributed 
£1 .0m (2014: £1 .4m) to Group revenue and contributed a headline operating loss of £0.2m (2014: loss of £0.2m) to Group results. 
Bodycote India is disclosed within the Emerging Markets - AGI operating segment.

28. Share-based payments
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
The Company operates the BIP under which executive directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares 
up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three  
year period. 
Fifty percent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and fifty percent of the award is 
subject to an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition. 
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (CIP)
The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of 
awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred 
shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in 
the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2. Ten percent per annum compound growth in excess of growth in 
the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 .
The number of outstanding share awards is as follows:

30. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada 
and the United States of America. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control 
of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by 
the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Group’s employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes operated by the governments of each country. The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £6.0m (2014: £5.6m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2015 contributions of £0.3m (2014: £0.2m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year. The

30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
UK Scheme
The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”) which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK 
employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation. The Scheme is funded by 
the Group and current employee members. The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market (investment) risk. 
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group. The Scheme is governed by a board 
of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee. The trustees 
are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, 
funding) together with the Group.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the 
assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and 
Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group. The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2014 was completed by 
a qualified independent actuary and the results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2015.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £1 .6m, comprising £0.4m in respect of benefit accrual and 
£1 .2m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss 
account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
As the Group does not have an unconditional right to a return of any surplus in the Scheme under the wording of the Scheme Rules, 
the additional reporting requirements of IFRIC14 apply. Under IFRIC14 the Group is required to recognise additional liabilities of £4.2m 
as at 31 December 2015 due to the restriction imposed on the surplus in the Scheme at that date and the future contributions agreed 
at the 6 April 2014 actuarial valuation that the Group will pay to the Scheme. It has not been necessary to recognise additional liablities 
in previous years due to the funding position of the Scheme on an IAS19 basis.

Company accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 
101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable law. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied 
consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements. In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results 
of the Company has not been presented.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets, business combinations, discontinued operations 
and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s Report on page 23.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment, if any.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Pension costs
The Company participates in a final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom which is funded by the payment of 
contributions to a separately administered trust fund. This is a defined benefit plan which shares the risks between entities under common 
control. For further details, see note 11 .
There is no contractual arrangement or policy for charging the net benefit cost between the entities who participate in this scheme. The 
Company is considered to be the entity that is legally the sponsoring employer of this scheme. As such, the Company recognises the net 
defined benefit cost and the retirement benefit obligation as per the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, as described in further 
detail in the accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements on page 88.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period 
of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt 
with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Company as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.

Company accounting policies continued
T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20%
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, at the following annual rates:
Software 10% to 33%
T axation
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is 
estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse. The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be 
obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 Related Party Transactions not to disclose transactions or balances 
with wholly-owned entities of the Group.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year relevant to the 
Company financial statements are included within the Group considerations on page 86.

11. Pension commitments
The Company participates in a final salary defined benefit scheme, the details of which are disclosed in note 30 to the consolidated 
financial statements. This is a defined benefit plan which shares the risks between entities under common control. There is no 
contractual agreement or policy for charging the net benefit cost between entities who participate in this scheme. The Company is 
considered to be the entity that is legally the sponsoring employer of this scheme. The net defined benefit cost and the retirement 
benefit obligation are recognised as per the requirements of IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits. Full disclosures concerning the 
scheme as required by IAS 19 (revised) are set out in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
The contributions made by the Company over the financial year to the defined contribution scheme amounted to £0.3m (2014: £0.3m). 
As at 31 December 2015, contributions of £0.1m (2014: £0.1m) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to 
the scheme.
12. Related party transactions
During the current and prior year, the Company has not entered into any transactions with related parties who are not wholly-owned 
members of the Group.
13. T ransition to FRS 101
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance 
with previously extant United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements, for the year 
ended 31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101 .
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in the relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, and made 
those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first-time adoption of FRS 101 . As such, this note explains 
the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared under previously extant 
UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirments of paragraph 6-33 of IFRS 1 First time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
Exemptions applied
IFRS 1 allows first time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirements to apply IFRSs retrospectively. The Company has 
taken advantage of the following exemptions:
IFRS 2 Share-based payment has not been applied to any equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002, 
nor has it been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before 1 January 2005. This treatment is 
consistent with the transitional provisions taken when the Company adopted FRS 20, the UK equivalent standard.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post employment benefits are recognised in full in equity on the date of 
transition to IFRS. This is the same treatment as under UK GAAP .

14. Restatement from UK GAAP to FRS 101
On transition to FRS 101, the net defined benefit cost and retirement benefit obligation relating to the final salary defined benefit 
pension scheme is recognised as per the requirements of IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits. As such, the Company has recognised a 
retirement benefit obligation of £1 .0m at 31 December 2014 (1 January 2014: £4.8m) and a corresponding deferred tax asset of £0.2m 
at 31 December 2014 (1 January 2014: £1 .1m). The net impact of recognising the retirement benefit obligation and corresponding 
deferred tax asset is a £0.8m reduction in the profit and loss reserves account at 31 December 2014 (1 January 2014: £3.7m 
reduction).
Software assets of £9.5m (1 January 2014: £6.3m) have been reclassified from tangible fixed assets to intangible fixed assets as per 
the requirements of IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Receivables of £4.8m (1 January 2014: £5.6m) have been reclassified from current to fixed assets as per the requirments of IAS 1

Osmetech today
Osmetech is a fast developing and well funded international diagnostics
business targeting the high growth point of care sector. The acquisition
of the OPTI range of blood gas analysers in April 2003 from Roche
marked a transformation of the business by providing a profitable and
high quality revenue base. This has created a strong platform from
which the Group’s exciting pipeline of new products can be developed.
Based in Atlanta, US, OPTI has also provided an excellent operational
infrastructure which together with a strong international distributor
network is capable of supporting the Osmetech’s future growth.

During the last financial year Osmetech has made significant advances
with its strategy to develop a medical devices and diagnostics business in
the fast growing point of care market.  As a result of the successful
acquisition of the OPTI product line of blood gas analysers from Roche,
the Group’s risk profile improved substantially and the business is now
well funded with over £3m of cash and term deposits at the year end.
Chairman’s statement
The first full year of trading of the OPTI product line has exceeded our expectations at all levels.
Now fully integrated, this business provides a sound and profitable commercial base for the
Group.  There are clear organic growth plans for OPTI which will commence in the second half of
the coming financial year following the launch of three key new products and the start of the
important trading relationship with IDEXX in the veterinary market.
The OPTI business has provided us with an excellent platform from which we can develop other
opportunities within the Group, notably the vaginal infection product scheduled for the next
calendar year.  The experience of the OPTI management team and the proven development and
engineering capabilities will be very valuable in this process of bringing new products through to
market.
I am delighted to welcome Alfred Marek to the Board. Alfred joined Osmetech from Roche at the
time of the OPTI acquisition and is President of Osmetech’s Critical Care Division based in Atlanta.
Previously with AVL he was instrumental in developing their entire blood gas business prior to its
sale to Roche.
This strengthening of the management team comes at an important time for the Group as it seeks
to grow both organically and through continued strategic acquisitions.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Introduction
During the course of this financial year the Group has been successfully transformed from a pre-
revenue technology development operation to an international diagnostics business through the
ground breaking OPTI acquisition. The highly reliable revenue streams from OPTI have exceeded our
expectations and provide a solid base from which the business can develop its exciting opportunities
for further growth. The acquisition has substantially improved the financial and commercial risk
profile for Osmetech as it is now able to pursue its strategy for growth from a position of strength.
The market
The global medical diagnostics market is worth approximately $20bn and growing steadily, with
Osmetech positioned in the fast growing point of care (POC) market segment. Annual double digit
percentage growth is expected to continue in this sector as healthcare operators increasingly
demand faster test results.
The OPTI business operates in the POC arterial blood gas market which has experienced high
growth over recent years as testing migrates from traditional central hospital laboratory settings.
Osmetech’s vaginal infection product, currently under development, will also target similar POC
markets where there is a significant unmet need for improved infectious disease testing.
Business structure
Following the successful integration of the OPTI acquisition we have been able to consolidate the
Group’s operations on to the Atlanta site, where we have an excellent 60,000 sq ft facility capable
of supporting the anticipated growth of the business. 
The development of the vaginal infection product is now directly benefiting from the considerable
experience and expertise of the OPTI team. These benefits span the full commercial progression
from product development through to clinical, regulatory, production, sales and marketing
operations. Both products have similar customer bases and we intend to use OPTI’s strong
international network of distributors to gain access to all significant world markets.
OPTI trading
Sales revenues for the first full year of trading of $10.5m (£6.2m) far exceeded our original
expectations. These revenues include approximately $1m (£0.6m) of SARS-related sales to China
during the first half of the year.
New instrument sales accounted for 33% of total revenues with over 800 new analyser instruments
sold during the year. The active installed base of over 4,000 instruments with customers provides
robust and reliable demand for our proprietary consumables that are necessary in order to perform
the tests. This high quality stream of consumable sales revenues amounted to 65% of total sales
and should steadily grow as the installed base of instruments widens and further advances are
made with initiatives to increase the average number of tests per instrument.
OPTI’s self contained optical sensor cassette for
blood gas, electrolyte and metabolite analysis
Over 1.3 million consumable tests sold in 2003/4
representing 65% of total OPTI sales and a highly
reliable source of revenue. 4 Osmetech Annual Report 2004  
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
New OPTI products
We remain on target to introduce five new products during the coming year, the first three of
which, including the new Critical Care Analyser with colour touch screen, were launched at the
recent American Association of Clinical Chemists Conference (AACC) in Los Angeles. Two further
key products are expected to be introduced in the second half of the year and should provide the
basis for substantial revenue growth both through the sale of new instruments and consumable
revenues for the growing installed base. We believe that much of this new business will be
incremental as we will be able to offer products aimed at reducing the cost per test for both the
higher usage customer and those operators only requiring a narrow range of tests.
IDEXX agreement
We have recently entered into an OEM manufacturing and supply agreement with IDEXX
Laboratories, Inc, a worldwide leader in the development and commercialisation of animal health
diagnostic products. In 2003, IDEXX had sales of $475m and have a current market capitalisation of
approximately $1.8bn. This long term commercial relationship should provide a substantial level of
new business for OPTI in both instruments and consumables thereby allowing us to benefit from
leveraging our highly scaleable manufacturing infrastructure in Atlanta.
We have also entered into a development and supply contract with IDEXX to create a new
platform for measuring critical care parameters based on Osmetech’s proprietary optical
fluorescence technology.
Both contracts will span over a period of at least 10 years and will open the veterinarian market for
Osmetech’s technology and products. 
This relationship is not only a further validation of the OPTI technology but also demonstrates
Osmetech’s ability to scale up its manufacturing efficiently and become a top quality provider of
critical care diagnostic instrumentation.
Vaginal Infection Product
The increasing spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continues to be of major concern in
all markets worldwide. The Centre for Disease Control has reported that 15 million people are
diagnosed annually with an STD. In the ten year period to 2002, the NHS in the UK reported that
the number of STD patients doubled, with 1 in 10 of the entire UK adult population now estimated
to be infected with Chlamydia.
Current diagnostic practice is unable to provide results in a timely manner that would allow the
early commencement of appropriate treatment that could provide improved control over the
further spread of infection in the community. There is a clear unmet need for a simple and
objective test for the most common and clinically important vaginal infections that is capable of
delivering results within the time period of a normal patient visit.
The portable OPTI CCA analyser
Over 800 new OPTI CCA instruments sold in 2003/4
increasing the active installed base of units to over
4,000 from which repeat consumable sales
will be generated. Osmetech Annual Report 2004    5

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Good progress has continued to be made with the development of a device capable of satisfying
this market requirement. The device’s automated testing process has been clinically tested and has
provided results comparable to the manual methods currently used. This is an important step and
the tests will now be optimised further and combined within the single platform device prior to the
commencement of clinical trials. FDA regulatory approval for the combined device will be required
prior to launch in the US in 2005.
Financial review
Sales revenues totalled $10,453,000 (£6,180,000), with 38% representing direct US sales and the
remainder through third party distributors serving other markets. In product terms, the highly
reliable repeat consumable sales accounted for 65% of total business revenues.
The gross profit margin was abnormally high at 55.8% reflecting the successful utilisation of slow
moving and redundant inventory acquired as part of the purchase of the OPTI business.
The profitable trading of OPTI together with the significant reduction in the cost base of the
remainder of the business has contributed to a substantial reduction in the loss for the year to
£1,168,000 (2003 – £3,667,000). Development costs associated with the new product introductions
will however increase in the coming year.
Cash outflows before financing at £2,084,000 were higher than the reported loss for the year,
reflecting the final payments of the deferred consideration of $795,000 (£422,000) for OPTI
together with an increase of £474,000 in trade debtors due to the growth of the business over the
full trading period.
Following the £2,000,000 placing to institutional investors in October 2003, the Group ended the year
with cash balances and term deposits of £3,172,000. This represents a strong cash position and we
are satisfied that the Group should have sufficient funds available to launch all of the new OPTI
products scheduled for the coming year through to the launch of the integrated vaginal infection
device.
All of OPTI’s sales revenues and the majority of its costs are dollar based. The surplus of dollars
that this generates broadly matches the dollar requirements for the rest of the Group.

Outlook
The relocation of Osmetech’s operational base to Atlanta has been extremely successful and our
thanks go to all our employees, old and new, for making this move and indeed this year as
productive and encouraging as it has been.
We have a high quality operational infrastructure capable of supporting the continued growth of
the business.  We expect to be able to build on the excellent performance of OPTI this year and
are confident of significant growth commencing in the second half of next year through the new
product introductions and the IDEXX relationship.
Osmetech is well placed in a fast growth market sector, with a strong commercial business base
and access to enabling technologies, including its proprietary electronic nose technology, capable
of meeting the market requirements for new products.  We will also continue to search for
opportunities through suitable acquisitions to further stimulate this growth.

Compliance
As an AIM listed company, the Combined Code is not mandatory and the Company has therefore not produced a separate
Corporate Governance or Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Going Concern
Having reviewed the Group’s budgets and financial projections and after making due and careful enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The accounts, therefore, are prepared on a going concern basis.
Directors’ responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing
those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the web site is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that have occurred
to the information contained in the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site. 10 Osmetech Annual Report 2004
Report of the directors
continued
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other information
included in the annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Company has due regard to the payment terms of suppliers and settles all undisputed accounts in accordance with the
payment terms agreed with the supplier for each business transaction. The Company had 18 days (2003 – 22 days) of purchases
outstanding at the end of the financial year.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are eligible for settlement through CREST, the system for securities to be held and transferred in
electronic form rather than in paper. Shareholders are not obliged to use CREST and can continue to hold and transfer shares in
paper without loss of rights.
Independent Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Electronic Communications
The Company may deliver shareholder information including Annual and Interim Reports, Forms of Proxy and Notices of General
Meetings in an electronic format to shareholders. 
If you would like to receive shareholder information in electronic format, please register your request on the Company’s Registrar’s
electronic database at www.capitaregistrars.com. You will initially need your unique ‘investor code’, which you will find at the top of
your share certificate. There is no charge for this service. If you wish to subsequently change your mind, you may do so by
contacting the Company’s Registrars by post or through their web site.
If you elect to receive shareholder information electronically, please note that it is the shareholder’s responsibility to notify the
Company of any change to their name, address, e-mail address or other contact details. Shareholders should also note that, with
electronic communication, the Company’s obligations will be satisfied when it transmits the notification of availability of
information or such other document as may be involved to the electronic address it has on file. The Company cannot be held
responsible for any failure in transmission beyond its control any more than it can for postal failure. In the event of the Company
becoming aware that an electronic notification is not successfully transmitted, a further two attempts will be made. In the event
that the transmission is still unsuccessful a hard copy of the notification will be mailed to the shareholder. In the event that specific
software is required to access information placed on the Company’s website it will be available via the website without charge.
Before electing for electronic communications shareholders should ensure that they have the appropriate equipment and
computer capabilities sufficient for the purpose. The Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure no viruses are present in
any communication it sends out but cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any e-mail
or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to
use. Any electronic communication received by the Company that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
Shareholders wishing to receive shareholder information in the conventional printed form will continue to do so and need take no
further action.

Annual General Meeting – Explanation of Special Business
Renewal of Authority to Allot Shares and Disapplication of Pre-emption rights (Resolutions 6 and 7)
Resolution 6
The directors may only allot shares or grant rights over shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. The general authority
granted at the annual general meeting held on 28 August, 2003 is due to expire at the annual general meeting in 2004.
Accordingly, Resolution 6 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant a new authority to allot unissued share capital up to
an aggregate nominal value of £2,014,767, representing 33
1
/3 per cent. of the total issued ordinary share capital as at 5 August
2004. If given, this authority will expire at the earlier of (A) 31 October 2005 and (B) the conclusion of the annual general meeting in
2005. Other than in respect of the Company’s obligations under its employee share schemes the directors have no present
intention of utilising the authority set out in this resolution to issue any of the authorised but unissued share capital of the
Company. This authority, if granted, will be in addition to any other like authority to the extent not utilised at the time and date it is
granted.
Resolution 7
The directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares where they propose to
do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The general authority granted at the annual
general meeting held on 28 August, 2003 is due to expire at the annual general meeting in 2004. Accordingly, Resolution 7 will be
proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority. If given, this power will expire at the earlier of (A) 31 October 2005 and (B)
the conclusion of the annual general meeting in 2005. Apart from rights issues, open offers and other pre-emptive issues, the
authority will be limited to the issue of shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,208,860 being 20 per cent. of the issued
ordinary share capital at 5 August 2004. This authority does not accord with IPC guidelines, but the directors regard the authority
as desirable to maximise the options open to the Company in the coming year.

Independent auditors’ report
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Osmetech plc
We have audited the financial statements of Osmetech plc for the year ended 30 April 2004, which comprise the consolidated
profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the reconciliation of net cash flow to movement
in net funds, notes to the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses and
the related notes 1 to 26. The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company
and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in the Annual Report for the above year as set out in the
contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and Group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 30 April
2004 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

Notes forming part of the financial statements
for the year ended 30 April 2004
1  Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by section 230 of the Companies
Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account. The following accounting policies, which have not changed in the year,
have been applied.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of Osmetech plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to
30 April 2004. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to consolidate the results of its subsidiary 
undertakings. The results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition. 
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Acquisitions and disposals
On acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Group’s share of
net separable assets under the acquisition method in FRS6 ‘Acquisitions and Mergers’. Where the cost of acquisition exceeds the
fair values attributable to such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and capitalised in the balance sheet in
the year of acquisition. The results and cash flow relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account
and the consolidated cash flow statement from the date of acquisition.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales of goods and services to third parties and access fees, milestone payments and non-refundable licence
fees due from third parties, excluding value added tax.
Unearned amounts are carried forward as deferred income.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impariment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets over their expected useful
lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Short leasehold improvements – over the life of lease
Plant, machinery and motor vehicles – 10-35% per annum on cost
Office equipment – 25-50% per annum on cost 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, research and development tax credits and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected
to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a
right to pay less tax at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 20 Osmetech Annual Report 2004
Notes forming part of the financial statements
continued
1  Accounting policies continued
Finance costs
Finance costs associated with the issue of debt are deducted from the proceeds of the issue and charged to the profit and loss
account over the term of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in note 26:
• Short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities.
• The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
• Forward exchange contracts are used to fix the value of the related asset or liability in the contract currency at the contract
rate and any gains or losses on these instruments are offset. Where the instrument is used to hedge a committed or
probable future transaction, gains and losses are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Foreign currency
Profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rate. Assets and liabilities of
the foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences which arise from translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiary undertakings and the translation of
the profit and loss account between closing rate and average rate are taken to reserves.
All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings,
which, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, are taken directly to
reserves to the extent of the exchange differences arising on the net investment in those enterprises.
Intellectual property rights
Patent and trademark costs are capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over the shorter of the life of the patent or
trademark or its useful economic life. The Company’s other intellectual property rights are stated at cost and amortised over their
useful economic lives in relation to revenues generated. 
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, is
capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. This is presumed to be 15 years unless
circumstances change significantly resulting in an impairment of the carrying value.
Research and development
All research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Stock
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated as follows:
Raw materials – cost of purchase on first in, first out basis.
Finished goods – cost of raw materials and labour and attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal. Osmetech Annual Report 2004 21

1  Accounting policies continued
Pension costs
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they
become payable.
Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on
such a basis.
2  Turnover
The turnover is wholly attributable to the Group’s principal activity.
Turnover is analysed by market as follows:
2004 2003
£ £
United Kingdom 123,923 3,008
Rest of Europe 1,142,784 43,082

commercial interests.

–   capital allowances in excess of depreciation (22,826) –
–   movement in short term timing differences (11,432) –
Total current tax credit (147,804) (163,762)
Factors that may affect the future tax charge
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses carried forward as there is
insufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered. The amount of the asset not recognised at a standard tax rate of 30% is
£6,412,912 (2003 – £5,019,332). In addition, a deferred tax asset in respect of capital allowances and general provisions of £317,063
(2003 – £nil) has not been recognised. These assets will be recoverable if the company generates profits in the future from the
same trade in which the losses were incurred.
11  Loss attributable to the Company
The loss for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company was £1,283,961 (2003 – £2,987,237). As
permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the parent
company.
12  Loss per share
The loss per share of 0.21p (2003 – loss per share 0.94p) has been calculated on the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the year namely 561,457,432; (2003 – 389,690,248) and losses of £1,168,114; (2003 – £3,667,283). 
FRS 14 requires presentation of diluted EPS when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease net profit
or increase net loss per share. For a loss making company with outstanding share options, net loss per share would only be
increased by the exercise of out-of-the-money options. Since it is inappropriate to assume that option holders would act
irrationally, no adjustment is made to diluted EPS for out-of-the-money share options. Osmetech Annual Report 2004 25

24  Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions with other Group undertakings as voting rights
are controlled within the Group and consolidated financial statements are publicly available.
No director was, or is, materially interested in any contract subsisting during, or at the end of the financial year which was
significant in relation to the business of the Group.
25  Pension costs
The Company makes contributions into money purchase pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The assets of the
schemes are held separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The pension cost charge represents
contributions payable and paid by the Company to the funds, and amounted to £107,637 for the year (2003 – £87,443).
26  Financial instruments
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard
13 – Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures (FRS13). Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiaries
are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures other than the currency risk
disclosures.
There is no material difference between the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial instruments, either in the current or
prior year.
The Group’s treasury activities are designed to provide suitable, flexible funding arrangements to satisfy its requirements. The
Group uses financial instruments comprising cash and term deposits. The main risks arising from the Group financial instruments
are interest rate and liquidity risks. The Board reviews policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged from previous years.
The Group aims to achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility of funding by maintaining a range of maturities on its
liquid resources. The Group also mixes the duration of its deposits to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has limited foreign currency risk since overseas subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses denominated
predominantly in the currencies of the countries in which they operate. All monetary assets and liabilities of the Group are
materially denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.

respectively.

ChaIRMaN’s state MeNt
Your company has produced record results with  
pre-tax profits of £101.7m, being the highest since  
it became a property company in 1984, 30 years  
ago. The total unleveraged return of its property  
portfolio, as measured by iPD, was 23.8%,  
compared to the iPD Universe of march valued  
funds of 13.4%.
Total property return increased by 290% to £140.1m (2013: £35.9m) and 
included continued growing rents of £29.8m (up 21.6% on 2013) and 
development profits of £65.0m (2013: £7 .0m), a remarkable increase of 
828%! Diluted EPRA net asset value per share increased by 18.6% to 313p 
(2013: 264p). Total Shareholder Return for the year to 31 March 2014 was 
61.1%, compared to returns of companies in the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Super Sector Return Index of 27 .4% and for the wider UK Equity Market as 
a whole of 8.8%. These record results allow the Board to continue its 
progressive dividend policy and to recommend to shareholders a final 
dividend of 4.75p, an increase of 28% on 2013 (3.70p), taking the total for 
the year to 6.75p, an overall increase of 22% (2013: 5.55p).
This year’s results reflect the culmination of many years’ work on two very 
profitable schemes on which helical acted as development manager. Details 
of the projects at White City, London W12 and 200 Aldersgate, London EC1 
are set out later in this report but together they contributed £61.0m (2013: 
£1.0m) of the £65.0m development profit made by the Group during the 
year. Our decision to invest in the regions for income and in London for 
capital growth continues to create shareholder value with see-through net 
rents of £29.8m and gains on sale or revaluation of the investment portfolio 
of £45.0m, including an 18.6% valuation increase on our London assets. We 
now have an investment portfolio of over £600m of which 43% is in London 
and the remaining 57% in regional assets mainly, but not solely, held for 
income generation.

INCREASE IN TOTAL DIVIDEND
The expansion of the Company’s activities by investing in London and the 
regions was financed by the proceeds of an £80m Retail Bond issued in 
June 2013, and bank facilities provided by our banking partners. Our 
business model is predicated on the basis that we are able to read and 
understand the real estate cycle. We use gearing on a tactical basis, being 
raised to accentuate property performance when property returns are judged 
to outperform materially the cost of debt. however, we remain nimble enough 
to reduce our exposure to the cycle at the appropriate time. Our medium to 
long term target for our loan to value, the ratio of net borrowings to the value 
of property, is 50% and at 31 March 2014 this ratio was 46% (2013: 46%).
The Group is well positioned to face the future with a sound financial base, 
having increased its income stream by replacing low growth assets with 
higher yielding retail properties, refinancing maturing debt with longer term 
bank facilities and reducing its exposure to any future interest rate rises by 
entering into hedging instruments, taking advantage of low interest rates. In 
addition, and with the backing of the major property lending banks, the Group 
has access to a number of new bank facilities which, when added to its cash 
balances, provides a level of liquidity and resources that enable it to continue 
to rebalance its portfolio. We believe that there are further opportunities in 
today’s real estate market to add to the portfolio, boosting income returns 
and the potential for capital gains.
In my statement in May 2013 I noted that I believed we were on the cusp of 
returning to delivering outperformance. These results are the vindication of 
that belief. Looking forward, our London development schemes at The 
Bower, Old Street, Barts Square, Maple house, Clifton Street, Creechurch 
Place and hammersmith Town hall provide comfort that, in the absence of a 
major economic downturn, and with an investment portfolio providing 
growing income and capital surpluses, the Company is well placed to 
continue to deliver outperformance and ongoing value for shareholders.
nigel mcnair Scott 
Chairman 
19 June  2014 “Helical aims to deliver market leading returns by  
acquiring higher yielding investment properties,  
applying a rigorous approach to asset management  
and deploying limited equity through a variety of  
different structures into development situations  
which have the potential to be highly profitable. ”
The first half of the financial year was dominated by the outstanding success 
of the projects at White City, London W12 and at 200 Aldersgate, London 
EC1. It would be wrong not to reflect on these results as both schemes 
illustrate the ‘helical model’ of applying limited equity and hard work to create 
exceptional performance. To remind shareholders, these two projects resulted 
in a net cash receipt of £62m, an outstanding return on a total of £1.5m 
invested.
We acquired the 10 acre site south of the A40 at White City in joint venture 
with Aviva and worked with them over a number of years helping to create 
the vision for the Mayor’s Opportunity Area, resulting in a resolution to grant 
planning permission for a 1.5m sq ft mixed use development. The site was 
sold to Imperial College in September 2013 crystallising the substantial profit 
payment. 
The second significant transaction involved us working with Deutsche 
Pfandbriefbank on the refurbishment and letting of the 367 ,000 sq ft office 
and retail building at 200 Aldersgate, EC1. Last summer we completed the 
final letting and oversaw the sale of the building for £228m and, as a result, 
helical received a substantial profit-share payment. My fellow directors 
Gerald Kaye and Matthew Bonning-Snook deserve recognition for these 
outstanding achievements. 
Shareholders will recall that at the time of the 2012 accounts we undertook 
to augment our investment portfolio to 75% of the Company’s assets, 
reducing the development/risk element of the business to 25%. I am pleased 
to report that we have achieved what we set out to do. 
We also undertook at that time to divide the investment portfolio between 
investments in the regions (shopping centres, retail parks and logistics) 
chosen for high yields and income, and assets in central London to provide 
capital growth. I am pleased to report that by recycling our capital and taking 
advantage of the successful issue of an £80m retail bond last summer, we 
have been able to increase the size of our share of the property portfolio to 
over £800m. We have maintained the high yields from our regional 
investments and achieved an 18.6% capital gain from our investment assets 
in central London.

the Company forward in the future. We are particularly pleased to have agreed a 
joint venture with h OOPP (healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan) to develop 
speculatively the 273,000 sq ft office scheme in EC3, now renamed Creechurch 
Place. We are beginning construction this summer for delivery in Q4 2016. 
We, in partnership with Crosstree Real Estate Partners, are now on site at our 
396,000 sq ft office refurbishment at The Bower, Old Street, EC1. Further 
developments at Maple house, City Road, EC1 and Clifton Street, EC2 complete 
our programme in the burgeoning Shoreditch tech belt. At Barts Square, EC1, our 
scheme in partnership with Baupost, we are on track to start the first phase of 94 
apartments in January 2015. Subsequent phases comprise two office buildings 
of 202,000 sq ft and 23,500 sq ft, a further 121 apartments and retail/A3.
Working jointly with Grainger, we have received planning consent for a mixed 
use development adjoining hammersmith Town hall that comprises offices 
for the Council, 196 apartments, a cinema, retail, restaurant and café space. 
At the same time, work on our 220,000 sq ft pre-let and pre-sold 
development for Scottish Power in Glasgow proceeds to plan. We live in a 
time of short supply in most sectors yet the improving economy is giving rise 
to strong occupational demand. helical has been fortunate in timing its 
development acquisitions; all are well structured financially and we look 
forward to delivering and monetising these projects over the next few years.  
We have had an outstanding year and are exactly where we planned to be. 
No doubt there will be a few blips along the way, but we remain positive on 
the prospects for our market place. We continue to focus on London offices 
and high yielding regional property for the investment portfolio whilst building 
out the London development programme. We remain highly focused, highly 
incentivised and confident in our prospects over the next two to three years.
It remains for me to thank all the members of the team for their outstanding 
efforts and also to express my thanks to the members of the Board, our bankers, 
the many professionals who have advised us so well and to you our shareholders.

HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
The group’s objective is to deliver market leading 
returns by acquiring high yielding investment 
properties, applying a rigorous approach to asset 
management and deploying limited equity through 
a variety of different structures into development 
situations which have the potential to be highly 
profitable.
The Company aims to make excellent returns for 
its shareholders (which include the management 
team who own 15% of the Company) through a 
variety of high margin activities.
OUR BUSin ESS mODEl An D STRATEgY
investment strategy
The investment portfolio, which is mainly let and income producing, has  
two main purposes: 
•  To provide a steady income stream to cover overheads, interest and 
dividends;
• To produce above average capital growth in the Group’s net asset value. 
The Group seeks to achieve these aims through careful, disciplined selection 
of properties, including multi-let offices in London, shopping centres, industrial 
estates, regional offices and mixed-use portfolios. helical’s key aim, when 
undertaking this selection process, is to ensure that there is sustainable 
demand from potential occupiers for all of its assets. helical aims to have a 
blend of central London properties, where yields are lower but the potential 
for capital growth higher and properties outside London where surplus 
cashflow is greater.
The Group frequently refurbishes and/or extends its properties to create 
value. helical also works closely with tenants with the aim of maintaining 
maximum occupancy in its properties. The Company’s relationship with 
tenants can lead to opportunities to increase value though re-gearing leases 
or moving tenants within a building as their respective businesses expand or 
contract. 
The Group acquires properties where good management can enhance value 
rather than relying simply on market improvements. 
development strategy
The Group aims to limit the amount of equity that it deploys into development 
situations through a variety of different structures. The intention is to 
maximise the Group’s share of profits in a development by leveraging the capital 
employed by the Group and with a view to managing the risks inherent in the 
development process. The Group employs a wide variety of approaches to 
development activities including:
•  Participation in profit share situations where no equity investment is 
required, where helical will seek to minimise its ongoing development fee 
to maximise its profit share so that its interests are completely aligned 
with its partners. In this way, for minimal equity commitments, the 
Company can benefit from a significant profit share if it contributes to a 
project’s success by using its skills and experience through the entire 
development process. This participation method was used for the 
development at 200 Aldersgate, London EC1. 
•  Reduce up-front equity required by entering into conditional contracts or 
options. helical uses this approach at Creechurch Place and for its 
foodstore led supermarket development programme, for example Shirley 
(where land is optioned or put under contract conditional on achieving 
planning permission and pre-let to a supermarket operator) thereby 
mitigating the risks of the developments.
•  Co-investment alongside a larger partner where we have a minority equity 
stake, receiving a “waterfall” payment whereby we obtain a greater profit 
share than our percentage investment depending upon the profitability of 
the project. This strategy is used for the developments at Barts Square, 
The Bower, Creechurch Place and White City.
•  Traditional forward funding, where the cost of the development overrun is 
borne by the developer for a commensurate profit participation. In such a 
case, the developer will have no equity invested but will underwrite a 
maximum build cost which bears the risk of costs being in excess of an 
agreed maximum construction price.

Key PeRFoRMaNCe INdICatoRs
The Group measures its performance using a number of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). Management is incentivised to 
outperform the Group’s competitors by setting appropriate levels for performance indicators against which rewards are measured. The Company also designs 
its remuneration packages to align management’s interests with shareholders’ aspirations. Key to this is the monitoring and reporting against identifiable 
performance targets and benchmarks.
inVESTmEnT P ROPERTY DATABAn K
The Investment Property Databank (“IPD”) produces a number of independent benchmarks of property returns which are regarded as the main industry indices.
IPD has compared the ungeared performance of helical’s total property portfolio against that of portfolios within IPD for the last 20 years. The Group’s annual 
performance target is to exceed the top quartile of the IPD database. helical’s ungeared performance for the year to 31 March 2014 was 23.8% (2013: 8.6%) 
compared to the IPD median benchmark of 13.4% (2013: 3.9%) and upper quartile benchmark of 15.4% (2013: 4.7%).

helical’s trading & development portfolio (22% of gross assets) is shown in IPD at the lower of book cost or fair value and uplifts are only included on the sale 
of an asset.
EPRA n ET ASSET VAl UE PER SHARE (PEnCE) 
A property company’s share price should reflect growth in net assets per share. The Group’s main objective is to maximise growth in assets from increases in 
investment portfolio values and from retained earnings from other property related activities.
Net asset value per share represents the share of net assets attributable to each ordinary share. Whilst the basic and diluted net asset per share calculations 
provide a guide to performance, the property industry prefers to use an EPRA adjusted diluted net asset per share. The adjustments necessary to arrive at this 
figure are shown in note 33 to these accounts.
Management is incentivised to exceed 15% p.a. growth in net asset value per share. The diluted net asset value per share, excluding trading stock surplus, at 
31 March 2014 increased by 33% to 288p (2013: 217p).
Including the surplus on valuation of trading and development stock, the diluted EPRA net asset value per share at 31 March 2014  increased by 18.6% to 
313p (2013: 264p). Diluted EPRA triple net asset value per share increased by 20.1% to 311p (2013: 259p).

helical’s strategy is to hold approximately 75% of its real estate assets as investment property and 25% as development property. helical believes that at

HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
The group’s c.£600m investment portfolio provides 
income to cover all operational and finance costs 
and dividends. The group has a strong focus on 
asset management, maximising net operating 
income and working closely with its tenants. 
Helical’s goal (over recent years) has been to have 
75% of its portfolio in investment properties and 
25% in development properties, blending stable 
recurring income with exposure to potentially 
superior profitability in developments. The group 
now has 75% of its assets in investment properties 
and, having realised its stated goal, will look to 
retain this balance going forward. 
Helical’s income stream is diverse and secure with 
no tenant accounting for more than 5.4% of the 
rent roll. The group’s average weighted unexpired 
lease term is 7 .2 years (2013: 6.4 years). 
The income stream has grown steadily since 2010 
and is highly reversionary. The passing rent from 
the investment portfolio is £37 .7m (2013: £28.7m)
and the estimated rental value of the portfolio is 
£45.6m (2013: £32.4m) (Helical’s share). This 
reversionary income will be captured through 
letting vacant units and rent reviews. 
Through judicious buying of under-rented buildings 
in growth areas, securing lettings and undertaking 
refurbishments, Helical aims to generate substantial 
capital growth in our property values. 
ASSET mAnAg EmEnT 
During the year contracted income increased by £0.37m as a result of new 
lettings and rent reviews, net of any losses from breaks and expiries (2013: 
£0.38m). 
There was significant activity within the investment portfolio with a lease 
event on nearly 200 leases. 
The Group concluded £2.0m of new lettings and renewals (6.0% rent roll) 
and benefitted from uplifts at rent reviews of £0.12m, offsetting the loss of 
rent at lease end or break (3.7% rent roll) and a further £0.35m through 
tenant administrations (0.9% rent roll).  
Rent lost at break/expiry (£1.4m)
Rent lost to administrations (£0.35m)
Rent reviews £0.12m
Lease renewals and new lettings £2.0m
Total change £0.37m
Overall the Group has seen good letting demand across the portfolio, 
reducing the vacancy rate from 5.7% (31 March 2013) to 4.6% (31 March 
2014). The Group has seen strong take up and rental growth in its London 
office portfolio with estimated rental values increasing by 7 .3% in the year for 
the London portfolio (excluding Barts Square and The Bower at Old Street 
which will be redeveloped). 
SAl ES An D ACQUiSiTiOn S 
There has been significant sales and purchase activity reflective of an 
increasingly buoyant property market. Since 31 March 2013 the Group has 
sold £156.7m (2013: £50.8m) (helical’s share) of property. Significant sales 
include Battersea Studios for £35.0m, TK Maxx in Cardiff for £14.8m and 
Asda in Clydebank for £12.1m (helical’s share £7 .3m), as well as our 
successes at 200 Aldersgate and White City.
helical completed £11.7m of sales of units from our retirement village 
portfolio (2013: £10.6m). 
The Group has been extremely active acquiring properties over the year, 
made possible through profits realised from 200 Aldersgate and White City 
and with funds raised from the retail bond. Reflecting the strategy of 
acquiring higher yielding assets outside London for cashflow and lower 
yielding assets in London for capital growth, significant acquisitions included 
Enterprise house, Paddington for £30.75m; New Loom house, Whitechapel 
for £34.2m; Maple house, City Road for £17 .55m; Artillery Lane, City of 
London for £6.8m; huddersfield Retail Park for £17 .0m; Churchgate and Lee 
house, Manchester for £34.0m and a mixed use office, industrial and retail 
portfolio known as the Quartz portfolio for £48.6m. 
Total acquisitions for the year were £199.9m, (2013: £60.8m). 
FUTURE inVESTmEnT ACQUiSiTiOn S 
The market is increasingly competitive both in and outside London although 
the Group continues to find good value in its core markets as demonstrated 
by purchases in Manchester (for £34m) and, post year end, the Constellation 
portfolio, comprising 10 industrial and office properties for £40m.

helical was appointed asset and development 
manager by Deutsche Pfandbriefbank in  
May 2010. The brief was to refurbish and let this 
office building, vacant since 2005 when the 
previous tenant, Clifford Chance, relocated to 
Canary Wharf. The reception areas and common 
parts were redesigned and the atrium re-clad, 
creating a “vertical village” for office users 
comprising a variety of floor-plates to suit a range 
of different occupiers, as well as exceptional 
tenant facilities, including a concierge, cycle store 
and changing facility service, an on-site gym and 
a café and business lounge. Refurbishment works 
were completed in January 2011 when the 
building was re-launched. The building comprises 
348,000 sq ft of offices, 19,810 sq ft of retail 
and 39,317 sq ft of basement leisure space. By 
June 2013 we had let 338,000 sq ft of office 
space, 9,000 sq ft of retail and the whole of the 
basement space to Virgin Active, and the building 
was sold to clients of Ashby Capital in September 
2013. This sale triggered the development 
management profit share.

A retirement village is a private residential community in which active 
over-55s are able to live independently in retirement. Residents have 
typically down-sized from a larger family home into a cottage or 
apartment which provides no maintenance or security issues.
With access to a central clubhouse containing a bar and restaurant 
facilities, health and fitness rooms and surrounded by maintained 
grounds, this retirement option is proving increasingly popular.

The original Bramshott Place Village was an 
Elizabethan mansion built in 1580, although now 
only the original Grade II listed Tudor Gatehouse 
remains, which we have fully restored. The land 
and buildings were derelict when helical acquired 
them in 2001. Changing planning from its 
previously designated employment use to a 
retirement village took several years but was 
eventually achieved in 2006.
The development of 151 cottages and 
apartments, and the new clubhouse, has 
completed. To date, the Group has sold 138 units, 
with reservations on a further five units, with just 
nine units, mainly apartments, left to sell.

148 units, eight affordable housing units, a 50

clubhouse building. Following changes to the 
scheme the development will be for 171 units. 
The first phase (48 units) started in May 2012

REViEW OF THE YEAR
These outstanding results, created by a combination of significant 
development profits, growing rental surpluses and revaluation gains on the 
investment portfolio, are reflected in shareholders’ funds which increased by 
34% in the year to 31 March 2014. This growth in the Group’s balance 
sheet has enabled it to continue its rebalancing of the Group’s property 
portfolio towards its intended 75:25 target balance between an income 
producing portfolio and non-income producing development stock. The 
Group’s portfolio, including its share of property held in joint ventures, 
increased to £802m (2013: £626m), largely the result of investment 
property acquisitions during the year. This expansion of the Group’s activities 
has been undertaken without increasing its loan to value, which remained at 
46% (2013: 46%) and with a reduction in gearing to 109% (2013: 113%).
During the year the Group continued to lengthen and diversify its borrowings 
profile. New secured borrowings included a £75m revolving credit facility and 
a £100m investment facility, and these were supplemented by the issue of 
an unsecured retail bond, raising a further £80m. With the repayment of 
short term debt, these new sources of funding enabled the Group to extend 
its overall debt maturity profile to 3.9 years (2013: 2.6 years), albeit with an 
increased weighted average cost of debt of 4.5% (2013: 3.9%). 
At 31 March 2014, the Group had unutilised bank facilities of c. £106m and  
c. £80m of cash. These facilities are available to fund the Group’s retirement 
village programme, refurbishment works at Maple house, City Road EC1 and 
The Bower, Old Street EC1.
EPRA EARning S
Adjusted diluted EPRA Earnings per share, before performance related awards, increased by 478% to 47 .4p per share (2013: 8.2p), reflecting increased 
development profits of £65.0m (2013: £7 .0m) and the Group’s share of net rental income of £29.8m (2013: £24.5m). After taking into account performance 
related bonuses and share awards of £17 .9m (2013: £6.8m), EPRA Earnings per share was 32.5p (2013: 2.4p).

Financial rEvi EW continued
inCOmE STATEmEnT
The main focus of the year was on targeting and working towards the many 
development milestones that were set in 2012 and 2013 and which had a 
substantial impact on the income statement for the year under review. Apart 
from these milestones, we continued to dispose of investment properties which 
had reached their short to medium term potential. We added to our investment 
portfolio with the acquisition of c. £200m (£189m plus costs) of property 
compared to £72m of sales. 
REnTAl inCOm E An D PROPERTY OVERHEADS
Gross rental income receivable by the Group in respect of wholly owned 
properties increased by 16.2% to £30.0m (2013: £25.8m), mainly reflecting 
the acquisitions made throughout the year. The Group’s share of gross rents 
receivable in joint ventures increased by 6.5% to £6.6m (2013: £6.2m). 
The see-through gross rents totalled £36.6m, an increase of 14.3% on 
2013. After taking account of head rents payable on those properties held 
on long leases, and the costs of managing the assets, void costs and the 
amortisation of annual letting costs, see-through net rents increased by 
22.0% to £29.8m (2013: £24.5m). Bad debts from tenant administrations 
and failures fell to 0.4% of gross rents (2013: 2.4%).
DEVEl OPmEnT PRO g RAmmE
Turning to the development programme, the letting and sale of 200 
Aldersgate, London EC1 by Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and the sale of  
a 10 acre site at White City, London W12 by our joint venture partner Aviva, 
realised total development profits of £62.0m, of which £1.0m had been 
recognised last year. The retail schemes at Leisure Plaza, Milton Keynes and 
Shirley, West Midlands, contributed £2.2m of profit whilst our retirement 
village development programme contributed profits of £1.5m from continued 
sales at Bramshott Place, Liphook and from the first completions at Durrants 
Village, Faygate. Development management fees from our schemes at 
Glasgow, Barts Square and Riverbank house contributed a further £0.6m 
and improving land values allowed us to write back provisions of £0.5m. Set 
against these profits were the costs of our Polish operation of £0.6m, 
resulting in the Group’s share of net development profits at £65.0m 
(2013: £7 .0m).
SHARE OF RESUl TS OF jOinT VE nTURES
As mentioned above, helical has increasingly sought to acquire larger assets 
in joint ventures with property funds that provide the majority of the equity 
required to purchase the assets, whilst relying on the Group to provide the 
asset management or development expertise. These joint ventures include 
our share of the investment properties at Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank; 
Barts Square, London EC1 and The Bower 207 Old Street, London EC1, and 
our development schemes at Europa Centralna, Gliwice, Poland; Shirley Town 
Centre, West Midlands; Leisure Plaza, Milton Keynes and King Street, 
hammersmith. Detailed analysis of the financial position of our share of 
these joint ventures is provided in note 19 to this report and the see-through 
analysis on page 108. In the year under review, net rents of £5.4m (2013: 
£4.9m) were received, offset by net finance costs of £2.5m (2013: £2.2m). 
A gain on revaluation of the investment portfolio of £15.7m (2013: £3.1m), 
primarily arose in respect of Barts Square and Old Street. Net of taxes, our 
joint ventures contributed £16.4m (2013: £3.9m). 
ADmini STRATiOn COSTS
Administration costs, before performance related awards, increased by 9%, 
from £8.1m to £8.8m, mainly arising from costs incurred in connection with 
the proposed move of the Company’s head office.
Performance related share awards and bonus payments increased to 
£15.7m (2013: £6.0m) for the year. Of this amount, the £6.3m (2013: 
£1.9m) charge for share awards under the Performance Share Plan is 
expensed through the Income Statement but added back to shareholders 
funds through the Statement of Changes in Equity. The £9.4m (2013: 
£4.1m) accrual for bonus payments comprises £5.1m (2013: £2.7m) which 
will be paid in June 2014, £2.9m (2013: £0.8m) which will be carried 
forward to next year in accordance with the terms of the Annual Bonus 
Scheme 2012 and £1.4m (2013: £0.6m) which will be paid in deferred 
shares to be held for a minimum of three years. In addition, National

Interest payable on bank loans including our share of loans on assets held in 
joint ventures but before capitalised interest increased to £17 .3m (2013: 
£12.7m), reflecting the increased debt taken on to finance the expansion of 
the Group’s investment activities. Capitalised interest increased from £2.5m 
to £2.8m as development schemes progressed. Other interest payable 
increased from £1.7m to £2.5m. As a consequence of these movements, 
total finance costs increased by £5.2m from £11.8m to £17 .0m. Finance 
income earned on cash deposits of £1.8m (2013: £0.9m) was boosted by 
the £2.9m profit realised on the purchase of a loan at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments have been valued on a mark to market basis 
and a credit of £5.3m (2013: charge of £2.6m) has been recognised in the

The deferred tax asset is principally derived from tax losses which the Group 
believe will be utilised against profits in the foreseeable future.
inVESTmEnT PORTFOliO
The issue of the £80m Retail Bond and development receipts of £62m, 
together with sales of over £70m of investment assets, where our asset 
management initiatives were completed, provided funds, net of loan 
repayments, for £200m of acquisitions and value enhancing capital 
expenditure. The sales of the investment assets generated a profit of £8.6m 
(2013: loss of £2.4m).
The £200m of additions to the investment portfolio, net of the £48m book 
value of sales together with a transfer of £9m from trading stock and added 
to the revaluation surplus of £21m, increased the value of the wholly owned 
investment properties from £312m to £493m. In joint venture the revaluation 
surpluses at Clydebank, Barts Square and The Bower at Old Street of 
£15.7m increased our share of the investment portfolio held in joint ventures 
to £107 .5m. T ogether, the Group’s share of the total investment portfolio, on a

facilities at 31 March 2014 was 3.0 years (2013: 1.9 years).
RETAil BOn D
In June 2013, the Group raised £80m from the issue of an unsecured Retail 
Bond with a 6.00% coupon. This bond is repayable in June 2020. Initially, the 
net proceeds were used to repay secured bank borrowings which were 
subsequently re-drawn, under the terms of our revolving credit facilities, to 
fund additions to our investment portfolio. The Retail Bond is included within 
borrowings repayable within six to seven years in note 25 to the financial

As noted above we hold a number of investment and development properties in 
joint venture with third parties and include in the above table our share, in 
proportion to our economic interest, of the debt associated with each asset. Of 
the amount due to be repaid in the year to 31 March 2015, £11.7m is in respect 
of the investment holding facility for Barts Square, and timed for a potential 
redevelopment of the site in 2015. In April 2015, our investment facility on the 
Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank, is repayable. During the year we agreed a

Risk is an integral part of any Group’s business activities and helical’s ability to identify, assess, monitor and manage each risk to which it is exposed is 
fundamental to its financial stability, current and future financial performance and reputation. As well as seeing changes in our internal and external 
environment as potential risks, we also see them as being opportunities which can drive performance.
Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set the overall risk appetite of the Group and the risk management strategies. helical’s 
management runs the business within these guidelines and part of its role is to act within these strategies and to report to the Board on how they are being 
operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and risk management strategies are continually assessed by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent with the 
Group’s overall strategy and with external market conditions. The effectiveness of the Group’s risk management strategy is reviewed every six months by the 
Audit Committee and by the full Board.
The risks faced by the Group do not change significantly from year to year but their importance and the Group’s response to them vary in accordance with 
changes in the internal and external environment. The Board considers not only the current situation but also potential future scenarios and how these might 
impact our business.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within the business. however the small size of our team and our flat management structure allows the executive 
directors to have close contact with all aspects of the business and allows us to ensure that the identification and management of risks and opportunities is 
part of the mindset of all decision makers at helical.
The principal risks faced by the Group, and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate these risks, are as follows:
mARKET RiSK 
Market risks are risks specific to the economy as a whole and to the property sector. 
Risk description Mitigation/action 
Property values decline: 
Current uncertainties in the world economy mean that future performance is 
difficult to predict 
helical management reviews external data
helical has been active in disposing of non-performing assets and 
rebalancing its portfolio for the changing market
helical keeps a diversified portfolio to prevent being over-exposed to one 
sector
Reduced tenant demand for space Our focus is on buying well let properties in good locations
We continue to ensure that vacant space is kept to a minimum
Appropriate timing of investment and divestment decisions Our management team is highly experienced
Market conditions result in difficulties in divestment of properties at a time  
when the proceeds are required for new investments Management constantly reviews the market conditions
STRATEgiC R iSK 
strategic risk includes the risk that the group’s business strategy or capital structure results in the group underperforming the rest of the 
property sector, or being unable to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.
Risk description Mitigation/action
Group’s strategy is inconsistent with market conditions, for example:
-  Asset concentration/lot size impacts on liquidity (e.g. if investments become 
difficult to sell, does this affect our liquidity?)
-  Asset concentration/mix creates excessive volatility in property revaluation 
movements
Management constantly monitors and considers changes to the Group 
strategy in the light of any changes to market conditions. The management 
team is very experienced and has a good track record in the property market
Due to the small size of the Group and the management team, changes to 
the strategy can be effected quickly

inTRODUCTiOn
helical Bar recognises that our business activities impact on the environment 
and the wider communities in which we operate. As our business involves 
working with joint venture partners and outsourcing partners, our direct 
impacts as a business are relatively small. however, we are aware of the 
influence we can exert through the implementation of responsible 
environmental and social practices via our partners, contractors and suppliers.
An endorsement of helical Bar’s commitment to managing environment and 
social impacts is our continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index. The 
FTSE4Good Index measures the performance of companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards and facilitates 
investment in those companies. Maintaining listed status on this index 
remains a key priority for helical Bar, and informs our evolving approach to 
corporate responsibility. 
mAnAging C ORPORATE RESPOn SiBiliTY
Each year we review and update our environmental management system, 
which has been in place since 2003, and the updated environmental 
management system, available on the Company website, is embedded within 
the operations of helical Bar. Key elements of the system include:
•  ‘Environment’ and ‘Corporate Responsibility’ policies which set out helical 
Bar’s high-level commitment across a number of impact areas. These are 
reviewed at Board level annually and are implemented by our senior 
management team. 
•  Annual (and rolling) performance targets to enable us to focus our efforts 
throughout the year on measurable, yet achievable performance goals. 
This year we have continued to report on energy and water consumption 
at our large managed multi-let assets and head office, and measured our 
performance against quantitive targets set in 2013. In addition, we have 
measured the proportion of waste at our managed assets as well as within 
our developments.
•  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help us monitor progress towards 
these targets and to ensure that we are able to report in line with investor 
disclosure requirements, notably FTSE4Good. It should be acknowledged 
that our particular business model with regard to the buying and selling of 
assets means that absolute performance measures can be difficult to 
compare year on year. We are currently investigating reporting against 
selected intensity KPIs.
•  Checklists to assist us in applying minimum sustainability requirements across 
our development activities. In collaboration with our consultants, we developed 
a sustainability project management checklist to ensure that sustainability 
issues are incorporated into all decisions throughout the development 
lifecycle, which was reviewed and updated in the reporting year. In addition we 
utilise a Contractor Checklist that is issued to individual contractors in order to 
address our corporate goals at the construction stage. 
•  Effective use of internal audit and review through quarterly meetings of 
key helical Bar personnel, their external corporate responsibility advisors 
and principal managing agents to ensure effective delivery of the 
objectives and targets.
The management system we have developed has been designed specifically 
to reflect the flexibility of helical Bar’s business model. It also reflects the 
key role that our partners play in delivering enhanced sustainability outcomes 
in all our business ventures, be they developments/refurbishments or in the 
management of individual multi-let assets. 
REViEW OF PROg RESS in THE YEAR TO 31 mARCH 2014
The benefits of managing our environmental and social impacts include 
increased ability to secure planning consent, improved marketability of assets 
to prospective tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, mitigation of the 
risk of future legislation and regulation, and enhanced corporate reputation.
Below we outline our progress in relation to the each of our Corporate 
Responsibility impact areas. 
EnVi ROnmEnT
Our high-level corporate commitments to environmental issues are outlined 
in the Company’s Environmental Policy which can be found on the Company 
website. The policy details our commitments across a range of impact areas 
and our development and property management activities. In 2013-14, 
helical Bar set itself 25 targets to guide the environmental element of its 
Corporate Responsibility programme over the following 12 months. These 
targets address a range of impacts arising from our development and 
property management activities, including resource use and waste 
production, pollution, biodiversity, timber sourcing, tenant engagement, flood 
risk and sustainable design and construction. A full list of these targets can 
be found on the helical Bar website. The performance against the key 
targets is summarised below.
•  At our London head office, we aimed to maintain our current performance 
given the significant improvement achieved in previous years. Usage of 
gas and electricity showed a decrease of 20% and 2% respectively.
•  At our managed multi-let offices, we continue to improve energy and 
water efficiency through the implementation of low and no cost measures. 
The specific target for 2013 was to achieve a 5% improvement against 
the 2012 baseline. A review of the data in the table below shows that 
performance is variable across the portfolio complicated by the changing 
nature of the portfolio with three new properties purchased and Battersea 
Studios sold in February 2014. Of those that can be compared, the hub 
has shown an improved performance of an 11% decrease in electricity 
consumption and a 7% decrease in both gas and water consumption. 
Whereas the Shepherds Building has slightly increased its electricity 
consumption but decreased water consumption. The variation reflects 
increasing occupancy and ongoing changes to the portfolio structure. 
•  At our managed shopping centres, comparative figures where available 
indicate a similar story that the performance is allied to overall occupancy 
and programmed refurbishment. An example is the significant reduction in 
electricity consumption at Corby Town Centre which is attributed to the 
demolition of service and walkway areas along with associated lighting. 
Nevertheless, engagement exercises have also reaped dividends this year. 
The appointment of an environmental champion within the security team 
at Clyde Shopping Centre has achieved a 6% reduction in electricity 
consumption through implementing a lighting switch off campaign. Clyde 
Shopping Centre also achieved two Green Apple Awards in 2013, UK 
Gold Winner and Scotland Gold Winner under the category of Retail 
Shopping Centres in recognition of environmental schemes undertaken. 
•  Water consumption is generally comparable year on year across the 
shopping centre part of the portfolio. The larger differences at the 
Guineas, Idlewells and Clyde Shopping Centres are explained by meter 
and billing anomalies that are currently being resolved.
•  We continue to offer recycling facilities at all our managed assets. Farm 
Street, the Shepherds Building, New Loom house, Corby Town Centre, 
The Guineas and Clyde Shopping Centre are diverting nearly100% waste 
from landfill. At some of our other managed assets we comfortably 
exceeded our ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35%. In 
addition, Shepherds Building achieved a Silver Award from First Mile 
recycling for the amount recycled in 2013. 
•  One ongoing target is to proactively engage with our tenants to encourage 
improvements in efficient use of the buildings. Individual property 
managers have engaged with tenants to try and see if there are ways in 
which efficiency initiatives can be introduced and to particularly encourage 
increased recycling within the portfolio.

•  There was increased activity throughout the year under review with regard 
to construction projects. There were a number of refurbishments 
throughout the portfolio which provided completed checklists confirming 
compliance with helical’s objectives. Three retirement village 
developments at Durrants Village, Faygate, Maudslay Park, Great Alne and 
Millbrook Village, Exeter were ongoing and demonstrated achievement of 
key corporate objectives including maximising waste recycling and 
addressing ecological considerations. In addition, the site manager at 
Durrants Village achieved the accolade of a Silver Award from the 
Considerate Constructors’ Scheme.
The Company has maintained its registration with CRC. The confirmed 
purchased allowance for 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 was 5,972 tonnes. 
The projected allowance for the year to 31 March 2014 is of a similar figure 
based on the current reported emissions for the portfolio as a whole. We 
have also reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2013 and in line with 
the mandatory requirement for reporting our greenhouse gas emissions, 
have provided a separate disclosure in this report.
Below we present our utility consumption performance for multi-let buildings 
under management as well as our head office (where data availability 
permits). This year we have reviewed the data provision to ensure that it 
focuses on energy consumption that is the responsibility of the landlord to 
enable more robust reporting.

gREE n HOUSE gAS Emi SSiOn S REPORTing
For the reporting year 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 we have followed the 
2013 UK Government environmental reporting guidance and used 2013 UK 
Government’s Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Greenhouse gas 
emissions are reported using the following parameters to determine what is 
included within the reporting boundaries in terms of helical Bar’s energy 
consumption.
•  Scope 1 - direct emissions include any gas data for landlord controlled 
parts and fuel use for Company owned vehicles. Fugitive emissions from 
air conditioning are included where it is helical Bar’s responsibility within 
the managed portfolio. 
•  Scope 2 - indirect energy emissions includes purchased electricity 
throughout the Company operations within landlord controlled parts. 
Electricity used in refurbishment projects has not been recorded 
separately. In the majority of cases the electricity consumed is recorded 
for the individual properties as part of the data collection for the 
management of common parts, but going forward to 2014 it is a 
requirement for contractors to ensure project specific data is collected. 
Greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes CO
2
e) are set out below for the year. 
1 April 2013 to 
31 March 2014
Scope 1: Direct emissions 494 
Scope 2: Indirect emissions 2,619
Total All Scopes 3,113
Intensity figure* 0.00117 per sq ft 
* Note: the intensity figure for 2013/14 has been calculated based on net floor areas.
The specific target set by helical Bar is to reduce energy consumption by 5% 
per annum in the principal managed assets. As discussed earlier in this section 
of the report, year on year performance is variable across the portfolio 
complicated by the changing nature through acquisition and divestment, 
increasing occupancy and ongoing refurbishment of the component assets. 47

COmmUniTiES
helical Bar takes a strong interest in community issues. Community 
engagement is an on-going concern throughout the development process, 
from planning until development completion and operation. The following 
examples demonstrate how community engagement has benefited the 
communities that we work with over the past year. 
•  Clyde Shopping Centre sponsored the Scottish youth Champions League 
for the second year running which is contested by Scotland’s top teams. 
League winning teams from Aberdeen, Oban, Perth, Lesmahagow, Paisley, 
Ayr and Fife took part at the tournament hosted at Parklea, Glasgow. The 
benefits of youth sport help to tackle social and health issues in Scotland. 
Clyde Shopping Centre also gave space in the malls to The Kirkintilloch 
high School y oung Enterprise Scheme for a weekend sales event. 
Competing teams set up individual RMUs to market and sell their 
developed products. The event helped to build pupils’ understanding of the 
retail environment while building confidence and leadership skills.
•  The Morgan Quarter in Cardiff ran an Apprentice-style initiative called T rading 
Places, partnering with the University of South Wales. Six local colleges worked 
with the shopping centre, to enable potential students to understand higher 
education opportunities on offer, whilst also putting their entrepreneurial skills 
into practice. The aim was to benefit the university by targeting and inviting in a 
number of 16-18 year olds who might not necessarily be looking at higher 
education. A one day event was organised, where students from the different 
colleges were mixed and put into teams to run stalls within a pop-up shop, using 
a vacant shop unit within the Morgan Quarter.
•  Idlewells Shopping Centre and major tenant Specsavers teamed up and 
sponsored a local authority community event known as the Ashfield 
Festival. The sponsorship played a major part in enabling the annual local 
event to continue to go ahead in spite of public sector cutbacks. The 
centre exhibited in a marquee at the event and invited all retailers to join 
the centre management team to promote their own goods and services. 
Tenant uptake was positive, with around 20% of retailers taking an 
exhibition space. The centre management team ran competitions to raise 
money for Teenage Cancer Trust at the same time as showcasing a brand 
new interactive mobile phone application being launched to communicate 
retailer offers and special promotions to customers.
•  Idlewells Shopping Centre also gave space on the malls to a local 
community group to place a food bank. In an area of the country hit hard by 
recession and consequential effects on unemployment levels, the demand 
for voluntary organisations to step in and offer help was growing. By having 
a food bank in the shopping centre, customers were able to place any 
excess food items directly into the food bank safe in the knowledge that 
their donations would be collected and passed on to those in need.
•  The centre manager at The Guineas Shopping Centre in Newmarket is 
actively involved with the Newmarket Retailers Association planning, 
events and parking sub-committees. The events committee recently 
entered a float at the Severalls Newmarket Carnival Day which was a well 
attended event by all in the local community and an opportunity to 
promote retailers at the shopping centre. In addition, the planning 
committee has been instrumental in securing £100,000 from Tesco and 
£100,000 from Morrisons, Section 106 money which will be delivered as 
and when building takes place on both supermarket developments. 
During the year to 31 March 2014 helical has donated £17 ,400 to charity, 
including LandAid, Walking With The Wounded, The haven (Breast Cancer 
Charity) and Schools Around The World. 
HEAl TH & SAFETY
helical Bar’s health & Safety policy aims to develop a corporate culture that 
is committed to the prevention of injuries and ill health to its employees or 
others that may be affected by its activities. The Board of Directors and 
senior staff are responsible for implementing this policy and they ensure that 
health and safety considerations are always given priority in planning and in 
day-to-day activities. The Company’s health & Safety policy was reviewed 
and updated in February 2014 to reflect the latest legislative and regulatory 
developments. There have been no reportable RIDDOR incidents within the 
portfolio during the year ended 31 March 2014. The Company’s health & 
Safety policy can be found on the Company website. 
SUPPliERS
Fair treatment of suppliers remains a key priority for helical Bar, particularly 
in challenging market conditions where smaller suppliers in particular may 
rely on our payments for balanced cash flow. The Company’s policy is to 
settle all agreed liabilities within the terms established with suppliers. 
The Strategic Report, contained on pages 20 to 47 , was approved by the

INTRODUCTION FINaNCIal s Ta TemeNT s sTR a Teg IC Rep ORT INves TOR INFORma TION g OveRNaNCe GOVERNANCE
At helical we believe that robust corporate governance is of fundamental 
importance in delivering for shareholders the long-term success of the 
Company through the effective, entrepreneurial and prudent management of 
the Company. The Board of helical is collectively responsible for providing 
the leadership of the Company within a framework of controls and reporting 
structures which assist in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. 
The uk Corporate governance Code (the “Code”)
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance. We believe in applying the highest principles of corporate 
governance and have complied throughout the year with the principles as set 
out in the section of the Code headed “The Main Principles of the Code”. 
Except as stated below in relation to the appointment of Nigel McNair Scott 
as Chairman, we have complied with the provisions of the Code. The Group 
also takes into account the corporate governance guidelines of institutional 
shareholders and their representative bodies.
l EADERSHiP
Chairman
Nigel McNair Scott, who was formerly the Group’s Finance Director, was 
appointed as Chairman of the Company in 2012. The Code requires that a 
new chairman should satisfy, on appointment, the independence criteria set 
out in provision B.1.1 and Nigel McNair Scott did not satisfy this Code 
provision on appointment. 
roles of Chairman and Chief executive
The Chairman and the Chief Executive are responsible for the leadership of 
the Company. The Chairman’s primary responsibility is for leading the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness, whilst the Chief Executive is responsible for 
running the Company’s business. The division of responsibilities is clearly 
established at helical and is set out in writing and is approved by the Board. 
Board responsibilities
The main purpose of the Board is to create and deliver the long term 
success of the Group and returns for its shareholders. The Board is 
collectively responsible for providing the entrepreneurial leadership of the 
Group within a framework of controls and reporting structures which assist 
the Group in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. The Board 
sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives and also 
reviews management performance. The Board sets the Group’s values and 
standards and ensures that the Group’s obligations to its shareholders and 
others are understood and met.
All directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the Group. As part 
of their roles as members of the Board, non-executive directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and the risk 
appetite of the Group. Non-executive directors scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the 
reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves on the integrity of 
financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk 
management are robust and defensible. They are responsible for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration of executive directors and have a prime 
role in appointing and, where necessary, removing executive directors. In 
conjunction with the Nominations Committee, the Board considers 
succession planning of Board members and senior management. In addition 
to Boardroom discussions, the Chairman maintains contact with other 
non-executive directors by telephone and, if appropriate and at least annually, 
will hold meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive 
directors present. Richard Gillingwater (Senior Independent Director) holds 
meetings of the independent non-executive directors separately from the 
rest of the Board at least once a year to ensure that any issues may be 
discussed without the presence of a non-independent director.
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. 
The Board controls the business but delegates day-to-day responsibility to 
the executive management. An Executive Committee, comprising all the 
executive directors, meets regularly to discuss the development of strategy, 
to review and implement proposed transactions, to review policies and 
procedures (including health and safety), to monitor budget and financial 
performance and to assess risk. The full Board reviews all minutes of 
proceedings at Executive Committee meetings and receives reports from the 
Executive Committee Chairman (Michael Slade) at every Board meeting. 
however, there are a number of matters which are required to be or, in the 
interests of the Group, should only be, decided by the Board as a whole. A 
summary of the schedule of matters reserved for the Board is set out below:
•  Strategy and management - responsibility for the overall management of 
the Group; approval of the Group’s long-term strategic aims and 
objectives; approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets; 
oversight of the Group’s operations and review of performance; extension 
of the Group’s activities into new business areas; approval of major capital 
projects and projects outside the normal course of business; any decision 
to cease to operate all or any material part of the Group’s business.
•  Structure and capital - changes to the Group’s capital structure; major 
changes to the Group’s corporate structure; changes to the Group’s 
management and control structure; changes to the Group’s listing or plc 
status.
•  Financial reporting and controls - approval of half yearly report, approval of 
interim and final results announcements; approval of annual report and 
accounts, including the directors’ report, corporate governance statement 
and the directors’ remuneration report; approval of dividend policy; 
approval of significant changes in accounting policies or practices; 
approval of treasury policies; approval of material unbudgeted capital or 
operating expenditures.
•  Internal controls - ensuring maintenance of a sound system of control and 
risk management.
•  Contracts - approval of major capital projects; approval of contracts above 
limits of authority delegated by the Board.
•  Communication - approval of resolutions and corresponding 
documentation to be put to shareholders in general meeting; approval of 
all circulars and listing particulars.
•  Board membership and other appointments to senior management; 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary; membership of 
Board committees following recommendations from the Nominations 
Committee.
•  Corporate governance matters including directors’ performance 
evaluations and review of the Company’s corporate governance 
arrangements.
•  Remuneration - determine the remuneration policy for the Chairman, 
executive directors, Company Secretary and other senior executives 
following recommendation from the Remuneration Committee; determine 
the remuneration of the non-executive directors subject to the Articles of 
Association and shareholder approval as appropriate.
•  Approval of policies including anti-bribery policy; whistleblowing 
procedures; equal opportunities policy; diversity policy; share dealing code; 
health and safety policy; environmental and corporate social responsibility 
policy; charitable donations policy.

EFFECTiVEn ESS
Composition of the Board
The Code requires a Board to have an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable it to 
discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. helical operates with a 
strong management team of senior decision makers backed up by a finance 
team and other support staff. The Group is keen to promote exceptional 
talent to Board level at the earliest opportunity to expose such individuals to 
the broader issues facing the business, encourage their long term commitment 
to the Group and to provide for future succession. It is for these reasons that 
helical’s Board includes six executive directors, which is more than those of 
other comparable listed real estate companies.
Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes that companies such as helical, which are 
below the FTSE350, are required to have at least two independent 
non-executive directors. The Board has determined that in helical’s case a 
total of four independent non-executive directors is appropriate to balance 
the current executive team, to provide the experience and advice that the 
executive team seeks and to ensure the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders are adequately protected. The independent non-executive 
directors are Richard Gillingwater, Richard Grant, Andrew Gulliford and 
Michael O’Donnell. 
In the Board’s view, the composition of the Board has an appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company as 
required by the Code.
annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees
The annual evaluation process, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
involves each director submitting an appraisal in respect of the performance 
of the main Board, its committees and directors, including the Chairman. 
Since the Company is outside the FTSE350 it does not currently make use 
of an external evaluation process as permitted by the Code.
During the year the Board undertook a formal evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees and the Senior Independent Director 
reported the results of that evaluation process to the Board. The process 
covered criteria including real estate matters, Board composition and Board 
and Committee processes. Individual evaluations of directors were conducted 
by the Chief Executive and Chairman. There were no significant areas of 
concern raised by the Directors and any points raised have been dealt with 
appropriately.
directors - information and professional development
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a form and of a 
quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and its directors are 
free to seek any further information they consider necessary. The directors 
have access to the services of a professionally qualified and experienced 
Company Secretary who is responsible for advising the Board on all 
governance matters and ensuring compliance with Board procedures and 
applicable laws and regulations. Under the direction of the Chairman, the 
Company Secretary’s responsibilities include ensuring good information 
flows within the Board and its Committees and between senior management 
and non-executive directors, as well as facilitating induction of new directors 
and assisting with professional development as required. The Board ensures 
that directors have access to independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as 
directors. Training is available for all directors as necessary.

audit Committee
The Audit Committee Chairman is Richard Grant, who is the Finance Director 
of Cadogan Estates Limited and a former partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
As a result, the Board considers that he has recent and relevant financial 
experience. The report of the Chairman of the Audit Committee describing 
the issues considered by the Committee in the year under review is on page

risk management and internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. Such a 
system is designed to manage, but cannot eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. There are inherent limitations in any control 
system and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
•  Clearly defined organisational responsibilities and limits of authority. The 
day-to-day involvement of the executive directors in the running of the 
business ensures that these responsibilities and limits are adhered to.
• Financial controls and review procedures.
•  Financial information systems including cash flow, profit and capital 
expenditure forecasts. The Board receives regular and comprehensive 
reports on the day-to-day running of the business.
•  An Audit Committee which meets with the auditors and deals with any 
significant internal control matters. In the year under review the Audit 
Committee met with the Auditors on two occasions.
•  The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s risk profile 
which is reviewed by the Audit Committee during the year. An analysis of 
the Group’s principal risks can be found on pages 42 to 44.
internal audit
The Board reviewed its position during the year to 31 March 2014 and 
reaffirmed its stance that in view of the relatively small size of the Group it 
does not consider that an internal audit function would provide any 
significant additional assistance in maintaining a system of internal controls.
going concern
The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of 
the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading 
performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
• Timing and value of property sales.
• Availability of loan finance and related cash flows.
•  Future property valuations and their impact on covenants and potential 
loan repayments.
• Committed future expenditure.
• Future rental income and bad debts.
• Payment timings and the value of trade receivables.
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to reflect those cash inflows 
which are less certain and to take account of a further deterioration of 
property valuations. From their review, the directors believe that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going concern for 
the foreseeable future.
REmUnERATiOn
This information is contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 55 to 67 .
RElATiOn S WiTH SHAREHOl DERS
notice of a nnual general Meeting
The Code recommends that the Notice of AGM and related papers be sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. For the 2013 
AGM the Notice and related papers were sent out 21 working days before 
the AGM. 
relations with shareholders
The directors value the views of the Company’s shareholders and recognise 
their interest in the Group’s strategy and performance, Board membership 
and quality of management. They hold regular meetings with, and give 
presentations to, the Company’s institutional shareholders to discuss the 
Group’s results and objectives. The directors regularly meet, with the help of 
the Company’s brokers, institutions that do not currently hold shares in the 
Group to inform them of the Company’s objectives. Michael Slade, as Chief 
Executive, attends most of these meetings and is usually accompanied by 
one of the other executive directors. 
During the year under review, Andrew Gulliford, as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, engaged with principal shareholders (holding 
more than 3% of the Company’s shares) and shareholder representative 
bodies, to seek their approval for the renewal of the Company’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan, to be proposed to shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
The Senior Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater, was available to meet 
with shareholders throughout the year under review and will hold meetings 
with shareholders whenever requested in order to ensure sufficient 
understanding of any issues and concerns they may have. 
The AGM is used to communicate with investors and they are encouraged to 
participate. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and members of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees will attend the AGM and 
will be available to answer questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on 
each issue in order that they can be given proper consideration and there is 
a separate resolution to consider the annual report and accounts. All proxy 
votes are counted and the level of proxies lodged on each resolution will be 
indicated after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The directors receive regular reports from sector analysts and investor 
relations advisors on how the Group is viewed by its shareholders. The Group 
communicates with all shareholders through the issue of regular press 
releases and through its website at www.helical.co.uk.

In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the role of the 
Nominations Committee, and my primary responsibility as its Chairman, is to 
ensure that the Company is headed by an effective Board which is 
collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company. This is 
best achieved through the provision of entrepreneurial leadership and a 
talented executive team, supported by committees with an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company 
to be able to constructively challenge and assist the executive team in 
achieving its objectives. Alongside me, the Committee comprises Richard 
Gillingwater, Richard Grant, Andrew Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell. 
BOARD APPOinTm EnTS
Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made against objective 
criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have enough time available 
to devote to the job. The Nominations Committee controls the process for 
Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. The Board 
is mindful of the Group’s diversity policy and the Committee will give full 
consideration to diversity, including gender diversity, when recommending to 
the Board any future Board appointments. All Board appointments will be 
based on experience and will be made on merit.
THE WORK OF THE nOminATiOn S COmmiTTEE in THE 
YEAR
The Committee met once during the year and all members attended this 
meeting. A record of attendance at all Board and Committee meetings is 
shown on page 52. 
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board.
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee, which were reviewed 
and updated during the year, are available on request and are included on 
the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
DiRECTORS’ RE-El ECTiOn
The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7 .1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled. This provision requires all 
directors of FTSE350 companies to be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. Whilst the Company is not in the FTSE350, the Board has 
chosen to comply with this provision as it accepts that shareholders should 
annually have the right to vote on each director’s re-election to the Board. 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2014, the following 
resolutions relating to the appointment of directors are being proposed: 
• The re-election of Nigel McNair Scott as non-executive Chairman;
•  The re-election, as executive directors, of Michael Slade, Tim Murphy, 
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook, Jack Pitman and Duncan Walker; 
and,
•  The re-election, as independent non-executive directors, of Richard 
Gillingwater, Richard Grant Andrew Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell.
The Nominations Committee confirms to shareholders that, following the 
annual formal performance evaluation and taking into account their 
qualifications and experience, these directors continue to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to their roles. Biographical details of the directors 
are given on page 50.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of 
these resolutions.

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s Report on directors’ 
remuneration for the year to 31 March 2014. This report has been approved 
by the Board of helical Bar plc. 
The main duty of the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) is to determine 
and agree with the Board, the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors and, subject to 
proposals being submitted by the Chief Executive, recommend and monitor 
the level and structure of remuneration for such other members of the 
executive management who report directly to the Chief Executive. The 
remuneration of non-executive directors shall be a matter for the Chairman 
and Executive members of the Board. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
the Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and Narrative Reporting 
Regulations issued by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 
2013. In particular, the report has been divided into the following two 
sections:
•  Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of executive and non-executive directors; and
•  Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the remuneration 
policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2014 and how 
the policy will be operated in the year ending 31 March 2015. 
A binding vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report and an advisory 
vote on this Annual Statement and the Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be tabled at the forthcoming 2014 AGM. 
REmUn ERA TiOn i SSUES DEAl T WiTH DURing THE YEAR
The Committee considered a number of matters during the financial year 
under review and the following decisions were taken:
•  Basic salaries of executive directors were reviewed in July 2013 and 
inflationary increases of 3% were awarded with effect from 1 July 2013 
to Michael Slade, Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman; 
•  The basic salaries of Tim Murphy and Duncan Walker were increased by 
10% from 1 July 2013 to move their salaries towards market norms;
•  The basic salary of Matthew Bonning-Snook was increased by a further 
18% from 1 January 2014 and the basic salary of Duncan Walker is to be 
increased by 16% from 1 July 2014, both increases reflecting each 
individual’s significantly increased contribution to the business and to bring 
their remuneration more in alignment with their fellow directors;
•  The Committee reviewed the awards made in accordance with the terms 
of the Performance Share Plan 2004 (“2004 PSP”) in 2010 and 
considered the performance of the Company during the three year 
performance period to 31 March 2013. The performance conditions 
required for vesting of the shares were not met and no shares vested; 
•  The Committee resolved in June 2013 to make a further award of shares 
under the terms of the 2004 PSP; 
•  The Committee recommended that the Company’s Employee Share 
Ownership Plan Trust (“ESOP”) acquire a further 250,000 shares in the 
Company to enable it to satisfy the anticipated vesting of share awards in 
2014/15; and
•  As a result of the 2004 PSP nearing the end of its ten year life, the 
Committee resolved that formal shareholder approval should be sought for 
a replacement scheme (the “Performance Share Plan 2014” or “2014 
PSP”) at the 2014 AGM. The proposed replacement scheme introduces a 
third performance criteria of relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and 
provides for additional shareholder protections, including a two year post 
vesting holding period, clawback and increased minimum shareholding 
requirements for executive directors of 300% of basic salary in line with 
best practice.
The implementation of these decisions is detailed in this report, together with 
additional information on the fixed and variable remuneration paid and 
payable to the directors of the Group. 
PERFORmAnCE An D REWARD DURing 2013
As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 20 to 47 , the Group has delivered 
an increase in EPRA net assets per share of 18.6% and a total portfolio 
return, as reported by IPD, of 23.8%. Pre-tax profits of the Group, before 
performance related awards, increased to £120m (2013: £12m).
Subsequent to the year end, and in accordance with the rules of the helical 
Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and the Executive Bonus Plan 2011, cash 
bonuses have been approved for inclusion in the financial statements for the 
year to 31 March 2014. Details of the bonuses payable are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration below.
Awards made under the 2004 PSP in 2011 were subject to two 
performance conditions over the three years to 31 March 2014. Two thirds 
of the awards were based on absolute net asset value performance with a 
vesting threshold of 7 .5% p.a. (24% over three years) growth and maximum 
vesting at 15.0% p.a. (52% over three years) growth. The remaining third of 
the awards were based on a comparison of the Group’s portfolio return to 
the IPD Total Return index with a vesting threshold of the median of the 
index and full vesting at the upper quartile of the index. The performance 
criteria were measured at the end of the three year period and 62% of the 
awards are expected to vest.
The Committee believes that the provision for annual cash and deferred 
shares bonuses and the expected 2004 PSP vesting in respect of the 
performance periods ending 31 March 2014 accurately and fairly represents 
the performance of the Group over the respective performance periods.
REmUn ERATiOn POliCY FOR 2014
The Remuneration Committee of helical Bar plc is committed to ensuring 
that its remuneration policy remains aligned to the interests of shareholders, 
incentivising management to increase total returns and growing net asset 
value per share whilst ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained 
between the targets set for management and the risk profile of the Group. 
The Committee believes that it has struck the right balance between fixed 
annual remuneration and an incentive structure with challenging targets 
which seeks to reward outperformance with a mixture of cash-based annual 
bonus payments and longer term share awards. 
Reviewing the current remuneration the Committee has determined that the 
basic salaries of the executive directors, excluding those salaries of Matthew 
Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker, should be increased from 1 July 2014 
by an amount reflecting current inflation levels and has determined that this 
should be 2% (2013: 3%), which is below the average 6% awarded to all 
other employees of the Group. As stated above, Duncan Walker’s base salary 
will be increased by 16% to move him towards market norms as his 
contribution increases.
The two annual bonus schemes were approved by shareholders in 2011 and 
2012 and will not be reviewed during the forthcoming year. however, as a result 
of the 2004 PSP reaching the end of its ten year life, major shareholders and 
representative bodies have been consulted on a replacement scheme, the 
helical Bar Performance Share Plan 2014, with increased shareholder 
protections. A resolution seeking approval of this replacement scheme will be 
put to shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The first grant under this plan will be 
made, subject to shareholder approval, following the 2014 AGM.
Ann UAl gE n ERAl mEETing 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2014 the following 
resolutions relating to remuneration are being proposed:
• The approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report;
•  The approval of the Annual Statement and Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2014; and
•  The approval of the replacement long term incentive plan, the 2014 
Performance Share Plan.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

The Report of the Remuneration Committee has been prepared in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Act”). It has 
been approved by the Board and will be submitted to shareholders for 
approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2014. If 
approved, the Remuneration Policy Report will have an effective date from 
that point and for a period of three years. The Company’s remuneration 
policy follows the principles and guidelines of the Listing Rules and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2012 as they relate to directors’ remuneration.
REmUn ERATiOn POliCY REPORT
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of 
the Group from 1 April 2014 which will, subject to shareholder approval, 
become formally effective at the 2014 AGM. There have been no changes to 
this policy since 1 April 2013 and the Committee believes that the policy 
continues to support the Group’s strategy and is aligned with shareholders’ 
interests. 
REmUn ERATiOn POliCY
helical’s approach to the remuneration of its executive directors is to provide 
a basic remuneration package below the median level of its peers within the 
listed real estate sector combined with an incentive based bonus and share 
scheme structure aligned with the interests of its shareholders. 
Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored and reviewed 
regularly to ensure that the Group’s positioning of its remuneration remains 
in line with these objectives. In addition to this external view, the Committee 
also monitors the remuneration levels of senior management below Board 
level and the remuneration of other employees to ensure that these are 
taken into account in determining the remuneration of executive directors 
and considers environmental, social, governance and risk issues.
In determining such policy, the Committee shall take into account all factors 
which it deems necessary. The objective of the remuneration policy shall be 
to ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair 
and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Group. Within the terms of the agreed policy, the Committee 
shall determine, for the executive directors:
•  the total individual remuneration packages of each executive director 
including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, share awards, 
and other benefits;
• targets for any performance related remuneration schemes; and
•  service agreements incorporating termination payments and 
compensation commitments.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on 
request and are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
OPERATiOn OF PERFOR mAnCE RElATED 
REmUnERATiOn
The Committee operates the two annual bonus schemes and the 2004 PSP 
(to be replaced by the 2014 PSP) in accordance with their respective rules, 
as approved by shareholders, and the Listing Rules. In seeking shareholder 
approval to the performance related remuneration schemes the Committee 
has incorporated a number of shareholder protections and will apply these 
in the operation of the schemes. In particular, the Committee has:
•  Applied a profit sharing and net asset value model to ensure cash 
bonuses vest only on performance and with maximum limits;
•  Included clawback provisions in the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and 
the proposed 2014 PSP;
•  Retained absolute discretion with regard to the payment of cash bonuses 
or the vesting of shares in the determination of good/bad leavers, or 
change of control or if payment of bonuses is not deemed to be in the 
interests of shareholders; and
• Included enhanced share retention guidelines.

RECRUiTmEnT POliCY
In considering the structure of the Board, the balance between executive directors and independent non-executive directors and the skills, knowledge and 
experience required to ensure the Board functions in accordance with the Group’s objectives, the Committee will seek to apply the following principles in 
relation to the remuneration of new directors, whether by internal promotion or external appointment:
Element Policy
Salary The salary of newly appointed executive directors would reflect the individual’s experience and skills, and be targeted at between 
lower quartile and median of appropriate sector comparables, taking into account internal comparisons. On initial appointment, 
salaries would generally be set at a level lower than benchmarked for that role to allow for pay increases to market levels subject to 
satisfactory progress and contribution.
Benefits Benefits would be as are currently provided and periodically reviewed, being car or car allowance, private medical cover, permanent 
health insurance and life assurance.
Pension There is no Company pension scheme for directors and no contributions are payable to directors’ own pension schemes.
Annual bonus Annual bonus arrangements would be set in line with existing arrangements as approved by shareholders, with the Committee 
retaining the right to pro-rata any bonus payable in respect of the first year of employment.
Long term incentives Annual awards under the terms of the 2014 PSP (subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM) will be made in accordance 
with the terms of that Plan.
Share Incentive Plan In line with that of existing executive directors.
Buy-out awards Should it be deemed necessary to compensate a new director for loss of bonus or incentives from a previous employer, the 
Committee may structure the remuneration of such director to buy-out any such bonus or incentives on a like-for-like basis in respect 
of currency (i.e. cash versus shares), timing and performance targets. Where possible such buy-out will be structured within the 
Company’s existing incentive arrangements but the Committee has the discretion to implement the exemption under rule 9.4.2 of the 
Listing Rules.
Non-executive 
directors
Newly appointed non-executive directors will be paid fees at a level consistent with existing non-executive directors. Fees would be 
paid pro-rata in the year of appointment.
HOW EmPl OYEE PAY iS TAKEn inTO ACCOU nT An D 
HOW iT COmPARES TO THE REmUn ERATiOn POliCY 
OF Ex ECUTiVE DiRECTORS
All full-time employees of the Company, including executive directors, receive 
a basic remuneration package including base salary, private medical cover, 
permanent health insurance, life assurance and membership of the Share 
Incentive Plan. In addition, directors and senior management are entitled to 
the use of company cars or the payment of a car allowance. Whilst 
employees below Board level are not entitled to participate in the Executive 
Bonus Plan 2011 or Annual Bonus Scheme 2012, discretionary bonuses 
are paid to employees on an individual basis depending on their performance 
and contribution. The Performance Share Plan is available to all employees 
but is primarily utilised to incentivise executive directors and senior 
management. An Inland Revenue approved Company Share Option Plan is 
available for the Committee to grant options to those who do not receive 
awards under the Performance Share Plan. In determining executive 
remuneration, the Committee considers the overall remuneration of all the 
Company’s employees and, other than in exceptional circumstances, seeks 
to award increases in salaries at levels below those made to other staff and 
within its own guidelines. The remaining remuneration is weighted towards 
performance related awards. The Committee does not consult with its 
employees when drawing up the Company’s remuneration policy.
PERFORmAnCE mETRiCS
The performance metrics used in the two annual bonus schemes and the 
long term incentive plan are aligned with the Company’s Key Performance 
Indicators, discussed on pages 22 to 23.
The Executive Bonus Plan 2011 compares the net asset value per share 
performance of the Company to an index of property performance as 
measured by the Investment Property Databank (“IPD”). The intention is to 
compare the Company’s overall financial performance to that of the real 
estate sector’s primary index. The scheme is open to the Chief Executive and 
the Finance Director.
The Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 is a profit sharing model which takes the 
results of the Company, including valuation movements on its property 
portfolio, and, after charging all finance costs, non-performance related 
administration costs and a charge for the use of the Company’s equity, 
allocates the net results into a profit pool for payment to participants with 
maximum limits, deferral clawback and other shareholder protections. The 
scheme is open to executive directors, other than the Chief Executive and 
the Finance Director.
Long term incentives, awarded in accordance with the rules of the 2004 
PSP (to be replaced, subject to shareholder approval, with the 2014 PSP), 
are subject to an absolute net asset value growth test and a relative 
performance metric based on the performance of the Company’s property 
portfolio compared to an IPD index. In the 2014 PSP, these two criteria are 
to be joined by a third metric, based on relative Total Shareholder Return.
SERViCE COnTRACTS 
The service contract of Michael Slade operates from 1 August 2007 , those of 
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Jack Pitman from 1 March 2010, 
that of Duncan Walker from 24 June 2011 and of Tim Murphy from 24 July 
2012. No service contract provides for more than a one year notice period. All 
service contracts can be inspected at the registered offices of the Company.
lEAVER P OliCY
On termination of employment each director may be entitled to a payment in 
lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual entitlements i.e. provision 
of a car, health and life insurance. The Group may make payments in lieu of 
notice as one lump sum or in instalments, at its own discretion. If the Group 
chooses to pay in instalments the director is obliged to seek alternative 
income over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to the Group. 
Instalment payments will be reduced by any alternative income.
Awards under the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 may be payable with respect 
to the period of the financial year served although amounts will be paid at 
the normal payout date and, normally, pro-rated for the period of the financial 
year worked.  59

dirEctorS ’ rEmun Eration rEport continued
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the 
Company’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. 
Under the helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012, participants shall not 
normally be entitled to receive any distribution under the scheme following 
cessation and shall immediately cease to have any interests, benefits, rights 
and/or entitlements under the scheme howsoever arising on the date of 
such cessation except where good leaver status applies (i.e. death; injury, 
disability; redundancy; retirement; sale or transfer of employing company or 
business outside of the Group or any other reason permitted by the 
Committee). For good leavers, individuals would cease to accrue future 
amounts into future Bonus Award Pools although would continue to receive 
deferred share awards and any remaining amounts held in the Bonus Award 
Pools for a period of three years from cessation.
For awards granted under the 2004 PSP, awards will normally lapse at 
cessation except where the good leaver status applies (e.g. death, 
redundancy, retirement due to injury, disability or retirement otherwise with 
the Committee’s agreement). For good leavers, awards will vest at cessation 
having regard to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and 
the time elapsed since the date of the award (rounded up to the nearest 
whole year).
For awards granted under the 2014 PSP, awards held by good leavers will 
vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance conditions and time 
pro-rating, unless the Committee determines that awards should vest at 
cessation and/or time pro-rating should not apply.
nOn-E x ECUTiVE DiRECTORS 
Non-executive directors are appointed by a Letter of Appointment and their 
remuneration is determined by the Board. The appointment of non-executive 
directors is terminable on three months’ notice. Non-executive directors are 
not eligible to participate in any new awards made under the terms of the 
Group’s bonus or share award schemes. In exceptional circumstances, where 
an executive director becomes a non-executive director e.g. Nigel McNair 
Scott became Chairman in 2012, ongoing participation in awards previously 
made in bonus and share schemes will be subject to the rules of those 
schemes and will be subject to the discretion of the Committee.
SHARE OWnERSHiP gUiDElinES
Senior executives will not normally be permitted to sell shares received 
through the 2004 PSP/2014 PSP, other than to meet taxation (and national 
insurance contributions) liabilities, for at least two years and until they own 
shares to the value of 200% of basic salary for executive directors and 
100% of salary for other executives. This is to be increased for executive 
directors to 300% on the first vesting of share awards in respect of the 
2014 PSP. To date, all shares received by the executive directors under the 
terms of the group’s 2004 PSP and Share Incentive Plan have been 
retained, net of taxes paid, thereby increasing the management’s 
shareholding in helical.
Alignm EnT W iTH SHAREHOl DER inTERESTS
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be 
made by executives (directors and those below Board level) through the 
2004 PSP/2014 PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place. It 
has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group 
(measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as 
dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all executives through the 
Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at the point at which 
the maximum awards vest over the term of the plans might be of the order of 
20%. At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple 
net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Group’s relative 
performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over each three year period. 
REWARD SCEnAR iOS
The charts below show how the composition of the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages varies at three performance levels, namely, at 
minimum (i.e. fixed pay), target (assumed to be 50% of the maximum 
incentive levels) and maximum levels, under the policy set out in the table 
overleaf.
Value of remuneration packages at different levels of performance
The charts are based on:
•  salary levels effective 1 April 2014.
•  an approximated annual value of benefits (no pension is provided).
•  a £1.5m maximum annual bonus for the Chief Executive, a £500,000 
maximum annual bonus for the Finance Director and a 300% of salary 
maximum annual bonus for the other executive directors (based on Gerald 
Kaye’s package for simplicity) (with target assumed to be 50% of the 
maximum).
•  a 300% of salary award under the 2014 PSP in line with the normal 
maximum award (with target assumed to be 50% of the maximum). No share 
price appreciation in respect of the 2014 PSP awards has been assumed. 
REmUnERATiOn CO mmiTTEE
The Committee comprises Andrew Gulliford, as Chairman, Richard 
Gillingwater, Richard Grant and Michael O’Donnell, all of whom have served 
throughout the year. Each member of the Committee is an independent 
non-executive director.
ADViSORS TO THE COmmiTTEE
The Committee consults the Chief Executive and Finance Director about its 
proposals and has access to professional advice from independent remuneration 
consultants, New Bridge Street, to help it determine appropriate remuneration 
arrangements. T erms of reference for New Bridge Street, which provided no 
other services to the Company, are available from the Company Secretary on 
request. Their fees for the year to 31 March 2014 amounted to £46,167 .

The basic package of salary and benefits is designed to match the experience and responsibilities of each director and is reviewed annually to ensure that it is 
consistent and appropriate to their responsibilities and expectations. The Group does not provide any separate pension provision for executive directors and 
expects individuals to provide for their retirement through their basic salaries and incentive payments. Executive directors’ current basic annual salaries,

In 2012, the Committee resolved that the basic salaries of executive 
directors should be reviewed annually and increased to reflect an appropriate 
level of salary inflation or greater to reflect increases in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of their roles or to allow recently appointed executives to move 
to market norms as their experience and contribution increase.
On 1 July 2013, increases in basic salaries of 10% were awarded to Tim 
Murphy and Duncan Walker to move their salaries towards market norms.  
On 1 January 2014, Matthew Bonning-Snook’s salary was increased by 18% 
and from 1 July 2014 Duncan Walker’s salary will be increased by 16%. These 
increases reflect their significantly increased contribution to the business and to 
bring their remuneration more in alignment with their fellow directors. Neither 
Matthew Bonning-Snook nor Duncan Walker will receive inflationary increases  
in July 2014. The Committee has determined that the remaining executive 
directors, Michael Slade, Tim Murphy, Gerald Kaye and Jack Pitman, will receive 
inflationary increases of 2% from 1 July 2014. Benefits-in-kind provided to 
executive directors comprise the provision of a company car or car allowance, 
private medical cover, permanent health insurance and life insurance.
Ex ECUTiVE BOn US PlAn 2011
Michael Slade and Tim Murphy will continue to be eligible to participate in the 
Executive Bonus Plan 2011 (the “2011 Plan”) for the year ending 31 March 
2015 following shareholder approval in 2011 to operate it for a further five 
years. Therefore, the Committee may, at its discretion, award bonuses in 
respect of the year ending 31 March 2015 subject to performance conditions 
based on absolute net asset value, un-geared total property return and relative 
net asset value per share versus the IPD, the aim of which is to link the size of 
bonuses paid to the financial growth of the Group over that financial year. 
The total amount payable under the 2011 Plan in any one year will continue 
to be limited to £2m. An individual employee’s participation in the 2011 Plan 
is limited so that the bonus which may be paid to him under the 2011 Plan 
will not exceed £1.5m per annum. There is a further limit that payments 
under the 2011 Plan in any year may not exceed 20% of the Group’s pre-tax 
profits plus any payments under the 2011 Plan. Among other constraints the 
Committee could restrict the bonuses if payment would affect the financial 
or trading position of the Group.
Following feedback received during the investor consultation in respect of 
the codification of the bonus arrangement set out below, the Committee 
agreed that future participants in this scheme who do not have a minimum 
shareholding in the Company of 200% of basic salary should receive up to 
one third of any bonus in deferred shares for three years.
The main features of the 2011 Plan and details of how it operated for the 
year ended 31 March 2014, which will be consistent with how it will operate 
for the year ending 31 March 2015, are set out on page 63.
HEliCAl BAR Ann UAl BOn US SCHEmE 2012
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook, Jack Pitman and Duncan Walker will 
continue to participate in the helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 which 
was approved by Shareholders at the 2012 AGM. Neither the Chief 
Executive nor the Finance Director participate in the Scheme given their 
participation in the 2011 Plan. This scheme provides annual cash bonuses 
based on the performance of the Group’s property portfolio and is aligned 
with shareholders through a profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles 
and shareholder protections (including deferral and clawback). 
The distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants will continue to be 
restricted for 2014/15 to the lower of 70% of the balance of the Bonus 
Award Pool and 300% of salary. Any excess will be deferred and carried 
forward to the subsequent year to form part of the Bonus Award Pool for the 
subsequent year(s).
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme and details of how it operated 
for the year ended 31 March 2014, which will be consistent with how it will 
operate for the year ending 31 March 2015, are set out on pages 63 to 64.
PERFORmAnCE SHARE PlAn
As a result of the Performance Share Plan 2004 (“2004 PSP”), the 
Company’s primary long-term incentive arrangement, reaching the end of its 
ten year life, shareholder approval for a replacement plan, the Performance 
Share Plan 2014 (“2014 PSP”), will be sought at the forthcoming AGM. 
The main features of the 2014 PSP are as follows:
•  Awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary of their 
grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions (see below) 
have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group. 
Once exercisable, awards will remain capable of exercise for a period of 
normally no more than six months.
•  No award may be granted to an individual in any financial year over shares 
worth more than three times salary.
•  There are three performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in 
the Group’s net asset value per share, one based on the gross (ungeared) 
total property return per share relative to other property funds as determined 
by IPD and one based on relative total shareholder return.
•  Performance conditions for the awards to be granted in 2014 will, subject 
to shareholder approval, be measured over the three years following grant 
as follows:
 -  For the growth in net asset value, the “fully diluted triple net” net asset 
value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes place will be 
compared to the value three years later (having added back dividends): 61

The comparator group for the awards to be granted in 2014 will be the companies included in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index, excluding 
storage companies and agencies. 
Share awards will lapse in full where:
-  net value per share (having added back dividends) does not increase over the three year performance period; or
-  the gross return falls below the IPD median, the growth in triple net asset value is below 7 .5% per annum and relative TSR is below median over the three 
year period.
Further details of this new scheme can be found in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.

Ex ECUTiVE BOn US PlAn 2011 
In 2011, shareholders approved the renewal of the Executive Bonus Plan 
(the “2011 Plan”) for a further five years. Michael Slade and Tim Murphy 
were eligible for 2011 Plan bonuses during the year. Total 2011 Plan 
bonuses for the year to 31 March 2014 of £2,000,000 (2013: £1,297 ,000) 
have been accrued in the financial statements for the year to 31 March 
2014 and are payable in June 2014.
The performance conditions which applied for the year ended 31 March 
2014 were as follows:
•  Increase in net asset value: net asset value at the end of the financial year 
exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the financial year;
•  Absolute performance of the portfolio - un-geared total return: the 
percentage increase in the total return on property assets of the Group 
over the financial year (the “Performance Period”) is greater than the 
percentage increase achieved by the portfolio ranked nearest to 
three-quarters up the performance table (taken in ascending order of 
return) (the “Upper Quartile”) of the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds 
measured by the Investment Property Databank at the beginning of the 
relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly during the 
Performance Period (the “IPD Total Return Benchmark”); and
•  Performance of the net asset value per share: the percentage increase in 
net asset value per share for the Performance Period must be greater 
than the percentage increase achieved by the Upper Quartile of the 
portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment 
Property Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period 
and compounded monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD 
Capital Growth Benchmark”).
The total amount of bonus payable in the year ended 31 March 2014 was 
determined by: 
•  Calculating the difference between the percentage increase in net asset 
value per share for the Performance Period and the percentage increase 
in the Upper Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark over the same 
period (the “Difference”); and
•  Calculating the sum of the amounts payable in relation to each 1% of the 
Difference on the following basis:
Amount of difference
% of base net asset
value payable
Less than 1% 0.01
1% to less than 2% 0.02
And thereafter for every additional 1% An increment of 0.01
For example: From 4% to less than 5% 0.05
If the net asset value at the end of a financial year is less than the net asset value 
at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable for any subsequent year will be 
calculated by reference to the highest net asset value in the preceding year.
In the year to 31 March 2014, the application of the bonus calculation to the 
results of the Group resulted in a potential total bonus payment of 
£4,486,000. This was reduced to the maximum amount payable of 
£2,000,000. Bonuses paid under the terms of this 2011 Plan in the last five 
years are as follows:

HEliCAl BAR Ann UAl BOn US SCHEmE 2012
The helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 was approved by shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM. This scheme provides annual cash bonuses based on the 
performance of the Group’s property portfolio and is aligned with 
shareholders through a profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles and 
shareholder protections (including deferral and clawback). Total 2012 Bonus 
Scheme Bonuses have been accrued in the financial statements for the year 
to 31 March 2014 and the cash element will be payable in June 2014. 
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme as applied to the year to 31 
March 2014 are as follows:
•  The scheme participants were Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook, Jack 
Pitman and Duncan Walker. Neither the Chief Executive nor the Finance 
Director participate in the Scheme given their participation in the 2011 Plan;
•  All property assets held during the year were allocated to one of two pools 
namely the “Investment Pool” or the “Development Pool” (“Profit Pools”);
•  Investment assets are included at valuation as at 31 March 2013 with 
subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing the size of the 
relevant Profit Pool. Development assets were also included at valuation as at 
31 March 2013 with subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing 
the size of the Profit Pool. Any opening surpluses or deficits in the value of the 
trading and development assets as at the introduction of the scheme on 1 April 
2012 were only included in the Profit Pools if they were realised;
•  Development profits, development management fees, net rents, other 
income and profits/losses on the sale of property assets were allocated to 
the relevant Profit Pools; and
•  Profits in the two Profit Pools were eligible for the award of bonuses once they 
were sufficient to exceed the recovery of all related finance costs, a charge for 
the use of the Company’s equity at a rate equivalent to the Company’s weighted 
average cost of debt plus a margin (reviewed regularly to reflect any changes in 
the cost of debt and the risk profile of the Company’s activities), the Group’s 
total administrative costs (excluding performance related remuneration) and any 
unallocated losses from the previous three financial years.
shareholder p rotections 
•  No more than 10% of profits are available to participants for distribution 
(“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant financial year. Pool 
allocations between participants are based on a set formula agreed at the 
start of the financial year;
•  The distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants are restricted in 
any financial year to the lower of 70% of the balance of the Bonus Award 
Pool and 300% of salary (except in years five and ten as noted below). 
Any excess is deferred and carried forward to the subsequent year to form 
part of the Bonus Award Pool for the subsequent year(s);
•  Two thirds of any payment is made in cash after the relevant financial year 
end and one third is deferred for three years into helical Bar plc shares;
•  In addition to any annual payments, at the end of the fifth and tenth years 
of operating the scheme, any Bonus Award Pool not paid out will be 
distributed to participants in the form of deferred shares for three years, 
subject to an additional individual limit of 300% of salary each time;
•  No payments will be made where the Company has not generated a profit 
(amounts will be deferred until a profit is generated). In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to increase the deferred 
share amount (up to 100% of the payment) or not to make a payment at all 
(with any amounts reverting back to the Company rather than remaining in 
the Bonus Award Pool) where it is considered appropriate to do so;
•  Net losses will be carried forward in Profit Pools for offset against future 
net profits. Carry forward of losses will be for a minimum of three years, 
subject to extension at the request of the Remuneration Committee; 64

•  The scheme will operate a clawback provision whereby amounts deferred, amounts held in Bonus Award Pools or the net of tax amounts paid may be 
recovered in the event of a misstatement of results, an error being made in assessing the calculation of Bonus Award Pools or in the event of gross 
misconduct; and
•  The share of any increase in value of the Company (measured as the increase in net asset value plus cash returned as dividends) that could accrue to all 
executives through the Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at maximum vesting/payouts during the lifetime of the plans will continue to 
be no more than 20%.

Plan after five years; 
•  Awards may be satisfied through shares purchased in the market or by new issue or treasury shares. Where new issue or treasury shares are used, the 
ABI’s 5% in ten year dilution limit will apply; and
•  On a change of control of the Company, any amounts accrued over the financial year up to the relevant date, and any amounts held within the Bonus Award 
Pools, and any deferred shares would be distributed.

The 2004 PSP numbers presented for the comparatives in the remuneration table above are based on the 2004 PSP awards granted on 13 July 2010 which 
lapsed in full as a result of performance targets not being met. The three year performance period to 31 March 2013 showed that the net asset value per 
share, calculated in accordance with the terms of the 2004 PSP, had increased by 1.6% p.a. During this three year period the total return of helical’s property 
portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 5.6% compared to the median of the IPD Benchmark which showed a return of 6.2%. Therefore, no shares could vest as 
the performance of the property portfolio was below that of the IPD median benchmark.

THE AUDiT COmmiTTEE 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Richard Grant and the other members of the 
Committee are Richard Gillingwater, Andrew Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell. 
Further details of these directors may be found on page 50. None of the 
Committee members have any personal or financial interest in the matters to be 
decided (other than as shareholders), potential conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships, or any day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC Guidance on 
Audit Committees. The Board has formal and transparent arrangements for 
considering how it applies the Group’s financial reporting and internal control 
principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors. 
Whilst all directors have a duty to act in the interests of the Group the 
Committee has a particular role, acting independently from the executive, to 
ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation to 
financial reporting and internal control. Appointments to the Committee are 
made by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee 
in consultation with the Audit Committee Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which were reviewed and 
updated during the year, are available by request and are included on the 
Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
The business model and strategy of the Group are discussed in the Strategic 
Report on pages 20 to 47 .
THE WORK OF THE AUDiT COmmiTTEE in THE YEAR
The Committee met three times during the year and a record of attendance 
at these meetings is shown on page 52. It is common practice at helical for 
Audit Committee meetings to be attended by all Board members who are 
available, whether or not they are members of the Committee so that their 
contribution to the matters discussed may be obtained.
In conjunction with the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the following 
matters during the year:
• Review of risk and internal controls;
• Recommendation to the Board for the payment of dividends;
•  The financial statements of the Group and the announcement of the 
annual results to 31 March 2013 and the interim statement on the half 
year results to 30 September 2013; 
• The re-appointment of the Group’s external auditor; and
•  The external auditors’ independence and the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor.
The Audit Committee met the external auditor on two occasions to discuss 
matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Other matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Committee during the 
year included:
•  The Group’s compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 and a review of its 
anti-bribery policy and procedures;
•  Review of the Group’s whistleblowing policy, noting that no issues had 
been raised under these procedures by any member of staff during the 
year under review;
• Review of the Group’s policies on equal opportunities and diversity;
• Review of the Group’s share dealing policy;
• Review of the Group’s signing authority policy;
• Review of the Group’s charitable donations policy;
• Review of the Group’s environmental management systems;
• Review of the Group’s need for an internal audit function;
• Review of IT risk and business continuity planning; and
• Review of the Group’s health and Safety policy.
The audit issues considered by the Audit Committee during the year include 
the following:
•  A discussion of the accounting treatment of complex transactions, including 
both investment and development properties, and the reasonableness of the 
Annual Bonus Scheme calculations. In order to address these issues, the 
Audit Committee requested that the external auditor assess whether 
complex transactions have been accounted for appropriately and report 
back to the Committee and that the external auditor meet with the Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee to talk through the Annual Bonus Scheme 
calculations once the calculation had been reviewed in light of the approved 
scheme rules. This was carried out satisfactorily.
•  The Audit Committee also discussed the significant accounting 
judgements and estimates as noted in Note 36 of the financial 
statements. This involved the circulation of the paper prepared by 
Management and a discussion amongst the Committee of any issues that 
required clarification, also consulting with the external auditor for their 
opinion. The Committee concluded that the judgements and estimates 
made by management were reasonable, based on the information 
available and in line with the Group’s accounting policies.
•  The Committee reviewed the investment property valuations as provided 
by the external valuer and discussed the reasonableness of the director’s 
stock surplus. The former utilises market knowledge of one of the 
Non-Executive directors who reviews the external valuations for 
reasonableness based on this knowledge. The latter is based on 
discussions with the Executive directors and a review of the stock surplus 
by the external valuer. The Audit Committee considers the property 
valuations to be reasonable.
•  The Audit Committee discussed the key sales and purchases during the 
year with the external auditor in order to assess key transactions that 
feature in the financial statements. The external auditor reported to the 
Committee in their management report and the highlights were discussed 
both at the half year and full year.
EFFECTiVEn ESS OF THE ExTER nAl AUDiTOR
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed Grant Thornton UK LLP’s 
fees, effectiveness and whether the agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and 
the reasons for any variation from the plan. The Audit Committee also 
considered its robustness and the degree to which Grant Thornton UK LLP 
was able to assess key accounting and audit judgements and the content of 
the management report issued by the external auditor. This was performed 
through meeting with the external auditor and discussing the issues they had 
addressed. The Audit Committee concluded that both the audit and the audit 
process were effective.
AUDiT in DEPEn DEnCE
A policy of reviewing audit independence has been adopted whereby 
non-audit services undertaken by the auditor are approved prior to work being 
carried out. The Audit Committee considers the external auditor to be 
independent and has satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the external auditor.
The Group’s policy on awarding non-audit work to its auditor is designed to 
ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate advice without 
compromising the independence of the auditor. Whilst no fee caps or limits 
have been set by the Committee, the level of fees would be a factor in 
considering whether the auditor’s independence could be affected by the 
award of non-audit work. In the year to 31 March 2014, certain fees (as 
shown in note 7 on page 83) were paid to the auditors for non-audit work.
Ann UAl gE n ERAl mEETing 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2014 the following 
resolutions relating to the auditor are being proposed: 
•  The re-appointment of Grant Thornton UK LLP as Independent Auditor; and
•  T o authorise the Directors to set the remuneration of the Independent 
Auditor.
I hope that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of 
the Company. As is permissible under the Act, the Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to consider, and if it sees fit, to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. Directors are required to notify 
the Company of any conflict or potential conflict of interest and the Board 
confirms that no such conflicts have been notified to the Company during 
the year under review.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
The directors consider that the annual report and the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, provide the information necessary to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy and is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and article 4 of the IAS 
Regulations. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and,
•  the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

We have audited the financial statements of helical Bar plc (“the Group”) for 
the year ended 31 March 2014 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated 
and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes 1 to 37 . The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s

RESPECTiVE RESPOn SiBiliTi ES OF DiRECTORS An D 
AUDiTOR
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set 
out on page 71, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
AUDiTOR COmmEnTARY
an overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is organised into two segments: investment and trading properties, 
and development properties. The Group financial statements are a consolidation 
of their reporting units which consist of its subsidiary undertakings and nine joint 
venture arrangements (significant subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 18 
and joint ventures in note 19 of the financial statements) comprising the Group’s 
operating businesses within these segments.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed on the operating businesses by 
us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors operating under 
our instruction. Our audit approach included a full audit of the financial 
statements of the parent company, helical Bar plc, and the financial 
information of its subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the United 
Kingdom and Channel Islands and seven of the joint venture arrangements, 
due to the size or risk characteristics of those entities. In addition, specific 
audit procedures were performed on certain balances and transactions of 
the Group’s subsidiary undertakings in Poland and two of the joint venture 
arrangements, based on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement 
of the Group financial statements. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to 
have in the audit work at those operating businesses to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The subsidiary undertakings and joint venture arrangements subject to a full 
scope audit represent 96% of the Group’s net assets at the balance sheet 
date, 98% of the Group’s revenue for the year and 94% of the Group’s profit 
before tax for the year.
We evaluated controls over key financial systems identified as part of our risk 
assessment, reviewed the accounts production and consolidation processes 
and addressed critical accounting matters. We undertook substantive testing 
on significant transactions, balances and disclosures, the extent of which 
was based on various factors such as our overall assessment of the control 
environment, the effectiveness of controls over individual systems and the 
management of specific risks.  
our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing our audit, in 
evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements and in forming our opinion. 
For the purpose of determining whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of a misstatement 
or an omission from the financial statements or related disclosures that would 
make it probable that the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the 
information would have been changed or influenced by the misstatement or 
omission. For the group audit, we established materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole to be £3,405,000, which is 1% of net assets. Net asset 
value and similar measures are used by investors and analysts to assess the 
performance of the Group and we therefore consider net assets to be most 
appropriate measure on which to base our materiality. For the financial 
information of the individual subsidiary undertakings and the joint venture 
arrangements, we set our materiality based on a proportion of group materiality 
appropriate to the relative scale of each of the operating businesses.
We determined the threshold at which we would communicate 
misstatements to the Audit Committee to be £157 ,300. In addition, we 
communicated misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.

our assessment of risk
Without modifying our opinion, we highlight the following matters that are, in 
our judgement, likely to be most important to users’ understanding of our audit. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion 
on individual transactions, account balances or disclosures.
recognition of revenue
The Group enters into development contracts under which the recognition of 
revenue often involves management judgement in applying IFRIC 15 or is 
determined by complex criteria, such as staged recognition of revenue upon 
completion of specified contractual obligations. In addition, auditing 
standards prescribe a presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition in that 
revenue may be misstated through improper recognition. We have therefore 
identified revenue recognition as a significant risk requiring special audit 
consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, an evaluation of the 
Group’s revenue recognition policies and their application to key 
development contracts, agreeing property sales proceeds to completion 
statements and bank receipts, and analytically reviewing rental income.
The revenue recognition policy of the Group is set out on page 102. Rental 
income is disclosed in note 3 and development property income in note 4 to 
the financial statements.
Valuation of investment property
The Group holds investment property for long-term rental income and capital 
appreciation which is required to be revalued annually to fair value in 
accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’. The fair values of significant 
investment properties are determined by professionally qualified external 
valuers. These valuations involve a number of estimates and assumptions, 
some of which derive from information provided by management and can be 
highly judgemental. We therefore identified the valuation of investment 
properties as an area requiring particular audit attention.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, obtaining an 
understanding of the approach to, and controls over, the valuation of 
investment property; discussing and challenging the estimates, assumptions 
and valuation methodology with the external valuer; considering the accuracy 
of prior period valuations in the context of subsequent sales; and assessing 
the appropriate accounting treatment of complex transactions. We have 
assessed the independence and credentials of the external valuer and 
evaluated the adequacy of the valuer’s work in respect of our audit. 
The Group’s accounting policy on investment properties is set out in note 37 and 
the disclosures in respect of investment properties are included in note 15.
employee remuneration – bonus and performance share plan
The Group operates three directors’ remuneration bonus and performance 
share plans being the Executive Bonus Plan 2011, the helical Bar Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2012 and the Performance Share Plan. Determining the 
charge in respect of each scheme involves complex calculations and 
elements of management judgement and we have therefore identified this as 
an area requiring particular audit attention.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, confirming that the 
calculation methodology accords with the scheme rules, that management 
judgements are reasonable and that matters requiring the approval of the 
Remuneration Committee have been approved. Our work focused on 
obtaining supporting documentation and challenging management’s 
assumptions related to the judgements for the surplus of the development 
stock above cost and assessing the forecasted net asset value growth of the 
Group over the three year vesting period of the Performance Share Plan 
options and future bonus cap based on our knowledge of the Group.
Details of bonuses and Performance Share Plan charges in respect of the 
directors are shown in Note 8 to the financial statements.
Management override of controls
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to consider the risk of 
management override of financial controls and, due to the unpredictable 
nature of this risk, we are required to assess it as a significant risk requiring 
special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, specific procedures 
relating to this risk that are required by ISA 240 ‘The Auditors 
Responsibilities relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements’. This 
included tests of journal entries, the evaluation of judgements and 
assumptions in management’s estimates and tests of significant transactions 
outside the normal course of business.
In particular, our work on revenue recognition, the valuation of investment 
properties and bonus and performance share plans address key aspects of 
ISA 240.

f actors that may affect future tax charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in respect of eligible 
expenditure on investment properties. 85

Other temporary differences 734 2,068 287 606
Deferred tax asset 8,458 10,381 749 577
Other temporary differences represent deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments, unrealised gains 
and future tax relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised. The total unrecognised losses amount to approximately £7 .6m. 
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which the losses have been generated either do not have forecast taxable profits or the 
losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of £1.2m 
(2013: £2.4m) would be released and further capital allowances of £11.4m (2013: £9.5m) would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

14.  EARning S PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end. 
Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the effect of all dilutive options and awards.
The earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real 
Estate Association (“EPRA”). Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Interest capitalised during the year in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties amounted to £nil (2013: £nil). 
Interest capitalised in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties is included in investment properties to the extent of £4,782,317 (2013: 
£5,767 ,000).
Investment properties with a total fair value of £474,200,000 (2013: £312,025,000) were held as security against borrowings.
All of the Group’s properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 March 2014 and there were no 
transfers between levels during the year. Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties, are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 (inputs from 
quoted prices) and level 2 (observable inputs either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. derived from prices).
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
Valuation methodology
The fair value of the Group’s investment property as at 31 March 2014 was determined by independent external valuers at that date. The valuations are in 
accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation – Professional Standards 2012 and were arrived at by reference to market 
transactions for similar properties. Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach. The main assumptions 
underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below. A key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place 
at the valuation date. These determine the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years. The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values 
to current market rent at the time of the next rent review (where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by 
new leases. The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations. The 
nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and 
costs, generates the market value of the property. The equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes 
into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against 
market transactions for similar properties. The valuation output, along with inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure these are in line with what a market 
participant would use when pricing each asset.
There are interrelationships between all the inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase in more than one input would be 
to magnify the input on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions.
Details of the investment portfolio yields can be found on page 26 of this report.

At 31 March 4,973 5,997
Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development and a holding of 
20% of the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are classed as an available-for-sale investment and held at fair value. The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the 
loan and the equity element separately. The loan element is valued at the fair value of the expected consideration to be received including anticipated future 
costs of recovering this loan. This amount has been impaired in the year due to a revision in the expected receipt. The equity element is given a nil value with 
the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at £nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome. This nil valuation is derived 
because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the company’s assets, after the repayment of the loan payable to the Group, would 
be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
The Group does not consider that it has significant influence over this company despite having 20% of the equity as another party owns a majority 
shareholding and the Group does not have a representative on the board of the company.
The decline in value of £1,024,000 (2013: £1,304,000) has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and, of this, £88,000 (2013: £nil) has been 
reclassified from Other Comprehensive Income and recognised in the Income Statement, being the amount impaired below historic cost of £5,061,000.

LIBOR.
As at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 the Company’s borrowings consist of fixed rate borrowings of £6,690,000 at 5.645% (2013: £6,690,000 at 
5.645%) expiring in October 2014 with the remainder being floating rate borrowings.
In addition to the fixed rate borrowings above, the Group has a £75m interest rate swap at 2.0% starting in January 2015 and expiring in January 2020. 95

The Group’s capital management objectives are:
-  to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and, 
-  to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital is defined as being issued 
share capital, retained earnings, revaluation reserve and other reserves (2014: £333,977 ,000; 2013: £246,220,000). The Group continually monitors its 
gearing level to ensure that it is appropriate. Gearing increased from 88% to 92% in the year due to the Group selling some of its non-core properties.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital repayment or further 
shares in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by shareholders on 20 December 2004. The deferred shares carry no voting rights and have 
no right to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares for a maximum aggregate total of 
1 penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase.
28.  SHARE OPTiOn S
At 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 there were 46,284 (2013: 46,284) unexercised options over new ordinary 1p shares in the Company. No options over 
purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to directors and employees under the Company’s share option schemes (31 March 2013: nil). 
The Company uses a stochastic valuation model to value the share options.

The carrying value of trade and other payables and borrowings is not deemed to be materially different from the fair value. Financial liabilities are stated in 
accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and those designated on initial recognition. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted 
based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
IFRS 13 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels:
-  Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
-  Level 2: values are derived from observing market data
-  Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data
The derivative financial instruments above have been valued using a Level 2 methodology and the available-for-sale investments, which are described in note 
21, are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, being those not based on observable market data. There were no transfers between categories in the 
current or prior year. 100

Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses 
the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
As at 31 March 2014 helical has total credit risk exposure excluding cash of £40,853,000 of which £4,973,000 is available-for-sale assets and £35,880,000 
is loans and receivables. Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 21.
Of the trade receivables held at 31 March 2014, £0.7m related to rent due from tenants which was received post year-end. 
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 22.
liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, and through 
numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of 
expected cash flows. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the 
financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on debt facilities, see notes 25 and 26.
The maturity profile of the Group’s contracted financial liabilities is as follows:

Total contracted liabilities 516,462 323,900 37 ,894 166,558
At 31 March 2014 helical had £91m of undrawn borrowing facilities, £39m of uncharged property assets and cash balances of £63m. The above contracted 
liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. The management believe that these facilities, together with anticipated 
sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that the Group can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments and 
accrued development profits. The Group actively monitors these exposures. 101

interest rate risk
It is the Group’s policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing. The Group does this by using a number of derivative 
financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the 
Group’s sources of finance. The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 26.
In the year to 31 March 2014, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits and equity due to 
movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk
Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, the Group has exposure to exchange movements on foreign 
currencies. helical’s management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to 
minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2014 the Group made foreign exchange losses of £501,000 (2013: gains of £17 ,000) resulting from movements in foreign exchange 
rates during the year affecting its assets and liabilities related to its overseas operations.
The Group’s balance sheet translation exposure is summarised as follows:

36.  POST BAlAnCE S HEET EVEnTS
In April 2014, the Group acquired a portfolio of ten properties for a total consideration of £40.15m, reflecting an 8.35% net initial yield.
On 10 June 2014, the Group announced the issuance of £100m of senior, unsecured guaranteed convertible bonds. The bonds will carry a coupon of 4.00% 
payable semi-annually in arrears and subject to certain conditions, will be convertible in June 2019 at the option of bondholders into preference shares of the 
issuer, helical Bar (Jersey) Limited, which will be automatically and mandatarily exchangeable into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company, unless a cash 
settlement option is exercised at the discretion of the Company. The initial conversion price has been set at £4.9694 per share. 102

Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of helical Bar plc (the 
“Company”) and all of its subsidiary undertakings (together the “Group”) 
drawn up to 31 March 2014. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over 
which the Group has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies 
through the exercise of voting rights. Subsidiaries are accounted for under 
the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost 
and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by 
the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group and are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s 
share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s 
net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for 
permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence 
but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the 
Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in 
the Corporate Governance review on page 51.
Revenue recognition 
Rental income - rental income receivable is recognised in the Income 
Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any incentive for 
lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with 
entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods - assets, such as trading properties, development sites and 
completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance 
with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts for 
the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional 
contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a 
conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion. 
Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived 
from the fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 
Revenue.
Construction contracts - where an asset is constructed under a specific 
contract with a purchaser (a “pre-sold development”) the initial sale of the 
site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with 
IAS 18 Revenue, where the sale of the land is not conditional on the 
construction of the buildings and is not reversible in the event that the 
building is not constructed. The construction element of the contract is 
treated, for the purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract 
in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion which is typically determined by 
reference to project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation 
certificates provided by quantity surveyors. The Company’s principal other 
responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identification of and 
agreement of terms with potential tenants of the completed building(s). The 
revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements 
is considered separately to reflect the substance of the transaction as the 
rendering of services, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. The amount of 
revenue recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the 
building(s) that are let. 
Property advisory/development management services - where the Group 
provides these services to the third party property site owner the Group 
recognises income over the period these services are provided and in 
accordance with the specific terms of the contract. If the amount of, and 
payment of, the consideration for these services are contingent upon a 
future event (such as sale of the property) and the Group recognises 
revenue when it has provided the services, it can reliably estimate the fair 
value of the consideration and upon occurrence of the relevant event, where 
amounts are receivable in future periods, the amount due is discounted for 
time and risk.
Investment income - revenue in respect of investment and other income 
represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an accruals 
basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on 
investments held for the short-term. Dividends are recognised when the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. Interest income 
is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate.
Deferred income - money received in advance of the provision of goods or 
services is held in the balance sheet until the income can be recognised in 
the Income Statement.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share 
plan awards and a share incentive plan. These payments are discussed in 
greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 67 . The 
fair value of share-based payments related to employees’ service are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument 
at the grant date. All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 
November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised 
in the financial statements. The Group uses the stochastic valuation model 
and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income 
Statement (“Income Statement”) over the vesting period of the share-based 
payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where 
non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting 
period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the 
number of awards that are expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently 
revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest 
differs from previous estimates.
The amount charged to the Income Statement is credited to the Retained 
Earnings reserve.
On exercise of the performance share plan options, the total cumulative 
amount recognised in the Income Statement for the options is movement 
from Retained Earnings to the Share Capital and Share Premium accounts. 
On lapsing of the performance share plan options, the total cumulative 
amount recognised in the Income Statement is reversed in the Income 
Statement and Retained Earnings.
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided 
for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties. 
The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. 
Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the Group’s head 
office at 11-15 Farm Street, London W1J 5RS are capitalised and held as 
short-term leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements, plant and 
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual 
value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the 
following basis:
Short leasehold improvements - 10% or length of lease, if shorter 
Plant and equipment  - 25% 103

Taxation 
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the 
year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains 
recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release 
of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. The measurement of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which 
the Group expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of those assets and liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to 
be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the 
estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is 
settled. It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to 
items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following 
conditions are satisfied:
a)   the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference; and,
b)   it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a 
liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are 
approved.
investment properties 
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which 
are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction 
costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value. These fair values 
are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified 
external valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on 
their knowledge of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment 
properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income 
Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no 
depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral 
plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment 
property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued 
future use as investment property, the property remains an investment 
property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. Interest is capitalised 
before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15.
land, developments and trading properties. 
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and 
are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under 
development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised. The interest 
capitalised is either based on the interest paid (where a project has a 
specific loan) or calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of 
borrowings (where there are no specific borrowings for the project). Interest 
is capitalised from the date of commencement of the development work until 
date of practical completion. 
investments 
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet 
date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are 
attributable to impairment below historic cost, in which case they are 
recognised in the Income Statement. Upon disposal, accumulated fair value 
adjustments are included in the Income Statement. 
Held for sale investments 
Investments are defined as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the 
investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held for sale investments are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their 
classification as held for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised 
cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, cash held at solicitors, cash in 
blocked accounts and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised 
at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. 104
HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
notES to tHE F inancial StatE mEntS continued
Borrowing and borrowing costs 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and the Group’s retail bond are 
initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs yet to be 
amortised in accordance with IAS39. Embedded derivatives contained within 
the borrowing agreements are treated in accordance with IAS39.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of 
new developments and investment properties are added to the costs of such 
properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. 
After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost. This 
treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Gains or losses on extinguishing debt are recognised in the Income 
Statement in the period in which they occur.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and 
floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks 
arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and 
are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated 
future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair 
value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be 
found in note 35.
l eases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A lease 
that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are 
accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an 
obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property 
asset is included in the Balance Sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
In accordance with IAS17 , operating leases receipts are spread on a 
straight-line basis over the length of the lease.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on 
translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in 
which they arise. Exchange differences on non-monetary items are 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that 
they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses 
are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries 
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in 
subsidiaries are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of 
a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the 
Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
net asset values per share 
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best 
practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association 
(“EPRA”).
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the 
best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
Shares held in the helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
(“ESOP”) are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds. Assets, 
liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to 
which they relate. Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease 
the book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance Sheet. At each period 
end the Group assesses and recognises the value of “Own shares held” with 
reference to the expected cash proceeds and accounts for movement 
between book value and fair value as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements 
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, 
management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset 
and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the 
financial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and 
various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors 
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these 
considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other 
sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may 
significantly impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position are:
-  recognition of property management/development management service 
income includes subjective assumptions such as assessment of 
contingent events and time value of money for future payments (note 2);
-  valuation of investment properties, where external valuers are used to 
provide third party valuations (note 15);
-  recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the 
estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the 
end of the performance periods (note 29);
-  calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, 
where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 11);
-  the provision for future bonuses payable under the Annual Bonus scheme;
-  assessment of whether option and forward contracts entered into by the 
Group fall within the scope of IAS 39 (note 32). This involves assessing 
whether a contract can be settled net in cash or whether associated 
properties are readily convertible into cash;
-  assessment of whether forward sales meet the criteria for revenue 
recognition of IAS18 (note 2). In particular, whether the inflow of future 
economic benefits is probable or not;
-  valuation of the investment in a property developer which is based on a 
valuation method (note 21); and
-  directors’ valuation of land, development and trading properties include 
subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions 
and future sales values and timings (note 20). 105

may wish to consider having their dividends paid directly into their bank or 
building society account. This has a number of advantages, including the 
crediting of cleared funds into the nominated account on the dividend 
payment date. If shareholders would like their future dividends to be paid in 
this way, they should complete a mandate instruction available from the 
Registrars. Under this arrangement tax vouchers are sent to the 
shareholder’s registered address.

Un SOliCiTED inVESTm EnT ADViCE - WAR ning TO 
SHAREHOl DERS
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. 
These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high 
risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent and 
extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in 
this way; many of the victims had been successfully investing for several 
years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•  Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA (Financial Conduct 
Authority) before getting involved.  
you can check at www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
•  Report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or by 
completing an online form at:
  www .fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/investment-scams/share-fraud-and-
boiler-room-scams/reporting-form.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Also keep in 
mind that some fraudsters use the name of genuine firms or individuals on 
the FCA Register to suggest that they are legitimate. however, authorised 
firms are unlikely to contact you out of the blue offering to buy or sell shares.

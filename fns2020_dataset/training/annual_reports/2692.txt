This has been a transformational year for Cable 
& Wireless Communications ( CWC). There has 
been continued demand for mobile data, and we 
have reduced our operating costs, particularly in 
the Caribbean. The sale of our Islands and Macau 
divisions has focused our business on Panama and 
the Caribbean – a region we call pan-America. These 
continuing operations are therefore the focus of this 
report. The reshaping of our business positions us 
for future growth.
During the period, CWC announced that it entered into two significant disposal transactions. In this 
Annual Report and Accounts, Panama, the Caribbean and Monaco are classified as continuing operations. 
Our businesses in the Maldives, Channel Islands and Isle of Man, the Seychelles, South Atlantic, Diego 
Garcia and Macau have been treated as discontinued operations within CWC’s reported results. A full list 
of definitions for terms included in this report appear on page 136. 
Pages 1 to 67 inclusive (together with the information incorporated by reference) consist of a Directors’

Our business in brief
Our business is based in pan-America, 
a region consisting of the countries which 
lie in and around the Caribbean basin. 
Where we operate
We can trace our involvement in the region back to 
the 1870s and have been supporting the development 
of its telecoms infrastructure since that time.
We control 14 businesses within the Caribbean, with 
the largest markets being Jamaica, The Bahamas and 
Barbados. We also hold a minority stake in TSTT in 
Trinidad and Tobago. In Central America we are the 
leading operator in Panama. 
Across the region we have an extensive grid of 
sub-sea cable networks and sell carrier services 
in 40 countries. 
We are also the majority shareholder in Monaco 
Telecom, Monaco’s leading telecoms operator.

Chairman’ s review
 “We will now run our businesses, 
in the Caribbean and Panama,  
as a unified operation. ”
Sir Richard Lapthorne, CBE
Chairman
2012/13 has been a milestone year for our Company.
It has been a year in which we executed several key 
strategic initiatives, most notably selling our Macau and 
Islands businesses to focus the Group on one region – 
pan-America. 
Cable & Wireless Communications’ historic operating 
model has been as a telecoms ‘finance house’, owning 
and managing a portfolio of assets. The strategic shift 
we have undertaken during the year has converted the 
Group to being a telecoms operator.
We will now run our businesses, in the Caribbean 
and Panama, as a unified operation. This will involve 
establishing a totally different structure for managing 
the Group and its operations, with the Group’s central 
function and operational control co-located in a new 
facility in the region. 
With this structure we will be able to reduce the layers 
of management, bring our best talent to exercise 
management control across the region and reinforce 
the accountability of our front line managers.
It is a clear break from the traditional approach of 
CWC, and Cable & Wireless Group before that, but it 
is the organisational approach that best captures the 
opportunity for our business and hence for establishing 
sustainable value for the firm. 
The fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. 
In the pan-America region demand for the mobile and 
fixed data services we provide is growing. Our business 
posted a 34% increase in mobile data service revenues 
in 2012/13 and the penetration of data services in the 
region is still below developed markets such as the US 
and Europe.
2012/13 Highlights
—  Dividend of 
US4 cents
—  Agreed sale of 
majority of Monaco 
& Islands division for 
US$680 million
—  Agreed sale of Macau 
division for a total 
consideration of 
US$750 million
  Annual report 2012/13 05
Positive value
 “ The fundamental drivers of our business 
remain strong. In the pan-America 
region demand for the mobile and fixed 
data services we provide is growing.”
Ahead of full implementation of the changed approach 
we are also improving the productivity of the business, 
by tackling our cost base, particularly in the Caribbean. 
This will improve our margins as well as the services we 
provide to customers.
The new approach will, however, not affect our business 
practices or corporate standards. The growth and 
development of this Group over its history has been 
based on strong ethical principles, which will remain 
firmly embedded in our organisation.
We have always been a vital part of the communities we 
serve – from providing the technology and networks 
that our customers use to connect with each other, to 
our support for the key institutions of the societies we 
operate in.
For example, we take a firm public stance against 
corruption and unethical business practice. Corruption 
damages business, discourages investment, stifles 
innovation and ultimately costs consumers. CWC already 
has rigorous procedures in place to attempt to prevent 
improper activities in our business, and we have set 
several further priorities to improve our practices, as 
well as setting an example to our industry. We have set 
out further detail on our position in the CSR report on 
pages 20 to 23.
With all the activity during the year devoted to 
progressing complex portfolio changes we were 
constantly aware of the risk of distraction from our usual 
attention to operational supervision. However, amid a 
very active year for the business, we have also achieved 
a strong operating performance, delivering the results 
we forecast at the start of the year. 
Group revenue of US$1.9 billion and EBITDA of 
US$589 million represented a solid performance, and 
our cash generation was strong. For a full commentary 
on the results, please see the Finance review on 
pages 24 to 30. 
As we continue the process of change we remain 
committed to maintaining returns to our shareholders 
via our dividend. The Board has recommended a dividend 
of US4 cents for the 2012/13 year, and committed 
to maintaining the US4 cents payment in 2013/14. 
We aim to progressively grow our dividend in line 
with future performance. 
Finally, these results and the transformation of the 
business would not have been possible without the 
efforts of our committed colleagues. Those who will 
leave the Group with the disposals, and those who 
remain, have done an excellent job in meeting the needs 
of our customers. On behalf of the Board, I thank them 
all for their efforts. 
Sir Richard Lapthorne, CBE
A focus on governance
The Board remains committed to the high 
standards of corporate governance that we 
have developed over several years.

Chief Executive’ s review
 “We have set a target of 
US$100 million of annual 
cost savings to be achieved 
over the next two years. ” 
Tony Rice
Chief Executive
2012/13 has been a successful year for Cable & Wireless 
Communications, and brought our business to a key 
inflection point.
As a Group we achieved ‘structural coherence’ following 
our announced divestments of the Macau and Islands 
operations – a strategy we have pursued since our 
demerger from Cable & Wireless Group in 2010. 
We are now a business focused entirely on one region, 
pan-America, where we have a great platform from 
which to build. 
This structural clarity allows us to review our operating 
model and management approach and make changes 
to create a more unified, effective and cost-efficient 
business. The streamlined business will also help us to 
adapt in the new age of telecoms where data rather than 
voice is the primary product and customer priority. 
We have established a strong foundation from which 
to grow the business, our challenge is now to deliver. 
2012/13 Performance
The business performance in 2012/13 was solid, but 
highlighted the unequivocal shift to a data-centric 
marketplace.
Mobile data revenue grew by 34% during the year 
as our customers continued to rapidly migrate on to 
smartphones. In contrast our voice revenue declined, 
particularly in fixed line services.
In Panama the growth of mobile data drove a 3% 
increase in mobile revenue, despite continued intense 
competition in the market.
Mobile data made a similar contribution to strong 
financial performance in The Bahamas, as our 4G 
network came online. We also continued to improve 
efficiency and customer experience in this market.
Our Jamaica business has struggled in the face of mobile 
competition in recent years, but following positive  Mobile data
 “Having introduced high speed mobile data 
networks in our key markets the next 
frontier is ‘Long T erm Evolution’ technology 
which will enable our customers to easily 
stream video on their smartphones. We are 
in the early stages of introducing this in 
The Bahamas and expect to launch a 
commercial proposition in 20 13/1 4. ” 
Annual report 2012/13 07
regulatory changes our team launched a terrific fight-
back campaign and increased customers by 16%. 
Trading conditions in the rest of the Caribbean were 
challenging, but we continued to enhance the services 
we deliver in markets with higher GDP and announced 
plans to build fibre broadband networks in the Cayman 
Islands and Barbados. 
We also demonstrated our ability to tackle costs during 
the year, with the outsourcing of our retail operations 
in Barbados and our network management in Jamaica 
contributing to a reduced cost base in the Caribbean. 
Performance in our other divisions, Macau and Monaco 
& Islands, was positive, with Monaco Telecom having 
benefited from the elimination of loss-making activities 
to post EBITDA 27% higher.
New operating model
Having unified our business we can now bring our 
management teams together, including moving 
our senior management closer to our operations, 
and most importantly, closer to our customers. We 
have announced plans to establish a new corporate 
headquarters in southern Florida, USA. The Group will 
remain listed on the London Stock Exchange, but our 
key corporate functions will be based in the new HQ 
and our management team will take a more operational 
approach. 
This fundamental change to our operating model will 
enable us to drive significant cost out of the business. 
We have set a target of US$100 million of annual cost 
savings to be achieved over the next two years. The 
savings will come through productivity improvement 
and the realisation of synergies as we unify the business. 
This will improve our cash flow and margins, particularly 
in our Caribbean business. Our operating margin in the 
Caribbean is currently 24% and we have set a target of 
raising it to above 30% in the medium term.
Investment
Proceeds from the disposals will also give us the financial 
flexibility to invest in the future of CWC.
Such investment will be focused on:
 —Organic – Quality network infrastructure and systems 
to deliver the best possible customer experience
 —Inorganic – Acquisitions that we can develop into full 
service businesses within our target footprint 
Having introduced high speed mobile data networks 
in our key markets the next frontier is ‘Long Term 
Evolution’ technology which will enable our customers 
to easily stream video on their smartphones. We are in 
the early stages of introducing this in The Bahamas and 
expect to launch a commercial proposition in 2013/14. 
Customer service remains a cornerstone of what we do 
and so we will continue to invest in facilities that help us 
to improve the experience we deliver. 
We have strict criteria for making investments and 
Return on Invested Capital, which we have broadly 
maintained at the same level as in 2012/13, is an 
important management measure. We are targeting 
improvements in future and key to that will be the 
pricing and bundling of the mobile data bandwidth we 
supply. We have made progress on introducing tiered 
pricing for mobile data services across our business and 
will continue to develop our customer information and 
billing systems in support of that. 
While we are saying goodbye to many valued colleagues 
through our disposals, these are exciting times for CWC. 
We have a unified business, clear strategy and strong 
sense of determination to enact the changes which will 
transform our Group and deliver long-term growth.

are buying smartphones and tablets and using applications with 
increasingly enriched forms of entertainment and information. 
Network speeds and capacities are increasing, enabling customers 
to download richer content like pay TV and streamed video.
As a result of these trends, the appetite for data services, particularly 
mobile data, will continue to increase.

Operational review
Our businesses delivered a 
stable performance during 
the year, amid the significant 
changes to the Group. 
Overview 
Mobile data was the stand-out service across our 
business. Approximately 32% of total handsets sold in 
Panama and the Caribbean were smartphones which has 
supported this growth. Mobile data revenue increased 
34%, with 47% growth in Panama and 28% in the 
Caribbean. This was a strong return on the investment 
we made in mobile data networks in 2011/12. Following 
that significant investment in the prior year, capital 
expenditure was lower across the Group.
While our mobile data activity increased, customers 
continued to turn away from fixed voice usage, switching 
instead to use mobiles and voice over internet protocol 
services utilising fixed broadband. 
Broadband is a significant growth opportunity for our 
business, with penetration rates in pan-America lower 
than in developed nations. We plan to invest in the roll-
out of fibre broadband next year.
We also plan further launches of our ‘LIME TV’, TV over 
broadband service in the Caribbean following a positive 
reception in Barbados and Cayman. 
Group operating expenditure was US$798 million for 
our continuing operations, an improvement of 6% on the 
prior year. 
We expect further cost reductions as we move to 
a unified business structure and drive to improve 
operational synergy and target US$100 million of 
savings over the next two years.

Our Caribbean business saw good performances in The 
Bahamas and Jamaica, but faced difficult economic 
conditions in the Eastern Caribbean. 
The successful transformation of our Bahamas business 
continued as we completed the roll out of a new high 
speed mobile data network. There has been a significant 
increase in mobile data network traffic and an extra 
500,000 calls per day since we started the project in 
2011/12.
Across the region we enjoyed better management of 
costs, with operating expenditure improved by 5% as we 
benefited from efficiency improvements in The Bahamas 
and a region-wide cost reduction programme.
Our Jamaica mobile customer base increased by 16% by 
year end as regulatory changes created a level playing field. 
However, changes to regulations in Jamaica and the 
imposition of a special telecoms tax contributed to a 
10% fall in Caribbean fixed line revenue.
Trading conditions in the rest of the Caribbean were 
difficult, but we continued to invest in growth services 
within higher GDP per capita markets. Our new Barbados 
pay TV network had over 3,000 customers by year end 
and we launched in a second market, the Cayman Islands, 
in April 2013. We have also announced plans to roll 
out new high speed fibre broadband networks in both 
Barbados and Cayman.
The economic outlook for the region is stable. The 
International Monetary Fund predicts that whilst growth 
will continue to be constrained, the Caribbean’s recovery 
from recession will continue, with a gradual pick up in 
tourist flows. 
Panama 2012/2013 2011/2012
Revenue US$586m US$601m
EBITDA US$239m US$256m
Operating cash flow US$154m US$131m
In Panama we improved EBITDA by 8% in the second 
half of the year. Our mobile business again performed 
strongly, leading to a 3% increase in mobile revenue. 
The business is in one of the most competitive mobile 
markets in Central America with four operators and 
mobile number portability giving customers the 
opportunity to freely move between networks. Despite 
this we retained a majority of market share by gaining 
an additional 18,000 postpaid customers. We plan to 
build on this positive momentum by launching a mobile 
payments service in 2013/14.
Pay TV is a core component of our triple play (pay TV, 
broadband, fixed line) offering. Our pay TV customer 
base increased by 5%, with more than three quarters of 
customers choosing to take multiple services. Annual report 2012/13 19
The delayed launch of some Government programmes 
caused a decline in enterprise revenue, but we won 
several social telecoms contracts. These included 
contracts to: put the country’s ‘National Registry’ online 
(making it easier to buy and sell property in Panama); 
create an IT system for public hospitals; and to install 
a software system to help the health service monitor, 
maintain and manage the assets it owns. 
Our business continues to benefit from Panama’s strong 
GDP growth (over 10% in 2012). Growth has been 
boosted by construction related to the project to widen 
the Panama Canal, a major boost to future trade which 
will be completed in 2014. 
Monaco 2012/2013 2011/2012
Revenue US$236m US$267m
EBITDA US$75m US$59m
Operating cash flow US$60m US$34m
Monaco continued to perform strongly in 2012/13, 
with the sale of its loss-making Afinis operations 
during the year helping to boost EBITDA by 27%. There 
was continued demand for mobile data services from 
residents and roamers, creating a positive platform 
for the introduction of Long Term Evolution services in 
2013/14.
CWC Wholesale Solutions
Last year we combined our sub-sea cable assets into a 
new business, CWC Wholesale Solutions. 
In May 2013 we announced that we have entered into a 
strategic partnership with Columbus Networks Limited 
to further develop our international wholesale capacity 
business. The joint venture contains more than 42,000 km 
of sub-sea cables with connectivity to 42 countries. 
The alliance positions us strongly to meet the data 
capacity demands of our retail operations in the future, 
as well as optimising our capital expenditure on sub-sea 
cable networks in the future. 
We will further extend our capability next year as a 
founder member of the Pacific Caribbean Cable System, 
a 6,000 km cable linking Florida and Ecuador, building 
work for which will begin in 2013/14.
Islands and Macau 
We agreed the sale of both our Islands and Macau 
businesses, to Batelco Group and CITIC Telecom 
International Holdings Limited respectively. 
The agreed sale price of US$750 million for Macau 
reflected the company’s strong growth in recent years 
and its development since CWC became a founding 
shareholder in 1981. The disposal of our Islands business 
also achieved an excellent price, with an agreed sale 
price of US$580 million. We also agreed the sale of 25% 
of our shareholding in CMC, the business which holds 
our shares in Monaco Telecom, for US$100 million to 
Batelco. We have an option in place to sell Batelco the 
rest of our shares in CMC, subject to gaining regulatory 
and Government approval by April 2014. 
Talks with our partner in that business, the Government 
of Monaco, have taken place regarding the sale of our 
remaining 75% in CMC. Feedback has not been as 
positive as expected and so we are also working with 
Batelco to consider the alternative options available.
 
Win back Jamaica 
Garry Sinclair, CEO, Jamaica
“ We campaigned for a change in the regulation 
governing mobile operators to give Jamaicans 
real choice. When the Government made those 
changes last summer we immediately launched 
Talk EZ for our prepaid and postpaid customers, 
reducing call prices by over two-thirds and 
reasserting LIME as Jamaica’s value leader. 
Talk EZ was supported by our highly successful 
marketing campaign based around the Olympic 
Games which really excited consumers. We are 
still in a dog fight, but for the first time in a long 
time the momentum is with us.” 
Mobile data leadership
Jorge Nicolau, CEO, Panama
“ Our four operator mobile market is one of the 
most fiercely contested in Central America. We 
have maintained our market share above 50%, 
because we have been innovative in delivering 
affordable access to mobile data services for our 
customers, for example with pricing plans that 
enable customers to buy data allowances for 
short time periods.”
New networks in The Bahamas
Geoff Houston, CEO, Bahamas
“ The completion of our high speed mobile data 
network in The Bahamas was a clear statement of 
our intent, considering that the legacy network 
was more than 15 years old in some places. The 
value of this work has been clear and we’ve 
released pent up demand for quality telecom 
services. We have spectrum to introduce even 
faster mobile data services and plan to do so in 
2013/14, ensuring we are strongly positioned for 
the introduction of mobile competition in 2014.”  20 Cable & Wireless Communications
Corporate social responsibility
We take corporate social responsibility 
seriously. CWC ( and prior to 2010 Cable 
& Wireless Plc ) has been a continuing 
member of the FTSE4Good corporate 
responsibility index since its inception 
in 2001. 
 1
Contribute positively to the social and 
economic development of the 
communities in which we operate
Our services directly contribute to the economy of 
the countries in which we operate. We also invest in 
the social development of the communities where our 
employees and customers live.
We sponsor sporting activities and athletes across 
pan-America.
In the Caribbean we sponsored several individual 
athletes in the 2012 Olympic Games including Grenada’s 
Olympic 400m champion, Kirani James and sprinter, 
Yohan Blake from Jamaica who won one gold and two 
silver medals in London. 
Our Bahamas business sponsored its national team at 
the Olympics, and the 2013 CARIFTA Games, a major 
platform for the region’s young athletes. It is the third 
year in a row that our Caribbean business has sponsored 
the CARIFTA Games.
In Panama +Movil, our mobile brand, is synonymous with 
soccer as sponsor of the National Football League, the 
+Movil Cup and the Panamanian Football Federation. Our 
sponsorship of the national team last year included the 
friendly ‘Red vs Red’ clash between Panama and World 
and European Champions, Spain. 
We are also a strong supporter of education, and in 
Jamaica our annual ‘Skool Aid’ event attracted 30,000 
people and helped local children prepare for the new 
school year by providing free school supplies, haircuts 
and medical, dental and eye checks.
In Panama we teamed up with renowned painter Olga 
Sinclair to provide a painting workshop for thousands 
of children. 
We also work to develop the economies in which we 
operate. In 2012, our Panama business sponsored 
Connect Americas, a major telecoms conference which 
discussed ways to close the digital divide in the region. 
Later in the year the business sponsored the Britain in 
Panama conference which celebrated the links between 
the two countries and encouraged more inward 
investment of the type made by CWC. 
Below are some examples of how our 
business units deliver corporate social 
responsibility programmes meeting 
our four responsibility principles: Annual report 2012/13 21

Seek continuous improvement in our 
environmental performance
Our environmental commitment focuses on energy 
conservation, recycling, waste management, responsible 
water usage and reducing our carbon footprint.
Our online system to report on energy use and carbon 
emissions ensures consistent reporting and provides us 
with a useful reference point against which to measure 
reductions in energy usage and carbon emissions.
We estimate our carbon footprint to be 171,398 tonnes 
of CO
2
e based on our Scope 1, 2 & 3 greenhouse 
gas emissions. Our electricity consumption was 
248,992 megawatt hours this year and our fuel usage 
was 5.87 million litres.
The Group’s total emissions have increased by 17,540 
tonnes of  CO
2
 from the prior year. This is due to 
a 32% increase in the emissions associated with 
electricity consumption despite only a 12% increase 
in usage. This disproportionate increase in electrity-
associated emissions is principally caused by changes 
in the methodology employed by the Carbon Neutral 
Protocol and changes in the International Energy Agency 
calculated emissions factors for electricity consumption 
in the relevant regions, particularly Jamaica.
We continue to use video conferencing facilities to 
reduce business travel, although travel is still necessary 
due to our geographical spread, and we estimate that 
created 6,136 tonnes of CO
2
e usage.
The recycling programmes in our Panama business, 
started in 2011/12, continued successfully. This year we 
ran seminars for colleagues to emphasise the importance 
of recycling paper and ink products. We also formalised 
agreements with recycling enterprises Recicla Panama 
and Recitec to dispose of obsolete IT equipment, as we 
do in several other businesses. Panama has recycled 
more than 50,000 pounds of equipment so far. 
The Caribbean region continued to generate the largest 
proportion of carbon emissions, representing 50% 
of the Group’s total emissions for the 2012/13 year. 
Management have initiated a programme with energy 
optimisation consultants that is focused on identifying 
and executing projects to reduce energy usage and 
carbon emissions, as well as procuring energy more 
efficiently in the Caribbean. These projects will typically 
take three or more years to realise significant benefits, 
however we expect to see some reduction in energy 
usage in the 2013/14 year.
We also work to support the local ecosystems of the 
countries in which we operate. Grenada, for example, 
is known as the ‘island of spice’ due to its production 
of nutmeg and mace crops. Our business has been 
promoting the importance of the nutmeg plant and 
in 2012 provided over 1,000 plants to farmers, and 
sponsored the Grenada Nutmeg Festival in November.

Respect cultures, values and human 
rights throughout our operations
We conduct business with honesty, integrity, openness 
and with respect for the human rights and interests 
of our employees and the communities in which we 
operate.
Our Panama business joined the Social Enterprise 
Alliance for the Prevention and Eradication of Child 
Labour in Panama. As part of the Alliance we will defend 
and promote the rights of children and teenagers in 
Panama so that they acquire training, education and life 
skills.
Carnival is an important part of cultural activities across 
pan-America, and our businesses get involved in many 
locations. 
In The Bahamas, for example, we agreed a US$850,000 
sponsorship to support the Christmas season Junkanoo 
parades, which have been a part of Bahamian life for 
several centuries. 
In Panama we had +Movil floats in annual carnival 
parades across the country, and maintained local 
tradition by spraying the crowds with water as they 
thronged in the streets dancing to their favourite tunes. 
Since 2005, our Panama business has also sponsored 
and organised the National Oratory Contest, a public 
speaking competition which started in the 1970s. The 
Oratory contest encourages young people to research 
and then discuss topical issues about Panama. The 
2012 National Oratory Contest winner, Suellen Ayala, 
won a scholarship to university and will be able to study 
towards her dream of becoming a doctor.
As well as celebrating national culture the business 
also recognises minority groups within Panama. For 
example, we celebrated the Chinese year of the snake by 
supporting celebrations for the Chinese community in 
Panama.

Nurture best practice in our activities
Our businesses share best practice across the Group, 
developing further what is good and removing what isn’t.
Our success has been built on an honest and transparent 
approach. We have recently strengthened our 
procedures in line with the requirements of the UK’s 
Anti-Bribery law, but the principles behind this legislation 
are not new to our business. Our commitment to ethical 
business behaviour is long-standing and starts at the top 
of the organisation. 
CWC always takes a proactive approach to addressing 
the threat of corrupt activities in the markets in which 
we operate.
Externally, we are taking a more public stand against 
corruption by increasing the transparency of our dealings 
with Government and urging our competitors to do the 
same.
We also take very seriously our duty to protect our 
employees from corruption. This commitment has 
enabled us to attract some of the brightest and best 
talent everywhere we do business. 
To address all these challenges, we have developed an 
internal programme which set outs our values and our 
policies and procedures to prevent bribery and corrupt 
practices from occurring in our business activities. This 
includes: 
—  A company-wide code of conduct policy – updated 
annually 
—  An annual Board review of the Company’s compliance 
with the UK Anti-Bribery legislation 
—  A register of political or charitable contributions, 
sponsorships, gifts and corporate hospitality 
—  Company-wide annual training for staff 
—  Thorough due diligence on the many other businesses 
and organisations with which we have business 
relationships
This comprehensive programme has been tailored 
to minimise the damaging effects of bribery in all 
jurisdictions in which we operate. We take a zero 
tolerance approach to corruption.

Financial review  
continued
During the period, CWC announced that it entered into two 
significant disposal agreements. As a result, the businesses 
in the Maldives, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, the 
Seychelles, South Atlantic, Diego Garcia and Macau have 
been treated as discontinued operations within the Group’s 
reported results.
Revenue from continuing operations fell by 4% to US$1,942 million. 
Mobile revenue for the Group was flat on the prior year as strong 
mobile data growth of 34%, following increased penetration and 
usage, was offset by declining voice revenue. Our fixed voice and 
enterprise, data and other revenues were adversely impacted 
by declining voice traffic, lower activity levels and a difficult 
macroeconomic environment.
Group EBITDA was in line with the prior year at US$589 million as 
improved performance in Monaco following the disposal of Afinis in 
the first half was offset by declines in Panama and in the Caribbean, 
where EBITDA also reduced despite efficiency gains.
Operating profit before exceptional items was the same as the prior 
period at US$328 million. During the year we took an exceptional 
restructuring charge of US$50 million related to efficiency initiatives 
including the initial steps towards the transformation of engineering 
operations across the Caribbean. In addition, we took an exceptional 
non-cash impairment charge of US$86 million in the Eastern 
Caribbean reflecting the more difficult economic climate we face in 
those markets.
Profit for the period increased to US$178 million following lower 
exceptional charges. Adjusted earnings per share for the year 
were 2% higher than the prior year at US6.6 cents. The Board has 
recommended a full year dividend of US4 cents per share.
On a constant currency basis, revenue for the Group was 3% lower 
and EBITDA was 1% higher than the prior year.

Revenue at US$586 million was 2% lower than the same period last 
year as strong mobile growth was offset by lower fixed voice and 
enterprise, data and other revenues.
Mobile revenue was up 3% to US$323 million. The business 
maintained market leadership and data penetration of the subscriber 
base increased to 31%. High data usage, particularly in the prepaid 
segment due to the availability of short-term flexible plans, resulted 
in non-voice revenue growth of 47% which more than offset the 
decline in voice revenue. ARPU grew by 17% as postpaid subscribers 
were 9% higher and we retained high value prepaid customers whilst 
promotional activity caused the total number of prepaid subscribers 
to fluctuate.
Broadband & TV revenue at US$60 million was in line with the same 
period last year. Our focus remained on the higher ARPU broadband 
segment and pay TV subscribers grew by 5% on the prior year. The 
number of pay TV subscribers taking an additional triple play service 
increased to 77%.
Fixed voice revenue declined by 10% to US$122 million as mobile 
competition continued to impact usage and rates.
Enterprise, data and other revenue fell by 10% as a result of delayed 
Government programmes in Panama. During the year we were 
awarded a Government contract to supply, install and support 
new systems to share documents electronically and a contract to 
introduce a Hospital Information System to improve administration 
and patient care in state funded hospitals.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 1% higher than last 
year as growth in higher margin mobile offset reduced enterprise, 
data and other revenue which is typically lower margin.
Operating costs at US$158 million were 8% higher than the prior 
year reflecting higher network costs following the expansion of our 
mobile network and greater utility costs.
As a result of higher operating costs, EBITDA of US$239 million was 
7% lower compared to the prior year, however we saw an increase of 
8% in second half performance compared to the first half. EBITDA as 
a percentage of revenue was 41%.

Revenue in our Caribbean business at US$1.120 billion was down 
4% on the prior year, consistent with the decline in the first half 
of the year.
Mobile revenue of US$527 million was 1% down on the prior 
year driven principally by lower ARPU. Subscriber numbers were 
broadly flat on the prior period with growth in Jamaica following 
regulatory changes which enabled us to improve our competitive 
positioning, stimulating subscriber and usage growth offset by 
churn in the Eastern Caribbean. We have seen sustained growth in 
mobile data usage following the launch of high speed networks in a 
number of islands during the year and plan to expand on this where 
commercially viable.
Broadband & TV revenue was down 2% at US$120 million. We 
launched LIME TV in Barbados during the year and have signed 
up over 3,000 subscribers to date with plans to roll out TV over 
broadband services to a number of islands in the coming year.
Fixed voice revenue at US$290 million was 10% down compared 
to the prior year. Voice substitution continued across the 
region, although the ARPU and revenue decline this year was 
mainly influenced by Jamaica where regulatory changes and the 
introduction of a special telecommunications tax led to lower 
revenues.
Enterprise, data and other revenue at US$183 million was down 7% 
on last year due principally to a lower level of cable capacity sales in 
the period. 
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained stable.
Operating costs were 5% down compared to the prior year at 
US$578 million. Across the Caribbean business we have embarked 
on targeted cost reduction programmes to improve efficiency and 
build a sustainable operating base. During this year our headcount 
has reduced by 12% to 3,421 and we have further outsourced our 
field force technician services in Jamaica. Much of the improvement 
has come from our Bahamas business which has seen a full year’s 
benefit from the restructuring we undertook following acquisition 
of the company in 2011.
EBITDA for the Caribbean was US$274 million representing a 4% 
reduction from the prior year. 
Our proportionate ownership of Caribbean EBITDA for the year 
ended 31 March 2013 was 72%.

1  At constant currency.
Revenue at US$236 million was 5% lower than the prior year on a 
constant currency basis driven primarily by a reduction in transit 
traffic volumes. Despite the introduction of competition, our mobile 
customer base grew by 9% as we launched new tariffs and focused 
on non-voice revenue. This more than offset declining voice revenue 
and resulted in overall mobile revenue growth of 3% at constant 
currency. Subscriber growth led to a 7% increase in broadband & TV 
revenue on a constant currency basis.
Gross margin at US$139 million was 2% higher than the prior year on 
a constant currency basis as improved mobile gross margin, driven 
by lower outpayments, offset lower total revenue.
Operating costs of US$64 million were 22% lower at constant 
currency primarily due to the disposal of Afinis in August 2012.
EBITDA at US$75 million was 39% higher than the prior year at 
constant currency and 27% higher on a reported basis reflecting 
lower operating costs.
Exceptional restructuring costs
Net exceptional items (excluding impairments) of US$50 million 
related to redundancy and restructuring programmes in the 
Caribbean. The prior year charge of US$66 million was primarily in 
respect of restructuring activities in The Bahamas and Panama.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment
Depreciation and amortisation at US$275 million remained in line 
with the pre-exceptional charge in the prior year.
We recognised a non-cash impairment charge of US$86 million in 
the year ended 31 March 2013. This was mainly due to the difficult 
macro environment in the Eastern Caribbean indicated in our Q3 
results. The prior year charge consisted of a non-cash impairment 
and accelerated depreciation charge of US$244 million primarily due 
to poor financial performance in Jamaica.
Net other operating income/(expense)
The US$4 million net other operating income received in the year 
comprised a foreign exchange translation gain of US$8 million 
related to UK pension schemes partially offset by US$4 million 
of hurricane related costs in the Caribbean. 28 Cable & Wireless Communications
Financial review  
continued
Joint ventures and associates
Our share of profit after tax from joint ventures was US$10 million, 
US$16 million lower than the same period last year primarily due 
to customer migration costs in TSTT following the introduction of 
a 4G/HSPA+ high speed mobile data network and the impact of 
increased competition on Roshan.
Net finance expense
The US$141 million net finance expense for the Group included 
finance income of US$11 million (US$10 million in 2011/12) and 
finance expense of US$152 million (US$158 million in 2011/12). 
The reduction in finance expense compared to the prior period 
mainly reflected the absence of the non-cash Monaco put option 
interest partially offset by foreign exchange losses.
(Loss)/gain on termination of operations
The US$16 million charge reflected the loss on the disposal of Afinis. 
In the prior year, the income of US$13 million was in respect of gains 
on disposals.
Income tax expense
The income tax charge for the continuing Group of US$41 million 
(US$49 million in 2011/12) was in respect of overseas taxes. This 
charge represented an effective tax rate of 36% pre-exceptional 
items. Removing the impact of non-deductible interest charged on 
the Group’s central borrowing facilities this charge represented an 
effective tax rate of 24% pre-exceptional items.
We expect the Group effective tax rate in 2013/14, pre-exceptional 
items and excluding non-deductible interest charged on the Group’s 
central borrowing facilities, to be around 25%.
Discontinued operations
Our Islands businesses comprising operations in the Maldives, the 
Seychelles, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic and 
Diego Garcia had a good year with revenue and gross margin up 1% 
compared to the prior year driven by strong mobile and broadband & 
TV growth.
Macau achieved another record year of EBITDA performance driven 
by increased mobile data usage where revenue was up 43% on the 
prior year and higher mobile roaming revenue.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was US$263 million, excluding cable assets 
transferred from inventory, 16% lower than last year and 
representing 14% of revenue. Including discontinued operations, 
Group capital expenditure was US$347 million and in line with 
guidance.
Our principal customer facing investments continued to be in  
4G/HSPA+ mobile data networks supporting smartphone sales in 
Panama, The Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, St. Lucia 
and Cayman, selective pay TV investments, and improvements to 
our fixed broadband network. These fixed broadband investments 
have included continuing our fibre roll outs in the Caribbean and 
completing a Next Generation Network in The Bahamas. We have 
also pursued strategic investments in transmission capacity and 
cable systems to support both retail and carrier sales. Finally, 
we continue to advance our billing and customer relationship 
management systems.
We have now completed our second year of investment in The 
Bahamas having invested around US$100 million in capital 
projects during that period. We continue to focus on providing an 
improved service to our customers and preparing for future market 
competition. Annual report 2012/13 29

(US$17 million in 2011/12) has been reallocated to dividends paid to non-controlling

The Group generated operating cash flow before exceptional items 
of US$326 million for the year ended 31 March 2013, 18% higher 
than the prior year as capital expenditure reduced following previous 
heavy investments in mobile data networks within key markets. 
There was a net outflow in working capital and provisions whilst 
investment income of US$23 million included proceeds from the sale 
of investments, interest received on cash balances and dividends 
received from joint ventures.
Fixed charges
We paid US$74 million relating to underlying income tax in 
2012/13, US$4 million higher than the prior year. Interest of 
US$129 million was paid on our external borrowings. We paid 
dividends to non-controlling interests of US$106 million in the 
period, which was US$13 million higher than the prior year due 
to increased distributions from Monaco prior to closing of the 
Islands transaction.
Underlying equity free cash flow of US$141 million, or US5.6 cents 
per share, was up 11% relative to the prior year driven by reduced 
capital expenditure. On the current dividend of US4 cents per share 
this represented underlying cash dividend cover of 1.4 times.
Non-recurring items and exceptionals
The net cash outflow included US$26 million for exceptional 
items related to redundancy and restructuring programmes in 
the Caribbean. We also incurred additional borrowing costs of 
US$27 million due to the timing of refinancing our 2012 sterling 
unsecured bond. A tax legislation change during 2012/13 in Panama 
led to the timing of payments being brought forward and as a result 
there were US$37 million of additional cash tax payments in the year. 30 Cable & Wireless Communications

During the year the sterling unsecured bonds repayable in August

the US$600 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit 
facility has a margin of 2.50% over LIBOR and a maturity date of 
October 2016. As at 31 March 2013, US$360 million of this facility 
was drawn. Following closing of the Islands transaction on 3 April 
2013, all outstanding drawings on the revolving credit facility and 
US$25 million of other borrowings were repaid.
Pro forma net debt as at 31 March 2013 after receipt of the disposal 
proceeds for the Islands (including the Seychelles) and Macau 
businesses was US$140 million. This figure includes an adjustment 
for net cash attributable to minority interests in the disposed 
businesses.
Pensions
As at 31 March 2013, the defined benefit section of the  
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (CWSF) had an IAS 19 
deficit of £86 million, compared to a deficit of £81 million as at 
31 March 2012.
Cash contributions have been agreed with the Trustees in order to 
eliminate the actuarial deficit, however these payments are subject 
to the outcome of the actuarial valuation as at March 2013. This 
future deficit funding constitutes a minimum funding agreement 
and, in accordance with accounting standards, we are required to 
account for this within our IAS 19 deficit. The IAS 19 deficit recorded 
at 31 March 2013 represents the present value of the maximum 
amount committed under the minimum funding agreement.
The increase in the deficit in the year is mainly due to a fall in the 
corporate bond rate used to discount liabilities. The AA corporate 
bond rate used in calculating the pension deficit was 4.5% compared 
with 4.9% at 31 March 2012.
The fund assets at 31 March 2013 were approximately invested 
73% in the bulk annuity policy, 18% in equities, and 9% in bonds, 
property, swaps and cash.
There are other unfunded pension liabilities in the UK of £30 million 
(£26 million at 31 March 2012). The Group holds investments 
in gilts of £24 million to partially back the UK unfunded pension 
liabilities. Other schemes in Cable & Wireless Communications have 
a net IAS 19 surplus of US$19 million (US$30 million surplus at 
31 March 2012).
Dividend
For the financial year 2012/13 the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of US2.67 cents per share. This represents two-thirds of 
our previously announced intention to pay a full year dividend of 
US4 cents per share.
The Board is targeting progressive dividend growth that reflects the 
underlying cash generation and growth outlook of the business. Annual report 2012/13 31
Principal risks and uncertainties 
We recognise that there are risks in operating our 
businesses, influenced by both internal and external 
factors, some of which are outside our control. The Group 
has a risk management framework which our business 
units and headquarters utilise to review their risks. 
We set out a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that could have a materially adverse effect on the Group and how 
they are managed. However, there may be other risks that are 
currently unknown or regarded as immaterial which could turn 
out to be material. We update the Group risk register on a rolling 
12 month basis and since the last year end a number of risks have 
been removed as they are no longer considered to be material to 
the Group overall. 
Investors should consider these risks along with other 
information provided in this Annual report.
Risk and impact Mitigation
Business change
Business change strategies fail to be executed quickly enough 
or fail to achieve the anticipated efficiency and cost savings. In 
particular, the Group’s strategic focus is on the Central America 
and Caribbean region and we have begun to develop a unified 
business structure and revised operating model to better exploit 
opportunities available and realise synergies. If such business 
change programmes do not achieve their objectives this could 
affect the Group’s profitability and cash flow
 ▶ Regular reviews are held by Group senior management to 
monitor project status, risks and mitigating actions
 ▶ We employ high calibre individuals with proven experience 
and expertise of working on business turnaround/change 
projects
Investment 
Following the disposal of the majority of the Islands and Macau 
businesses the Group’s strategy is to focus investment in the 
Caribbean and Central American region where we have a 
critical mass of operations and the ability to realise operational 
efficiencies. There is a risk that investments, acquisitions and 
partnership arrangements are not successful or that suitable 
investment opportunities are not available in the region. This 
could adversely affect the Group’s return on investment and 
ultimately shareholder returns 
 ▶ We undertake detailed due diligence, employ experienced and 
knowledgeable individuals, obtain external specialist advice 
and ensure thorough debate at Board level
 ▶ Integration plans are considered as part of our due diligence 
to ensure any new acquisitions can be successfully integrated 
into our Group
 ▶ We set rigorous investment hurdles internally against which 
we measure potential opportunities
 ▶ Group Board approval is required for material transactions
Business development 
The development of mobile data, pay TV and value added services 
together with other sources of revenue growth fail to perform 
as anticipated. The Group therefore fails to mobilise into new 
business lines in sufficient time to offset the structural decline in 
traditional voice revenues being experienced across the telecoms 
industry. Failure to achieve profitable revenue growth may lead 
to a decline in revenue and a reduction in future profitability and 
cash flow 
 ▶ We ensure focused attention on marketing and product 
development activities and encourage cross-regional 
leveraging
 ▶ We engage with experts to look at external product 
developments
 ▶ We focus closely on the pricing of new services to ensure the 
Group achieves the required return
 ▶ Post-implementation reviews of business cases are conducted 
as part of business unit performance reviews 32 Cable & Wireless Communications
Risk and impact Mitigation
Competitive activity 
Competitor activity and new market entrants could, through 
a combination of aggressive pricing and promotional activity, 
reduce our market share and margins. As a consequence of 
disposals, the Group is also more concentrated in terms of 
geographical spread and therefore may be more restricted in its 
ability to compete effectively in the event of further consolidation 
and new market entrants. Failure by the Group to compete 
effectively could have a significant adverse effect on revenues, 
profitability and cash flow
 ▶ We undertake continued investment in our networks to 
improve our customer experience, for example we are focusing 
on selective investments in high speed networks in a number 
of territories 
 ▶ We engineer our customer propositions based on our strengths 
relative to our competitors
 ▶ There is focus on our retention activity and loyalty programmes 
and how to enhance our customer relationship management 
capabilities 
Economic conditions
The effect of an economic downturn may adversely affect our 
operations and trading. The challenging economic environment 
in some of our major territories and the importance of overseas 
tourism to the economies of some countries could continue to 
suppress government and consumer spending impacting our 
profitability and cash flow
 ▶ We continue to monitor key recession indicators and remain 
prepared to take action to address any ongoing impact of the 
downturn
 ▶ We continuously seek to improve efficiency and reduce costs in 
order to best meet customer price expectations 
Regulatory risk
We need to comply with a large range of regulations and licence 
terms which govern our operations across the multiple legal 
jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the regulatory 
environment could impact the granting and renewal of licences, 
spectrum and operating agreements or significant terms 
attached to them. We are also impacted by key regulatory 
decisions relating to pricing such as the determination of 
termination rates. Failure to comply with regulations or adverse 
regulatory decisions could impact the value of our investments, 
limit the Group’s financial returns or restrict the ability to 
operate or provide new services to our customers 
 ▶ We actively liaise with regulators to encourage a positive 
working relationship based upon open dialogue 
 ▶ We continuously monitor developments in the regulatory 
environment for all our businesses. Regular reports are made 
to the executive team on regulatory risks 
 ▶ We employ local colleagues in each country who are 
experienced in local laws and regulations
Political risk
A change in the political environment could lead to changes in 
law, government policy or attitudes towards foreign investment. 
This could have an adverse impact on our business operations, 
investment decisions and profitability
 ▶ We monitor political developments in both existing and 
potential markets closely 
 ▶ We actively liaise with governments and opposition parties 
to encourage a positive working relationship with open 
communication at senior levels
 ▶ We aim to contribute positively to the social and economic 
development of the communities where we operate
Principal risks and uncertainties continued Annual report 2012/13 33
Risk and impact Mitigation
Service disruption
Our networks form part of a country’s critical national 
infrastructure and therefore we are relied upon on a daily basis to 
deliver a high quality, resilient service. Disruption to our network 
and IT systems from events such as hurricanes and other natural 
disasters, fire, security breaches, system failures or human 
error could damage our reputation and also result in a loss of 
customers or financial claims
 ▶ All our businesses have business continuity policies and major 
incident management plans in place which we continue to 
review to ensure that they remain up to date
 ▶ We also have insurance cover and employ network resilience to 
mitigate the effects of these risks
 ▶ We plan network upgrades and have a programme of ongoing 
maintenance 
Network and data security 
We carry and store large volumes of confidential personal and 
corporate voice traffic and data. Unauthorised access to sensitive 
data by third parties or employees could have an adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, its reputation and expose us to litigation
 ▶ The Group has information security procedures and controls in 
place which are regularly reviewed
 ▶ Remedial action plans are implemented where necessary
 ▶ We conduct third party data security reviews as required
People 
Our people are one of our most important assets and problems 
recruiting and retaining skilled colleagues could harm our 
business. We also face the risk of disruption and lost productivity 
in the event of industrial action 
 ▶ Incentive, succession and retention plans are in place to limit 
the risk of losing key employees
 ▶ We actively engage with unions and undertake colleague 
engagement surveys to keep abreast of and monitor any 
employee issues
 ▶ We have business continuity plans in place to deal with 
industrial action 
Technology 
New technology developments may render our existing products, 
services and supporting infrastructure obsolete or non-
competitive. As a result this may require the Group to increase its 
rate and level of investment in new technologies which affect cash 
flow and profit. Concerns are occasionally expressed that mobile 
phones and transmitters may pose long term health risks which, if 
proven, may result in the Group being exposed to litigation
 ▶ New technology developments are under constant review and 
new technologies are introduced when appropriate
 ▶ We continue to keep abreast of the latest research on the 
potential health risks of mobile phones and transmitters
Joint ventures 
We have a number of operations where we do not have 
management control. Our ability to manage the performance of 
these operations is therefore more limited which could impact 
the value of our investments
 ▶ We endeavour to have some operational involvement and we 
engage with local management in line with the applicable 
shareholder agreements
 ▶ We have regular interaction with our local joint venture 
partners 
Pensions 
The Group has significant pension scheme obligations. The value 
of the Group’s pension schemes’ assets and liabilities may be 
adversely affected by a decline in investment returns, longer 
life expectancy and regulations. An increase in pension deficits 
may necessitate additional contributions to the schemes with an 
adverse impact on future cash resources 
 ▶ We have previously undertaken actions to de-risk our exposure 
through the purchase of insurance policies for certain scheme 
liabilities in the UK and Jamaica
 ▶ We continue to examine additional strategies to further 
mitigate the risk of increased deficits
 ▶ The Company maintains regular dialogue with the pension 
Trustees who manage the scheme’s assets with appropriate 
external advice along with independent advisers Our customers are 
embracing mobile data 
across the Caribbean

Directors’ and corporate governance report
 “ Good corporate governance is critical  
to ensuring our long-term success. ”
Sir Richard Lapthorne, cbe
Chairman 
Dear Shareholder
Cable & Wireless Communications has complied 
in full with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the year. 
Corporate governance is about delegating safely and 
it is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that 
the Group is governed properly and responsibly. 
By its very nature effective corporate governance is 
fundamental to the Board’s duty to maintain control 
and line of sight across a geographically dispersed 
Group such as Cable & Wireless Communications.
This year has been an active year for the Board. The 
disposals of the Islands and Macau business units 
required an increased time commitment for the 
Board of Directors during the year to ensure that 
there was sufficient time for robust and challenging 
debate in relation to the disposals and also to ensure 
that the balance of time for Board discussions focused 
on strategy, the review of financial and operational 
performance and oversight of internal controls to 
ensure the right checks and balances remained in 
place during a period of transformational change.
Alison Platt, Managing Director at Bupa responsible 
for International Development Markets, joined the 
Board in June 2012. Alison brings skills, knowledge 
and experience gained from her executive career 
across international markets.
This section describes the way that corporate 
governance works in Cable & Wireless 
Communications. Our governance focuses not only 
on the boardroom but right across the business. We 
believe that good governance supports long-term 
performance.
Our commitment to ethical business behaviour is 
long-standing and starts at the top of the organisation 
and we believe that our success has been built on 
an honest and transparent approach. A values-led 
culture, high behavioural standards and robust 
procedures are fundamental to a strong corporate 
governance framework. We have updated our Code 
of Conduct during the year which sits alongside our 
Anti-Bribery policy and procedures which were 
strengthened in 2011. We have a comprehensive 
internal programme which ensures that everyone 
who is part of our Group understands our approach 
and values via a communications and training 
programme.
Sir Richard Lapthorne, cbe 
Chairman

Alison Platt was appointed to the Board as a Non-executive 
Director with effect from 1 June 2012, and Mary Francis retired 
as a Non-executive Director with effect from the end of her term 
on 30 June 2012.
The Board meets regularly and there were nine meetings during 
the year, including an annual strategy meeting. One Board meeting 
took place in a regional business unit location. Such visits provide 
an insight into the business unit operations, the local teams and the 
culture and environment in which they operate.
There are a number of informal meetings held throughout the year 
and as part of the annual corporate governance programme the 
Independent Directors meet once a year to discuss any relevant 
governance matters. They also met twice with the Chairman 
present and once with the Chairman and Chief Executive present. 
This balance of formal and informal meetings throughout the year 
creates an environment that encourages challenge, the sharing of 
information, innovative thinking and open communication.
The Chairman is responsible for the overall operation and 
governance of the Board. The Chairman provides the leadership 
of the Board to ensure that the Board satisfies its duties and 
responsibilities. The Chairman sets the agenda for the Board, 
ensuring that the Board receives clear, timely and accurate 
information. The Chairman is also responsible for facilitating the 
contribution of the Directors.
The Chairman, together with the Senior Independent Director, is 
also responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains effective 
communication with shareholders and other stakeholders.
The commitment of the Chairman as a Non-executive Director 
of Sherritt International, a company listed on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange, as Chairman of the PwC Public Interest Body and as 
Chairman of the Foresight Group on UK Manufacturing are noted on 
page 37, and the Board considers that these appointments are not a 
constraint on his agreed time commitment to the Company. 
The Chief Executive has responsibility for developing the strategy 
for recommendation to the Board. He is also responsible for the 
leadership of the business and managing it within the authorities 
delegated by the Board. 
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the Group’s corporate governance 
system and is committed to maintaining high governance standards. 
In order to progress the objectives of the Group the Board meets 
on a regular basis and is responsible for organising and directing the 
Company and the Group in a manner that promotes the success of 
the Company and is consistent with good corporate governance 
practice. To enable the Board to function effectively, full and timely 
access is given to all relevant information. 
The key policies and practices of the Company and the Group are set 
out in this report as well as in the reports of the Audit Committee 
on pages 48 to 50 and the Remuneration Committee on pages 51 
to 66. Furthermore, our independent Non-executive Directors have 
prepared a report describing corporate governance and behaviours 
of the Board on page 47 and details of significant shareholdings and 
rights, obligations, powers and procedures under the Company’s 
Articles of Association are set out in the statutory information 
on pages 42 to 46. Together, these reports provide shareholders 
with an insight into how our Board and senior management seek 
to manage the business to create and deliver long-term success 
for the Group. 
Formal minutes recording decisions of all Board and Committee 
meetings are prepared and circulated to each Director as 
appropriate. If a Director objects to a particular proposal, this is 
recorded in the minutes of the relevant meeting. During the period 
under review there were no such objections.  40 Cable & Wireless Communications
Directors’ and corporate 
governance report continued
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and four Non-executive Directors. The Board considers 
all the Company’s Non-executive Directors to be independent in 
character and judgement. Collectively the Non-executive Directors 
contribute to an effective Board with a strong mix of skills and 
business experience, including recent financial, strategic, operations 
and retail experience, gained in a variety of geographic areas. As 
they all occupy or have occupied senior positions each contributes 
significant weight to Board decisions.
The Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three year 
term with an expectation that they will continue for a further three 
year term.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-executive 
Directors, which sets out the time commitment expected of them, 
and service contracts for Executive Directors, are available for 
inspection by shareholders at our registered office during normal 
business hours and at our Annual General Meeting (AGM).
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary as well as appropriate training and briefings on matters 
including corporate social responsibility, ethics, health & safety 
and governance matters. Additionally, any Director may take 
independent professional advice on any matter at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties.
The Senior Independent Director
Simon Ball is the Senior Independent Director of the Company. The 
Senior Independent Director is available to meet shareholders on 
request and is the designated point of contact for shareholders to 
raise any concerns where contact through the normal channels of 
the Chairman or Executive Directors is inappropriate. Matters raised 
by major shareholders to any Director are brought to the attention 
of the Board.
As part of our commitment to regular dialogue, meetings have 
been held between the Executive Directors and investors on an 
ongoing basis throughout the year. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director have offered ongoing dialogue and meetings 
with shareholders to discuss any issues they wish to raise, and held 
meetings where appropriate or requested. The Company intends to 
continue this practice.
Internal control, risk management and financial reporting
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness on a continual basis. The Group’s 
system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The concept of reasonable assurance 
recognises that the cost of control procedures should not exceed 
the expected benefits.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board which 
includes:
 —Strategy and management: 
Approval of long-term objectives and strategy, extension of 
Group activities into new business or geographic areas, any 
decision to cease to operate any material part of the Group’s 
business, review of Group performance and the approval of 
annual budget
 —Corporate governance: 
Annual formal reviews of its own performance, a review of Group 
corporate governance arrangements, receiving reports on the 
views of shareholders and determining the independence of 
Non-executive Directors
 —Financial reporting and controls: 
Approval of announcements of interim and final results, annual 
report and accounts, approval of dividend policy and approval of 
significant changes in accounting policies and practices
 —Board membership and other appointments: 
Changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board, 
membership and chairmanship of Board Committees, ensuring 
adequate succession planning, appointment of the Senior 
Independent Director and the appointment or removal of the 
Company Secretary
 —Remuneration: 
Determining the remuneration policy for the Directors and other 
senior executives and the introduction of new share incentive 
plans or major changes to existing plans to be put to shareholders 
for approval
 —Delegation of authority: 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive and receiving reports from Board Committees on 
their activities
 —Contracts/expenditure: 
Approval of all significant contracts and expenditure and all 
investments or disposals in shares in which the Group holds an 
interest
 —Internal controls: 
Receiving reports on and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk and control processes to support its strategy and 
objectives and assessing these annually. 
Other specific responsibilities are delegated to the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees, each with clearly defined terms 
of reference. Each Committee reviews their terms of reference 
annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and effective.
Full details on matters reserved to the Board and the terms 
of reference of its Committees can be found on our website  
at www.cwc.com. Annual report 2012/13 41
The Group operates a risk management process under which 
the regional businesses identify the key risks to their plans, their 
likelihood and impact and the actions being taken to manage those 
risks and the effectiveness of steps taken to mitigate them. The risk 
register is presented to the Audit Committee on a rolling 12 month 
basis. The principal risks identified by the Group are set out on pages 
31 to 33.
The Executive Directors report to the Board, on behalf of 
management, significant changes in the Group’s businesses and the 
external environment in which it operates. In addition, they provide 
the Board with monthly financial information, which includes key risk 
and performance indicators. The Group’s key internal control and 
monitoring procedures include the following:
 —Financial reporting: each year, an annual budget is agreed and 
approved by the Board. At each Board meeting, actual results are 
reviewed and reported against budget and, when appropriate, 
revised forecasts
 —Investment appraisal: the Group has clearly defined policies for 
capital expenditure. These include annual budgets, detailed 
appraisal processes and post-implementation reviews for such 
expenditure
 —Monitoring systems: internal controls are monitored through a 
programme of internal audits. The Internal Audit function reports 
to the Audit Committee on its examination and evaluation of the 
effectiveness and adequacy of systems of internal control
 —Financial and non–financial controls: the Group has dedicated 
resource to embed processes and controls across the businesses. 
It operates a number of self-assessment exercises, which include 
monthly and quarterly processes to certify compliance with key 
financial and non-financial controls via the Business Assurance 
Checklist (BAC). The BAC requires management to assess and 
certify the effectiveness of its fundamental controls over all 
aspects of its operations. The results of this exercise are utilised 
by Internal Audit in planning its work for the forthcoming year
 —Whistle blowing: the Group operates an Ethics Helpline which is 
administered by an independent third party and is available to all 
employees
 —In addition to the regular updates and reports during the year, the 
Board was also updated on cyber-security threats and the 
controls in place to protect against them.
Effectiveness of internal control
The Board reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control 
systems in operation during the financial year in accordance with the 
revised Turnbull guidance. The processes as set out above have been 
in place for the year under review and up to the date of this Annual 
report. Where appropriate, necessary action has been or is being 
taken to remedy any failings and weaknesses identified as significant 
during this review.
The responsibility for internal control procedures within our joint 
ventures rests with the senior management of those operations. 
We monitor our investments and exert our influence through board 
representation where possible.
Induction and professional development
On appointment, the induction of new Board members is undertaken 
by the Company Secretary at the request of the Chairman, who 
retains responsibility for the induction process. The induction 
includes the provision of information about the Company, details of 
procedures, governance issues and Directors’ responsibilities. The 
programme also includes meetings with senior management and 
key advisers, with meetings with major shareholders arranged on 
request.
The ongoing training and development programme for the Directors 
includes:
 —Regular visits to the overseas business units to meet the local 
teams. During the year, this included a Board visit to the 
Caribbean enabling enhanced knowledge of the business 
operations and to meet local external stakeholders
 —The Board also received presentations from an external provider 
on the economics, political environment, challenges and 
opportunities of the Central American telecommunications 
markets
 —Technology briefing papers to enhance understanding of the 
Group’s products and services which, during the year, included a 
briefing on customer relationship management and billing systems 
and processes
 —Governance updates from external advisers or via the Company 
Secretary’s report
 —Additional presentations to provide an external stakeholder or 
market perspective which, during the year, included a 
presentation to the Board regarding governance from an 
institutional shareholder’s perspective
In addition, individual training requirements are agreed and arranged 
with Directors as required.

The Nomination Committee (the Committee) was chaired by 
Sir Richard Lapthorne throughout the year. Alison Platt became a 
member of the Committee upon her appointment to the Board as a 
Non-executive Director on 1 June 2012, and Mary Francis retired 
with effect from 30 June 2012. All members of the Committee,

Directors’ and corporate 
governance report continued
In accordance with the terms of reference, the Committee has 
reviewed succession planning requirements and the need to ensure 
planned and progressive refreshing of the Board as and when 
required. 
Meetings
The Nomination Committee met on one occasion in the period 
1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. 
During the period under review, the Committee considered and 
recommended to the Board the appointment of Alison Platt as a 
Non-executive Director, and as a member of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. Alison Platt, as a Managing Director 
at Bupa responsible for driving retail growth in international markets, 
was identified as a candidate who would complement the existing 
balance of skills and knowledge of the Board, with sufficient time 
to dedicate to the role. JCA Group, an independent boardroom 
consultancy firm, was appointed to undertake the search and was 
briefed with the criteria required for the role, including consideration 
for gender diversity. The suitability of her knowledge and skills was 
independently verified by JCA Group.
In addition, in May 2013 the Committee considered and 
recommended the re-appointment of Non-executive Director 
Simon Ball for a further one year period. Simon Ball has been on the 
Board of the Company since demerger in March 2010, and prior 
to this served as a Non-executive Director of Cable and Wireless 
plc from 1 May 2006. The re-appointment of Simon Ball was 
considered in the light of the Code requirements for his continued 
independence and the need to ensure progressive refreshing of the 
Board. The Committee reviewed his contribution over the previous 
year and considered that his skills and breadth of experience would 
be valuable in retaining a well-balanced Board. 
The Board remains supportive of Lord Davies’ recommendations. 
The Board understands the importance of diversity and recognises 
the importance of women having greater representation in senior 
roles. The search for Board candidates will continue to be conducted, 
and appointments made, with due regard to the benefits of diversity 
on the Board and where appropriate specialist search consultants 
engaged to assist in the search for suitable candidates. However, all 
appointments to the Board are ultimately based on merit, measured 
against objective criteria, and the skills and experience the individual 
can bring to the Board taking into account a number of factors 
including the existing size of the Board, the balance of Executive and 
Non-executive Directors as well as the existing skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity already represented and the likely future 
requirements.
The composition of the Board, including the balance of skills, 
independence, knowledge and diversity on the Board is reviewed 
annually as part of the Board evaluation process.
Performance evaluation
In accordance with the Code, an external evaluation of the Board 
takes place at least every three years. The last external evaluation 
was undertaken in 2011 by Independent Audit Limited, which 
evaluated the performance of the Board as a whole. Independent 
Audit Limited has no other connection with the Company or Group. 
An internal Board evaluation was conducted in 2012 using a 
structured questionnaire, which covered the operations of the Board 
and its principal Committees. Questionnaires were also issued, in the 
case of each of the Board Committees, to those participants who 
regularly attend these meetings.
The report on the findings of the review was discussed by the 
Board at its meeting in June 2012. The evaluation concluded that 
the Board and its Committees operate effectively. A number of 
recommendations were made following the review and the key 
themes included further consideration of the size of the Board in 
light of the strategic direction of the Group and augmenting the 
Board’s induction and training programme, with an increased focus 
on matters specific to the telecommunications industry. The Non-
executive Directors also appraised the Chairman’s performance 
and carefully reviewed the relationship between the Chairman and 
the Executive Directors to ensure that the Board structure and 
relationships continue to promote the long-term success of the 
Group.
The Board evaluation for 2013 will also be conducted using a 
structured questionnaire covering the operation of both the Board 
and its principal Committees and the results and recommendations 
will subsequently be discussed by the Board.
Other statutory information
Principal activities, business review and results
The Group’s principal activities are detailed on pages 2 and 3. 
Through this Annual report, including the Chairman’s review and 
the Business review sections (pages 1 to 33) that precede this 
report and this corporate governance section (pages 38 to 67), 
the Board seeks to present a balanced and clear assessment of the 
Group’s activities, position and prospects. Each of those sections 
is incorporated by reference into the Directors’ report, which is 
comprised of those sections, the information set out below and the 
other information which is incorporated by reference. The Group’s 
results for the financial year are shown in the consolidated income 
statement on page 71. 
Directors
The names and biographical details of the Directors are set out on 
page 37.
In compliance with the Code which specifies that all directors 
of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election by 
shareholders, all Directors will stand for re-election at the 2013 
AGM.
The interests of the Directors and their connected persons in the 
shares of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc, along with details 
of their share awards, are contained in the Directors’ remuneration 
report set out on pages 51 to 66. Annual report 2012/13 43
No Director had a material interest in any significant contract 
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries during the year. For 
further information, refer to note 32 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Company has granted indemnities in favour of its Directors 
against personal financial exposure that they may incur in the course 
of their professional duties as Directors of the Company and/or any 
subsidiaries (as applicable). These indemnities are qualifying third-
party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the Companies Act 
2006 (the 2006 Act). They were granted on appointment of the 
Directors and are still in force. Officers of wholly owned subsidiary 
companies within the Group have also been granted indemnities.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of US2.67 cents per 
ordinary share payable on 9 August 2013 to ordinary shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 31 May 2013. This final 
dividend, together with the interim dividend of US1.33 cents per 
share paid by the Company on 11 January 2013, makes a total 
dividend payment to shareholders of the Company of US4 cents 
per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Share capital and treasury shares
The called-up share capital of the Company, together with details 
of shares allotted during the year, are shown in note 8 to the 
Company financial statements. At the 2012 AGM, the Company was 
authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 252 million of its own 
ordinary shares, representing approximately 10% of its issued share 
capital (excluding shares held in treasury) as at 11 June 2012. Under 
the authority granted by shareholders at the 2010 AGM to purchase 
up to 262 million of its own ordinary shares, on 23 February 2011 
the Company announced a share buyback programme up to a value 
of US$100 million in order to return capital to shareholders. During 
the period 1 April 2011 to 20 July 2011, the Company purchased 
94,726,873 shares with a nominal value of US$0.05 each for an 
aggregate consideration of US$66 million, and these are held as 
treasury shares. The total number of shares held in treasury as at 
31 March 2013 is 137,488,873. 
The Board intends to seek shareholder approval at the forthcoming 
AGM on 25 July 2013 to make market purchases of up to 10% of 
its issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury). Details of 
the proposed resolution are included in the Notice of Meeting. The 
Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority to 
purchase the Company’s ordinary shares but will keep the matter 
under review, taking into account other investment opportunities. 
The authority would only be exercised if and when, in the light 
of market conditions prevailing at the time, the Directors believe 
that the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests of 
shareholders generally.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Further details on the share capital of the Company are set out in 
note 8 to the Company financial statements on page 132 and are 
incorporated into this report by reference.

Ethics
The Company is committed to sound business conduct in its 
relationships with key stakeholders (shareholders, employees, 
customers, business partners and suppliers), governments and 
regulators, communities and the environment. 
During the year a review of the Group’s ethics policies was 
undertaken. A new Code of Conduct policy was approved by the 
Board which sits alongside the Group’s Anti-Bribery Policy and 
applies to all Group companies and employees. Where the Group 
operates in conjunction with business partners, third parties or 
in joint venture arrangements without management control, it 
aims to promote the application of these policies. Responsibility 
for the compliance with the policy remains with the Board and the 
regional Chief Executives are responsible for the communication, 
implementation and monitoring of their region.
The Group seeks to conduct its operations with honesty, integrity 
and openness, and with respect for the human rights and interests 
of our employees. The Group respects the legitimate interests of 
all those with whom it has relationships. The Group’s employees are 
required to complete an annual online training programme in relation 
to these policies. 
Charitable and political donations
During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group 
gave US$1.42 million (2011/12 – US$3 million) to 
charitable organisations including US$91,436 (£60,000) 
(2011/12 – US$144,312 (£90,000)) to the Porthcurno Trust, 
a charitable organisation in the United Kingdom. The Group 
actively supports corporate social responsibility in the communities 
in which it operates and more information on these activities is 
set out on pages 20 to 23.
The Company has no intention of making donations to what are 
generally regarded as political parties within the European Union. 
As a precautionary measure and in the light of the wide definitions 
of European Union political organisations for the purposes of the 
2006 Act, a resolution was passed at the 2010 AGM permitting 
the Company to make political donations and incur political 
expenditure. During the year, the Company did not exercise its 
authority granted to it at the 2010 AGM to make political donations 
within the European Union. In aggregate, the sum of US$91,126 
(US$233,167 – 2011/12) was made to non-EU political parties 
by non-EU subsidiary companies during the year.
Supplier payment policy
The Company did not enter into any purchase contracts with 
suppliers which required payment during the year to 31 March 
2013. It is the Group’s policy to agree appropriate terms and 
conditions in advance with suppliers and to make payment in 
accordance with those terms and conditions, provided the supplier 
has complied with them. 44 Cable & Wireless Communications
Directors’ and corporate 
governance report continued
Employee inclusion and diversity
The Group operates in many countries with diverse employment 
practices. Whilst respecting local circumstances, wherever we 
operate we follow the principles of equal opportunity in recruitment, 
development, remuneration and advancement. The Group’s 
employment policies also comply with local requirements and meet 
relevant standards on employment of disabled people. Full and 
fair consideration is given to disabled applicants for employment 
and training, and career development is encouraged on the basis 
of aptitude and ability. It is Group policy to retain employees who 
become disabled whilst in its service and to provide specialist 
training where appropriate.
Employee communication
The Group communicates with employees in many ways, including 
regular briefings by management, newsletters and intranet sites. 
These communications help to achieve a common awareness among 
employees of the financial and operational performance of the 
Group.
Exercise of rights of shares in employee share schemes
The Trustees of The Cable & Wireless Communications Share 
Ownership Trust (the Trust) exercise the voting rights on shares held 
in the employee trust in accordance with their fiduciary duties as 
Trustees, which include the duty to act in the best interests of the 
beneficiaries of the Trust.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11.00am on Thursday 25 July 2013 at the 
Grange Tower Bridge Hotel, 45 Prescot Street, London E1 8GP. 
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are given in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Auditor
Our auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, has instigated an orderly wind down 
of its business as a result of an internal reorganisation and KPMG 
LLP (an intermediate parent) is proposed as statutory auditor of 
the Company for the next financial year. Resolutions to appoint 
KPMG LLP as our external auditor in place of KPMG Audit Plc and 
to authorise the Directors to set the auditor’s remuneration will be 
proposed at the AGM.
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined in Section 418(3) of the 2006 Act) of which 
the auditors are unaware and the Directors have taken all reasonable 
steps to ascertain any relevant audit information and ensure the 
auditors are aware of such information.
Change of control
The Group has a number of contracts that are subject to change of 
control clauses. These primarily relate to financing facilities, bonds, 
licences and operating agreements.
Under the Group’s US$500 million and US$100 million revolving 
credit facility agreements, on a change of control the lenders are 
not obliged to fund any further sums and, if the majority lenders 
require, on not less than 10 days’ notice, the facility can be cancelled 
and all outstanding loans, together with related charges, become 
immediately due and payable.
Under the terms of the US$500 million 7.75% 2017 Senior Secured 
Notes and the US$400 million 8.75% 2020 Senior Secured Notes 
(the Bonds), if a change of control event occurs, each holder of the 
Bonds will have the right to require the repurchase of all or any part 
of their Bonds at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal 
amount of the Bonds purchased, together with accrued (but unpaid) 
interest.
A number of the Group’s operating licences and shareholders’ 
agreements include change of control clauses which may be 
triggered by the sale of all or a controlling stake in a business, or 
certain types of restructuring.
In the event of a change of control, these clauses may require 
consideration to determine their impact on the Group. At present, 
risks arising from a change of control are not considered to be 
significant. The Group will take appropriate action to mitigate any 
risks arising from these events should they occur. Change of control 
provisions in relation to Directors’ service contracts are explained in 
the Directors’ remuneration report on page 58.
Rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares
The following section summarises the rights and obligations in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) relating to the 
ordinary shares of the Company. The full Articles can be found on 
the Company’s website www.cwc.com.
Amendment of Articles: The Articles may be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders passed at a general meeting of the 
Company.
Voting: Each share (other than those held in treasury) allows the 
holder to have one vote at general meetings of the Company on 
votes taken on a poll. Proxy appointment and voting instructions 
must be received by the registrars at least 48 hours before the time 
appointed for the holding of a general meeting or 24 hours before 
a poll if not taken on the same day as the meeting (in each case 
subject to the Directors’ discretion to specify that the time periods 
exclude any part of a day that is not a working day). Annual report 2012/13 45
Dividends: The Company’s shareholders can declare dividends by 
passing an ordinary resolution, but the payment cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Directors. The Directors may also 
pay interim dividends without shareholder approval if they consider 
that the financial position of the Company justifies it. The Directors 
may operate dividend reinvestment plans or, subject to shareholder 
approval, operate scrip schemes or pay dividends by distributing 
assets. No dividend carries a right to interest from the Company. If 
dividends remain unclaimed for 12 years they are forfeited by the 
shareholder and revert to the Company.
Partly paid shares: The Company has a lien on all partly paid shares 
(and dividends), which has priority over claims of others to such 
shares covering any money owed to the Company for the shares. 
The Directors may sell all or any of such shares where: (i) the money 
owed by the shareholder is payable immediately; (ii) the Directors 
have given notice demanding payment, stating the amount due and 
that the shares will be sold on non-payment; and (iii) the money has 
not been paid within 14 clear days of the service of the notice.
The Directors may make calls on shareholders to pay any money 
which has not yet been paid to the Company for their shares. If a 
call is unpaid, the shareholder will be liable to pay interest and all 
expenses incurred by the Company as a result of non-payment if 
the call remains unpaid for 14 clear days after the date of a notice. 
In addition, failure to comply with any such notice may result in 
forfeiture of any share which is the subject of the notice, including 
any unpaid dividends.
The Directors may decline to register the transfer of any shares 
that are not fully paid, provided that such refusal does not prevent 
dealings from taking place on an open and proper basis.
Sanctions: Unless the Directors decide otherwise, a shareholder shall 
not be entitled to vote at any general meeting of the Company or at 
any separate general meeting of the holders of any class of shares in 
the Company or exercise any other right conferred by membership 
in relation to general meetings if the shareholder has not paid all 
amounts relating to those shares which are due at the time of the 
meeting, or if the shareholder is given a notice following a failure 
by that shareholder or someone who appears to be interested in 
the shares to comply with a notice under section 793 of the 2006 
Act. Further, if a shareholder holding 0.25% or more of the issued 
shares of a class (excluding treasury shares) or interested person is 
in default of a section 793 notice, the Directors may also state in the 
notice that: (i) the payment of any dividend shall be withheld; (ii) the 
shareholder shall not be entitled to elect to receive shares in place of 
dividends withheld; and (iii) the transfer of the shares held by such 
shareholder shall be restricted.
Certificated shares: The Company can sell any certificated shares at 
the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of the sale if: (i) in 
a period of 12 years at least three dividends have become payable 
and no dividends have been claimed; (ii) the Company has published 
a notice after the 12 year period stating that it intends to sell the 
shares; and (iii) during the 12 year period and for three months after 
the notice, the Company has not heard from the shareholder or any 
person entitled to sell the shares.
The Directors may decline registration of certificated shares if: (i) a 
share transfer form is used to transfer more than one class of shares; 
(ii) transfers are in favour of more than four joint holders; or (iii) the 
share transfer form is not delivered to the office, or such other place 
decided on by the Directors, accompanied by the share certificate 
relating to the shares being transferred (unless the transfer is by a 
person to whom the Company was not required to, and did not, send 
a certificate) and any other evidence reasonably asked for by the 
Directors to show entitlement to transfer the shares.
Uncertificated shares: The Directors may decline registration of 
uncertificated shares if the transfer is in favour of more than four 
joint holders or otherwise in accordance with the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
Interests in shares: Except where express rights are given, the 
Company will only recognise a current and absolute right to whole 
shares. The fact that any share, or any part of a share, may not be 
owned outright by the registered owner is not of any concern to the 
Company.
US Holders: The Directors may require a shareholder or other person 
appearing to be interested in shares, to disclose information relating 
to the ownership of such shares or to show that such shares are 
not held by a US Holder (defined in the Articles as being: (i) persons 
resident in the US who hold shares in the Company and (ii) persons 
who appear to the Directors to fall within sub-paragraph (i) of the 
definition of a US Holder). The Directors may require a US Holder to 
sell their shares to someone who is not a US Holder, failing which, the 
Company may effect a sale of such shares on the US Holder’s behalf.
Disputes: Any disputes between a shareholder and the Company 
and/or the Directors arising out of or in connection with the Articles 
shall be exclusively and finally resolved under the Rules of Arbitration 
of the International Chamber of Commerce, as amended from time 
to time, in accordance with the Articles.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors are 
contained in the Articles, including the rules for who is eligible to be 
elected as a Director and the procedure to be followed to nominate 
such persons. 
The Articles provide that Directors may be appointed by an ordinary 
resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, 
provided that, in the latter instance, a Director appointed in this 
way retires and stands for election at the first AGM following his 
appointment.
The Company’s members may remove a Director by passing an 
ordinary resolution for which special notice has been given. Any 
Director will automatically cease to be a Director if: (i) they resign; 
(ii) they offer to resign and the other Directors accept that offer; 
(iii) all the other Directors (being at least three) require it; (iv) they 
are suffering from mental ill health and the Directors require them 
to cease to be a Director; (v) they have missed Directors’ meetings 
for a continuous period of six months without permission and 
the other Directors resolve that they shall cease to be a Director; 
(vi) a bankruptcy order is made against them, or they make an 
arrangement or composition with their creditors; (vii) they are 
prohibited from being a Director by law; or (viii) they cease to be 
a Director under legislation or are removed from office under the 
Articles. 46 Cable & Wireless Communications

governance report continued
Powers of Directors
The powers of the Directors are determined by UK legislation and 
the Articles. As provided in the Articles, the Directors may exercise 
all the Company’s powers provided that the Articles or applicable 
legislation do not stipulate that any such powers must be exercised 
by the members. The Directors have been authorised to issue and 
allot ordinary shares, pursuant to Article 12. The powers under 
Article 12 are referred to shareholders at the AGM for renewal. 
Shareholders are also requested to renew the Directors’ power 
to make market purchases of shares at each AGM. Any shares 
purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles permit the Directors to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts. Procedures have been put in place for the disclosure by 
Directors of any such conflicts and also for the consideration and 
authorisation of these conflicts by the Board. These procedures 
allow for the imposition of limits or conditions by the Board when 
authorising any conflict, if they think this is appropriate.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business reviews on pages 1 to 33 including the 
Financial review on pages 24 to 30. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on pages 24 to 30. Further, notes 
24, 28 and 36 to the consolidated financial statements include the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit and 
liquidity risk.
The Directors believe that the Group’s geographic spread, robust 
monitoring and forecasting processes leave it well placed to 
manage its business risks in the current economic conditions. 
In addition, the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into 
account possible changes in trading performance which could be 
reasonably anticipated, indicate that the Group is able to operate 
within the level of its current available facilities. A formal process for 
monitoring compliance with debt covenants is also in place. Further 
information on debt can be found in note 22 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
After reviewing budgets and other longer-term plans and making 
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

  Annual report 2012/13 47
Independent  
Directors’ report
The strategic portfolio considerations leading up to the disposal 
of the Islands and Macau business units has required a different 
focus from the Board during the year. 
Additional time was added to the eight scheduled Board meetings 
and a further Board meeting was also held. Significant attention was 
given to the move from a diverse international portfolio of assets, 
to a focused, unified regional telecoms operator. The Board has 
discussed evolving strategy throughout the year with robust and 
challenging debate on the organic and inorganic opportunities in the 
pan-America region as well as the cultural and organisation demands 
of the move to a regional telecoms operator. External participants 
were invited to the strategy meeting in December to discuss the 
economic and political environment of the region which provided a 
valuable insight for the Independent Directors as well as a further 
basis for rigorous debate in subsequent discussions. 
During the year, it was important that despite the substantive focus 
on the changing business, close attention remained on delivering a 
strong operating performance. The annual meeting plan included 
a number of recurring items particularly in relation to financial and 
operational performance to inform a structured debate. In addition, 
a number of unstructured debates took place during the year 
covering a number of matters including strategy and remuneration. 
These discussions enabled the Board to freely discuss and challenge 
the Company’s behaviour and approach to such matters without the 
constraints of predetermined opinions.
In the past three years, at least two Board meetings a year have 
taken place in the regional business unit locations. These visits give 
the Independent Directors a valuable insight into the business unit 
operations, the local teams and the culture and environment within 
which they operate. The number of overseas visits was reduced 
in the year ended 31 March 2013 due to the time commitment 
required in relation to the disposal of the two business units. During 
the year, the Board visited the Cayman Islands and met with the 
Caribbean management team as well as external stakeholders 
including Government Ministers and enterprise customers.
As part of the annual corporate governance programme, the 
Independent Directors met separately during the year to discuss 
any relevant governance matters. They also met twice with the 
Chairman present and once with the Chairman and Chief Executive 
present. 
Alison Platt, Managing Director at Bupa responsible for International 
Development Markets joined the Board as an Independent Director 
in June 2012. Alison’s breadth of experience gained during her 
successful career at Bupa has augmented the Board’s focus on 
behavioural, organisational, market facing and cultural matters all 
of which are key considerations in this period of transformational 
change.
Turning now to the four questions posed annually as part of Cable 
& Wireless Communications’ approach to measuring effective 
corporate governance:
1. What is the quality of the relationship between the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors?
The Chairman and the Executive Directors have been working 
together as a team since 2008 and the relationship between them 
has remained strong. This provided a stable background to plan and 
execute two major corporate transactions and facilitate the decision 
to move towards a unified regional telecoms operator. 
There is a clear understanding of the roles of each of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive with the Chairman being responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and the Chief Executive being responsible 
for running the business. 
2. How open are the Executive Directors with the Board?
The Board receives detailed reports and presentations from the 
three Executive Directors in advance of Board meetings, as well 
as updates at the meetings. This is supplemented by unstructured 
debates on key strategic areas. There were also three informal 
meetings held during the course of the year.
The Board also meets with members of the London and Regional 
Senior Management teams who are invited to attend Board and 
Committee meetings to present and discuss a number of matters 
including remuneration, risk and operational performance enabling 
an open forum for discussion and debate.
3. What is the visibility of the checks and balances between the 
Executive Directors?
The visibility of checks and balances between the Executive 
Directors has remained high. This was particularly important for the 
execution of the disposal of the two business units as well as the 
preparation and approval of the two circulars which were sent to 
shareholders. 
The Executive Directors have openly shared and debated different 
perspectives in Board meetings enabling the Non-executive 
Directors to obtain a rounded view of the Executive Directors’ views. 
4. Have questions asked by the Independent Directors in Board 
and Committee meetings been appropriately addressed?
The Independent Directors are comfortable that questions have 
been answered in a considered and effective manner throughout 
the year ended 31 March 2013 and are satisfied that the corporate 
governance controls of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc are 
effective.
As we look ahead to the transformation process with the 
consequent strategic and executive challenges that will present 
to the Executive Directors and the Board, as a whole, it will be 
critical that the beneficial behavioural practices established are 
continuously applied. The Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
the Independent Directors need to pay particular attention to this 
aspect of Board management and behaviours in the period ahead.

Meetings
The Committee held four scheduled meetings during the year ended 
31 March 2013. Details of Committee membership and individual 
attendance at the meetings by members are given in the table on 
this page.
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, 
Head of Internal Audit and representatives from KPMG Audit Plc 
(KPMG), the Company’s external auditor, are also invited to attend all 
Committee meetings. In May and November when the full year and 
half year results are considered, the Chairman is also invited to attend.
The agenda for meetings is prepared by the Committee Chairman 
in conjunction with the Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial 
Controller and the external auditor. Each scheduled meeting 
commences with a private session, attended only by Committee 
members, the external auditor and Head of Internal Audit, to take 
soundings on matters to be discussed at the meeting or any other 
matters attendees wish to highlight. At each meeting the Committee 
then receives reports from the Chief Financial Officer, the external 
auditor and the Head of Internal Audit, together with biannual 
litigation reports.
Disclosure Committee
To assist the Committee with the above, responsibility for 
identifying and considering disclosure matters in connection with 
the preparation of all market releases containing material financial 
information has been delegated to a Disclosure Committee. This 
Committee comprises members of senior management from 
finance, legal, company secretarial and investor relations.
During the preparation of the Annual report, the Disclosure 
Committee obtains certifications from contributors prior to the 
document’s review by the Committee and approval by the Board.
Whistle blowing
The Company provides an Ethics Helpline which is administered by 
an independent third party and is available to all Group employees 
via a web-portal or by telephone. This provides a mechanism 
for employees to raise concerns where they either do not feel 
comfortable raising the matter with local management or they are 
not satisfied with the local management response. 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit is led by the Head of Internal Audit, supported 
by a team of in-house auditors based in the UK and Jamaica, 
supplemented by a third party to provide specific skills as required. 
The internal audit plan is approved by the Committee annually.  50 Cable & Wireless Communications
Audit Committee report  
continued
External audit
The Board has accepted the Committee’s recommendation that 
KPMG should be retained for 2013/14. This recommendation was 
based on a detailed review of the 2011/12 audit of the Company 
which demonstrated overall satisfaction with the performance 
of KPMG as external auditor. The review included a survey of 
Committee members and key personnel involved in the audit, 
discussions with KPMG, senior management and Internal Audit, 
as well as an analysis of KPMG’s capabilities and independence.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years. The audit 
engagement partner responsible for the 2012/13 audit will rotate 
following the completion of the Group’s 2013/14 audit cycle.
KPMG was appointed as auditor of the Company during the financial 
year 2009/10 and also acted as auditor of Cable and Wireless 
plc from 1991. There are no contractual obligations restricting 
the Company’s choice of external auditors. A revised version of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code was issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 which provides that FTSE 350 
companies should put the external audit contract out to tender at 
least every 10 years. The Committee will consider these provisions 
and developing guidance in relation to audit tendering and rotation 
in light of emerging practice during the course of the financial year 
ending 31 March 2014.
KPMG has instigated an orderly wind down of KPMG Audit Plc as a 
result of an internal reorganisation and requested that going forward 
the audit is instead undertaken by KPMG LLP (an intermediate parent 
of KPMG Audit Plc). KPMG Audit Plc will not therefore be seeking 
re-appointment as auditor of the Company and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing the appointment of 
KPMG LLP as our auditor will be put to the 2013 AGM.
The Committee has established a policy to maintain the 
independence of the external auditor and its personnel and to 
govern the provision of audit and non-audit services provided by 
the auditor and its associates. The policy clearly identifies permitted 
and prohibited services and sets out the procedure to be followed 
for the approval of all audit and non-audit services. All engagements 
with an expected fee in excess of US$400,000 require the prior 
approval of the Chairman of the Committee, and to be reported to 
the Committee.
For the year ended 31 March 2013 the Committee approved fees 
for audit services of US$4.3 million, together with fees for audit-
related regulatory reporting of US$0.8 million and non-audit work of 
US$1.2 million. The nature of the services provided is set out in note 
6e to the consolidated financial statements. There is no limitation 
of liability in the terms of appointment of KPMG as auditor to the 
Company.

Directors’ remuneration report 
 “This year our incentive arrangements take into 
account the changing shape of our portfolio” 
Simon Ball
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the Remuneration 
Committee’s report providing details of the remuneration of the 
Directors for the financial year 2012/13 and our policy for 2013/14.
As you may be aware, the UK Government’s Department for 
Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) has produced draft regulations 
reforming the way in which the remuneration of Directors is 
approved and reported upon. The new regulations expected to come 
into effect in October 2013 will impact the content and presentation 
of the Directors’ remuneration report. Accordingly, we have decided 
to adopt some of the draft regulations early, including the splitting 
of the report into two sections: a Policy report, setting out our 
policy for the year ahead, and an Implementation report, setting out 
how we implemented our policy over the year to 31 March 2013, 
which we hope will make the overall report more accessible for 
shareholders.
Remuneration policy for 2013/14
Over the past 12 months there have been significant changes within 
our organisation. We have divested of the Islands part of our Monaco 
& Islands business (specifically the Channel Islands, the Maldives, 
the Seychelles and South Atlantic territories) and are in the process 
of finalising the sale of our 51% shareholding in CTM, our Macau 
operation. These changes in our portfolio will allow us to create a 
more focused pan-America business around our existing Caribbean 
and Panamanian businesses and will enable us to explore potential 
acquisition opportunities in this region alongside organic growth 
initiatives. As a result, we are proposing some changes to how our 
bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) schemes are structured 
for 2013/14 to ensure that our incentive arrangements are aligned 
appropriately with the new organisational structure.
As we wish to incentivise our Executive Directors to focus on the 
continuing operations of the business, 70% of the bonus will remain 
subject to EBITDA and cash flow targets. The performance of 
Macau will be excluded from the bonus targets and will not count 
towards performance. In the event that Monaco Telecom is sold in 
the year, the outcome of the sale will form part of the consideration 
of bonus outcome. 30% of the bonus will be measured on specific 
personal objectives, with the focus based on measures relating to 
the portfolio reshaping.
Last year we made a number of changes to our LTIP arrangements, 
specifically a reduction in quantum of LTIP awards and a change in 
performance conditions from absolute Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) to a combination of relative TSR and Earnings Per Share (EPS). 
Since that review, in light of the significant organisational changes 
that have taken and will take place in the short to medium term, 
the Committee has agreed that for the 2013/14 LTIP awards, the 
use of relative TSR as a single metric is more appropriate given the 
difficulties in setting a robust and appropriate EPS range during a 
period of significant organisational change. There will be no change 
to the policy on overall quantum for the bonus and LTIP. 
No salary increases are being proposed for the Executive Directors 
and so fixed pay levels have been maintained at current levels.
Full details of our bonus and LTIP arrangements for the forthcoming 
year are described in the report.
Performance and reward for 2012/13
Bonuses for 2013 are paying out at the level of 56% of maximum 
opportunity for Tony Rice, and 61% of maximum opportunity for 
Tim Pennington and Nick Cooper. The bonus payments represent 
a combination of strong EBITDA performance for Macau and 
Monaco & Islands which has flowed through to robust Net Cash Flow 
before Financing (NCFbF) results, and solid performance against 
personal objectives. Further details on the bonus outturn is provided 
on page 61. 
No LTIP awards vested in the year to 31 March 2013, as the 
absolute TSR performance target was not achieved. In addition, the 
LTIP award with performance conditions measured over the three 
years to 3 June 2013 is forecast to also not reach the absolute TSR 
performance target.
A single resolution for the advisory approval of this report will be put 
to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 25 July 
2013. On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I hope that we can 
again rely on the continued support of our shareholders in 2013/14.

Policy report
Overview of our remuneration policy
The structure of remuneration for Executive Directors was initially 
adopted on demerger in March 2010. The Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee) recognised that the circumstances for managing 
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc were materially different from 
those affecting the former Cable and Wireless plc and over the last 
three years has significantly amended its policy to a more standard 
arrangement, while critically retaining linkage to the Company’s 
evolving strategy. 
Our policy
Overview
The overall aim is to establish remuneration structures which 
encourage, reinforce and reward the delivery of outstanding 
business performance. This is underpinned by the following guiding 
principles:
 —The risk and reward structure must maintain an overall alignment 
with the interests of shareholders
 —Executive Directors are encouraged to maintain a very significant 
personal investment in the shares of the Company
 —There is a strong focus on performance-related pay
 —Targets should be appropriately stretching and provide for median 
levels of reward for median performance against the targets, and 
median to top quartile rewards for exceptional performance
How do we do this?
 —By setting fixed pay levels by reference to mid-market 
comparators and recruitment/retention considerations, while 
retaining some flexibility to reflect executives’ experience and 
expertise
 —By carefully balancing the variable pay opportunities provided 
through our performance-related short and long term incentive 
plans such that executives are incentivised to maximise 
performance over both the short and longer term
 —By providing for a significant proportion of the package to 
be delivered and retained in shares and therefore subject to 
claw back
 —By requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a 
substantial holding of ordinary shares at upper decile level of 
market practice
 —By ensuring that all aspects of remuneration for the Executive 
Directors and selected senior employees are approved by the 
Committee and by reviewing the levels, structure and philosophy 
of remuneration on an annual basis
 —By taking account of the pay and employment conditions of other 
employees in the Group when determining the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration
 —By considering the impact of remuneration on the risk profile 
of the Company
What key changes have we made for 2013/14? 
Fixed pay
No salary increases are being proposed for the Executive Directors 
and so fixed pay levels have been maintained at current levels.
Annual bonus
70% will be based on financial targets and 30% on personal 
performance objectives.
The majority of the bonus will continue to be subject to financial 
targets based on Group EBITDA and Group NCFbF (apportioned two 
thirds EBITDA and one third NCFbF). As we wish to incentivise our 
Executive Directors to focus on the continuing operations of the 
business, the performance of Macau will be excluded from the bonus 
targets and will not count towards performance. In addition, in the 
event that Monaco Telecom is sold in the year, the outcome of the 
sale will form part of the consideration of bonus outcome (at a level 
of one seventh of the element measured on financial performance). 
The proportion of bonus based on specific personal objectives will 
increase from 20% to 30% of total bonus opportunity, with the 
focus on driving greater synergies and growth opportunities both 
organic and inorganic in the pan-America region.
Long-term incentives
The degree of portfolio change which we have had and expect 
to continue to experience for the foreseeable future, makes it 
difficult to define a robust EPS range at this point in time. Therefore 
the Committee has decided that the awards to be granted in 
2013/14 will be entirely based on relative TSR. The Committee 
will additionally assess whether it is satisfied with the financial 
performance of the Group before determining the extent to 
which (if at all) awards should vest. 
There will be no change to the policy on overall quantum for the 
bonus and LTIP.

1  In accordance with the rules of The Cable & Wireless Communications 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan (the Deferred Bonus Plan), half of each gross bonus awarded will be converted 
into shares which are deferred for 12 months and subject to forfeiture during that period. During the deferral period the shares carry cash dividend rights and any dividends 
awarded are also deferred during the deferral period. Deferred shares count toward each participant’s personal shareholding. The Committee may exercise its discretion as to 
whether claw back is applicable at any time prior to the date in the following year, when the shares are due to be released. Claw back allows for all or a portion of shares to be 
reduced in the event that there is a restatement of the Company’s accounts resulting from fraud, error or misrepresentation, or any issues of a nature which have a significant 
effect on the performance of the business.

How do the remuneration arrangements for 2013/14 align with Group strategy?
The performance targets set for the Executive Directors and their regional management teams have been carefully aligned with the Group’s 
strategy. This is illustrated in the following table:
Strategic objective Annual bonus scheme metric Long Term Incentive metric
Growth of our pan-America 
operations 
Focus on EBITDA and cash metrics encourages focus 
on opportunities for synergies and economies of scale 
across the two regions
Well executed M&A activity will flow 
through to TSR improvements over time
Improving operational synergy The blend of earnings and cash targets in the annual 
bonus plan creates a focus on improving gross margin, 
reducing operating costs and strong cash management 
through tight working capital discipline, operational 
expenditure reduction and capital expenditure control. 
All these aspects combined, help to drive share price 
performance and generate cash to reinvest for future 
expansion and to distribute via dividends to shareholders
Use of relative TSR to ensure our 
management team are focused on 
improving market share and gross margin 
and reducing the cost base, which in 
combination will improve operational 
synergy/performance and share price 
performance
Optimising shareholder value 
through portfolio reshaping 
Specific non-financial objectives around portfolio 
reshaping, and alignment of incentive arrangements in 
realising synergies and economies of scale
Actual and potential organic growth will be 
reflected in our TSR performance
Maintaining our leading market 
position (where applicable) and 
growing market share through 
developing data based products 
and services in existing markets
Specific non-financial objectives on shaping regulatory 
change, embedding the use of growth metrics in the 
business units and progressing mobile data
Maintaining our leading market position 
should flow through to our annual 
performance and be reflected in 
improvements in TSR
Identification of new markets 
in which to expand our services 
through value added products, 
e.g. social telecoms and mobile 
data
Stretching annual bonus targets require the exploration 
of organic growth opportunities to supplement revenue 
streams
Non-financial objectives supporting the expansion of our 
services beyond existing geographical boundaries
Balancing risk and reward Deferral of 50% of any annual bonus award into shares 
for a year. This reduces the risk of large payments where 
an event occurs which has a significant effect on the 
performance of the Group’s business for the financial 
year in respect of the award or requires a restatement of 
the Company’s accounts
Claw back arrangements operate whereby the 
deferred bonus will be subject to claw back during 
the deferral period in the event of any fraud, error or 
misrepresentation by any person which gives rise to a 
restatement of the Company’s financial accounts, or 
in certain other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee
High personal (at upper decile level) 
shareholding requirements create greater 
alignment with the shareholders and 
reduce the potential for behaviours and 
actions which are not beneficial for the 
long term health of the organisation
Payment in shares is an additional claw 
back where share price performance is 
negative

Proportionate split of total remuneration at target level versus maximum level of performance
The balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration at a target level and a maximum level are shown in the charts below. 
The packages for all our Executive Directors are weighted in favour of performance related remuneration at both the target and maximum 
performance levels. Based on a target level of performance it is intended that around 60% of the package is performance related. Based on 
maximum performance the weighting of performance-related remuneration increases to around 70% to 75% of the remuneration package.

remuneration report

Considerations taken into account in determining 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Impact of remuneration on risk
The Committee understands that an appropriate balance is required 
between reward and risk and is committed to keeping this balance 
under review to ensure the remuneration policy dovetails with the 
risk profile of the Company. The Committee commissions an annual 
independent assessment of risk in relation to the remuneration 
arrangements of senior executives to ensure fully informed decisions 
can be made in this context. Following an assessment in 2012, the 
Committee remains satisfied that the current remuneration policy is 
appropriately aligned with the risk profile of the Company and that 
the remuneration arrangements do not encourage excessive risk 
taking.
Pay of other employees
Pay and employment conditions of other employees elsewhere in the 
Group (in particular in the UK) are taken into account when setting 
the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. The Committee is 
provided with periodic updates on employee remuneration practices 
and trends across the Group.
Shareholder views
The Committee actively seeks to engage with shareholders and 
values highly the contribution their views can make in the process of 
formulating remuneration policy decisions. The Committee sought 
and considered feedback from shareholders prior to the 2012 AGM 
on remuneration policy generally and, in particular, on a review of the 
performance conditions in the LTIP. Likewise, the Committee has also 
sought feedback from shareholders prior to this year’s AGM on, in 
particular, changes to the annual bonus and LTIP and their alignment 
to Group strategy.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service 
contracts should include a maximum notice period of one year. 
Executive Directors’ service contracts continue until their normal 
retirement date. 
Date of appointment Notice period
Nick Cooper 25 January 2010 One year
Tim Pennington 25 January 2010 One year
Tony Rice 25 January 2010 One year
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide that, in the event 
of a change of control of the Company and a Director’s employment 
being adversely changed, then he will receive a payment equal to 
base salary for the notice period and a time pro-rated annual bonus. 
The contracts do not provide for any other fixed payments. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts contain no other 
provisions for compensation payable on early termination. In 
the event of early termination, the Committee will, within legal 
constraints, determine the approach to be taken according to the 
circumstances of each individual case, taking full account of the 
departing Executive Director’s obligation to mitigate loss. Except in 
cases of early termination for cause, the Committee will take into 
account the relevant Executive Director’s current salary, notice 
period and contractual benefits when calculating any liability of the 
Company. The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to 
salary are pension, healthcare and life insurance. Annual bonuses and 
long-term incentives are granted at the discretion of the Committee 
and would therefore be dealt with in accordance with the rules of 
the relevant scheme. A significant proportion of each Executive 
Director’s total remuneration is subject to performance conditions 
and therefore would not be payable to the extent that the relevant 
targets have not been met.
Chairman’s service contract
The Chairman’s contract is effective from 25 January 2010 with 12 
months’ notice on either side or the requirement to stand for annual 
re-election at the AGM. There are no other contractual entitlements 
on early termination or following a change of control. 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company, but instead have letters of appointment. Their fees are 
determined by the Board, within the limits set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, with Non-executive Directors abstaining 
from any discussion or decision on their fees. The Non-executive 
Directors do not receive any incentive payments or pension 
provision.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three year 
term with the expectation that a further three year term will follow. 
After two three year terms, the continued appointment of any 
Non-executive Director may be extended on an annual basis on 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. Termination of 
the appointment may be earlier at the discretion of either party on 
one month’s written notice. None of the Non-executive Directors 
is entitled to any compensation if their appointment is terminated. 
Appointments will be subject to re-election at the AGM in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Annual fees payable to each Non-executive Director are disclosed 
on page 66. Annual report 2012/13 59

3  Company pension contributions in 2012/13 have been paid to the Directors as either annual cash allowance and/or employer’s pension contributions. In addition to the pension 
cash allowance listed above, in 2012/13 Nick Cooper and Tim Pennington waived £50,000 of their pension/ cash allowance as an equivalent amount was paid into the pension plan 
by the Company on their behalf. An amount of £20 million (2011/12 - £18 million) is included in the net pensions deficit figure in note 27 to cover the cost of former Directors’ 
pension entitlements.
4  For 2012/13, Tony Rice, Tim Pennington and Nick Cooper received bonuses of £588,350, £457,750 and £343,312 respectively. Half of the bonus is paid in cash (as shown in the 
table under ‘total cash bonuses’) and the other half is deferred into shares for one year and subject to claw back at the discretion of the Committee. These shares will count 
towards each Director’s shareholding requirement. 
5  Sir Richard Lapthorne received a cash allowance of £60,500 from 1 May 2012, in the financial year 2012/13, in lieu of a company car, which was previously under ‘benefits in kind’.
6 Ian Tyler received additional fees for his role as Chairman of the Audit Committee from 1 June 2012.

The salaries of Tony Rice and Tim Pennington will not be increased 
from their 2010/11 levels for 2013/14 (and will remain the same 
for the third year running). The salary of Nick Cooper will remain 
unchanged from his 2012/13 level. The next salary review will be 
1 April 2014.
Details of pension and other benefits in 2012/13
Executive Directors choose to receive one of the following:  
a cash allowance of 25% of their base salary, an employer’s pension 
contribution at the rate of 25% of base salary or a combination of a 
cash allowance and employer’s pension contribution with a combined 
value of 25% of base salary. The Director is not required to pay any 
pension contributions. The Company made contributions to the 
pension plan on behalf of two Executive Directors, Nick Cooper and 
Tim Pennington, totalling £100,000 in 2012/13. 
The Executive Directors participated in employee benefit 
programmes including life, disability and health insurance plans. 
The value of these benefits for 2012/13 is included in the Directors’ 
emoluments table above.

Annual bonus payments
Bonuses in 2012/13 for the Executive Directors were based 80% 
on financial and 20% on personal performance targets. 65% of the 
financial performance was based on EBITDA and 35% on NCFbF. The 
EBITDA element was based on EBITDA targets for the four regional 
businesses. There was also a minimum EBITDA underpin for both the 
EBITDA and NCFbF elements. 
An overview of our EBITDA performance and Group NCFbF 
performance relative to the bonus targets is summarised in the table 
below.

EBITDA underpin EBITDA underpin achieved
Tony Rice’s personal targets for last year included delivery of a 
premium disposal and progressing the Jamaica turnaround plan in 
reaction to changes in the regulatory environment. Tim Pennington’s 
personal targets for the last year included managing and delivering 
one major portfolio disposal within the 2012/13 financial year and 
embedding the use of return on investment metrics within the 
business. Nick Cooper’s personal targets included developing a plan 
for dual sourcing of exchange equipment and delivery of customer 
relationship management and mobile data billing initiatives. These 
objectives, the Executives’ overall personal performance and the 
achievements delivered in the year were assessed by the Committee 
with input from the Chairman and for Tim Pennington and Nick 
Cooper, with input from the Chief Executive.
Bonuses for 2012/13 are paying out at the level of 56% of maximum 
opportunity for Tony Rice and 61% of maximum opportunity for 
Tim Pennington and Nick Cooper. The bonus payments represent 
a combination of strong EBITDA performance for Macau and 
Monaco & Islands which has flowed through to robust NCFbF 
results, and solid performance against personal objectives. The 
Committee assessed these bonus levels in the context of the overall 
performance of the individuals and the business in the year, the value 
created from the disposals, and concluded that they fairly reflected 
performance.
In accordance with the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan, as 
summarised in footnote 1 to the Policy table on page 54, half of 
each gross bonus award for 2012/13 has been converted into shares 
which are deferred for 12 months and subject to forfeiture during 
that period. 
Vesting of deferred bonus in the year
On 31 May 2011 the first deferral of 50% of the bonus (into 
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc shares) was made under 
the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan. The shares were potentially 
subject to claw back as described in footnote 1 to the Policy table 
on page 54. 
For the awards granted in May 2011, the deferral period ended on 
30 May 2012 and the shares vested in full on 30 May 2012.
Vesting of long term incentive awards in the year
No awards were subject to performance measurement periods 
ending in the 2012/13 financial year.
The performance period for the June 2009 LTIP awards granted 
under the Cable and Wireless Incentive Plan 2001 was aligned with 
the financial year, with the performance period beginning on the 
first day of the financial year in which the awards were made (i.e. 
performance period ending 31 March 2012). The performance 
conditions were not met for these awards and therefore the awards 
lapsed in June 2012.
The performance targets and levels of vesting for the 2009 awards 
were:
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over 
performance period % of award vesting
20% compound p.a. or higher 100%
Between 8% compound p.a. and 
20% compound p.a.
Straight-line between 
25% and 100%
Equal to 8% compound p.a. 25%
Less than 8% compound p.a. 0%
Prior year long term incentive awards not vesting in year
In June 2010 and 2011, performance share awards equal to 2.8 
times base salary for Tony Rice and Tim Pennington and 2.0 times 
base salary for Nick Cooper were granted (under the previous 
performance share plan) which vest on the third anniversary of grant 
in June 2013 and June 2014 respectively. 
The June 2010 award is measured over the period 4 June 2010 to 
3 June 2013. The minimum performance targets have not thus far 
been met and therefore the awards are forecast to lapse in full.
The performance targets and levels of vesting for these awards are:
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over 
performance period % of award vesting
14% compound p.a. or higher 100%
Between 8% compound p.a. and 
14% compound p.a.
Straight-line between 
0% and 100%
8% compound p.a. or lower 0%
For the purposes of these awards, TSR is defined consistently with 
the definition as described in the footnote to the Policy table on 
page 54.
In addition to reviewing performance against the targets set out 
in the above two tables, the Committee will, within 12 months 
following the end of each three year performance period, also 
consider whether the underlying performance of the Group 
warrants release of the shares. It will reduce the vesting percentage 
if appropriate. In considering underlying performance, the 
Committee may take account of (though not necessarily in isolation) 
the following metrics: revenue, EBITDA, operational spending, cost 
of sales, capital expenditure and quantum and timing of cash flows.

The number of shares awarded was calculated based on the average share price for the period 24 to 30 May 2012 (inclusive) which is the period immediately after the 2011/12 full 
year results and would ordinarily have been used to calculate the award price had the Company not been in an extended close period until January 2013.

1 In addition, as potential beneficiaries from outstanding awards which may be satisfied by shares held by the Trust, the Executive Directors are deemed to have an interest in all of 
the ordinary shares held by the Trust, which at 31 March 2013 amounted to 34,598,177 shares. 
2 Included in the shares acquired during the year are shares purchased under the Share Purchase Plan (as described on page 66). Matching Shares allocated under the Share 
Purchase Plan are included if they have vested. All unvested Matching Shares as at 31 March 2013 are not included. Details are disclosed on page 65. As at 21 May 2013, there 
were the following increases in the interests of Directors and their connected persons: as a result of the vesting of Matching Shares awarded under the Share Purchase Plan, 
Nick Cooper 2,492, Tim Pennington 2,491 and Tony Rice 2,492 shares.
3 Included in the shares acquired during the year are shares awarded under the Deferred Bonus Plan under which 50% of gross bonus awarded to Executive Directors is paid in 
shares deferred for one year. These amounts are: Nick Cooper 642,666 shares, Tim Pennington 878,412 shares, Tony Rice 1,259,333 shares. A proportion of these deferred 
shares may be sold at the end of the deferral period to meet tax obligations relating to their acquisition/vesting.
4 Each of the Executive Directors will receive 50% of their total gross bonus payment for 2012/13 in the form of shares deferred for one year and subject to claw back at the 
discretion of the Committee. Once awarded these shares will count towards each Director’s shareholding requirements. A proportion of these deferred shares may be sold at the 
end of the deferral period to meet tax obligations relating to their acquisition/vesting.
5 Shares disposed of by Nick Cooper were to cover tax obligations which arose as a result of shares vesting under the Deferred Bonus Plan. Annual report 2012/13 63

1  The market price on the date of awards made prior to demerger has been adjusted in proportion to the market price value of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc to the 
combined share price of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc over the five days following demerger. This adjustment resulted in the market 
price on the date of award for all awards being adjusted to 38% of their original value.
2  The total number of shares comprised in each Performance Share award adjusted as a result of the demerger has been included in the table as at 1 April 2010 notwithstanding the 
fact that the equivalent value of these Performance Share awards was determined by reference to the average closing price of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc ordinary 
shares and Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc ordinary shares over the five trading days commencing on the demerger effective date, being 26 March 2010 and concluding on 1 April 
2010. The adjusted awards were granted by the Trust on 13 May 2010.
3  Performance is measured on the absolute TSR performance of Cable and Wireless plc up to demerger and the combined Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and Cable & 
Wireless Worldwide plc thereafter.
4  The award of 1,310,302 Performance Shares granted to Tim Pennington on 2 June 2009 was split so that half the award is measured over TSR for Cable and Wireless plc prior to 
demerger and the combined Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc thereafter. The remaining half is measured over TSR for Cable & Wireless 
Communications Plc. Subsequent to demerger one half of the award was adjusted in line with note 2 above.
5  The number of shares awarded under the PSP 2011 set out on pages 63 to 64 was calculated based on the average share price for the period 24 to 30 May 2012 (inclusive) which 
is the period immediately after the 2011/12 full year results and would ordinarily have been used to calculate the award price had the Company not been in an extended close 
period until January 2013.  Annual report 2012/13 65

prohibited period.   
Notes:         
These were unapproved (non-tax relieved) grants made under the Cable & Wireless Share Option Plan 2001.
Following the demerger, these shares under option, were linked to an equal number of Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc shares and cannot be exercised separately. The exercise price is 
the combined value of a Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc share and a Cable & Wireless Communications Plc share.
No amounts were paid by Directors for the award of the options listed in the table above. The closing mid-market price of an ordinary share in Cable & Wireless Communications Plc 
on 29 March 2013 was 41.94 pence, and subsequent to the acquisition of Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc shares by Vodafone Group Plc on 27 July 2012, the value of the linked 
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc share was 38 pence.
The highest closing mid-market price of an ordinary share in Cable & Wireless Communications Plc during the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 was 42.63 pence, and the 
lowest closing mid-market price was 27.28 pence. 66 Cable & Wireless Communications

Share Purchase Plan
Prior to 5 April 2012, Executive Directors were eligible to participate 
in the all-employee Cable & Wireless Communications Share 
Purchase Plan (the Share Purchase Plan) on the same terms as other 
employees. With effect from 13 April 2012 no further shares were 
available for award under the Cable & Wireless Communications 
Share Purchase Plan.
Dilution
The Committee ensures that at all times the number of new shares 
which may be issued under any share option or share-based plans, 
including all employee plans, does not exceed the dilution limit of 
10% of the Company’s issued share capital over any 10 year rolling 
period. As at 31 March 2013, 7% of the issued share capital was 
available for issue under our share-based plans. In calculating this 
figure, the Committee has taken into account historic awards of the 
former Cable and Wireless plc shares made to current or former 
employees of the Communications business and the adjustments to 
the awards as a result of the demerger.
Awards under the various share plans are funded by a mix of 
purchased and newly-issued shares, as determined by the 
Committee. Newly-issued shares are subject to the dilution limit 
outlined above. Purchased shares are held by the Trust, which is 
subject to a holding limit of no more than 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ Fees
The Chairman’s annual fee of £386,000, effective from his 
appointment as Chairman of Cable and Wireless plc in January 2003, 
was reviewed by the Committee in March 2013 and will remain 
unchanged for 2013/14. The Chairman receives a cash allowance 
of £5,500 per month in lieu of the provision of a car. The Chairman 
exercised his option in 2012/13 to purchase his company car, details 
of which are listed in the related party transaction note on page 122.
The fee levels of the other Non-executive Directors were last 
reviewed in March 2013 and no increases were approved for the 
coming year.

executive Director for 2013/14 are shown in the table below.

Audited information
The Group’s auditor, KPMG, has audited the information contained in 
the tables headed Directors’ emoluments, Directors’ shareholdings, 
Directors’ share awards, Share Purchase Plan awards and Directors’ 
share options.
This report has been approved on behalf of the Board by:
Simon Ball 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
21 May 2013 Annual report 2012/13 67
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) and applicable law. Further, they have 
elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance 
with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP)). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 —Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
 —Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
 —For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU 
 —For the Company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company 
financial statements
 —Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that their financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, with regard to the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and the Company and for 
taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ 
remuneration report and Corporate governance statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are also required by the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules to include a report containing a fair review of the business and 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
and the Company.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group and 
Company’s website, www.cwc.com. Information published on the 
Company’s website is accessible in many countries with different 
legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
page 37, confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge 
and belief:
 —The Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group
 —The Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
UK GAAP give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company
 —The Annual report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined in Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 
2006) of which the auditor is unaware, and the Directors have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
1 General information
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (the Company or the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (together Cable & Wireless Communications 
Group or the Group) is an international telecommunications company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Following the 
agreement to dispose of interests in Macau and the sale of its Islands businesses, the Group operates through three business units being the 
Caribbean, Panama and Monaco. 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union (EU) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2013.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and rounded to the nearest million. They have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups are stated at the lower of 
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Directors have prepared the accounts on a going concern basis (see page 46 of the Directors’ and corporate governance report for 
further detail).
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are 
discussed in note 3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and include the Group’s 
share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The results of the Group’s main trading subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates have been prepared to align with the Group’s reporting date. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by and forming part of the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the existence and effect of potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable are considered. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively takes control 
until the date that control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with the policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. 
The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised through profit or loss. Its share of 
post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the investment.
When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture and/or associate exceeds its investment (including any other unsecured long-term 
receivables), the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee. 78 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
2.2 Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group considered the implications of the following amendments to IFRS during the year ended 31 March 2013:
 — Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
 — Amendment to IFRS 1 First Time Adoption
 — Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes
The above were first effective for the Group in the year beginning 1 April 2012 and have been adopted by the Group for 2012/13. They did not 
have a material impact on the Group.
New and amended standards and interpretations endorsed by the EU, adopted by the Group for 2013/14:
Title Effective date Description and impact on the Group
Amendment to IAS 19 
Employee benefits
Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2013
There will be an impact on the Group results due to the 
change in calculating the income statement charge. Interest 
cost and expected return on plan assets will be replaced with 
a net amount calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability. 
Had the Group applied the new standard from 1 April 2012, 
Group profit before tax from continuing operations would 
have been US$8 million lower.
There are no other new or amended standards that are considered to have a material impact on the Group.
New and amended standards and interpretations, not yet effective and not adopted by the Group:
Title Effective date Description and impact on the Group
IFRS 9 Financial instruments Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2015, however the standard has yet to be 
endorsed by the EU which is likely to delay 
implementation
IFRS 9 replaces parts of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement that relate to the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments. 
There will be an impact on the Group results due to revised 
classification categories although further changes to the 
standard are likely. The Group will consider the effect of the 
revised standard once it has been endorsed by the EU.
In addition, a number of new standards have been released but are not yet effective. The Group is currently considering the effect of these 
revised standards but they are not expected to have a material impact. 
2.3 Foreign currencies 
a) Functional currency
Amounts included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
b) Foreign currency translation 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised through profit or loss. 
c) Foreign operations 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the Group’s presentation currency of 
US dollars are translated as follows:
i) Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
ii) Income and expenses are translated at rates closely approximating the rate at the date of the transactions; and 
iii) Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. Annual report 2012/13 79
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the same 
period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders’ equity. Where investments 
are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency loans, the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of such loans are also recorded 
as movements in the Group’s translation reserves and any excess taken to profit or loss.
There are no Group entities operating in a hyperinflationary economy. 
The principal exchange rates used in the preparation of these accounts are as follows:
2012/13 2011/12
£ : US$
Average 0.6330 0.6260
Year end 0.6562 0.6263
€ : US$
Average 0.7786 0.7225
Year end 0.7694 0.7506
2.4 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment includes labour and overhead costs arising directly from the construction or acquisition of an item of property, plant and equipment. 
Plant and equipment represents the Group’s network infrastructure assets.
The estimated costs of dismantling and removing assets, typically cell sites and network equipment, and restoring land on which they are 
located are included in the cost of property, plant and equipment. The corresponding obligation is recognised as a provision in accordance with 
IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the 
future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other subsequent costs (primarily repairs and 
maintenance) are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation is not recognised on freehold land or assets under construction. Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of property, plant 
and equipment, on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Lives
Cables up to 20 years
Network equipment 3 to 25 years
Ducting 40 years
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold buildings up to 40 years or term of lease if less
Asset useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its 
recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount through sale or use.
2.5 Intangible assets 
a) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from acquired assets that are not capable of being individually identified and 
separately recognised.
The goodwill recorded in the Group’s statement of financial position is calculated using two different methods, depending on the acquisition 
date, as a result of changes in accounting standards. 
All business combinations that occurred since 31 March 2010 are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations Revised. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. All transaction costs are expensed as incurred. 
All other business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004). 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Costs attributable to these combinations are included in the cost of acquisition. 80 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
2.5 Intangible assets continued
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to 
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
b) Other intangible assets
Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of identifiable and unique software products by the Group are 
recognised as intangible assets. Expenditures that enhance and extend the benefits of computer software programs beyond their original 
specifications and lives are recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software.
Intangible assets relating to customer contracts, customer relationships and licences obtained as part of the Group’s business combinations are 
recorded initially at their fair values.
Other intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortised on a straight line basis over their respective lives which are usually 
based on contractual terms. Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation. 
Lives
Software 3 to 5 years 
Licences 25 years or less if the licence term is shorter 
Customer contracts and relationships 4 to 10 years 
2.6 Financial instruments 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents; trade and other receivables; financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss; available-for-sale financial assets; and held-to-maturity investments. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the assets are held. The Group does not currently classify any assets as held-to-maturity investments. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date 
for financial assets other than those held at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank, short-term deposits, money market funds and government securities. They are 
highly liquid monetary investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position is considered to approximate fair value. Bank 
overdrafts are included within borrowings and classified in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a third party with no intention of trading the receivable. Trade and 
other receivables are presented in current assets in the statement of financial position, except for those with maturities greater than one year 
after the reporting date. 
Receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable 
(amortised cost). 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets that are either held for trading or those designated upon initial recognition. 
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by 
management. These financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised through profit or loss. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not 
designated as hedge instruments are recognised immediately through profit or loss. Annual report 2012/13 81
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category upon initial recognition or not 
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment 
within one year of the reporting date and such assets recognised in this category by the Group include UK and Bahamian Government gilts. 
Purchases and disposals of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value, other than 
impairment losses and foreign currency differences, are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve 
(within Capital and Other reserves) in equity. When an asset is derecognised the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified through profit 
or loss.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: trade and other payables; borrowings; and financial liabilities at fair value. 
Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting 
date for financial liabilities other than those held at fair value. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds received (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised through profit 
or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The financial liabilities recognised in this category include secured 
and unsecured bonds and facilities and other loans held by the Group and are presented in borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of 
financial position unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the reporting date.
Financial liabilities at fair value 
This category includes a puttable instrument on non-controlling interests relating to the acquisition of Monaco Telecom (the Monaco Telecom 
put option), together with derivative financial instruments. These financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent changes in 
fair value are recognised through profit or loss except for changes in the fair value of the Monaco Telecom put option. 
The fair value of the Monaco Telecom put option is based on the present value of the redemption amount, calculated using discounted cash 
flow techniques, as if the puttable instrument had been exercised at the reporting date. Movements in the fair value of the liability are 
recognised as adjustments to goodwill in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004), with the unwind of the discount on the fair 
value calculation being recognised through profit or loss in finance expenses.
2.7 Impairment of assets 
Financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or 
loss or a group of those financial assets is impaired. 
An impairment allowance is established for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Non-financial assets
Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. All other non-current assets are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units).
The Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the Group’s assets (or the cash-generating unit to which it 
belongs) to their recoverable amounts, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value represents 
market value in an active market. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows arising from the asset. Future cash flows are 
determined with reference to the Group’s own projections using pre-tax discount rates. 
Impairment reviews involve management making assumptions and estimates, which are highly judgemental and susceptible to change.
2.8 Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the price paid less any rebates, trade discounts or subsidies. It also 
includes delivery charges and import duties, but does not include value added taxes or advertising and administration costs. Cost is based on 
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. For inventories held for resale, net realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less costs to sell. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventories as required. 82 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
2.9 Share capital 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, stand-alone options or the repurchase of shares are recognised in equity. 
2.10 Leases 
All Group leases are operating leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives or premiums received, are charged 
through profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
2.11 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 
When the value of non-current assets is expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing usage, they are 
available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable, they are classified as assets held for sale. With the exception 
of deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits and financial instruments, the assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Disposal groups are groups of assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction. They are recognised as held for 
sale at the reporting date and are separately disclosed as current assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. Any amortisation 
and depreciation ceases when classified as held for sale.
Measurement differences arising between the carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal are treated as impairment charges and 
separately disclosed.
The Islands sub-group and the Macau segment have been classified at year end as disposal groups held for sale. See note 9 for details.
2.12 Discontinued operations 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group where the operations and cash flows are clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group 
and which:
 — Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
 — Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
 — Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs on disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and cash flow statement are re-presented as if 
the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
The Islands sub-group and the Macau segment have been classified as discontinued operations. See note 9 for details.
2.13 Employee benefits 
Defined contribution pensions 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a third party. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred through profit or 
loss.
Defined benefit obligations 
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually 
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. These schemes are generally funded through payments to 
insurance companies or Trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. 
The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of each defined benefit pension plan represents the fair value of 
plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the reporting date. Assets are only recognised to the extent that the 
present value of the economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan exceed 
the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations. Defined benefit obligations for each scheme are 
calculated annually by independent actuaries. 
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in 
which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately through profit or loss unless the 
changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In these 
cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Current service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan liabilities less the expected return on plan 
assets, are included within operating costs through profit or loss. Annual report 2012/13 83
Share-based compensation 
The Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of options over shares in the Company is recognised as an operating cost through profit or loss over the vesting period. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact 
of any non-market vesting conditions (for example service, profitability and cash flow targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
estimates about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest.
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits within other provisions when it is 
demonstrably committed to the action leading to the employee’s termination. 
Bonus plans 
The Group recognises a liability in the statement of financial position in relation to bonuses payable to employees where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. 
2.14 Tax 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised through profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income and equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or 
equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except where the difference arises from:
 — The initial recognition of goodwill; or
 — The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, affecting neither accounting nor taxable 
profit.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
2.15 Provisions 
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated.
Provisions are presented in the statement of financial position at the present value of the estimated future outflows expected to be required to 
settle the obligation. Provision charges and reversals are recognised through profit or loss. Discount unwinding is recognised as a finance expense. 
2.16 Revenue recognition 
Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of services and 
goods provided to customers. It includes sales to joint ventures and associates but does not include sales by joint ventures and associates or 
sales between Group companies. Revenue is recognised only when payment is probable.
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until 
provision of the service.
Amounts payable by and to other telecommunications operators are recognised as the services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately 
and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable 
to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. 84 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
2.16 Revenue recognition continued
Revenue from mobile, broadband, TV and fixed line products comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, 
airtime and usage, messaging and other telecommunications services. This includes data services and information provision and revenue from 
the sale of equipment, including handsets.
Monthly access charges from mobile, broadband, TV and fixed line products are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Airtime, 
either from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid customers through the sale of prepaid cards, is recorded in the 
period in which the customer uses the service. Unbilled revenue resulting from services provided to contract customers from the billing cycle 
date to the end of each period is accrued. Unearned monthly access charges relating to periods after each accounting period are deferred.
The Group earns revenue from the transmission of content and traffic on its network originated by third-party providers. Third-party dealers 
and partners are also used to facilitate the sale and provision of some services and equipment sold by the Group. We assess whether revenue 
should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of such arrangements including the following factors:
 — Whether the Group holds itself out as an agent;
 — Whether the Group has latitude for establishing the price, either directly or indirectly, for example by providing additional services;
 — Provision of customer remedies;
 — Whether the Group has the primary responsibility for providing the services to the customer or for fulfilling the order; and
 — Assumption of credit risk.
Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised upon delivery to the customer.
The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities (generally the sale of telecoms equipment and ongoing 
service) is allocated to those components that are capable of operating independently, based on the estimated fair value of the components. 
The fair value of each component is determined by amounts charged when sold separately and by reference to sales of equivalent products and 
services by third parties.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised over the periods in which the service is 
provided.
Customer acquisition costs including dealer commissions and similar payments are expensed as incurred.
2.17 Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are material items within profit or loss that derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group 
that are identified as exceptional items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
2.18 Transactions with holders of non-controlling interests
Transactions to acquire or dispose of ownership interests in the Group’s subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions. In these cases, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
the Group’s relative interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the 
fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity attributable to the owners of the Parent Company.
3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
A number of estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the reporting of results of operations and the financial condition of the 
Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the 
following discussion addresses the Group’s most critical accounting estimates. These particular policies require subjective and complex 
assessments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.
3.1 Valuation of assets for purchase accounting 
Where the Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of acquisition is allocated to identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities 
acquired and assumed by reference to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is recorded as goodwill. Any 
value assigned to the identifiable assets is determined by reference to an active market, independent appraisal or estimate by management 
based on cash flow projections. The latter situation includes estimates regarding expectations of the economic useful lives of the products and 
technology acquired.  Annual report 2012/13 85
3.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
The Group assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the 
intended use for those assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances (for example from one generation of mobile 
technology to the next), prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives 
differing from initial estimates. Where the Group determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened, it 
depreciates the net book value in excess of the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. 
Any change in an asset’s life is reflected in the Group’s financial statements when the change in estimate is determined.
3.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
The Directors assess property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value is less than its recoverable amount. Factors that are considered important and that could trigger 
an impairment review include the following:
 — Obsolescence or physical damage;
 — Significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;
 — Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
 — Significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy of the overall business;
 — Significant negative industry or economic trends; and
 — Significant decline in the market capitalisation relative to net book value for a sustained period.
In addition, the Directors test goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life at least annually for impairment.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable amount for assets or 
cash-generating units requires significant consideration. Note 12 sets out the assumptions and estimates used during these assessments.
3.4 Receivables allowance
The impairment allowance for trade receivables reflects the Group’s estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of the Group’s 
customers to make required payments. The allowance is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer creditworthiness and the Group’s 
historical write-off experience. Changes to the allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Group’s customers improves or 
deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs. Historically, changes to the estimate of losses have not 
been material to the Group’s financial position and results.
3.5 Tax 
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation in respect of certain items where the tax treatment cannot be 
finally determined until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, if necessary, through a formal legal process. The final 
resolution of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and/or cash flow variances.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of the administrative and legal 
processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in 
respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result, there 
can be substantial differences between the tax charge through profit or loss and tax payments made.
3.6 Provisions 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash outflows by a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. These provisions are estimates for which the amount and timing of actual cash flows are 
dependent on future events. 86 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
3.7 Pensions 
The Group provides several defined benefit pension schemes for its employees. The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial 
position in respect of defined benefit pension plans represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations at the reporting date. The expected cost of providing these defined benefit pensions will depend on an assessment of such factors 
as:
 — The life expectancy of the members;
 — The length of service;
 — The rate of salary progression;
 — The rate of return earned on assets in the future;
 — The rate used to discount future pension liabilities; and
 — Future inflation rates.
The assumptions used by the Group are set out in note 27 and are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may 
not necessarily be borne out in practice but are comparable to the median estimates in this regard used by FTSE 250 companies. Changes to 
these assumptions could materially affect the defined benefit schemes’ liabilities and assets.
3.8 Fair value estimation 
The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments traded in active markets (such as available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market 
prices at the reporting date. The quoted market price used for traded financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. The appropriate 
quoted market price for traded financial liabilities is the current offer price. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined 
using forward exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The 
Group uses a variety of methods which include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are 
substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models which reflect the specific instrument. 
The nominal value of receivables (less estimated impairments) and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair value of 
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate 
that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of 
remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market 
rates at the reporting date.
3.9 Revenue recognition 
Judgement is required in assessing the application of revenue recognition principles and the specific guidance in respect of Group revenue. This 
includes the allocation of revenue between multiple deliverables, such as the sale value of telecommunications equipment and ongoing service, 
where such items are sold as part of a bundled package. See note 2.16.

5 Segment information 
Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications service provider. It operates integrated telecommunications 
companies offering mobile, broadband, TV, fixed line and enterprise services to residential and business customers. It had three principal 
operations which have been identified as the Group’s reportable segments, being the Caribbean, Panama and Monaco. During the year ended 
31 March 2013, the Group announced that agreements had been reached for the sale of the Monaco & Islands and the Macau segments. The 
Islands sub-group and Macau segment have been classified as discontinued operations. Monaco does not meet the criteria for discontinued 
operations and remains an operating segment of the Group. See note 9 for more information.
The Group also has a London corporate centre that does not meet the definition of an operating segment as it does not earn revenue from its 
activities. This function primarily acts as a portfolio manager and operational support provider for the reportable segments. 
The operating segment result from continuing operations for the two years ended 31 March 2013 are presented below and the prior year 
results have been re-presented for the Islands sub-group and Macau disposals. The non-operating London corporate centre is also disclosed 
within ‘other and eliminations’ in order to reconcile the reportable segment results to the Group results. 
The Board (the chief operating decision maker of the Group) considers the performance of each of these operations in assessing the 
performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources. Accordingly, these are the operating segments disclosed. 
There are no other operating segments identified by the Board. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Board.

i) Monaco & Islands
At a general meeting on 9 January 2013, shareholders of the Group approved the sale of the Monaco & Islands operating segment to Batelco 
International Group Holding Limited (Batelco). The significant aspects of this transaction are described below:
 — We entered into an agreement to sell the Islands sub-group, (including the Group’s interests in operations in the Maldives, the Channel 
Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic, Diego Garcia and the Seychelles), for US$580 million on a cash and debt-free basis. The sale of the 
Islands sub-group, with the exception of the Seychelles for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained, was completed post-year 
end on 3 April 2013 (note 38); 
 — We also agreed to sell a 25% interest in Compagnie Monegasque de Communication SAM (CMC), the holding company of the Group’s 
interests in Monaco Telecom, for US$100 million. The sale was completed on 3 April 2013; 
 — As part of the transaction we have an option to sell the remaining 75% of CMC shares to Batelco for US$345 million subject to regulatory 
approval from the Principality of Monaco; and
 — On 3 April 2013, we issued Batelco with a put option over the 25% of CMC shares (the CMC put option). The CMC put option enables 
Batelco to require the Group to repurchase the 25% CMC shareholding for US$100 million in the event that the regulatory approval from 
the Principality of Monaco is not granted within 12 months of 3 April 2013. Batelco can exercise this put option between 18 and 19 months 
from 3 April 2013. 
The approval required from the Principality of Monaco means that Monaco does not meet the definition of a disposal group held for sale and 
does not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation as at 31 March 2013. The results of Monaco Telecom are now disclosed 
separately in their own operating segment.
The Islands sub-group has been classified as a disposal group held for sale and also as a discontinued operation as at 31 March 2013, as it 
represents a separate major geographical area of operations. The comparative consolidated income statement and cash flow statement have 
been restated. The results of the Islands sub-group were previously recorded in the Monaco & Islands operating segment. 
ii) Macau
At a general meeting on 28 February 2013, shareholders of the Group approved the sale of the Macau operating segment for US$750 million 
to CITIC Telecom International Holdings Limited. This sale is expected to take place following receipt of the necessary legal and regulatory 
approvals.
The Macau operating segment has been classified as a disposal group held for sale and also as a discontinued operation as at 31 March 2013, as 
it represents a separate major geographical area of operations. The comparative consolidated income statement and cash flow statement have 
been restated. The results of Macau were previously recorded in the Macau operating segment.

ended 31 March 2012).
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2013, the Directors have proposed a final dividend of US2.67 cents per share (US$67 million) 
(2011/12 – US5.33 cents per share), for approval by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 25 July 2013. These financial statements do not 
reflect the proposed dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ended 
31 March 2014.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) waived its right to dividends on the shares held in the Trust, with the 
exception of those shares held for Directors under the deferred annual bonus plan.

12 Impairment review 
Accounting policy detailed in note 2.7. ▶
Goodwill
A review of the carrying value of goodwill has been performed as at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012. In performing this review, the 
recoverable amount has been determined by reference to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of related businesses. 
The key assumptions used by the Group in the calculation of value in use for its goodwill balances are the discount rate, revenue growth, 
operating cost margin and the level of capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level. 
The Group’s significant goodwill balances are discussed below:

1 Monaco Telecom group:
 Three relevant cash-generating units (CGUs) were identified for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of Monaco Telecom (domestic including the cable television business; 
international business and other services).
2 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company – BTC: 
 One relevant CGU has been identified for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of the BTC business. 
3 Afinis: 
 The Group’s interests in Afinis were disposed during 2012/13. One relevant CGU was identified for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of the business. At 31 March 2012, 
the goodwill was fully impaired resulting in a charge of US$9 million. This was due to a decrease in the value in use, triggered by a change in the strategic direction of the business.
The value in use was determined for each CGU by discounting management forecasts of future cash flows (based on the approved five year 
business plan extrapolated at long-term growth rates) at pre-tax discount rates dependent on the risk-adjusted cost of capital of the different 
parts of the business. Management forecasts take account of the historical trading experience of the relevant business.
Sensitivity 
The value in use is sensitive to a number of input assumptions, in particular relating to net cash flow and discount rate. While the Group does not 
consider these scenarios to be reasonably possible, the value in use of the various CGUs in aggregate would not support the carrying value of 
the goodwill if:
 — Monaco Telecom group – net cash flows decreased by more than US$22 million per year or the discount rate increased by more than 8% 
above the pre-tax discount rate. 
 — The Bahamas Telecommunications Company – net cash flows decreased by more than US$31 million per year or the discount rate increased 
by more than 9% above the pre-tax discount rate. 
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles
Following a difficult year of trading and in the midst of challenging economic conditions, the Directors considered the performance of a number of 
our smaller island markets in the Eastern Caribbean region and the impact on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment. As a result of 
the review an impairment charge of US$86 million has been recorded across the islands noted below. Included within the charge of US$86 million 
was a further charge in respect of the Group’s business in Turks & Caicos as the performance of this business did not improve as anticipated. 
The recoverable amount was assessed based upon value in use which was determined by discounting future cash flows (based on the approved 
five year business plan at a pre-tax discount rate). The calculation is sensitive to changes in the discount rate, terminal growth rate and 
underlying trading.  98 Cable & Wireless Communications

There were a number of risks for our Jamaica business during 201 1 /1 2, including the need for change in the regulatory environment and the 
importance of business improvement strategies such as our Jamaica ‘win back’ activity. As at 31 March 201 2, progress in these areas had not been 
as anticipated. In light of this, a review of the carrying value of fixed assets was conducted and an impairment charge of US$184 million recorded.
Business performance in Turks & Caicos was below expectations coinciding with a period of economic downturn in the Islands. Having 
considered the carrying value of plant and equipment an impairment charge of US$12 million was recorded as at 31 March 2012.
At 31 March 2012, in addition to the Afinis goodwill impairment disclosed above, other intangible assets of US$2 million and plant and 
equipment of US$7 million were impaired.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables is equal to their carrying value. There is no material difference between the carrying value 
and fair value of trade and other receivables presented.
Concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade receivables are small as the Group customer base is large and unrelated. Receivables 
predominantly relate to retail customers, governments and corporate entities as well as other telecommunications operators.
Credit risk procedures vary depending on the size or type of customer. These procedures include such activities as credit checks, payment 
history analysis and credit approval limits. Based on these procedures, management assessed the credit quality of those receivables that are 
neither past due nor impaired as low risk. There have been no significant changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the 
Group that indicate this would change in the future. During the periods presented there was a continued economic weakness in many of the 
markets in which the Group operated. This would indicate an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired. 
However, management assessed this risk and, after providing valuation allowance where necessary, continued to support the assessment of 
credit quality as low risk.
An ageing analysis of the current ‘trade receivables’ and current ‘other receivables’ that are not impaired is as follows (excludes prepayments 
and accrued income, taxation and social security and amounts receivable from joint ventures and associates):

Overdue 181 days or more 57 18
Current ‘trade receivables’ and current ‘other receivables’ 309 362
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade and other receivables not past 
due or past due by up to 30 days. Due to the nature of the telecommunications industry, balances relating to interconnection with other 
carriers often have lengthy settlement periods. Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers result in both receivables and 
payables balances with the same counterparty. Industry practice is that receivable and payable amounts relating to interconnection revenue 
and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and settled on a net basis.  104 Cable & Wireless Communications

In a small number of the Group’s operations it is customary and practice to collect security deposits from customers as collateral. These are

18 Inventories 
Accounting policy detailed in note 2.8. ▶
Inventories represent equipment, cable capacity, consumables and accessories held for sale.
Inventories of US$31 million (31 March 2012 – US$103 million) are presented net, after recording an allowance of US$9 million (31 March 
2012 – US$14 million) made against slow moving or obsolete items.
The cost of equipment, cable capacity, consumables and accessories held for sale that were expensed within operating costs in 2012/13 was 
US$126 million (2011/12 – US$1 19 million). Cable capacity previously held within inventory was capitalised during the year following a 
reassessment of how the Group intends to utilise that capacity in future periods. 
Inventories of the Group are not pledged as security or collateral against any of the Group’s borrowings.

average maturity of 25 days (31 March 2012 – nine days).
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is equal to the carrying value of those financial instruments. Annual report 2012/13 105

On demerger, shares in the Cable & Wireless Communications Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) were converted from 43 million Cable and 
Wireless plc shares to 43 million Cable & Wireless Communications Plc shares and 43 million Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc shares. The Cable 
& Wireless Worldwide plc shares held by the Trust were reclassified at demerger as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they 
represent shares in an unrelated listed company. All remaining shares were disposed during the year.
Derivative financial instruments 
At 31 March 2012, the Group had foreign exchange swap contracts to sell US$324 million in hedging future sterling obligations regarding 
the coupon and redemption of the £200 million bond which matured in August 2012. The Group did not apply hedge accounting to these 
contracts and as such they were revalued to fair value through profit or loss. At 31 March 2012, the fair value of these contracts was an 
asset of US$8 million.

3 On 19 October 2011, the Group entered into five-year borrowing arrangements for US$600 million of revolving credit facilities with a maturity date of October 2016. As at 
31 March 2013, the Group had US$240 million undrawn facilities available (31 March 2012 – US$600 million undrawn). These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates 
prevailing when the facilities were arranged.
The agreements for the facilities entered into during the year contain financial and other covenants which are standard to these types of 
arrangements.

i. Monaco Telecom put option 
A put option is held by the non-controlling shareholder of Monaco Telecom, the Principality of Monaco (the Principality). This put option is 
measured at fair value and is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using inputs that are not based on publicly observable market 
data. The liability for the put option represents 45% of the market value of Monaco Telecom. The key assumptions used in valuing the put 
option liability are the Monaco Telecom five year operating plan (in particular revenue performance) and discount rates of between 8% and 
23% for the distinct operating businesses with Monaco Telecom (2011/12 – 9% and 24%). A movement in the discount rate of 1% would result 
in an increase or decrease in the liability of US$28 million (2011/12 – US$25 million). In determining the fair value of the liability, consideration 
has been given to the terms of the proposed disposal to Batelco Group as outlined in note 9.
Although the Group considers there to be only a remote likelihood of the Monaco Telecom put option being exercised, IAS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation requires the present value of the amount payable to be recognised as a liability regardless of the probability of 
exercise, as this is not within the Group’s control. As this put option was issued as part of a business combination, accounted for in accordance 
with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004), any change in remeasuring the derivative to fair value is recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
(note 31). 108 Cable & Wireless Communications

ii. Interest rate swap
At acquisition on 6 April 201 1, the Bahamas Telecommunications Company held an interest rate swap to economically hedge the interest rate 
risks associated with a loan from a consortium of banks led by Citibank N.A. The effect of the swap is to convert the floating rate loan at US 
three months LIBOR plus 1.35% into a fixed rate loan at 4.59% per annum. 
As at 31 March 2012, the interest rate swap had a negative fair value of US$1 million. The hedge did not qualify for hedge accounting, 
therefore the decrease in fair value of US$1 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement. The interest rate swap matured on 
15 February 2013. The increase in fair value of US$1 million is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
24 Financial instruments at fair value
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels are defined as follows:
Level 1 – Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either 
directly (from prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
Level 3 – Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

US$5,248 million).
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates where the Group controls the timing of 
remittance and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not 
been recognised is US$198 million (31 March 2012 – US$296 million). These temporary differences relate to unremitted earnings.
The Budget on 20 March 2013 announced a further reduction to the UK corporation tax rate to 20% from 1 April 2015. This change had not 
been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and therefore is not recognised in these financial statements.

Property
Provision has been made for dilapidation costs and for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments or cost of exit in 
respect of vacant properties. Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be 
derived from the vacant properties being sublet. The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease 
contract life.
Redundancy
Provision has been made for the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date. Amounts provided for and 
spent during the periods presented primarily relate to regional transformation activities. The provision is expected to be used within one year.
Network and asset retirement obligations 
Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity. The provision is 
expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites, technical sites, mobile cell 
sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling. This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arises. 
Legal and other
Legal and other provisions include amounts relating to specific legal claims against the Group together with amounts in respect of certain 
employee benefits and sales taxes. Legal proceedings are further discussed in note 34.
27 Retirement benefits obligations 
Accounting policy detailed in note 2.13. ▶
The Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees. These schemes include both defined benefit 
schemes, where retirement benefits are based on employees’ remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, where 
retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees. Contributions to the defined 
benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes
Cable & Wireless Communications operates the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (CWSF). This plan provides defined benefit and defined 
contribution arrangements for current and former employees of the Group. The CWSF has been closed to new defined benefit members since 
1998.
Additionally, the Group operates unfunded defined benefit arrangements in the UK. These primarily relate to pension provisions for former 
Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap. The Group operates other 
defined benefit pension schemes in Macau, Jamaica, Barbados and Guernsey.
Funding valuation – Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund
The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the CWSF was carried out by independent actuaries Towers Watson Limited as at 31 March 2010. 
The March 2010 actuarial valuation showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to meet the future 
benefit accrual was 38.4% of pensionable earnings (33.4% employer’s and 5.0% employee’s). This contribution rate will be reviewed when the 
next triennial valuation is carried out, at 31 March 2013. The terms of the CWSF Trust Deed also allow the Trustee or the Company to call for a 
valuation at any time. 
Cable & Wireless Communications paid a total contribution of US$2 million in 2012/13 (2011/12 – US$2 million), to the CWSF. A deficit 
recovery funding plan was also agreed with the Trustees during March 2011 as part of the March 2010 actuarial valuation with the aim that 
the deficit would be eliminated by April 2016. The payments under this agreement will fall within the following ranges: July 2014 – £20.5 
million to £30.4 million (US$31.2 million to US$46.3 million); July 2015 – £21.1 million to £31.3 million (US$32.2 million to US$47.7 million); 
and April 2016 – £21.9 million to £32.5 million (US$33.4 million to US$49.5 million). These contributions are based on best estimated 
investment returns and are subject to the outcome of the next full valuation due in March 2013.
During 2008, the CWSF Trustee agreed an insurance buy-in of the UK pensioner liabilities with Prudential Insurance. The buy-in involved the 
purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the CWSF under which Prudential Insurance assumed responsibility for the benefits payable to the CWSF’s 
UK pensioners. These pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the CWSF. On 19 December 2011, a further 233 
pensioners, those having commenced with pensions in payment since the original annuity, were brought within the bulk annuity policy for a net 
cost of £57 million (US$88 million), which was funded from gilts held by the CWSF. 112 Cable & Wireless Communications
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Contingent funding agreement
The Group is party to a contingent funding agreement with the CWSF Trustee, under which the Trustee can call for a letter of credit or cash 
escrow in certain circumstances, such as the breach by the Group of certain financial covenants, the incurrence by the Group of secured debt 
above an agreed level or the failure to maintain available commitments under the revolving credit facilities of at least US$150 million. 
Following the Group’s issue of the 2020 bonds in January 2012 (note 22), and the consequential increase in the Group’s available secured 
borrowings, letters of credit totalling £100 million (US$152 million) (2011/12 – US$160 million) as of 31 March 2013 have been issued in 
favour of the CWSF Trustee under the Contingent Funding Agreement. The letters of credit will remain in place pursuant to the terms of the 
Contingent Funding Agreement (which may be until the deficit of the CWSF is fully funded).
IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation – Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and other schemes
The IAS 19 valuations of the major defined benefit pension schemes and medical plans operated by the Group have been updated to 31 March 
2013 by qualified independent actuaries. Lane, Clark & Peacock LLP prepared the valuation for the CWSF and the UK unfunded arrangements. 
Towers Watson Limited reviewed the IAS 19 valuations prepared for all remaining schemes.

Assumptions used are best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which may not necessarily be borne out in practice. 
The assumptions shown above for other schemes represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes.
The assumptions regarding current mortality rates in retirement were set having regard to the actual experience of the CWSF’s pensioners 
and dependants over the three years ended 31 March 2010. In addition, allowance was made for future mortality improvements in line with 
medium cohort projections of the 1992 mortality series tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, subject to a minimum 
annual rate of improvement of 1.5%. These are the mortality rates used for calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 
31 March 2013. 
The mortality rates used for the figure in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2013 are the same as those which were used for 
calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2012.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners aged 60 are as follows:
On 
31 March 
2013
(years)
On 
31 March 
2023 
(years)
On 
31 March 
2033

Male pensioners and dependants 28.0 29.6 31.2
Female pensioners 26.7 28.2 29.7
Female dependants 32.6 34.2 35.8 Annual report 2012/13 113
A one year increase in the life expectancy assumptions would have increased the CWSF liabilities by approximately US$51 million as at 
31 March 2013. The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy would be 
US$39 million. A 0.25% pa decrease in the discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities would have increased the liabilities by around 
US$77 million. The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy would be 
US$43 million. A 0.25% pa change in the assumed rate of salary increases would have changed the liabilities by a negligible amount.
Excluding the annuities, which are measured at the value of the obligation to which they relate, the overall expected rate of return for each 
pension scheme is a weighted average of the expected asset return for each asset class. The expected asset return for each asset class has 
been set as a best estimate of the long-term return that will be achieved for the particular asset class in the country in question having regard 
to investment yields on the measurement date.
Using the projected unit method for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage 
of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees of the CWSF during 2010/11 constitutes a minimal funding requirement. An 
adjustment to the deficit in the CWSF to account for the minimum funding requirement has been calculated in accordance with IFRIC 14 
The limits on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction . The adjustment to the deficit, which is recorded 
in other comprehensive income, was US$30 million as at 31 March 2013 (2011/12 – US$26 million).
When defined benefit funds have an IAS 19 surplus, they are recorded at the lower of that surplus and the future economic benefits available in 
the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded in other comprehensive income. The 
effect of these adjustments, described as asset ceiling adjustments, were US$16 million as at 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012 – US$9 million). 114 Cable & Wireless Communications

The aggregate nominal value of the shares allotted in the year was US$nil (2011/12 – US$nil).
Included within the number of shares disclosed in the table above are treasury shares and shares held by The Cable & Wireless Communications 
Share Ownership Trust (the Trust). 
No treasury shares of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc were cancelled during the periods presented. 
Share buy-back
On 21 July 2010, the Group’s shareholders approved a resolution at the AGM for the Group to purchase up to 262 million ordinary shares. This 
authority to buy-back these shares expired at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM on 22 July 2011. Under the resolution, during the year 
ended 31 March 2012, the Company purchased 94,726,873 ordinary shares at an average price of 43 pence per share (US70 cents per share), 
with a nominal value of US$5 million, for consideration of US$66 million. Consideration included stamp duty and commission of US$0.4 million. 
At 31 March 2013 a total of 137 ,488,873 shares were classified as treasury shares (31 March 2012 – 137 ,488,873). This represented 5% of 
called-up share capital at the beginning of the year (201 1/12 – 5%).
The nominal value and market value of treasury shares held at 31 March 2013 was US$7 million (2011/12 – US$7 million) and US$88 million 
(2011/12 – US$71 million) respectively. Disclosures in respect of the shares held by the Trust are included in note 29.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, each share (other than those held in treasury) entitles the holder to one vote at 
General Meetings of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. The Company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary 
resolution but the payment cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. There are no restrictions on the repayment of capital 
other than those imposed by law. For further information refer to pages 44 to 45 of the Directors’ and corporate governance report.
There were no allotments of ordinary shares of US5 cents made during the year (2011/12 – no allotments). 
Capital management 
The Group defines capital as equity, borrowings (note 22) and cash and cash equivalents (note 19). The Group does not have any externally 
imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by Company Law.
The Group is currently undertaking a change in its geographical focus with steps taken during 2012/13 through the agreement to sell the 
majority of the Monaco & Islands operating segment and the Macau operating segment.
The Board’s objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives, including but not limited to reshaping the 
portfolio through mergers and acquisitions. In doing so the Board seeks to:
 — Manage funding and liquidity risk;
 — Optimise shareholder return; and
 — Maintain credit ratings.
This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with the policies described in note 36.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit aggregate borrowing up to the higher of three times the adjusted capital and reserves of the 
Group or US$3 billion.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders and it 
intends to target a sustainable and progressive dividend that reflects the underlying cash generation and growth outlook of the business. This 
process is managed through the Group’s budget and longer-term forecasting process.  Annual report 2012/13 117
Subsequent to year end the Group received total cash proceeds of US$601 million in respect of the Islands sub-group disposal (note 38) 
representing consideration of US$570 million plus US$31 million of the proportionate share of net cash in the disposed businesses attributable 
to Cable & Wireless Communications. Proceeds have been used to repay drawn bank facilities, including the revolving credit facility of 
US$360 million (note 22) and other facilities of US$25 million. In line with the Board’s objectives, remaining proceeds will be used for investment 
opportunities. In the absence of suitable investment opportunities, the remaining proceeds will be used to de-leverage the balance sheet. 
Both the US dollar secured bonds of US$400 million and US$500 million maturing respectively in 2020 and 2017 maintained a credit rating of 
Ba2 with Moody’s and BB with Standard and Poor’s. The unsecured sterling bond repayable in 2019 also maintained its credit rating with 
Standard and Poor’s of B+. 
Foreign currency translation and hedging reserve
The foreign currency translation and hedging reserve contains exchange differences on the translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency 
different to the presentation currency of the Group. It also includes cumulative exchange differences arising on the translation of hedging 
instruments.
Capital and Other reserves
In 2012/13, Other reserves included a capital redemption reserve of US$152 million (2011/12 – US$152 million), a revaluation reserve of 
US$30 million (2011/12 – US$30 million), a fair value reserve of US$20 million (2011/12 – US$16 million), a special reserve of US$2,137 
million (2011/12 – US$2,137 million) and a capital reserve of US$987 million (2011/12 – US$987 million), less a reserve relating to 
transactions with non-controlling interests of US$5 million (2011/12 – US$1 million). 
The special reserve relates to the cancellation of the share premium account of Cable & Wireless Limited (formerly Cable and Wireless plc) in 
February 2004. It will reduce from time to time by the amount of any increase in the paid-up share capital and share premium account of Cable 
& Wireless Limited after 20 February 2004 resulting from the issue of new shares for cash or other new consideration or upon a capitalisation 
of distributable reserves.
On 26 March 2010, a court-approved capital reduction became effective which had the effect of creating a capital reserve of US$1,931 million 
which may be released, in whole or in part, to distributable reserves of the Company at the discretion (and upon the resolution) of the Board of 
Directors or a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors. 
During 2011/12, the Board approved the release of US$200 million from the capital reserve to distributable reserves.

Accounting policy detailed in note 2.13. ▶
Share option schemes 
The Group does not currently have any outstanding share option awards over its own shares (2011/12 – nil). There are 1,246,303 outstanding 
share option awards relating to options granted by Cable and Wireless plc to senior employees (2011/12 – 7 ,710,684 outstanding options). 
These options were originally granted over Cable and Wireless plc shares at exercise prices between 101 to 154 pence. All options have vested 
in full. Subsequent to the demerger, these options have been redesignated as an option over a stapled unit of one share in Cable & Wireless 
Communications Plc and one share in Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc (an unrelated company). The share price of Cable & Wireless 
Communications Plc at 31 March 2013 and the final share price of Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc prior to its takeover by Vodafone Group 
were such that the obligation for these stapled unit options was US$nil (at 31 March 2012 – US$nil).
During the year, no options were exercised (201 1/12 – no options were exercised). 6,464,381 options lapsed during the year (2011/12 – 
5,995,089).
Other equity instrument awards
Performance shares
Executive Directors and other senior executives can receive awards of performance shares at nil cost.
The vesting of outstanding performance shares granted in June 2010 and 2011 are subject to Cable & Wireless Communications Plc absolute 
TSR performance conditions (see performance conditions for share-based award on page 59). For the performance shares granted in January 
2013, performance is based on a combination of relative TSR against a bespoke comparator group and Earnings per Share (EPS) performance 
measures. A dividend award supplement operates on all these awards. Dividends that would have been paid on the performance shares which 
vest will be regarded as having been reinvested in additional shares at the notional date of distribution.
Restricted Share Plan
Restricted shares are awarded to senior management and selected other employees, primarily as a retention or a recruitment tool. Generally, 
restricted shares vest over periods of one to three years from grant date. 118 Cable & Wireless Communications

Cable & Wireless Communications Share Purchase Plan
The Company also offered its employees, who are chargeable to income tax under Section 15 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, 
the opportunity to participate in the Cable & Wireless Communications Share Purchase Plan which is a HMRC-approved share incentive plan. 
Under the Share Purchase Plan, employees could contribute up to £1,500 or 10% of salary each tax year (whichever is the lower), to buy 
partnership shares in the Company, and the Company offered a matching award of one share for each partnership share purchased. From 
13 April 2012, the Share Purchase Plan is no longer offered. The existing shares will remain in the plan until such time as they would ordinarily 
vest in accordance with plan rules. 
The Cable & Wireless Communications Share Ownership Trust
The Cable & Wireless Communications Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) is a discretionary trust, which was funded by loans from Cable and 
Wireless plc (now Cable & Wireless Limited) to acquire shares in Cable and Wireless plc. Subsequent to the demerger, the shares held by the 
Trust were converted into one share in Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and one share in Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc for every share 
in Cable and Wireless plc held.
At 31 March 2013, the Trust held 34,598,177 shares in Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (of which 2,780,411 are shares awarded to the 
Executive Directors under the Deferred Bonus Plan and which carry dividend rights) with a market value of US$22 million. The remaining shares 
in Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc were sold during the year (2011/12 – 37 ,524,230 shares in Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and 
15,398,747 shares in Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc with a market value of US$28 million).

Commitments
Capital commitments at the end of the financial year for the continuing Group relating to the purchase of plant and equipment of US$59 million 
(2011/12 – US$93 million). No provision has been made for these commitments. US$11 million (31 March 2012 – US$9 million) of these 
commitments relate to the Group’s share of the capital commitments of its joint ventures and associates. Capital commitments at 31 March 
2012 included US$21 million in respect of discontinued operations.
In addition, the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s business. The most significant of 
these relate to network operating and maintenance costs. In the event of default of another party, the Group may be liable to additional 
contributions under the terms of the agreements.
The Group leases land and buildings and networks under various lease agreements. The leases have varying terms, escalations, clauses and 
renewal rights.

30 Commitments, guarantees and contingent liabilities continued
Other guarantees
Other guarantees include guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of property, other leases and letters of credit, and includes 
guarantees in respect of the demerged business of Cable & Wireless Worldwide. The Group is party to a contingent funding agreement with the 
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (CWSF) Trustee, under which the Trustee can call for a letter of credit or cash escrow in certain 
circumstances, such as the breach by the Group of certain financial covenants, the incurrence by the Group of secured debt above an agreed 
level or the failure to maintain available commitments under the revolving credit facilities of at least US$150 million. 
Following the Group’s issue of the 2020 bonds in January 2012 (note 22), and the consequential increase in the Group’s available secured 
borrowings, letters of credit totalling £100 million (US$152 million) (2011/12 – US$160 million) as of 31 March 2013 have been issued in 
favour of the CWSF Trustee under the Contingent Funding Agreement. The letters of credit will remain in place pursuant to the terms of the 
Contingent Funding Agreement (which may be until the deficit of the CWSF is fully funded).
In addition, the Group, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, has given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of 
disposals of subsidiary undertakings. Consistent with this practice, the Group has given guarantees and indemnities in respect of its disposal of 
the majority of the Monaco & Islands business. Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although 
some uncapped indemnities have been given. The Group also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including 
facility sharing agreements. Some of these agreements do not contain liability caps.
The Group has provided guarantees of US$1 million (201 1/12 – US$2 million) to third parties in respect of trading contracts between third 
parties and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group (a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc) 
has agreed a fee schedule for the benefit of these guarantees. To date, the Group has not been required to make any payments in respect of its 
obligations under these trading guarantees.
Contingent liabilities
Under the Separation Agreement, Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide agree to provide each other with certain 
customary indemnities on a reciprocal basis in respect of liabilities which the Group may incur but which relate exclusively to the Cable & 
Wireless Worldwide Group and vice versa and in respect of an agreed proportion of liabilities which do not relate exclusively to one Group or the 
other.
Whilst Pender, the Group’s former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite new business from April 2003, it has in the past written policies in 
favour of the Group and third parties. Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party 
policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with reinsurers. Significant progress has been made in resolving these 
claims. Details of these insurance claims and potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such 
claims (note 34).
Whilst the Group has ceased participation in the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF), it may be liable for contributions to fund a 
portion of any funding deficits which may occur in the future. The Group has made arrangements with MNOPF to pay invoices totalling £1.7 
million, plus interest, relating to the actuarial valuations made by the MNOPF trustee as at 31 March 2003, 2006 and 2009, by instalments 
over the next seven years. It is possible that the MNOPF trustee may invoice us in the future for additional amounts to the extent that there is 
an actuarially determined funding deficit. It is not possible to quantify the amount of any potential additional funding liability at this time.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of BTC included the value of expected synergies resulting from the integration into the existing business and 
other intangible assets that did not meet the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets as they were unable to be separately 
identified. Acquisition costs related to BTC of US$7 million were recorded in other operating expenses in 2011/12. A non-controlling interest of 
US$135 million has been recognised in the 201 1/12 accounts as at acquisition date measured at cost.
In 2011/12, from the date of its acquisition on 6 April 2011, BTC contributed US$352 million to Group revenue, US$91 million to Group EBITDA 
and US$13 million to Group profit after tax. There is no material difference in the results of BTC included in these accounts since acquisition on 
6 April 2011 and the results of BTC for the full year from 1 April 2011.
Monaco Telecom
Goodwill in connection with the Group’s investment in Monaco Telecom SAM increased by US$41 million during the year (2011/12 – US$33 
million). The goodwill balance increased as a result of exchange differences and changes in the fair value of the Monaco Telecom put option.
As part of the acquisition of Monaco Telecom a put option was issued (note 23). Changes in the fair value of this put option are treated as 
contingent consideration and adjusted against goodwill. The cash outflow in respect of contingent consideration, being the dividend paid to the 
Principality as the non-controlling shareholder of Monaco Telecom, was US$33 million (2011/12 – US$17 million).

32 Related party transactions 
Transactions with joint ventures and associates
All trade transactions with joint ventures and associates arise in the normal course of business and primarily relate to fees for use of the Group’s 
products and services, network and access charges. Group subsidiaries had transactions with Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and 
Tobago Ltd during the year. The transactions were in relation to the sale and purchase of mobile services. In respect of these transactions, 
US$3 million has been reported within revenue and US$2 million in cost of sales (2011/12 – US$3 million and US$1 million respectively). 
During 2011/12 the Group invested US$5 million in Seychelles Cable System Limited which is classified as an associate within discontinued 
operations (note 9). 
The Group received dividends of US$6 million from joint ventures and associates (2011/12 – US$4 million) . At 31 March 2013, joint ventures 
and associates owed US$2 million (31 March 2012 – US$2 million) in respect of trading balances.
There were no other material trade transactions with joint ventures and associates during the year.
Transactions with key management personnel
At 31 March 2011, two Directors held bonds issued by Cable & Wireless Limited and Cable and Wireless International Finance B.V. with a 
nominal value of US$4,211,156 (£2,630,000) (purchased in prior periods). Both Directors sold their entire holding during the year ended 
31 March 2012. The interest earned on these bonds prior to disposal during the year ended 31 March 2012 was US$55,426 which was fully 
settled. A profit of US$790,719 was realised upon the sale of the bonds.
A Director’s spouse held bonds issued by Cable and Wireless International Finance BV. These bonds had a nominal value at 31 March 2013 of 
US$731,472 (£480,000) (31 March 2012 – US$766,416 (£480,000)). The interest earned on those bonds during the year was US$65,404 
of which US$1,037 remained unpaid at 31 March 2013 (201 1/12 – US$66,132 of which US$903 remained unpaid at 31 March 2012). 
A Director’s spouse held bonds issued by Cable & Wireless Limited. The Director retired during the year. These bonds had a nominal value at 
31 March 2012 of US$15,967 (£10,000). The interest earned on those bonds during the year until retirement was US$344 which has been 
paid in full (2011/12 – US$1,398 of which US$901 remained unpaid at 31 March 2012). 
During the prior year, two children of a Director purchased bonds issued by Cable and Wireless International Finance BV. These bonds had a 
nominal value at 31 March 2013 of US$761,950 (£500,000) (31 March 2012 – US$798,350 (£500,000)). The interest earned on those 
bonds during the year was US$68,128 of which US$1,080 remained unpaid at 31 March 2013 (2011/12 – US$25,410 of which US$940 
remained unpaid at 31 March 2012).
During the year a Director purchased a car from the Company for market value.
Director and key management remuneration is disclosed in note 6c.
Transactions with other related parties
There are no controlling shareholders of the Group. There have been no material transactions with the shareholders of the Group.
Pensions contributions to Group schemes are disclosed in note 27.
Other than the parties disclosed above, the Group has no other material related parties.
33 Licences and operating agreements 
In all countries in which it operates, the Group holds licences to operate or operating agreements. These licences and operating agreements 
take a variety of forms and their terms, rights and obligations vary significantly. The Group assumes that it will renew these licences and 
operating agreements as they expire. Previous history indicates this is the most likely outcome.
The Group is currently in the process of renewing its licences and operating agreements in Antigua & Barbuda and Montserrat.
The Group does not have any concession agreements with governments that fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 Service Concession 
Arrangements.
On demerger of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide business, the Cable & Wireless brand was transferred to a joint venture entity owned by, and 
for the continuing use of, the Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Groups. As part of this transfer, Cable & 
Wireless Communications received a royalty-free licence, granting rights to use the Cable & Wireless brand in all of the Group’s jurisdictions 
with the exception of Macau and North and West Africa, which are branded differently. Further, the Group retains a licence to use the Cable & 
Wireless logo globally. These licence arrangements remain in force despite Vodafone Group Plc’s acquisition of Cable & Wireless Worldwide 
Group in July 2012.
There were no other significant changes to the terms of the licences held by the Group’s subsidiaries or operating agreements with 
governments during the periods presented.  Annual report 2012/13 123
34 Legal proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in litigation proceedings, regulatory claims, investigations and reviews. The facts and 
circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated in determining whether it is more likely than not that there will be a future outflow of 
funds and, once established, whether a provision relating to a specific case is necessary or sufficient. Accordingly, significant management 
judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The Group does not 
expect the ultimate resolution of the actions to which it is a party to have a significant adverse impact on the financial position of the Group.
35 Subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates
Accounting policy detailed in note 2.1. ▶
The Group comprises a large number of companies and it is not practical to include all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those

1 The Cable & Wireless Communications Group regards this company as a subsidiary because it controls the majority of the Board of Directors through a shareholders’ agreement.
2  This company is audited by a firm other than KPMG Audit plc and its international member firms.
3  The Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds an economic interest of 55% in Monaco Telecom SAM via a contractual arrangement. See below for further discussion.
4  From 6 April 2011.
 
On 18 June 2004, the Group acquired 55% of Monaco Telecom, a Monaco-based telecommunications service provider, from Vivendi Universal. 
Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & Wireless Communications transferred legal ownership of 6% of the shares of Monaco Telecom to 
an unrelated third party. The Group contractually retained voting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement. In addition, the 
6% interest is subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and economic rights, provide full management 
control of Monaco Telecom to the Group.
The Group has also entered into a shareholders’ agreement with the Principality of Monaco (Principality) that contains, among other provisions, 
mutual pre-emption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favour of the Principality. The Principality has a put option 
entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco Telecom to the Group in one or several instalments until 30 April 2019. The exercise price 
under the put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco Telecom (note 23).
Full details of all subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates and trade investments will be attached to the Company’s next Annual 
Return, to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
36 Financial risk management 
Treasury policy 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Day to 
day management of treasury activities is delegated to the Group’s treasury function (Treasury), within specified financial limits for each type of 
transaction and counterparty.
To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Group policies and delegated authorities. Material 
subsidiary positions are monitored by Treasury. Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board. All subsidiaries are required to 
report details of their cash and debt positions to Treasury on a monthly basis.
The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest rate and foreign currency risk. 
The majority of the Group’s cash resources (including facilities) and borrowings are managed centrally by Treasury.
The Group may use derivatives including forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and options, where 
appropriate, in the management of its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The use of these instruments is in accordance with 
strategies agreed from time to time by Treasury and subject to policies approved by the Board. Derivatives are not used for trading or 
speculative purposes and derivative transactions and positions are monitored and reported by Treasury on a regular basis and are subject to 
policies adopted by the Board.
Exchange rate risk
The Group trades in many countries and a proportion of its revenue is generated in currencies other than US dollars. The Group is exposed to 
movements in exchange rates in relation to non-dollar currency payments (including external dividends, the London corporate centre costs and 
pensions), dividend income from foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries and 
the net asset carrying value of non-US dollar investments. Exchange risk is managed centrally by the London corporate centre on a matching 
cash flow basis including forecast foreign currency cash repatriation inflows from subsidiaries and forecast foreign currency payments. 
See note 2.3 for key exchange rates used.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign exchange 
contracts and other derivative and financial instruments to reduce the exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short 
term. The Group will undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions that create significant foreign exchange exposures 
for the Group where appropriate. Where cost-effective and possible, foreign subsidiaries are financed in their domestic currency to minimise 
the impact of translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
As part of the overall policy of managing the exposure arising from foreign exchange movements relating to the net carrying value of overseas 
investments, the Group may, from time to time, elect to match certain foreign currency liabilities against the carrying value of foreign 
investments.
The reported profits of the Group are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Overseas earnings are predominately 
in US dollars or currencies linked to the US dollar. However the Group also has overseas earnings in other currencies.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in relation to financial instruments which are not in the functional currency of the entity that 
holds them. In broad terms, based on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2013 the impact of a unilateral 10% weakening of the US 
dollar would have been to decrease profit from continuing operations by approximately US$36 million (at 31 March 2012 – US$30 million).
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash balances and variable rate loans although there is a degree of offset 
between the two. Treasury may seek to reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest rate exposure whilst taking account of prevailing 
market conditions as appropriate. 
At 31 March 2013, 64% (31 March 2012 – 86%) of the Group’s loans were at a fixed rate. A reduction in interest rates would have an 
unfavourable impact upon the fair value of the Group’s fixed rate loans. However, no debt is held for trading purposes and it is intended that it 
will be kept in place until maturity. As a result, there is no exposure to fair value loss on fixed rate borrowings and, as such, its effect has not 
been modelled.
A one percentage point increase in interest rates will have a US$2 million (2011/12 – US$3 million) impact on the income received from the 
surplus cash balances of the Group and a US$6 million (201 1/12 – US$2 million) impact on the floating rate loans of the Group. The impact on 
equity is limited to the impact on profit or loss. Annual report 2012/13 125
Credit risk
Cash deposits and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be recognised if a counterparty 
failed to perform as contracted. The carrying amount of the financial assets of the Group represents the maximum credit exposure of the 
Group. Management seeks to reduce this credit risk by ensuring the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Group’s financial 
instruments are the core relationship banks. These banks are awarded a maximum credit limit based on ratings by Standard & Poor’s and 
Moody’s, the level of the banks’ credit default swap (CDS) and its associated level of tier one capital. The credit limit assigned to counterparties 
is monitored on a continuing basis. These limits reflect exposure for the Group as a whole to any one counterparty in a range of US$25 million to 
US$100 million. 
The Group Treasury policy approved by the Board contain limits on exposure and prescribes the types of instrument used for investment of 
funds. Credit risk on receivables is discussed in note 17.
Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that the operating units manage their own operational liquidity supported by the London corporate centre, which manages 
its own liquidity to meet its financial obligations of servicing and repaying external debt, external dividends, London costs and strategic 
initiatives. The principal source of liquidity for the London corporate centre is repatriation cash inflows from the operating units supported by 
bank finance, bond issuances and asset disposals.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$152 million. These amounts are highly liquid and are a significant component 
of the Group’s overall liquidity and capital resources, which also includes the undrawn revolving credit facilities of US$240 million.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, to ensure covenant compliance and 
that medium-term liquidity is maintained and for the purpose of identifying long-term strategic funding requirements. The Directors also 
regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
Approximately 15% of the Group’s cash is invested in short-term bank deposits and money market funds (2011/12 – 40%).
Certain foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions which may restrict the ability to repatriate cash to the Group from time to time. Where 
restrictions are severe, local cash balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts approval
These accounts were approved by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2013 and authorised for issue.
Monaco & Islands disposal 
On 3 April 2013, the Group completed the sale of the majority of the Islands sub-group to Batelco Group (Batelco) as part of a transaction 
described in note 9. 
Following receipt of the required consents and approvals the Group completed the sale of its businesses in the Maldives, the Channel Islands, 
Isle of Man, South Atlantic and Diego Garcia. Regulatory approval for the transfer of CWC’s business in the Seychelles has not yet been 
obtained. 
Batelco also acquired a 25% shareholding in Compagnie Monegasque de Communication SAM (CMC), the holding company of the Group’s 
interest in Monaco Telecom. As described in note 9, a put option over the 25% shareholding in CMC was also issued to Batelco on 3 April 2013. 
The CMC put option enables Batelco to require the Group to repurchase the 25% CMC shareholding for US$100 million in the event that the 
regulatory approval from the Principality of Monaco is not granted within 12 months of 3 April 2013. Batelco can exercise this put option 
between 18 and 19 months from 3 April 2013. The Group will account for the put option as a financial liability using the anticipated acquisition 
method, as if it had been exercised. 
On 3 April 2013, the Group received total cash proceeds of US$601 million in respect of these transactions. This represents consideration of 
$470 million for the Islands sub-group plus $31 million of net cash in the disposed businesses attributable to CWC, together with US$100 
million in respect of the 25% shareholdings in CMC. 
In April 2013, the cash proceeds were used by the Group to repay US$360 million of the revolving credit facility (note 22) and US$25 million of 
other borrowings.
Strategic alliance with Columbus Networks 
On 13 May 2013, the Group announced it had entered into a strategic alliance with Columbus Networks Ltd (‘Columbus’) to develop its 
international wholesale capacity business. 
The alliance will initially operate by providing joint sales and marketing services for each of CWC’s and Columbus’ international wholesale 
capacity services. Columbus has a 72.5% majority share in, and management control of, the formal arrangement and CWC has a 27.5% share.
The alliance will be broadened within the next two years with Columbus and CWC contributing their sub-sea and related assets into a new 
company with the same respective shareholdings, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and certain other conditions being met. Until then, 
Columbus and CWC will retain complete ownership and control of their respective existing networks.
The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s earnings. Group assets subject to the joint venture arrangement had a 
book value of US$108 million, and recorded a loss before tax of US$1 million in the year to 31 March 2013.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013
1 Statement of accounting policies 
1.1 Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United Kingdom and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis where appropriate.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not the Cable & Wireless Communications Group (the Group) which it 
heads. The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements.
The Company is exempt under FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures from the requirement to provide its own financial instruments 
disclosures on the grounds that they are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply 
with the IFRS equivalent standard.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$), as this is the functional currency of the Company at 31 March 2013, and rounded to 
the nearest million. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting Policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the 
change has a material impact on the reported results for the year.
1.2 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at historical cost less any impairments recognised. Impairment reviews are carried 
out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable. 
Impairments are determined by comparing the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary to its recoverable amount, being the higher of 
the subsidiary’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value represents market value in an active market. Value in use is determined 
by discounting future cash flows arising from the subsidiary with reference to the Group’s own projections using pre-tax discount rates which 
represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Company. Impairments are recognised in profit or loss.
1.3 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held. 
The Company currently does not hold or classify any financial assets under these categories. The basis of determining fair values is set out in 
note 1.4.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Recognition and measurement
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the 
Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired.
1.4 Fair value estimation
The nominal value (less estimated impairments) of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair value of 
financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the 
Company for similar financial instruments. Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial 
instruments. Annual report 2012/13 131
1.5 Tax 
The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of 
certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the 
extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen 
but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.6 Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.
1.7 Share-based compensation
The Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary companies over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over 
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the 
number of options that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in the profit and loss, and a corresponding 
adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are 
exercised. The Company recognises an additional investment in subsidiaries equivalent to the equity instruments granted, being a capital 
contribution to those subsidiaries.

10 Related party transactions 
Under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose transactions with entities that are part of the

controlled within the Group.
Related party transactions are detailed in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements. 
11 Subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates
Principal subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates are detailed in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group comprises a large number of companies and it is not practical to include all of them. The list therefore only includes those companies 
whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affects the figures shown in the financial statements.
The Company does not have any direct investment in the subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates listed in note 35 to the consolidated 
financial statements, with the exception of Cable & Wireless Limited.
Full details of all subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates and trade investments will be attached to the Company’s Annual Return, 
to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales.
12 Dividends

Dividend information is detailed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
13 Commitments 
The Company had no capital commitments at 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012 – no capital commitments).
14 Guarantees and contingent liabilities
Under the Separation Agreement, Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc agree to provide each other with 
certain customary indemnities on a reciprocal basis in respect of liabilities which Cable & Wireless Communications may incur but which relate 
exclusively to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and vice versa and in respect of an agreed proportion of liabilities which do not relate 
exclusively to one group or the other.
Whilst Pender, the Group’s former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite new business from April 2003, it has in the past written policies in 
favour of the Group and third parties. Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party 
policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with reinsurers. Significant progress has been made in resolving these 
claims. Details of these insurance claims and potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such 
claims.
In addition, the Company, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, has given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number 
of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years. Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, 
although some uncapped indemnities have been given. The Company also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements 
including facility sharing agreements. Some of these agreements do not contain liability caps. 134 Cable & Wireless Communications

Definitions
This Annual report of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc has 
been prepared in accordance with English legal and UK Listing Rules 
requirements. The Annual review for the year ended 31 March 2013 
is published as a separate document. 
Unless otherwise stated in this Annual report, the terms ‘Cable & 
Wireless Communications’, the ‘Group’, ‘CWC’, ‘Cable & Wireless 
Communications Group’, ‘it’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refer to Cable & 
Wireless Communications Plc and its subsidiaries collectively. The 
term ‘Company’ and ‘Parent Company’ refer to Cable & Wireless 
Communications Plc. The terms ‘Cable & Wireless’ and ‘Cable & 
Wireless Group’ refer to the former Cable and Wireless plc and its 
subsidiaries collectively. The term ‘Cable & Wireless Worldwide 
group’ refers to Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc and its subsidiaries 
collectively, which was demerged from the former Cable and 
Wireless plc on 26 March 2010, and since July 2012 has been 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc.
Unless otherwise indicated, any reference in this report to financial 
statements is to the consolidated financial statements of Cable & 
Wireless Communications on pages 71 to 127. References to a year 
in this report are, unless otherwise indicated, references to the year 
ended 31 March 2013 (the financial year).
Cable & Wireless Communications prepares its financial information 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) applicable for use in the European Union (EU). The Company 
prepares its financial information in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP).
In this report, financial and non-financial information is, unless 
otherwise indicated, stated on the basis of the Group’s financial year. 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation and net other operating and non-operating income 
and expense. Unless otherwise stated, EBITDA excludes exceptional 
items. Exceptional items are material items which derive from 
individual events that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group 
that are identified as exceptional items by virtue of their size, nature 
or incidence. Operating cash flow is defined as pre-exceptional 
EBITDA less balance sheet capital expenditure. Adjusted earnings per 
share (adjusted EPS) is before exceptional items, transaction costs, 
gain/(loss) on disposals and amortisation of acquired intangibles. 
Return on Invested Capital is defined as total operating profit 
before exceptional items divided by average adjusted invested 
capital. Average adjusted invested capital for continuing operations 
is after deducting deferred tax assets; retirement benefit assets; 
the goodwill balance attributable to the Monaco Telecom put 
option (less the current portion of the related put option financial 
liability); interest bearing assets; total assets and current liabilities 
for discontinued operations; and adding back interest bearing 
current liabilities. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is 
provided on pages 125 to 126.
Where appropriate to aid understanding of our results compared to 
the prior year, we refer to financial performance on a total Group 
and/or constant currency basis. Constant currency figures are 
calculated by retranslating prior year figures at the exchange rates 
used during 2012/13 to eliminate the impact of movements in 
exchange rates.
Information has been updated to the most practical date prior to the 
approval date of the document, being 21 May 2013.
Companies Act 2006
Pages 1 to 33 constitute the Chairman’s statement and Business 
review of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and, for the 
purposes of section 463 of the Companies Act 2006, are 
incorporated by reference into the Directors’ report set out on 
pages 37 to 50 and shall be deemed to form part of that report.
English law 
Pages 1 to 67 inclusive consist of a Directors’ report that has been 
drawn up and presented in accordance with and in reliance upon 
English company law. The liabilities of the Directors in connection 
with that report shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions 
provided by such law. Cornwall’s Victorian Silicon Valley
Laid by the Eastern Telegraph Company (later to become Cable and 
Wireless), the first undersea cable to land on Porthcurno’s sandy beach 
forged a link between Britain and Bombay. Porthcurno grew to 
become the largest and busiest telegraph cable station in the world; 
by the late 1920s a network of 14 undersea cables made it one of the 
most connected places on Earth.
Previously the fastest means of international communication was by 
packet ship. Sub-sea telegraph technology, the use of electrical pulses 
to send Morse code messages via cable, was a world-shaping 
breakthrough in communications technology.
Porthcurno was also an important centre for education. The Cable & 
Wireless international college was a leading training institution for the 
telecommunications industry.
The communications hub became so strategically important during 
World War II that the telegraph station was moved into fortified 
underground tunnels. For many visitors today, these impressive 
tunnels, and the working telegraph instruments within, form 
a memorable highlight of their experience.
Two major tourism industry awards received in late 2012 and early 
2013 have reinforced the museum’s reputation as a unique heritage 
attraction.

The PK Trust, the charity that runs Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, 
houses the historical archive of our Group. From staff records and 
photographs, to artefacts and film footage, the archive is the 
embodiment of our heritage, a rich record of people and places.
We are proud to sponsor the PK Trust and Porthcurno Telegraph 
Museum, which is an educational charity, focused on the history, 
science and innovation of telegraph and wireless communications. 
Through our work with the Museum, we help to underpin and raise 
awareness of the important role that telecommunications has played 
in Britain’s past.

Cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements
This Annual report contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well 
as assumptions about future events. These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do 
not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward looking statements often use words such as ‘anticipate’, 
‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, ‘will’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘would’, ‘could’ or other words of 
similar meaning. Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they 
are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause 
actual results, and Cable & Wireless Communications’ plans and objectives, to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Furthermore, nothing in this Annual report should be 
construed as a profit forecast. There are several factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied in forward looking statements. Among the factors are changes in the global, political, 
economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax 
rates and future business combinations or disposals. Summaries of the potential risks faced by Cable & Wireless 
Communications are set out on pages 31 to 33.
Cable & Wireless Communications cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance 
or achievements. Cable & Wireless Communications undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward 
looking statement contained within this Annual report, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a 
result of new information, future events or otherwise, save as required by applicable laws or regulation. Designed by Further™

Cable & Wireless Communications Annual report 2012/13 Transforming our business
Annual review 2012/13 This has been a transformational year for Cable & 
Wireless Communications. There has been continued 
demand for mobile data, and we have reduced our 
operating costs, particularly in the Caribbean. The 
sale of our Monaco & Islands and Macau divisions has 
focused our business on Panama and the Caribbean 
– a region we call pan-America. These continuing 
operations are the focus of this report. The reshaping of 
our business positions us for future growth.
In this Annual review, Panama, the Caribbean and Monaco are classified as continuing 
operations. Maldives, Channel Islands and Isle of Man, the Seychelles, South Atlantic, 
Diego Garcia and Macau have been treated as discontinued operations.

Annual review 2012/13 03 04 Cable & Wireless Communications
2012/13 Highlights
- Dividend of US4 cents
-   Agreed sale of Macau division and majority of 
Monaco & Islands business
-  Gr oup revenue of US$1.9 billion and EBITDA of  
US$ 589 million 
2012/13 has been a milestone year for our Company. 
It has been a year in which we executed several key strategic 
initiatives, most notably selling our Macau and Islands 
businesses to focus the Group on one region – pan-America. 
Cable & Wireless Communications’ historic operating model 
has been as a telecoms ‘finance house’, owning and managing a 
portfolio of assets. The strategic shift we have undertaken has 
converted us to being a telecoms operator.
We will now run our businesses as a unified operation. This will 
involve establishing a new structure for managing the Group, 
with our central function and operational control co-located in 
a new regional facility. 
With this structure we will be able to reduce the layers of 
management,  bring our best talent to exercise management 
control across the region and reinforce the accountability of 
our front line managers.
It is a clear break from CWC’s traditional approach, but it is the 
organisational approach that best establishes sustainable 
value for the firm.     
The fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. In 
pan-America, demand for the mobile and fixed data services 
we provide is growing. Our business posted a 34% increase in 
mobile data service revenues in 2012/13.
We are also improving productivity by tackling our cost base, 
particularly in the Caribbean. This will improve our margins as 
well as the services we provide to customers.
The new approach will, however, not affect our business 
practices or corporate standards. Strong ethical principles are 
firmly embedded in our organisation and our corporate social 
responsibility programmes will remain a key part of the way 
we manage the business.
With all the activity during the year devoted to progressing 
complex portfolio changes we were constantly aware of the 
risk of distraction from our usual attention to operational 
supervision. However, amid a very active year for the business 
we have also achieved a strong operating performance, 
delivering the results we forecast at the start of the year.
Group revenue of US$1.9 billion and EBITDA of US$589 million 
represented a solid performance, and our cash generation was 
strong. 
As we continue the process of change we remain committed 
to our dividend. The Board has recommended a dividend of 
US4 cents for the 2012/13 year, and a US4 cent payment in 
2013/14. We aim to progressively grow our dividend in line 
with future performance.

“We have set a target of US$100 
million of annual cost savings 
to be achieved over the next 
two years. ”

2012/13 Highlights
-  US$210 million mobile data revenue 
in Panama and the Caribbean
-  17% incre ase in Panama mobile average revenue 
per user
-  75,000 new mobile customers in Jamaica 
2012/13 has been a successful year for Cable & Wireless 
Communications, and brought our business to a key inflection 
point.
As a Group we achieved ‘structural coherence’ following our 
announced divestments of the Macau and Islands operations. 
We are now focused entirely on one region, pan-America, 
where we have a great platform from which to build, allowing 
us to create a more unified, effective and cost-efficient 
business. The streamlined business will also help us to adapt in 
the new age of telecoms where data rather than voice is the 
primary product and customer priority.
The business performance in 2012/13 was solid, and 
highlighted the unequivocal shift to a data-centric 
marketplace, with a 34% growth in mobile data revenue.
At a business unit level, the growth of mobile data drove a 3% 
increase in mobile revenue in Panama. In the Caribbean there 
were good performances in The Bahamas and Jamaica but 
trading conditions in the rest of the region were challenging. 
Our Monaco business posted EBITDA 27% higher thanks to 
the elimination of loss-making activities.  
Looking forward, having unified our business we will move our 
senior management to a new corporate headquarters in 
southern Florida, closer to our operations and customers. 
The Group will remain listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
This fundamental change to our operating model will enable us 
to drive significant cost out of the business. We have set a 
target of US$100 million of annual cost savings to be achieved 
over the next two years through productivity improvement 
and the realisation of synergies. 
This will improve our cash flow and margins, particularly in our 
Caribbean business, where we have set a target of raising 
operating margins from 24% to above 30% in the medium 
term.
We will also continue to invest, with particular focus on:
—  Organic – Quality network infrastructure and systems to 
deliver the best possible customer experience
—  Inorganic – Acquisitions that we can develop into full 
service businesses within our target footprint 
These are exciting times for Cable & Wireless 
Communications. We have a unified business, clear strategy 
and strong sense of determination to enact the changes which 
will transform our Group and deliver long-term growth.

Our pan-America opportunity
We want to be the leading full service telecoms 
provider in the pan-America region. Our rationale 
for concentrating on pan-America is five-fold: 
1
There is a growing demand for data
Around the world customer behaviour 
is changing. Customers are buying 
smartphones and tablets and using 
applications with increasingly 
enriched forms of entertainment and 
information.  
Network speeds and capacities are increasing, 
enabling customers to download richer 
content like pay TV and streamed video.
As a result of these trends, the appetite for 
data services, particularly mobile data, will 
continue to increase.
Worldwide data traffic is growing strongly…

Summary Directors’ remuneration report
Overview of our remuneration policy
The structure of remuneration for Executive Directors was 
initially adopted on demerger in March 2010. The 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) recognised that 
the circumstances for managing Cable & Wireless 
Communications Plc were materially different from those 
affecting the former Cable and Wireless plc and over the last 
three years has significantly amended its policy to a more 
standard arrangement, while critically retaining linkage to the 
Company’s evolving strategy.  
Our policy
Overview
The overall aim is to establish remuneration structures which 
encourage, reinforce and reward the delivery of outstanding 
business performance. This is underpinned by the following 
guiding principles:
 — The risk and reward structure must maintain an overall 
alignment with the interests of shareholders
 — Executive Directors are encouraged to maintain a very 
significant personal investment in the shares of the 
Company
 — There is a strong focus on performance-related pay
 — Targets should be appropriately stretching and provide for 
median levels of reward for median performance against 
the targets, and median to top quartile rewards for 
exceptional performance
How do we do this?
 — By setting fixed pay levels by reference to mid-market 
comparators and recruitment/retention considerations, 
while retaining some flexibility to reflect executives’ 
experience and expertise
 — By carefully balancing the variable pay opportunities 
provided through our performance-related short and 
long term incentive plans such that executives are 
incentivised to maximise performance over both the 
short and longer term
 — By providing for a significant proportion of the package to 
be delivered and retained in shares and therefore subject to 
claw back
 — By requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a 
substantial holding of ordinary shares at upper decile level 
of market practice
 — By ensuring that all aspects of remuneration for the 
Executive Directors and selected senior employees are 
approved by the Committee and by reviewing the levels, 
structure and philosophy of remuneration on an annual basis
 — By taking account of the pay and employment conditions of 
other employees in the Group when determining the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration
 — By considering the impact of remuneration on the risk 
profile of the Company
What key changes have we made for 2013/14?
Fixed pay
No salary increases are being proposed for the Executive 
Directors and so fixed pay levels have been maintained at 
current levels.
Annual bonus
70% will be based on financial targets and 30% on personal 
performance objectives.
The majority of the bonus will continue to be subject to financial 
targets based on Group EBITDA and Group Net Cash Flow 
before Financing (NCFbF) (apportioned two thirds EBITDA and 
one third NCFbF).  As we wish to incentivise our Executive 
Directors to focus on the continuing operations of the business, 
the performance of Macau will be excluded from the bonus 
targets and will not count towards performance.  In addition, in 
the event that Monaco Telecom is sold in the year, the outcome 
of the sale will form part of the consideration of bonus outcome 
(at a level of one seventh of the element measured on financial 
performance).  
The proportion of bonus based on specific personal objectives 
will increase from 20% to 30% of total bonus opportunity, with 
the focus on driving greater synergies and growth opportunities

Long-term incentives
The degree of portfolio change which we have had and expect 
to continue to experience for the foreseeable future, makes it 
difficult to define a robust earnings per share range at this 
point in time. Therefore the Committee has decided that the 
awards to be granted in 2013/14 will be entirely based on 
relative total shareholder return. The Committee will 
additionally assess whether it is satisfied with the financial 
performance of the Group before determining the extent to 
which (if at all) awards should vest.  
There will be no change to the policy on overall quantum for 
the bonus and long term incentive plan. Annual review 2012/13 17

3  Company pension contributions in 2012/13 have been paid to the Directors as either annual cash allowance and/or employer’s pension contributions.  In addition to the pension cash 
allowance listed above, in 2012/13 Nick Cooper and Tim Pennington waived £50,000 of their pension cash allowance as an equivalent amount was paid into the pension plan by the 
Company on their behalf.  An amount of £20 million (2011/12 - £18 million) is included in the net pensions deficit figure to cover the cost of former Directors’ pension entitlements.

each Director’s shareholding requirement.

Principal activities
Cable & Wireless Communications is a full service 
telecommunications business. Our services include mobile, 
broadband and fixed line in most of our markets as well as pay 
TV, data centres and hosting, carrier and managed services 
and social telecoms solutions. Our operations are focused on 
providing our customers – consumers, businesses, 
governments – with world class service. We are the market 
leader in most products we offer and territories we serve.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of US2.67 cents  
per ordinary share payable on 9 August 2013 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 31 
May 2013. This final dividend, together with the interim 
dividend of US1.33 cents per share paid by the Company on 
11 January 2013, makes a total dividend payment to 
shareholders of the Company of US4 cents per ordinary  
share for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Directors
The names of the Directors as at 31 March 2013 are set out 
within this Annual review. Alison Platt joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director with effect from 1 June 2012 and 
Mary Francis retired from the Board at the end of her term on 
30 June 2012.
Ethics
The Company is committed to sound business conduct in its 
relationships with key stakeholders (shareholders, employees, 
customers, business partners and suppliers), governments and 
regulators, communities and the environment. 
During the year a review of the Group’s ethics policies was 
undertaken. A new Code of Conduct policy was approved by 
the Board which sits alongside the Group’s Anti-Bribery Policy 
and applies to all Group companies and employees. Where the 
Group operates in conjunction with business partners, third 
parties or in joint venture arrangements without management 
control, it aims to promote the application of these policies. 
Responsibility for the compliance with the policy remains with 
the Board and the regional Chief Executives are responsible 
for the communication, implementation and monitoring of 
their region.
The Group seeks to conduct its operations with honesty, 
integrity and openness, and with respect for the human rights 
and interests of our employees. The Group respects the 
legitimate interests of all those with whom it has relationships. 
The Group’s employees are required to complete an annual 
online training programme in relation to these policies.
. 
Internal control, risk management and financial reporting
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness on a continual basis. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The concept 
of reasonable assurance recognises that the cost of control 
procedures should not exceed the expected benefits.
The Group operates a risk management process under which 
the regional businesses identify the key risks to their plans, 
their likelihood and impact and the actions being taken to 
manage those risks and the effectiveness of steps taken to 
mitigate them. The risk register is presented to the Audit 
Committee on a rolling 12 month basis. 
The Executive Directors report to the Board, on behalf of 
management, significant changes in the Group’s business and 
the external environment in which it operates. In addition, 
they provide the Board with monthly financial information, 
which includes key risk and performance indicators. The 
Group’s key internal control and monitoring procedures 
include the following:
 —  F ina n ci a l r e p o r t in g
 —  In v es t m e n t ap p r a i sal
 —  M oni t ori n g s y s t e ms
 —  Financial and non-financial controls
 —  W h i s t l e b l o w i n g
Going concern
After reviewing budgets and other longer-term plans and 
making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

_0FUL_arf.05.qxd  23/11/2005  10:42  Page 3 > Chairman’s statement
I am pleased that the Group has continued to strengthen its order
book and win new clients. Implementation of our sales and
marketing reorganisation has had a positive impact on the business
and, together with improved performance, a reduced cost base and
strong balance sheet, Fulcrum will focus on taking the business to
the next stage of its development. The Group plans to deepen its
expertise in drug substance and formulation management and in
pre-clinical and regulatory services and is seeking suitable
opportunities to increase scale.
Business review
Since my report last year, the Group has
taken considerable steps to improve its
performance and to grow the core service
business. These steps included the
reorganisation of the sales and marketing
function, the tailoring of business
development and the continued effort to
increase global sales to new clients. The
tailored approach to business development
has reduced the Group’s reliance on
networked sales and has strengthened the
order book, which, together with effective
cost management and the more efficient
use of staff, has resulted in the return to
profitability in the second half of the
financial year.
Fulcrum’s turnover for the year was £12.6m
(2004: £11.1m) and the loss before tax
was £76,000 (2004: loss of £1.2m). 
The pharmaceutical services sector is
emerging from a number of challenging
years and there are signs that the need
for outsourcing is gaining momentum.
Emerging pharma and biotechs continue to
operate in a difficult funding environment
and strategic outsourcing is proving to be
an important way for them to improve
capital efficiency. In particular there is
growth in drug substance and formulation
management and pre-clinical services,
where Fulcrum has considerable expertise,
and in regulatory services where new
opportunities are arising. In addition, our
global service model enables companies
to operate outside of their domestic
market. For example the orphan drug
regulations in Europe allow US clients to
create value and extend exclusivity in the
market place. Additionally, large pharma
clients in Japan continue to seek faster
to market solutions by outsourcing
development to the US and to Europe. 
Board changes
The resignation of Dr Bruce McCreedy was
announced in September 2005. To drive
the Company’s global service model further
forward, it is intended to strengthen the
Board during the coming year with more
expertise from the service sector.
Conclusion
Fulcrum continues to concentrate on
strengthening its order book and now
intends to improve performance and focus
on taking the business to the next stage of
its development. With a reduced cost base
and strong balance sheet, Fulcrum plans to
deepen its expertise in drug substance and
formulation management and in pre-clinical
and regulatory services and is seeking
suitable opportunities to increase scale.

Case study 1
Client challenge:
The client required a development plan to reach
proof of concept in an oncology programme, which
met the business goals within the defined budget
and provided development resource which was
lacking in-house. 
Fulcrum solution:
Fulcrum provided a development plan that matched
the client’s budget, identified a team of suppliers 
to execute the programme and provided overall
management of the programme, reporting to the
client as a member of the development team.
Impact for client:
Fulcrum produced a timely and well run development
programme which facilitated progress of a molecule
despite an internal resource deficit. This enabled the
announcement of this new molecule in clinical
study, in line with the client’s business goals, and
generated the news flow required for investors.
_0FUL_arf.05.qxd  23/11/2005  10:42  Page 4 > Chief executive’s review
The reorganisation of sales and marketing on a regional basis has
had a positive impact on sales. Having returned to profitability
in the second half, Fulcrum is continuing to deepen its expertise in
key drug development areas and grow the business to the next stage.
Business development and sales
The reorganisation of sales and marketing
on a regional basis has had a positive
impact on sales. Fee sales increased in 
the second half of the year to £3.3m from
£2,9m in the first half year. The Group has
won a significant number of new clients 
in Europe.
Market research conducted in the US was
used to hone our service offerings to the
biotech community. The knowledge gained
was used to execute a targeted campaign
to increase client awareness. This campaign
included sponsorship of, and presentations
at, major biotechnology and partnering
conferences in the US, Europe and Japan such
as ASCO, BECIF, Bio Asia and BioBusiness, and
has resulted in a strengthening of the pipeline
of contracts and prospects. 
Establishing long-term 
business relationships
A core of long-term relationships has been
established in Europe, which has contributed
more than 60% of European sales in the
current financial year. In May 2005 we
announced a long-term agreement with
Syngenta Biopharma under which Fulcrum
continues to provide drug development
expertise and is embedding critical tools and
processes from Fulcrum’s “Document Driven
Drug Development” platform into the client
organisation. In addition, Fulcrum’s
partnership with Addex Pharmaceuticals S.A.
continues to support the delivery of Addex’s
portfolio of products to treat disease of the
Central Nervous System. We were delighted
that Addex were able to announce that
ADX10059 had started clinical studies in
France. This achievement of getting a drug
from discovery into the clinic in less than
three years is a strong validation of the
executional capabilities of the partnership.
Sales from Japan
Our investment in business development
in Japan continues to generate sales from
Japan into Europe and the US. Japan has
contributed 12% of fee sales in Europe and
the US. Our Japanese clients include large
pharma and emerging biotechs such as
NanoCarriers Co., Ltd. These companies
utilise our skill-sets and resources in our
European and US subsidiaries. Fulcrum has
also won contracts from emerging European
companies seeking the opportunity to
create value in the Japanese market. 
Regional performance
Europe
The sales pipeline and order book
strengthened throughout the year.
Encouragingly our business development
team has won a significant number of
new clients in the second half year and
has delivered cross sales to the US office
and Japan. Whilst sales in Europe have
decreased by 10% over the previous year
as a result of the weak order book at the
start of the year, the performance in the
second half has been good.
Significant cost savings have been achieved
in this financial year. This includes £230,000
of permanent annual savings, the majority
of which relate to the reorganisation of
sales and marketing and the remainder 
is the rent differential on the relocation 
of the UK office.

Case study 2
Client challenge:
After in-licencing a CNS compound with a history
of difficult pre-clinical studies, the client wished to
develop an FTIM pre-clinical toxicology and ADME
package within an extremely tight timeline
(four months from GLP material to draft reports).
Fulcrum solution:
Fulcrum provided a pre-qualified CRO team with
all CRO contractual arrangements established
before studies started. Fulcrum were able to
provide flexibility of response when issues arose
which might have jeopardised the timeline. Fulcrum
tightly monitored the budget and timelines, saving
over €100,000 in cost and over 16 weeks in time.
Impact for client:
The client met the timelines within budget for this
challenging programme, enabling key decisions
about the future of the programme to be made.
A CTA is scheduled for late 2005 and subsequently
the product is expected to enter phase 1 development.
The ultimate aim is to outlicense the product with 
a strong support package.
_0FUL_arf.05.qxd  23/11/2005  10:42  Page 5 > Chief executive’s review 
The cornerstones of the Group’s strategy are:
> Grow the service business in three regions and develop the
global service model
> Increase scale
> Regulatory, pre-clinical, drug substance and formulation
> Add further value through 
> Long-term relationships
> Risk sharing
Regional performance (continued)
US
The US subsidiary has continued to grow
through its domestic customer base, with
cross sales from Japan and the provision
of resources to the European subsidiary.
The latter has allowed efficient use of
global resources. Overall US fee sales have
grown by circa 20% compared with the
same period last year. 
Japan 
The Japanese Group has matured into
a specialist oncology CRO and regulatory
group to meet the needs of the local
market. Japan had a slow start to the year
but made a substantial recovery in the
second half. Our specialist oncology CRO
has gained significant orders for the next
two years including a phase II study with a
major US biotech. The study was won as a
result of delivering a successful pilot project. 
Future strategy
Having returned to profitability in the second
half, Fulcrum is continuing to deepen its
expertise in key drug development areas and
grow the business to the next stage. The
cornerstones of the Group’s strategy remain:
1. Grow the service business in three
regions and develop the global
service model
2. Increase scale
– Regulatory, pre-clinical, drug
substance and formulation 
3. Add further value through
– Long-term relationships 
– Risk sharing
Prospects and outlook
The pharma and biotech outsourcing market
remains competitive. However, companies
increasingly need to demonstrate efficient
use of capital and improved productivity.
These factors are driving drug developers
towards outsourcing as a core strategy.
With stronger order books over last year
the Group looks set to improve
profitability further.

Case study 3 
Client challenge
The client, a research-based company with little
development resource, had in-licensed a novel
analgesic with a broad range of potential analgesic
target indications. The client’s need was for a rapid,
focused development programme to proof of
concept, generating a quality data-package to
support out-licencing. 
Fulcrum solution
Using a Fulcrum in-house project team consisting of
programme management, CMC, toxicology, clinical
and regulatory expertise, Fulcrum prepared a target
product profile and identified key points and study
designs for a detailed development plan. This
development plan covered all activities from synthesis
of drug substance, full safety and toxicology
pre-clinical work and a clinical programme of studies
to proof of concept. Full development costs and
timelines were included and the programme was
designed to give the fastest route to clinical studies,
with contingency planning for the associated risks. 
Fulcrum then implemented the programme through
selection and management of suppliers in the CMC,
pre-clinical, regulatory and clinical areas. This included
negotiations and management of contracts and
budgets, timeline management and issue resolution.
Impact for client
Fulcrum achieved a timescale of ten months from
initiation of CMC activities to first subject dosed in the
Phase I programme within the agreed client budget.
The client was able to exceed senior management
and investor expectations on progress of the
development of the compound.

> Loss before tax of £76,000 (2004: £1.2m)
> Profitable before exceptionals in second half
> Group balance sheet remains strong
Results
Turnover
Fee sales increased by 4% to £6.2m
(2004: £5.9m) with sales increasing in the
second half year to £3.3m from £2.9m in
the first half.
Fee sales in the US and Japan increased
by 17% and 32% respectively over the
previous year. However, sales in Europe
decreased by 10% over the same period
due to lower sales in the first half resulting
from the weak order book at the start of
the year.
Operating loss
The results for the year ended 31 August 2005
show a loss before exceptional items of
£315,000 (2004: £862,000). 
Operating costs, excluding exceptional
credits and charges, are £3.0m compared
to £3.6m in 2004. The cost savings include
£230,000 of permanent annual savings
which relate principally to the reorganisation
of sales and marketing in September 2004
and to the rent differential on relocation of
the UK office.
Operating costs include an exchange
gain of £5,000 (2004: loss of £114,000). 
In order to reduce the risk on exchange,
the Group entered into a forward foreign
currency contract to sell US dollars on a
quarterly basis.
Exceptional costs
The exceptional credit of £239,000
represents the income from the surrender
of the lease on the UK office less the costs
associated with relocation to new premises.
The agreement to surrender the lease was
signed in March 2005. The exceptional
charge in 2004 represents the costs of the
subsidiary, Fulcrum Ventures Limited, which
was set up to in-licence rights to mid-to-late
oncology products and develop them.
Loss before tax
The Group made a loss before tax of
£76,000 compared to a loss of £1.2m
in the same period last year.
Earnings per share
The retained loss for the year was £89,000
(2004: £1.4m) and the loss per share was
0.07p (2004: 0.93p).
Dividends
No interim dividend was paid (2004: 0.2p
per share) and no second half dividend
is recommended.
Balance sheet
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong
overall with net cash at 31 August 2005 of
£1.5m (2004: £2.2m).

The Company’s shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange. The Group is therefore
subject to the AIM Admission Rules of the London Stock Exchange and is consequently not required to comply with the best practice
corporate governance provisions contained within the Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The principles by which the new Combined Code appended to the listing rules of the Financial Services Authority have been applied are

The Board
The Board currently comprises the Executive and Non-executive Directors. Given the current size of the Company, the Directors do not
feel that it is appropriate to appoint more than three Non-executive Directors, namely Professor Sir C George, Dr D Clough and Dr M Carter.
A minimum of six Board meetings are held annually. The Board is responsible for overall strategy, major finance matters and internal
financial control. It also monitors executive management in the business through its review of financial, strategic and operational matters.
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation.

The Board has established both Audit and Remuneration Committees, each with defined terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee comprises the Non-executive Directors and Dr G Walters who acts as the employees’ representative. They meet at
least twice each year and are responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored,
for meeting the auditors and reviewing the reports from the auditors relating to the financial statements.
A Remuneration Committee has been established, with the Non-executive Directors and Dr R M Miller, who acts as the employees’
representative, as members. It meets at least twice each year and reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and
structure of their remuneration having due regard to the interests of the shareholders. The Committee also manages the share option schemes.
Internal financial control
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal financial control to provide them with reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and that the assets are safeguarded. There are inherent
limitations in any system of internal financial control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation of financial information and the safeguarding of assets.
The Group, in administering its business, has put in place strict authorisation, approval and control levels within which senior management
operates. These controls reflect the Group’s organisational structure and business objectives. This control system includes clear lines of
accountability to cover all areas of the organisation. The Board operates procedures to identify the major business risks facing the Group
and controls those risks. The Group also has a budgeting and reporting system in place with results compared to budget, variance analysis
and re-forecasting of projected results.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets and forecasts with respect to its financial position as at 31 August 2005. After taking
into consideration the cash flow implications of these plans, the Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to produce the Group financial
statements on a going concern basis.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. The Directors are required to prepare the financial
statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently. They also confirm that reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2005 and that
applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Fulcrum Pharma PLC web site is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may
have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

_0FUL_arb.05.qxd  23/11/2005  10:44  Page 13 > Independent auditors’ report to the members of Fulcrum Pharma PLC
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Consolidated profit and loss account, the Consolidated and Company
balance sheets, the Statement of total Group recognised gains and losses, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the reports of the
Chairman and Chief Executive, the Finance review, the Directors’ report and the Corporate governance statement.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 August 2005
and of the loss and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the historical
cost convention. A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been reviewed by the Board of Directors in accordance
with Financial Reporting Standard (“FRS”) 18 “Accounting policies” and have been applied consistently, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the results of Fulcrum Pharma PLC and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 August 2005. The
results of all the subsidiaries with the exception of Fulcrum Pharma Developments Limited have been consolidated using the principles
of acquisition accounting. Fulcrum Pharma Developments Limited, which was acquired in March 2000 has been consolidated using the
principles of merger accounting.
Inter-Group transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed
assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful
economic life, as follows:
Leasehold Improvements – over the lease term
Fixtures and fittings – five years
Computer equipment – two–five years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Short term investments
Deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term deposits.
Finance and operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset
had been purchased outright. The assets are included in fixed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as
obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied
to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account. Assets held under finance leases
are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.

_0FUL_arb.05.qxd  23/11/2005  10:44  Page 19 > Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2005
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to individual personal pension plans. The contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they
are incurred.
Deferred taxation
Provision is made for deferred taxation in accordance with FRS 19, “Deferred taxation” on all material timing differences. Deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Turnover and long-term contracts
Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts invoiced to third parties including pass through costs from suppliers,
except in respect of long-term contracts where turnover represents the sales value of work done in the year, including estimates in
respect of amounts not invoiced. Turnover in respect of long-term contracts is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which
costs incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract.
Profit on long-term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The profit
included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the year end, on a contract by contract basis
by recording turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses. Revenue derived from variations on contracts is recognised only
when they have been agreed with the customer. Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Milestone payments due under contractual relationships are recorded to revenue when all work related to the milestone is completed.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial
year and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Differences on exchange arising
from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those undertakings at the
average rate, are taken to reserves and are reported in the Statement of total Group recognised gains and losses. All other foreign
exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise and are included in operating profit.
Employee share schemes
The Company may from time to time grant shares or share options to employees and, in accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force
Pronouncement Number 17 (“UITF 17”), records a non-cash charge to the profit and loss account for the difference between the amount
payable by the employee and fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The charge is then credited back to reserves. When
a compensation charge is recognised on options to incentivise future performance, the charge is recognised over the performance period.
Financial instruments
The Group’s policies in relation to financial instruments are set out in Note 23. The Group has taken the exemption allowed under FRS 13
“Derivatives and financial instruments”, and excluded short-term debtors and creditors from its disclosures under financial instruments
(see Note 23).
ESOP Trust
The Group has adopted UITF 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ in the financial statements. The Company recognises the assets and liabilities
of the ESOP Trust in its own accounts, and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds
until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.

5 Exceptional items
The Group has reported a loss before tax and exceptional items of £315,000 (2004: loss of £862,000).
The Group has recorded an exceptional credit to administrative expenses of £239,000 (2004: charge of £348,000). The exceptional
credit represents the income from the surrender of the lease on the UK office less the costs associated with relocation to new premises.
The agreement to surrender the lease was signed in March 2005.
The charges in 2004 represent the costs of the subsidiary Company, Fulcrum Ventures Limited, which was set up to in-licence rights to
mid-to-late clinical oncology products and develop them. This expenditure ceased on 30 April 2004.

Adjustment for exceptional costs (0.16)p 0.24p

The basic loss per ordinary share is based on the Group’s loss for the year of £89,000 (2004: £1,122,000) divided by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding those shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”).
In 2005 and in 2004, the number of shares used in the calculation of diluted loss per share was the same as that used in the calculation
of basic loss per share as the Group incurred a loss.
Exceptional costs charged against operating loss and exceptional tax credits do not relate to the profitability of the Group on an ongoing
basis. Therefore an adjusted basic loss per ordinary share is also presented.

23 Financial instruments
The financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk, currency risk and liquidity. The Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing each of these risks.
The Group’s main objective in using financial instruments are the maximisation of returns from funds held on deposit and, when
appropriate, the generation of additional cash resources for Group operations through financing arrangements for capital assets and
through the issue of shares and other financing instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital
for the Group’s operations in the UK, Japan and USA.
The Group’s policy is to raise cash when it is required and when market conditions are appropriate, using those financial instruments that
can be negotiated with the providers of finance at that time. These instruments include bank loans and finance leases.
Due to the weakness of the US dollar, the Group has entered into a forward foreign currency contract to sell US $200,000 to US $400,000
per quarter at a rate of US $1.74 to US $1.84 until September 2005.
Short-term debtors, creditors, accruals and prepayments have been excluded from the disclosures below, except the current portion of
bank loans and overdrafts and finance lease obligations.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained cash reserves, finance leases and bank loans. The policy of the Group is
to monitor exposure to interest rate risk and take into account potential movements in interest rates when selecting methods of financing.
However at present, the level of Group borrowings is low and the interest rate risk at present is not considered to be significant.

Bank loans and overdrafts 269 196
Obligations under finance leases 63 93

Financial liabilities
The finance leases are at various fixed and variable rates of interest. The total of these liabilities outstanding at 31 August 2005 was
£63,000 (2004: £93,000), with a weighted average outstanding period of 26 months (2004: 36 months) and a weighted average interest
rate of 4.00% (2004: 4.75% of bank loans). The bank loan facilities incurred interest at rates between 1.375% and 7.00% during the year.
The total amount of bank loans outstanding at 31 August 2005 was £269,000 (2004: £196,000). The maturity profile of finance leases
and bank loans is shown in Notes 16 and 18.
Borrowing facilities
The Group had unused borrowing facilities of £Nil at 31 August 2005 (2004: £107,000).
Interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial assets

Short-term investments:
Short-term deposits 835 1,019
Money market liquidity fund 358 404
1,871 2,468
The Group maintains sterling, euro, US dollar and yen accounts in which all cash and bank balances are held. Cash and bank balances
represent floating rate cash held in current accounts and deposit accounts with banks at interest rates based on interbank rates. Short-term
deposits represent fixed rate deposits placed with major clearing banks for up to three months earning interest at rates of 3.35% – 4.39%
on sterling accounts. The money market liquidity funds are administered by a major institutional manager and represent a pool of cash
invested in a range of short-term money market instruments. The money market liquidity funds generate floating rates of return after fees
that are benchmarked against the seven day bank rates.

Currency risk profile
The Group’s functional currency is sterling, and the majority of its transactions are denominated in that currency. The Group operates in
US dollars, yen and euros. The Group also has overseas subsidiaries where the US subsidiary’s functional currency is US dollars and the
Japanese subsidiaries functional currency is yen. The Group’s currency exposures, comprising foreign currency bank accounts and foreign
currency money market liquidity funds at 31 August 2005, are shown below:

Liquidity risk
The Board monitors the level of cash and liquid resources on a regular basis and manages it on a daily basis, to ensure that the Group has
sufficient liquid funds to enable it to continue as a going concern. This is achieved through the production and review of cash forecasts.
Fair values
Other than as disclosed below there is no material difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets
and liabilities at 31 August 2005. Carrying values approximate to fair values for the short-term investments because of the short maturity
periods of these financial instruments.

Explanations of resolutions
Resolution 1 – Financial statements
The Directors of the Company are obliged to present to shareholders the report of the Directors and the audited financial statements for
the Company for the year ended 31 August 2005. That report and those accounts, and the report of the Company’s auditors on those
financial statements, are set out on pages 1 to 31 of this document.
Resolution 2 – Re-appointment of auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which financial statements are laid, to hold office until the
next general meeting. The present auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers are willing to continue in office for a further year and this resolution
proposes their re-appointment and, in accordance with standard practice, authorises the Directors to determine the level of the
auditors’ remuneration.
Resolutions 3 and 4 – Re-election of Directors
After the first Annual General Meeting at which all of the Directors retired from office, at every subsequent general meeting one third of
the Directors for the time being (other than those appointed since the latest Annual General Meeting) are required to retire. If the number
of relevant Directors is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not greater than one third of the Directors should be obliged to
retire. Directors due to retire by rotation are those who have been longest in office since their last re-election and as between persons
who become or were last re-elected on the same day those due to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be

This resolution grants the Directors; authority to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £406,208 being an
amount equal to one third of the issued share capital of the Company. It is not the Directors current intention to allot relevant securities
pursuant to this resolution. This authority replaces the existing authority to allot relevant securities but does not affect the ability to allot
shares under the share option schemes. This authority expires at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or
15 months from the date of passing the resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 6 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
This resolution disapplies the statutory pre-emption rights which would otherwise apply on an issue of shares for cash pursuant to a rights
issue where the securities attributable to the interests of all shareholders are proportionate (as nearly as may be) to the number of shares
held and generally up to £60,931, being a sum equal to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company. This replaces the existing
authority to disapply and expires at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the date
of passing the resolution, whichever is the earlier.

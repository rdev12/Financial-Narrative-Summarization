Commenting on the results Communisis Chief Executive, Andy Blundell said:
“
Our 2011 operating results before exceptional items showed a marked improvement on 2010 and signalled  
the Group’s continued success in executing its strategy as a leading UK marketing services provider .
The macro-economic environment presents a blend of risks and opportunities and Communisis is well positioned 
to respond to both. Trading in the early weeks of 2012, together with new and existing customer prospects, 
support our expectation of further financial progress for the current year as a whole.

RESUL TS
Communisis delivered substantial growth in profit from 
operations before exceptional items in 2011. The Group made 
real progress during the year towards its dual aspirations to 
be the leading UK marketing services provider with a growing 
customer-led international profile and to achieve a double-digit 
operating margin on sales (excluding pass through) over the 
medium term.
Profit from operations before exceptional items increased to 
£9.4m, a 19% increase on 2010. This represented an operating 
margin of 5.5% on sales (excluding pass through) compared to 
4.7% in 2010. The net effect of exceptional items was to reduce 
profit after tax and basic earnings per share from £4.4m to £4.1m 
and from 3.20p to 2.96p respectively. Exceptional items related 
principally to the costs of a phased restructuring programme 
with £3.7m charged in 2011 (2010 £2.9m offset by a £2.6m 
gain on the settlement of certain pension obligations). Adjusted 
earnings per share, which excluded the after-tax effect of 
exceptional items, increased by 47.5% from 2.99p to 4.41p. 
The proposed final dividend of 1p per share brings the total 
dividend for the year to 1.5p per share an increase of 16% over 
2010, reflecting both the strong operating performance in 2011 
and the Board’s confidence in the future of the business. The 
dividend will be payable on 14 May 2012 to shareholders on the 
register at 13 April 2012.
BOARD CHANGES
As reported in the 2010 Annual Report, Nigel Howes assumed 
the Finance Director role in March 2011.
In November 2011 Alistair Blaxill resigned from the Board 
and Dave Rushton took over his responsibilities having been 
promoted to the newly created position of Group Managing 
Director.
Roger Jennings is not seeking re-appointment at the Annual 
General Meeting on 2 May 2012 having served for nine years as 
a non-executive director. The Board would like to thank Roger 
for his significant contribution over this long period during which 
Communisis has changed considerably.
The Board, through its Nomination Committee, expects to 
appoint a further non-executive director in due course.

OUTLOOK
T rading in the early weeks of 2012, together with new and 
existing customer prospects, supports our expectation of further 
financial progress for the current year as a whole.
Macro-economic uncertainties are expected to continue during 
2012. Such factors are less likely to impact our activities in 
transactional and regulatory communications but could affect 
our customers’ discretionary marketing spend. 
This situation provides both challenge and opportunity as 
marketeers seek to improve their investment returns or decide 
to outsource more of their core marketing services. Communisis 
continues to deploy advanced technology and invest in people 
with the skills and experience to deliver its broader proposition. 
The Group is therefore well positioned to benefit from the 
developing trends towards more personalised and targeted 
marketing campaigns and further outsourcing of marketing 
activities.

PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
Higher margin services
SUMMARY
Profit from operations before exceptional items showed a 
considerable improvement on 2010 and signalled the Group’s 
continued success in executing its strategy as a leading UK 
marketing services provider. 
This has been achieved through a combination of new 
business wins, better margin services and cost reductions. 
Organic growth has been complemented by our first acquisition 
since 2008 – Orchestra Bristol and the contract with Proximity 
London for BBC TV Licensing. 
Communisis is making progress towards achieving a double-
digit operating margin on sales (excluding pass through) over 
the medium term. 
WHAT WE DO
The company is an end-to-end marketing services provider 
(“MSP”) specialising in mission-critical communications.
This MSP proposition is delivered from two strategic business 
units:
 • Intelligence Driven Communications (“IDC”) which identifies 
campaign targets, designs messages, measures 
effectiveness and enables customers to outsource 
processes. This is our “front-end”, built on our capabilities 
in creative and data analytics; and
 • Specialist Production and Sourcing (“SPS”) which produces 
mission-critical communications in digital and paper formats. 
Communisis deploys advanced technology to support 
specialist in-house manufacturing and digital distribution,  
whilst managing other activity in the third-party supply chain. 
In combination, this is our multi-channel delivery network. 
The Group operates in an overall market which is attractive and 
fast-moving. There is a trend toward precision marketing and 
both Bellwether Marketing and The Direct Marketing Association 
have recently commented on the shift in marketeers’ behaviour 
toward direct marketing, online advertising and sales promotion. 
There continues to be a growing demand for data, insight and 
services to support digital media. Communisis is also benefiting 
from an emerging recognition that marketing services can be 
outsourced effectively.
Competitive differentiation is built on the relevance and strength 
of the end-to-end offer in marketing campaigns, the depth of 
embedded expertise and innovative capabilities and the scale of 
the Group’s operations. Communisis acts as a trusted partner to 
many of the UK’s largest and most respected brands under long-
term relationships with significant growth potential.
ASPIRATION
The Group’s aspiration is to be the UK’s leading marketing services 
provider with a growing customer-led international profile.
Our target is to deliver a double-digit operating margin on sales 
(excluding pass through) over the medium term. 
T o achieve this, Communisis will flex the strength of the 
combined IDC and SPS product and service offerings and 
pursue the following strategic objectives:
 • growing sales both organically and by acquisition; 
 • extending activities to broaden and deepen our 
service offering; 
 • diversifying our customer portfolio beyond the financial 
services sector;
 • following our international customers into overseas markets; 
 • investing in specialist manufacturing, notably high-speed 
colour digital; and
 • continuing to optimise our direct cost and overhead base.
The Group has expanded its activities in higher margin services 
during the year in postal sortation, in the use of credit data for 
marketing purposes and for e-billing and e-statements.
A number of commercial partnerships underpin these new 
services: with TNT for postal sortation; with Equifax for credit 
data; and with Sorriso, a leading technology provider, for 
e-billing and e-statements.
Our postal sortation service made significant progress during 
the period and now serves 43 customers, an increase of 37 
in the year. The impending privatisation of Royal Mail and the 
growing impact of downstream access provides good growth 
potential in this area.
Four new credit data based products were launched in the last 
quarter of the year and these have already been adopted by 
three major customers.

Since announcing the arrangement with Sorriso in October 
2011, there has been a strong interest from a number of 
customers, including a large international professional 
membership body. E-billing and e-statements will provide 
further opportunities for customers to benefit from 
Communisis’ ability to place personalised marketing messages 
on regular transactional documents, thus improving the use 
and value of the communication. 
Communisis continues to analyse acquisition targets in areas 
such as creative and digital marketing and presently has a 
strong pipeline of opportunities. Each prospective acquisition 
is assessed by reference to its coherence with our strategic 
objectives and its capacity to deliver acceptable financial returns.

Cost reduction initiatives and improved 
capacity utilisation
Communisis has been at the forefront of high-speed colour 
digital technology deployment in the UK for some time. Two HP 
T300 lines were installed in the Leeds facility during 2010 and 
2011 and Communisis has worked with 18 major customers 
to date to realise the benefits of the technology platform. The 
Group has announced a further significant development in this 
area with the installation of two HP T400 lines in Liverpool with 
commissioning in January and June 2012. 
The installation will treble digital capacity across the Group 
and allows all the existing Liverpool production to be migrated 
onto a digital print platform. Consequently, from June 2012, 
Communisis will have the ability to produce digitally about 
30% of its current six billion page output. Centrica is the first 
customer to adopt the technology in Liverpool and this product 
has been in the market since February 2012. A number of the 
Group’s other major transactional customers are expected 
to adopt the T400 technology and access the benefits of 
transpromotional communications. 
The Group continuously reviews its cost base to derive the 
most efficient and cost-effective operational design for the 
future. The operational network has been further rationalised 
with the closure of four sites, being the production facilities in 
Bristol, offices in Eastcote and Rickmansworth and the logistics 
facilities in Leicester following the successful transfer of the 
warehousing and fulfilment activities to Newcastle. 
Communisis’ new offices in central London have now been 
open for a year and are proving an effective base for our data 
analysis and southern print sourcing activities. 
A further phase of restructuring at the Leeds facility was 
completed during the year, which involved the streamlining of 
the middle-management structure and headcount reduction in 
the enclosing areas. This is expected to yield substantial annual 
payroll cost savings.
In the final quarter of the year, Communisis’ strategic expertise 
in purchasing and supply chain management was recognised 
through the award of Gold accreditation by the Chartered 
Institute of Purchasing and Supply (“CIPS”). The Group’s 
sourcing processes, which CIPS Chief Executive Officer, 
David Noble, described as “world class” are vital component 
parts of Communisis’ managed service offering to customers. 
Communisis is proud to be one of only 13 UK companies to 
have achieved this prestigious standard.

Communisis is proud to be one of only 13 UK companies to 
have achieved this prestigious standard.
CUSTOMERS
Communisis is privileged to count some of the best-known and 
respected companies in the UK amongst its customers.
In 2011 and the early part of 2012 a number of new customers 
were added to the portfolio including Boots, Premium Credit, 
Speedy Hire, Virgin Media, Virgin Money (Northern Rock), 
Nationwide and Proximity (BBC TV Licensing). Collectively new 
business wins in 2011 are expected to contribute £24m toward 
the revenue growth targets in 2012. 
The percentage of revenue derived from the financial services 
sector has reduced from 58% in 2010 to 51% in 2011 and 
our involvement in other sectors, especially consumer goods, 
media and retail, is increasing. 
Larger contracts typically have an average term of three to 
five years and, due to the nature of the work, Communisis 
often becomes deeply embedded within our customer’s 
organisations. A substantial proportion of sales are normally 
provided under multi-year framework contract relationships. 
These arrangements and the mission-critical nature of many 
of the transactional and regulatory communications for our 
customers give a reasonable degree of predictability when 
planning the Group’s performance.
In June 2011, Communisis acquired the trade and assets of 
Orchestra Bristol Limited and simultaneously novated a four 
year contract for the BBC TV Licensing work with Proximity 
London. The process of transferring this work to our Liverpool 
facility has now been completed and the Bristol site was 
closed in January 2012. Service levels have been maintained 
throughout the transfer and the performance of the acquired 
activities is as expected and encouraging.
Communisis’ established position in the mutual sector has been 
strengthened recently with the extension of our relationship 
with the UK’s largest building society, Nationwide, with annual 
revenues expected to increase fourfold to around £10m. The 
new contract resulted in Communisis assuming responsibility 
for a 15 strong on-site team at Nationwide’s Swindon 
headquarters. There are now 16 on-site teams at various 
customer sites across the UK and mainland Europe,  
with a total of 94 Communisis specialists working alongside 
each customer’s marketing department. This structure 
facilitates rapid response and gives immediate access to  
growth opportunities.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  (continued) CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  (continued) 10
International expansion opportunities are being pursued with a 
major fast-moving consumer goods customer. The initial phase 
of the Group’s underlying print management services contract is 
live and the first teams are in place in Germany and Italy. They are 
using Communisis’ technology and experience to optimise supply 
chains for marketing collateral in these territories and the new 
arrangements offer this customer enhanced central visibility and 
control. There is considerable scope to scale this contract in other 
regions as well as expanding it into additional product areas.
The Group is developing its key account management structure with 
two prime aims: to give assurance and visibility on service levels to 
the customer; and to identify growth opportunities in new areas. As 
an example, our work with one major customer, which is delivered 
through three on-site teams totalling 38 people, now includes 
creative activity and digital marketing within its remit. The process 
for new business sales is complementary to that for key accounts 
and ensures that wherever the initial point of engagement occurs, 
“the available market” per customer, comprising opportunities for 
other relevant products and services, is being considered. Various 
software tools are being used to support the sales effort and 
improve its effectiveness so that sales people in the field have better 
visibility of, and build cumulative knowledge around, each prospect.
The “Crusade for Customers” programme is now entering its 
third year and has been successful in raising awareness of the 
importance of improving customer service throughout the 
organisation. Key to the programme has been a third-party audit 
which was first run in May 2010 and repeated in November 
2011. The feedback from the recent study, which ran 40 detailed 
interviews across 30 of the top customers, confirmed that 
Communisis has achieved a significant improvement over the 
18 month intervening period. Moreover, it is now known, from 
this objective third-party source, that these customers rate 
Communisis better than the competition. The study included 
a conclusion that “the (Communisis) brand is also now closely 
related to being professional, passionate and environmentally 
aware” as well as being trusted in the provision of mission-critical 
services. The Crusade for Customers will continue and there will 
be a third audit of satisfaction in 2013. 
Communisis is a significant supplier of chequebooks to the UK 
market. As such, it welcomed the decision by the Payments 
Council during the year to remove the immediate uncertainty 
surrounding the future of cheques by announcing that it has 
withdrawn plans for closing cheque clearing in 2018 and that 
cheques will remain a primary payment mechanism for as long 
as needed. The Payments Council confirmed that it will focus 
on making all payments fit for the 21st century by encouraging 
innovation in new and existing types of payments. The Group has 
significant long-term contracts for the production of chequebooks 
with the majority of its financial services customers and continues 
to work with all interested parties to investigate such alternative 
payment solutions. The Group’s capability in security print is being 
extended to other areas, such as payslips, prescription forms 
and match tickets, so that the resulting new business offsets any 
reducing demand for chequebooks. In the meantime, the cost 
base continues to be managed to maintain margins.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group is committed to providing a safe and satisfying 
working environment and delivering on its broader environmental 
responsibilities. Its performance in these areas was sustained or 
improved during 2011. 
There were 87 accidents including 8 reportable incidents 
(2010 90 accidents including 8 reportable incidents) under the 
Health and Safety regulations. Whilst none are acceptable, the 
number is small in relation to the size of the workforce and the 
complexity and geographic spread of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s environmental record improved with further 
increases in recycled waste from 98.67% in 2010 to 98.92% 
in 2011 and reductions between years of 8.2% and 10.2% in 
carbon footprint and water consumption respectively.
Communisis is also actively involved in supporting young 
people and the wider communities in which we operate.  
Our work with the Prince’s T rust and other initiatives are set

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  (continued) 11
this objective third-party source, that these customers rate 
Communisis better than the competition. The study included 
a conclusion that “the (Communisis) brand is also now closely 
related to being professional, passionate and environmentally 
aware” as well as being trusted in the provision of mission-critical 
services. The Crusade for Customers will continue and there will 
be a third audit of satisfaction in 2013. 
Communisis is a significant supplier of chequebooks to the UK 
market. As such, it welcomed the decision by the Payments 
Council during the year to remove the immediate uncertainty 
surrounding the future of cheques by announcing that it has 
withdrawn plans for closing cheque clearing in 2018 and that 
cheques will remain a primary payment mechanism for as long 
as needed. The Payments Council confirmed that it will focus 
on making all payments fit for the 21st century by encouraging 
innovation in new and existing types of payments. The Group has 
significant long-term contracts for the production of chequebooks 
with the majority of its financial services customers and continues 
to work with all interested parties to investigate such alternative 
payment solutions. The Group’s capability in security print is being 
extended to other areas, such as payslips, prescription forms 
and match tickets, so that the resulting new business offsets any 
reducing demand for chequebooks. In the meantime, the cost 
base continues to be managed to maintain margins.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group is committed to providing a safe and satisfying 
working environment and delivering on its broader environmental 
responsibilities. Its performance in these areas was sustained or 
improved during 2011. 
There were 87 accidents including 8 reportable incidents 
(2010 90 accidents including 8 reportable incidents) under the 
Health and Safety regulations. Whilst none are acceptable, the 
number is small in relation to the size of the workforce and the 
complexity and geographic spread of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s environmental record improved with further 
increases in recycled waste from 98.67% in 2010 to 98.92% 
in 2011 and reductions between years of 8.2% and 10.2% in 
carbon footprint and water consumption respectively.
Communisis is also actively involved in supporting young 
people and the wider communities in which we operate.  
Our work with the Prince’s T rust and other initiatives are set 
out in more detail in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
on pages 18 to 29.
2011 has been a demanding but successful year on many 
fronts and I would like to thank all our employees for the 
contribution they have made in delivering this strong 
performance.

Both the IDC and SPS segments, whether people-based or capital-
intensive, have a degree of operational gearing with certain costs 
being fixed in the short to medium term. Any change in the level 
and mix of turnover therefore has an impact on profitability. This is 
reflected in the results for IDC as profit and margins have fallen with 
the reduction in turnover and also in SPS where profit and margins, 
with the added benefit of cost reductions, have both improved. 
The first phase of a restructuring programme, announced in 
November 2010 and charged as an exceptional cost of £2.9m in 
that year, was largely completed and paid for during the year.
The exceptional items in 2011 include: £2.2m relating to the 
second phase of a restructuring programme, announced in July, 
covering the Leeds manufacturing facility, site consolidation 
and headcount reduction elsewhere; £1.7m associated with 
the acquisition of Orchestra Bristol in June and the subsequent 
closure of the site, announced in December, following the transfer 
of production for the Proximity London (BBC TV Licensing) 
contract to the Liverpool facility; and £0.4m of non-recurring costs 
connected with the Pension Scheme and other projects. The 
benefits from the resulting efficiencies will predominantly flow in 
2012 and beyond. £1m of the estimated cash cost of £4.3m for 
these items was incurred in 2011 with £3m scheduled to be paid 
in 2012 and £0.3m in subsequent years.
Included within finance costs for the year is a credit of £0.9m 
being the difference between the expected return and the 
expected interest cost on the Pension Scheme assets and 
liabilities respectively (2010 charge of £0.5m).
FINANCE REVIEW   (continued)
Profit from operations before exceptional items increased by 
19% to £9.4m on turnover (excluding pass through) which was 
broadly unchanged from 2010. This was achieved in challenging 
market conditions through a combination of new business wins, 
better margin services and cost reductions, especially in the SPS 
segment, so that the overall operating margin on sales (excluding 
pass through) improved from 4.7% in 2010 to 5.5%. 
New business wins during the year largely offset the reduction in 
sales due to the progressive migration of communications from 
printed to digital formats and the effects of lower prices in some of 
the more competitive market sectors.
The mix of revenues and the relative contributions from the two 
segments were different to that in 2010 and will continue to vary 
as demand patterns change. The proportion of pass through 
revenues, which reflect purchases passed on to customers at cost, 
also vary for the same reason. 
The improvement in the overall result reflects the strength of the 
Group’s proposition as a marketing services provider as well as its 
resilience in being able to deliver a range of tailored services, either 
individually or in combination, that meet the particular and changing 
needs of each customer. 
T wo of the Group’s key strategic objectives are to broaden and 
deepen the service offering, so that each element has critical mass 
and credibility in the marketplace, and to diversify the revenues by 
growing the client portfolio in sectors other than financial services. 
Further progress has been made during 2011 with investments in 
new services, including e-billing, e-statements and postal sortation, 
and major client wins in the consumer goods, retail and media 
sectors. Over the three years 2009 to 2011, the proportion of 
revenues from the financial services sector has reduced from 63% to 
51%, whilst that from other sectors has increased from 37% to 49%.

reflected in the results for IDC as profit and margins have fallen with

the acquisition of Orchestra Bristol in June and the subsequent

2012 and beyond. £1m of the estimated cash cost of £4.3m for 
these items was incurred in 2011 with £3m scheduled to be paid 
in 2012 and £0.3m in subsequent years.
Included within finance costs for the year is a credit of £0.9m 
being the difference between the expected return and the 
expected interest cost on the Pension Scheme assets and 
liabilities respectively (2010 charge of £0.5m).
The 2011 tax charge has been reduced from the average standard 
rate for the year of 26.5%, and largely eliminated, following the 
favourable settlement of group relief claims and the repayment of 
prior year tax in the first half and the release of provisions no longer 
required after the successful agreement of certain open tax years in 
the second half. The 2010 tax charge was reduced by the write-back 
of provisions following the successful resolution of an outstanding 
tax issue in respect of a former subsidiary based in the USA. The tax 
charge in 2012 and beyond is expected to be below the standard 
rate due to the benefit of the asset-backed pension contribution, 
referred to below, which will be amortised over four years.
The resulting profit after tax has decreased by 7% to £4.1m (2010 
£4.4m) and basic earnings per share by 7.5% to 2.96p (2010 
3.20p). Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude the after-tax 
effect of exceptional items, have increased by 47.5% to 4.41p 
(2010 2.99p). This percentage improvement is greater than that 
of operating profit before exceptional items because the after-tax 
interest charge in 2011 is relatively lower than that in 2010.

Operating cash flow improved during 2011 with a net cash inflow 
of £7.8m (2010 £6.2m) after £3.9m of exceptional items (2010 £nil).
Bank debt disclosed in the table above reflects bank loans of 
£36m net of cash deposits of £13.3m.
Y ear-end net debt increased to £24.7m in 2011 from £19.2m in 2010. 
Within the overall amount, bank debt increased by £6.9m and finance 
lease creditors decreased by £0.8m as the capital value was repaid 
with no new finance leases being taken out. Intra-period fluctuations 
in working capital increase the level of indebtedness during the year 
with the average bank debt during 2011 being £30.5m.
The final earn-out payment for the acquisition of Absolute 
Intuistic Limited of £5.5m and the costs associated with 
the acquisition of Orchestra Bristol in June 2011 more than 
accounted for the overall increase in bank debt during the year. 
The management of trading working capital (being stock plus trade 
debtors less trade creditors) has improved over the last 3 years and 
will continue to be a focus of attention in 2012. Tight control over 
customer credit has been maintained with only 4.1% of debt being 
overdue at the year end and with little bad debt during the year.
The £3.9m cash cost of exceptional items has been a substantial 
outflow during the year. Of this amount, £2.9m related to the 
exceptional costs accrued or provided in 2010 or prior and £1m 
to the exceptional costs charged in 2011.
Investment in both segments has continued through the year.  
It is reflected largely in payroll costs in IDC and in capital 
equipment in SPS. Capital expenditure was relatively low in both 
2010 and 2011 as major deployments of leading technology 
were provided through operating leases, principally the two 
HP T300 high-speed colour digital platforms. The approximate 
capital value of these digital platforms is £2.5m each.
An interim dividend for 2011 of 0.5p per share was paid in 
September and a final dividend of 1p per share has been 
proposed, bringing the full year dividend to 1.5p, an increase of 
16% on the prior year. 
BALANCE SHEET
The Balance Sheet reflects three legacy issues that largely 
stem directly or indirectly from the original formation and early 
development of the Group through acquisitions – goodwill, net 
debt and retirement benefit obligations.
Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill has to be assessed for impairment 
at least annually under IFRS.
The impairment review conducted on the goodwill carrying value 
at 31 December 2011 of £153.7m, together with the underlying 
assumptions and estimates, reflected a more cautious outlook 
than previously in the context of current economic conditions. 
Consequently, the resulting overall headroom (being the excess 
of the recoverable amount of goodwill over its carrying value) 
reduced from £44m in 2010 to £29m in 2011. 
The approach adopted in determining the value in use, as 
a measure of the recoverable amount of goodwill, used a 
discounted cash flow methodology that necessarily involved 
numerous assumptions and estimates about revenue growth, 
operating margins, appropriate discount rates and working 
capital requirements. Future events or changes in market 
conditions, business activities and reporting structures or 
significant shortfalls in estimated cash flows could change any 
subsequent assessment of the recoverable amounts and lead to 
an impairment provision in the future that could have a material 
impact on the Group’s Balance Sheet and results.
Net debt
The Group’s continuing operations are funded through equity 
and bank debt in combination with finance and operating leases 
and trade creditors.
The bank facilities were renewed in February 2011 under a 
syndicated arrangement with Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group 
and HSBC. They comprise a fully revolving credit facility of £40m, 
which the banks agreed to extend by £5m to £45m in February 
2012, and committed until August 2014 together with an 
overdraft facility of £5m, renewable annually.
Y ear-end bank debt increased from £15.8m in 2010 to £22.7m 
in 2011 (excluding £0.6m of unamortised borrowing costs) due 
principally to the cash cost of debt-funded acquisitions. 
No new finance leases were entered into during 2011. As part 
of the ongoing commitment to the deployment of advanced 
technology, the Group entered into an operating lease for a 
second HP T300 high-speed colour digital platform, in April 
2011, with a capital value of approximately £2.5m. In November 
2011 the Group committed to a further operating lease for two 
HP T400 high-speed colour digital platforms, with installation 
planned in the first half of 2012. These platforms have a 
combined capital value of approximately £10m. 
The Group’s objectives are to ensure that bank debt excluding any 
acquisition funding but including intra-period fluctuations (which 
gave rise to average net bank debt of £30.5m during 2011) is not 
more than twice EBITDA and to generate sufficient free cash flow 
to reduce net debt progressively over the medium term. Free cash 
flow for these purposes is calculated after deducting all operating 
and non-acquisition related investment expenditure, pension 
contributions and dividends. The use of equity or debt to fund any 
future acquisitions will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
Retirement benefit obligations
The retirement benefit obligations recorded under IFRS, reflecting 
a deficit on the Pension Scheme, increased from £9.7m at 31 
December 2010 to £14.2m at the end of 2011 due principally to the 
effect of underlying changes in gilt yields and investment returns.
The pension deficit needs to be eliminated over time through 
additional contributions that are both agreed with the Pension 
Scheme T rustees and approved by the Pensions Regulator in the 
context of a triennial valuation conducted by the Scheme’s advisers. 
The triennial valuation in 2008 produced an actuarially calculated 
deficit of £40.7m. Over the last three years the Group has been 
actively managing these Pension Scheme obligations and, in 
agreement with the T rustees, has initiated an early retirement 
programme, undertaken an Enhanced T ransfer Value exercise, 
changed the inflation measurement basis for determining 
statutory increases in retirement benefits from the Retail to the 
Consumer Prices Index and made additional contributions. The 
combined effect of these initiatives, together with better-than-plan 
performance on Scheme assets has been to reduce the deficit by 
£23.7m to £17m. However interest on the deficit and subsequent 
market-related and other factors, especially the fall in gilt rates that 
are used to calculate the present values of future obligations, have 
more than doubled the deficit to £38.3m at 31 March 2011,  
the date of the latest triennial valuation.

Deficit
Fluctuations in the actuarially determined pension deficit tend to 
reflect relatively short-term volatility in market rates, compared to the 
very long-term nature of the obligations, rather than any substantial 
change in the underlying benefits that are ultimately payable. The 
Group will continue to manage the deficit within this broader market 
context by working with the T rustees to optimise the Scheme’s 
investment strategy and assets, reduce the obligations and make 
additional contributions at an appropriate and affordable level.
Following the latest triennial valuation, the Group and the 
T rustees have agreed to additional annual contributions of £3m, 
subject to review by the Pensions Regulator.
Subsequent to the year-end, the Group and the T rustees have 
also agreed to an arrangement involving the securitisation of a 
rental stream on one of the Group’s freehold properties. Under the 
arrangement the Pension Scheme will be entitled to annual rent 
of £1.15m for 15 years. The present value of the rental stream of 
£9.8m will be treated as an additional pension contribution and an 
asset that reduces the deficit by the same amount. As part of the 
arrangement, the T rustees have agreed that the £9.8m constitutes 
a prepayment of contributions for the three years from 2012 to 
2014 inclusive. Consequently the cash payments to the Pension 
Scheme will be limited to the annual rental on the property of 
£1.15m between 2012 and 2014 and then increase to £4.15m 
from 2015 onwards. The aggregate effect of the arrangement 
over this three year period will be to reduce the Group’s cash 
payments to the Pension Scheme by £5.5m.
The Group’s objectives are to manage its obligations to the 
Pension Scheme responsibly and to ensure that any future 
contributions are at committed levels that are affordable over 
the medium term without constraining the implementation of 
the Group’s development strategies.

Financial performance
Economic environment
Macro-economic uncertainties affect marketeers’ behaviour and 
the level and mix of discretionary marketing spend.
Market trends are monitored and factored into the Group’s 
business planning and management processes with volume 
erosion protection clauses being included in contract terms 
where possible.
T echnological change
Changes in the application of technology, especially customers’ 
progressive adoption of digital formats and channels, impact 
market demand for the Group’s products and services and 
necessitate the development of new offerings either organically 
or through acquisition.
Continued investment in advanced technology and new services 
maintains and enhances the Group’s competitive position.
Due diligence together with the monitoring of development 
projects and integration plans ensures that new products and 
services are cost-effectively introduced and acquisitions are 
successfully implemented.
Customer concentration
A substantial percentage of Group revenues are derived from a 
relatively small number of customers and from the financial services 
sector so that there is material exposure to the loss of one or more 
large customers or to the systemic failure of this sector.
A key account management programme operates to preserve 
customer relationships, monitor compliance with service level 
agreements and expand the Group’s services.
Business development activities promote the Group’s services in 
a broad range of market sectors and into international markets.
Operational gearing
The Group is operationally geared with a cost base that is 
reasonably fixed in the short to medium term so that any loss of 
volume impacts profitability and cash flow.
The principal risks are that the Group will not:
 • adapt sufficiently quickly to any technological change 
or downturn in demand, with a consequent loss of 
competitiveness and profitability;
 • have adequate resources to invest in new technology and 
services or to meet any shortfall in projected cash flow;
 • retain its major customer portfolio, without replacement,  
or recover debts;
 • diversify sufficiently into other market sectors; and
 • comply with banking covenants and maintain its  
funding facilities.
The Group’s cost base is regularly reviewed and aligned with 
projected demand to avoid margin erosion.
Sufficient financing facilities are arranged with a reasonable 
degree of headroom over projected funding requirements.
Customer credit is closely monitored and controlled to minimise 
the amount of overdue debt.
Working capital and capital expenditure are actively managed to 
ensure that banking covenants are not breached.
RISKS AND IMPACT MITIGATING ACTIONS AND 
MANAGEMENT
Framework contracts
A substantial proportion of the Group’s activities are conducted 
within the terms of multi-year framework contracts with customers, 
often for a range of different services.
The contract terms usually contain complex commercial, legal 
and financial arrangements.
The principal risk is that over the life of the contract the practical 
working relationships may differ from those anticipated at the 
outset giving rise to the potential for dispute, commercial damage 
and financial loss.
Policy guidelines require executive director approval for unusual 
or high risk terms.
Compliance with contract terms, particularly any service level 
agreement, is monitored and, when required, reported to 
customers on a regular basis.
Periodic reviews of contract terms are conducted to highlight any 
emerging anomalies between the original intent and the current 
working practices.
Network and information security
The Group’s operations depend upon the smooth and 
uninterrupted operation of complex computer networks and 
systems and on the ability to access the networks of other parties.
The Group also processes confidential and personal data on 
behalf of customers as part of many core services.
The principal risks are that:
 • a failure to maintain a secure and fully functional IT 
infrastructure could result in an inability to meet contractual 
service obligations; and
 • the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information 
processed by the Group could be compromised by human 
error, systems failure, equipment malfunction or deliberate 
unauthorised action, 
either of which could result in reputational damage and financial loss.
Robust business continuity plans are in place.
Established information and security standards are subject to 
regular third-party audits.
Continued investment in IT infrastructure, security and monitoring 
guards against the inappropriate use of sensitive data and 
maintains and enhances the effectiveness of controls.
Pension liabilities
The Group has continuing obligations under a defined benefit 
pension scheme that is now closed to new entrants.
The principal risk is that any changes in life expectancy or other 
assumptions or in interest rates and equity returns could require 
substantial and unsustainable future cash contributions to 
eliminate any resulting increase in the Pension Scheme deficit.
The Group works closely with the Pension Scheme T rustees to 
adopt programmes that optimise returns on Pension Scheme 
assets, reduce the ultimate pension liabilities and minimise the level 
of additional cash contributions required to eliminate any deficit.
Liabilities from past disposals
The Group has contingent liabilities arising from lease 
commitment guarantees on past corporate disposals.
The financial status of the leasehold occupants is monitored on 
a regular basis.
The principal risk is that the current leasehold occupants will 
become insolvent in the current economic climate and that the 
guarantees will be called with a substantial cash cost to the Group.
Action is taken to minimise the cost to the Group when default 
is anticipated.

Changes in the application of technology, especially customers’

Communisis is keen to promote the success of the Group for 
the benefit of everyone including employees, shareholders, 
customers, suppliers and others associated with the 
organisation. We pride ourselves in operating honestly, 
responsibly and ethically, both in the workplace and in the wider 
community. This means that Communisis is a safe, pleasant, 
positive and successful place to work; and that makes sound 
commercial sense. Underpinning the way in which we operate, 
we also recognise that managing and balancing environmental, 
social and economic issues is critical in ensuring the long-term 
success of the Group. This model is based on the idea that 
corporate success and social welfare are interdependent.  
A business needs a healthy and educated workforce, sustainable 
resources and adept governance to compete effectively.
In the fast-paced and dynamic environment in which 
Communisis operates, we work to a number of standards and, 
where appropriate, we aim to obtain the relevant certification. 
We have a set of clearly defined best practice frameworks and 
management systems across the Group.

SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE
Employees within Communisis are located in a variety of 
locations and supported by the Human Resources (“HR”) 
teams based within the larger Communisis sites. The HR teams 
work closely with each other to maintain central policies and 
processes, while focusing on the key activities that are important 
to each site. 
Our business succeeds because our employees feel a real 
sense of involvement and have the opportunity to develop 
their skills and careers. We provide a mix of competitive 
pay and benefits, training, personal development and open 
communication policies. In addition to this, we aspire to the 
highest standards of conduct based upon a transparent and 
honest approach to the things we do. All employees have a part 
to play in upholding our standards and we raise awareness of 
these responsibilities throughout the Group. During 2011 we 
updated our Fraud Policy and implemented a Bribery Policy.
Communisis continues to offer a defined contribution 
pension scheme to its employees which provides competitive 
contribution levels and ancillary benefits.
SUPPORTING OUR STAFF AND WIDER 
ECONOMY –  CBI VISIT
In October of 2011 Communisis played host to a 
visiting delegation from the Confederation of British 
Industry (“CBI”). Andy Blundell, Chief Executive, 
hosted a tour of the Leeds facility for John Cridland, 
CBE, Director General of the CBI and Andrew Palmer, 
regional director of the CBI.
The CBI delegates were interested to learn about 
Communisis’ growth in export markets and their 
contribution to sustaining employment throughout 
the local area and the wider economy, as well as the 
Company’s use of sophisticated data and creative 
services to deliver personalised communications. 
The visit took in highlights of the facility including a 
guide to the Company’s advanced personalised print 
technology - the HP T300 printers - which were the 
first machines of their kind in the UK. 
Andy Blundell said “We were delighted that John and 
Andrew could spend time with us at Communisis and 
give us the opportunity to demonstrate our growth 
plans. The current CBI agenda is very relevant to 
companies such as ours.”

Communisis supports its employees through a number of 
initiatives, some of which are outlined below:
 • as part of our family-friendly policies we offer childcare 
vouchers for children up to age 16 to assist with child 
care costs. We also make an employee assistance 
programme (UNUM Lifeworks) available to all our 
employees which provides information, support 
and advice on a wide range of personal issues;
 • having achieved accreditation to the Commitment to Equality 
(C2E) standard at our major sites in 2010, this is now subject 
to annual audit and re-accreditation. We are registered on the 
National Equality register and have access to a framework 
that helps us to achieve best practice and provide a 
workplace that is committed to eliminating discrimination 
and encouraging diversity, equality and fairness; 
 • our training programmes are targeted and help ensure 
that our employees remain at the forefront of their field. 
We offer sponsorship for professional qualifications, 
graduate programmes and apprenticeships. Employees 
are encouraged to develop their skills within their 
current roles and beyond. For example, our Leeds 
facility has achieved the following during 2011:
 – 65 NVQs/ILM qualifications; 
 –  2 employees obtained a degree in Manufacturing 
Excellence;
 –  25 members of the management team obtained 
certificates in IOSH “Managing safely”;
 –  15 employees successfully completed 5S training 
provided by “Vision in Print” with regard to work-area 
management.
 • the Group-wide Recognition Scheme continues to 
reward individuals nominated by colleagues for their 
outstanding contributions and extra effort. Winners are 
selected quarterly and receive a gift voucher; and
 • various communication tools help employees to keep on 
top of news and developments across the Group. Examples 
of this include the Communisis Information Consultation 
Forum which meets on a six-monthly basis. This provides an 
opportunity for employees from across the business to put 
questions to directors regarding Communisis’ performance. 
In 2011 there has been increased use of our intranet to send 
specific communications from Board and Executive T eam 
members.
HEAL TH AND SAFETY MATTERS
Safety
Matters
That’s why
Communisis’ “Safety Matters” programme 
enables the on-site safety teams to share 
best practice and deliver a consistent safety 
programme across the manufacturing, 
warehousing and office-based working 
environments. As part of certification and 
compliance with OHSAS 18001:2007 
Communisis has a structured approach to 
the monitoring and evaluation of legal, 
regulatory and company health and safety 
(“H&S”) requirements, which is supported by a formal continuous 
audit and improvement programme. 
Communisis’ H&S policy is to aspire to zero accidents, incidents 
and instances of occupational ill-health. The Company promotes 
a positive H&S culture by adopting best practice including 
consultation and joint involvement of management and 
employees on all matters affecting their health, safety and welfare. 
The process also ensures that all managers and supervisors have 
appropriate training and are aware of their responsibilities.
In 2011 Communisis was not subject to any improvement 
notices, prohibitions or prosecutions resulting from any breaches 
of H&S or environmental regulations. Communisis also won the 
BPIF industry excellence awards for H&S at the Leeds facility in 
June 2011. 
Some of the key activities carried out in 2011 are highlighted 
below:
 • we have continued to carry out extensive occupational 
health monitoring across all manufacturing sites. Industrial 
noise is a hazardous agent within our business. Audiometric 
testing is a key tool used to assess employees to ensure 
that implemented solutions are effective and the risks 
are successfully managed. Communisis is committed 
to noise reduction at source. The replacement of legacy 
systems and equipment with new technologies such as the 
T300 and T400 printers help support these objectives; 
 • we have also carried out air sampling in areas of the 
business where an assessment has deemed it necessary, 
and the on-site management teams have introduced 
action plans to combat any adverse findings;
 • we also recognise that there are other areas of the business 
where key functions are performed in a sedentary position. 
The business has carried out ergonomic assessments 
with external professional bodies and has developed 
action plans to minimise any adverse findings; and
 • Communisis is committed to increased training across 
its manufacturing sites. The H&S team have rolled out a 
number of IOSH “Managing safely” courses during 2011.

In 2011 we have adjusted the way in which our accident 
incidence rate is calculated to include the average number of 
temporary staff as well as the average number of employees. 
The accident incidence rate for 2010 has therefore been 
adjusted on this basis.
The rate is the total number of lost-time accidents and RIDDORs 
per thousand employees.
The accident incidence rate for 2011 was 9.88 compared to a 
restated figure for 2010 of 9.86.
In 2012 we will continue to:
 • evaluate and manage asbestos on all sites;
 • evaluate and manage noise exposure within the 
manufacturing sites;
 • evaluate and manage dust and particulate exposure within 
the manufacturing sites; and
 • carry out evaluation of compliance audits and communicate 
the results to the senior management teams.
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES
Communisis is working closely with the Prince’s T rust and 
committing its skills and resources to help change young and 
disadvantaged people’s lives in Britain. As part of this process, 
during 2012, Communisis aims to become a patron of the T rust. 
Other more local activities in 2011 include working with Leeds 
City Council to offer the following initiatives:
 • Communisis joined an initiative called YOUth Inspire which 
aims to get young people onto the employment ladder by 
offering them an eight week work-experience placement. 
YOUth Inspire is one of Leeds City Council’s Y outh 
Employability programmes and is part of their CSR initiative;
 • in June 2011 Beechwood Primary School in Leeds was 
taking part in a Y oung Enterprise Scheme which involved 
the school producing an activities booklet for school 
children. Communisis assisted the school via an 
organisation called Education Business Partnerships by 
facilitating a factory tour and printing the children’s book.

Communisis’ key focus is to build on the skills of local people, 
and support community-based development. During 2011 
Communisis made a number of small donations at a local level to 
support activities important to the local communities. Support is 
also given to employees to take part in fundraising events. 
Centrally, Communisis provided printing services: 
 • to help support the Prince’s T rust to the value of £5,800; and 
 • to the Make a Wish Foundation to the value of £2,000. 
No political expenditure was incurred during the year, nor were 
any contributions made for political purposes.
ENVIRONMENT MATTERS
Environment
Matters
The “Environment Matters” programme 
recognises the real and potential impact that 
the Company’s activities have on the local, 
regional and global environment and the 
need to keep these activities under constant 
control and review. Communisis is committed 
to continuously improving its environmental 
performance. Environmental protection is 
given equal importance to other key business 
objectives. The Board reviews the Group’s 
environmental performance twice a year.
Communisis retained its certifications to ISO/IEC 14001:2004 for 
its manufacturing and logistics locations. We have also retained 
our multi-site certification to the Forest Stewardship Council 
(“FSC”) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification (“PEFC”) Chain of Custody certification. Chain of 
Custody certification confirms that Communisis only uses paper 
originating from controlled forests and identifies each link in the 
production chain, from sourcing of timber to paper manufacture 
and printing.
One hundred percent of our approved print and envelope 
suppliers have ISO/IEC 14001:2004 certification and continue 
to be monitored and audited by our Communisis Sourcing team. 
One hundred percent of our paper was supplied by paper mills 
with FSC/PEFC certification.

COMMUNISIS IS HELPING TO 
SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY . 
PRINCE’S TRUST CAMPAIGN PAINTS A 
BLEAK PICTURE TO OFFER HOPE TO 
A LOST GENERATION
New advertising campaign launched by youth 
charity The Prince’s Trust
More than 7,000 six-sheet adverts appeared at bus stops 
around the country from the start of December 2011 
to highlight the plight of more than a million 18 to 24 
year-olds who are out of work. The advertising space was 
kindly donated to the youth charity by Clear Channel and 
printed at no cost by Communisis as part of the T rust’s 
ongoing charitable partnerships with the companies.
By employing the skills of British body painter, Emma 
Cammack, the series of three adverts depict a 
generation lost, capturing young models painted by 
hand and blended into urban backdrops.
Dan Farmer, Head of Marketing at The Prince’s T rust, 
said: “Our new campaign paints a very bleak picture of 
a generation at risk. The T rust wanted to use its Lost 
Generation campaign to capture the general public’s 
imagination and position the charity as a real option 
for young people – giving hope to too many in need of 
support. We are delighted with how the adverts have 
turned out and want to extend a huge and heartfelt 
thank you to our pro bono agency, CHI & Partners, 
and to Clear Channel and Communisis for donating 
advertising space and printing respectively.”

ENVIRONMENT MATTERS
Environment
Matters
That’s why
The “Environment Matters” programme 
recognises the real and potential impact that 
the Company’s activities have on the local, 
regional and global environment and the 
need to keep these activities under constant 
control and review. Communisis is committed 
to continuously improving its environmental 
performance. Environmental protection is 
given equal importance to other key business 
objectives. The Board reviews the Group’s 
environmental performance twice a year.
Communisis retained its certifications to ISO/IEC 14001:2004 for 
its manufacturing and logistics locations. We have also retained 
our multi-site certification to the Forest Stewardship Council 
(“FSC”) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification (“PEFC”) Chain of Custody certification. Chain of 
Custody certification confirms that Communisis only uses paper 
originating from controlled forests and identifies each link in the 
production chain, from sourcing of timber to paper manufacture 
and printing.
One hundred percent of our approved print and envelope 
suppliers have ISO/IEC 14001:2004 certification and continue 
to be monitored and audited by our Communisis Sourcing team. 
One hundred percent of our paper was supplied by paper mills 
with FSC/PEFC certification. 
The environmental projects and improvements that have taken 
place in 2011 are: 
 • to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the Leeds facility 
we assessed the impact of machinery and, with careful  
re-engineering, changed the traditional print production 
process to reduce emissions. The replacement of the 
legacy presses and associated plant with digital 
technologies, such as the T300, has also significantly 
reduced the gas consumption on site; 
 • the Company signed up to the government-backed Cycle 
to Work scheme. It encourages employees to travel to work 
by bike. As well as helping the environment, it also improves 
 the health of those taking part; and
 • the Group was awarded a Silver Award by Business in the 
Community for an improvement to its carbon strategy. 
Communisis Data Intelligence Limited (formerly Absolute 
Intuistic Limited) relocated from Richmond to our central 
London office, Longbow House. Our original 2011-2013 
objective was to gain ISO 14001:2004 for the Richmond site, 
however due to the change in nature of the new office 
environment, it is no longer appropriate to pursue this standard.

Carbon intensity
All carbon intensity calculations have taken into consideration 
the adjustment to baseline figures noted above.
Carbon intensity is measured in tonnes and represents the 
amount of C0
2
 emitted per tonne of paper processed.
Whilst our carbon footprint continues to decrease, our carbon 
intensity has risen in certain areas of production and remains a 
challenge. As certain market sector volumes decline our 
operating fixed energy usage does not mirror this trend and this 
has a disproportionate effect on our carbon intensity. In Crewe 
there was a 14.7% reduction in chequebooks and documents 
produced in 2011 compared to 2010 but the electricity 
consumption only decreased by 7.56%. Continued progress is 
required.

Adjustments to our baseline data
The following amendments have been made to our baseline data 
for 2011:
 • the Group closed the Leicester warehouse facility in 
June 2011 and the Rickmansworth office in October 
2011. All calculations within this report have taken into 
consideration the closure of these facilities and baseline 
figures have been adjusted accordingly. The Eascote 
office was also closed in 2011; however, the Eascote 
site was acquired as part of the Absolute Intuistic Limited 
(now Communisis Data Intelligence Limited) acquisition 
in 2008 and was not therefore included in the 2007-
2010 calculations, so no adjustments are required; 
 • Communisis also acquired the business of Orchestra 
Bristol Limited (“OBL”) on 14 June 2011. All environmental 
data, key performance indicators and commentary 
exclude the OBL facility because Communisis only 
operated the site for a limited period of time;
 • our Liverpool facility at Speke was not included in our 
2007-2010 calculations and was reported separately. 
Liverpool is now included in our calculations from 2008; 
 • as noted in the 2010 Annual Report, the Company has also 
extended its carbon footprint reporting to include Scope 
2 as well as Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions. 
During 2011, the Company has expanded its reporting 
capability to enable it to capture elements of some Scope 
3 GHG emissions such as water treatment and LPG in 
relation to heating. The Company’s aim is to include Scope 
3 GHG emissions in its reported data in the future. As 
reporting improves Communisis will continue to enhance 
its carbon footprint reporting in line with DEFRA guidance;
 • relevant conversion factors have been amended in 
line with DEFRA Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2011 (DEFRA 2011 Guidelines / DECC’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and 
the Carbon T rust Conversion Factors 2011); and
 • the figures used in the carbon intensity calculation have 
been adjusted to take account of new information on cheque 
book weight. Historically a nominal cheque and credit book 
weight of 52g has been used in our calculations. In Lisburn 
it is now recognised that the nominal weight of corporate 
cheque and credit books is 104g. Therefore we have used 
the revised figures for the 2011 carbon intensity calculations 
and recalculated the historical figures submitted.
Greenhouse gas reporting and reduction
Carbon footprint reporting
All carbon footprint calculations have taken into consideration 
the adjustments to the baseline figures noted above. In 2010 
we committed to reduce our absolute carbon footprint by  
3% year-on-year totalling a 9% reduction by 2013 on our 2010 
baseline. Our progress so far is set out below.
We measure our carbon footprint in carbon tonnes (Ct) of GHG 
emitted. The sum of our carbon footprint is the combined total of 
carbon emitted based on our Scope 1 and 2 data capture.
During 2011, we reduced our carbon footprint to 12,332 Ct 
which represents a reduction of 8.2%.

Water consumption
In 2010 we set an objective to cut our water consumption by 
10% of the 2010 baseline by 2013.
There has been a significant water consumption reduction for 
the Group during 2011 and we have already achieved our target 
for 2013. This was mainly due to two key factors: 
 • a significant amount of the redundant and/or excessive 
water system was removed from the Crewe facility 
and replaced with a system that meets the current 
business needs and employee numbers; and 
 • the removal of traditional printing methods requiring 
a high volume of water usage in the Leeds facility 
and their replacement with digital technology.

Waste
Non-recycled waste
In 2010 we agreed to begin reporting non-recycled waste as a 
percentage of all waste produced. We set a target to reduce this 
by 10% of the 2010 baseline by 2013.
During the year we reduced this by 18.61% of the 2010 baseline. 
We have therefore already exceeded our 2013 target.
Through our education and segregation programmes we 
continue to reduce the amount of non-recycled waste sent to 
landfill and we continue to explore new waste disposal routes. 
Given the progress made so far there is limited scope for further 
reduction. Any further improvements will require specific focus 
on key areas and greater engagement from our staff.

Reduce paper wastage
In 2010 we set a target to reduce the percentage of paper 
wastage at our production sites by 5% of the 2010 baseline by 
2013. Paper wastage is currently calculated based on the total 
weight of the products we produce compared to the total paper 
waste which is recycled. The products produced at our Leeds 
facility are complex and varied in nature and our systems are  
not currently able to measure the average weight of these 
products for the purposes of this paper waste calculation.  
All other sites involved in the production of paper-based 
products are included in the measurement data. In 2010 the 
percentage of paper wastage at these production sites was  
16.58%. This has increased to 17.22% in 2011 which represents 
a 3.86% increase .
It has been noted that our Liverpool site does not record 
customer paper waste separately from paper waste generated 
by Communisis. Our figures for 2010 and 2011 therefore include 
an element of customer paper waste over which Communisis 
has no control. Customer paper waste is from products such 
as obsolete leaflets or envelopes which customers provide to 
Communisis for use in their mailings. From 2012 onwards we will 
record customer paper waste separately in order to provide a 
more accurate picture of our progress.
Increasing our use of sustainable resources
In 2010 we committed to increase the percentage of electricity 
from renewable sources. In 2011 we bought 8,264,296.9 kWh 
of our electricity from renewable sources. This represented 41% 
of our total electricity needs (2010 39%). Further progress is 
planned for 2012.

SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS
Quality
Matters
That’s why
Communisis operates an ISO 9001:2008 
Quality Management System model and has 
achieved certification to this standard for its 
manufacturing, print sourcing and logistics 
sites. The Group has a “Quality Matters” 
programme to drive a “right first time” attitude 
within the workforce and promote a culture of 
collective responsibility for the quality of 
products and services.
We aim to make Communisis a centre of excellence and be the 
supplier of choice for the marketing services industry. We aim to 
deliver products and services that exceed expectations in terms of 
customer satisfaction and provide a best-in-class service through 
our quality, delivery and service. We want to deliver products and 
services in a timely, cost effective manner, continuously satisfying 
all legal, contractual and regulatory requirements. 
On an annual basis Communisis seeks feedback from customers. 
As a result of this process in 2011, we decided to focus on 
customer service, quality and innovation. Senior management and 
local site teams are charged with implementing and maintaining 
these objectives which are then converted into individual targets 
for employees and business areas.
SUPPORTING OUR SUPPLIERS
Communisis’ social and environmental impacts extend beyond 
the Group’s own direct operations to the goods and services it 
procures from its supply chain. The Communisis Sourcing team 
operates across the group, embedding ethical and responsible 
procurement practices within the supply chain whilst driving 
up environmental standards to create a fully sustainable, 
responsible and accountable supply base. Communisis Sourcing 
continues to encourage its suppliers to follow a greener path by 
planning, producing and delivering business-critical marketing 
communications in a more sustainable and environmentally-
friendly way enabling Communisis to deliver significant value to 
its customers. 
Communisis has been awarded the highly exclusive and 
prestigious Gold Certification from the Chartered Institute of 
Purchasing & Supply (“CIPS”). The certification recognises 
strategic expertise in purchasing and supply management. It also 
acknowledges our proven ability as an established purchase and 
supply business function which delivers competitive advantage, 
for Communisis and our clients. 
CIPS Gold Certification is the ultimate global recognition for 
purchasing and supply process management excellence and 
has only been awarded to 14 organisations in total. Others who 
have achieved Gold certificates are Asda, BBC, DEFRA and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Profit measures
Profit after taxation is calculated after all exceptional items and 
taxation.
Profit from operations before exceptional items is calculated by 
excluding material and infrequently occurring gains and losses.
Adjusted dividend cover is the ratio of interim dividends paid 
and final dividends proposed to profit before exceptional items 
after tax.
Operating margin on sales is profit from operations before 
exceptional items, as a percentage of total revenue excluding 
pass through revenue.
Cash flow and bank debt measures
Bank debt is calculated as total loans and borrowings, including 
overdrafts, net of cash and cash equivalents. For the purposes 
of capital management, the Group considers undiscounted 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings as the appropriate 
measure for the purposes of determining bank debt. This 
excludes amounts owed under hire purchase contracts, 
disclosed in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Debt outside credit terms is gross overdue trade debt, as a 
percentage of total trade debtors.
Other financial measures
Pension deficit is the year end accounting deficit measured in 
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Sales from financial services are measured as a percentage  
of total revenue.

The UK activities of the Group are directed under two operating 
companies, Communisis UK Limited and Communisis Data 
Intelligence Limited (formerly Absolute Intuistic Limited). The 
Group has two divisions: Intelligence Driven Communications 
(“IDC”) and Specialist Production and Sourcing (“SPS”).
IDC covers 
 • Data and Analysis Services
 • Creative Services
 • Campaign Management Services

 • Cheques
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Expenditure on research and development in the year was 
£372,000 (2010 £156,000). 
In 2011 we focused on two main areas of development.  
Firstly creating a platform “Mantl” under which we are bringing 
together our existing technologies: IQ; Connect; and Digital 
Asset Management. The first phase of this will be live in  
 Q1 2012. 
We have also invested in IBM Quality Stage. This solution 
provides a high performance data processing environment 
enabling us to consolidate activity into our data centres and 
eliminate legacy bespoke applications.
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EqUIPMENT 
Details of the movements in property, plant and equipment are

EMPLOYEES
The Group is an equal opportunity employer and maintained 
accreditation to the Commitment to Equality standard 
throughout 2011. As part of our ongoing commitment to 
equality and diversity there has been a focus on educating our 
employees on their responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 
and this has been supported by the roll-out of revised group 
polices that promote and support equal opportunities.
The Group gives full consideration to the applications for 
employment from disabled persons where the candidate’s 
particular aptitudes and abilities are consistent with adequately 
meeting the requirements of the job. Opportunities are available 
to disabled employees for training, career development and 
promotion.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s 
policy to provide continuing employment wherever practicable 
in the same or an alternative position and to provide appropriate 
training to achieve this aim.
We have also been awarded two BPIF Excellence Awards for 
Human Resources and Health & Safety. Both awards are in 
recognition of the positive progression that the business has 
made in each of these areas.
The Group keeps all employees informed about matters 
affecting them, through consultation and information on 
the general financial and economic factors affecting the 
Group’s performance. We use several types of employee 
communications such as weekly and monthly briefings, 
employee newsletters, roadshows, staff notice boards, intranet 
and regular e-mails to all employees. Any employees without 
access to the internet or e-mail are provided with copies of these 
communications.
The Communisis Information and Consultation Forum has 
been in place for the last four years. Business units elect forum 
members, who attend update meetings with the Chief Executive, 
Andy Blundell.

SUPPLIER PA YMENT POLICY
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of payment for every new 
supplier. The payment terms are specified on our standard 
documentation to ensure our suppliers are aware of them. 
The Group does not follow any specified code or recognised 
standard in respect of payment of suppliers.
The number of days’ purchases in creditors at the year-end was 
77 days (2010 69 days).
TREASURY POLICY
The Group takes a centralised approach to the management 
of debt, liquid resources and interest rate risk. We finance our 
activities with a combination of bank loans, finance and operating 
leases, cash and short-term deposits. Uncommitted overdraft 
facilities are used to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. 
The Group’s facilities are all on variable interest terms and 
therefore the Group is exposed to interest rate movements 
although, as explained in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, interest rate swaps are in place in respect of part 
of the Group’s indebtedness. Please refer to Note 26 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Finance Review on 
pages 12 to 15 for further details.
QUALIFYING THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY 
PROVISION
Article 172 of the Company’s Articles of Association provides 
that, subject to the provisions of the enactments concerning 
companies (which limit the scope of indemnities in favour of 
directors), every director, officer and the auditor of the Company 
is to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against 
all costs, charges, expenses, losses and liabilities which he 
may sustain or incur in or about the execution of his office or in 
relation thereto. This is a qualifying third party indemnity provision 
within the meaning of Section 234 Companies Act 2006.
The Company also takes out insurance covering claims against 
the directors or officers of the Company and any subsidiary. 
This insurance provides coverage in respect of some of the 
Company’s liabilities under Article 172.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Business Review on pages 5 to 29. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review 
pages 12 to 15. Notes 23 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements include:
 • the Group’s financial risk management objectives;
 • policies and processes for managing capital;
 • details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and
 • details of exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through its bank facilities, which were renewed on 24 February 
2011 for an extended term until August 2014. Current economic 
conditions create uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand 
for the Group’s products and services in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that we should be 
able to operate within the level of recently renewed facilities.
The Board has carried out an assessment in accordance with the 
FRC’s “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies 2009” and, based on the assumptions noted 
above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 2 May 2012 
is contained in a separate document sent to shareholders with 
this report and available on the Company’s website.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO  
THE AUDITOR
In accordance with Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, 
the directors confirm that, so far as each is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware.  
Each director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director to make himself aware of, and to establish that the 
auditor is aware of, any relevant audit information.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS
The following is additional information required for shareholders 
as a result of the implementation of the T akeovers Directive into 
UK law.
At 31 December 2011, the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised:
   % of total 
   issued  
   share  
 Number £000 capital
Ordinary shares  
of 25p each 138,651,540 34,663 100
Each share carries one vote with the result that the total voting 
rights at the same date were 138,651,540.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions in the transfer of 
shares or voting rights.
ORDINARY SHARES
Every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy at 
a general meeting of the Company will be entitled to vote and 
shall have one vote on a show of hands. On a poll, every member 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote for every ordinary share held.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines 
for exercising voting rights either in person or by proxy in relation 
to resolutions to be passed at that meeting. All proxy votes are 
counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to 
each resolution are available at the Annual General Meeting and 
published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company other than:
 • the registration of share transfers may be suspended 
at such times and for such periods (not exceeding 30 
days in any year) as the directors may determine;
 • certain restrictions may, from time to time, be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws 
and market requirements relating to close periods); and
 • the restrictions imposed by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, whereby certain employees 
of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal 
in the Company’s securities.
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by 
a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. 
Directors are re-appointed by ordinary resolution at a general 
meeting of the shareholders. The Articles provide that the Board 
can appoint a director but anyone so appointed must be elected 
by an ordinary resolution at the next Annual General Meeting. 
At each Annual General Meeting, one-third of the directors 
previously elected at an Annual General Meeting must retire by 
rotation. Each retiring director who wishes to continue to serve 
must be re-elected at the meeting. In line with best practice, the 
Board has agreed to conduct annual re-elections at the 2012 
Annual General Meeting and plans to do so in future years.
DIRECTORS’ AUTHORITIES
The directors are authorised under the terms of Section 551 
of the Companies Act 2006 to issue ordinary shares up to 
a maximum aggregate nominal value of £11,550,248 and to 
issue ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal value of £11,550,248. Pursuant to 
Section 570 of the Companies Act 2006, the directors are also 
authorised to allot shares for cash, without first offering them 
to existing shareholders, up to a limit of 5% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital. This authority also gives the 
directors the power to allot shares for cash in connection with a 
rights issue.

through its bank facilities, which were renewed on 24 February 
2011 for an extended term until August 2014. Current economic 
conditions create uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand 
for the Group’s products and services in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that we should be 
able to operate within the level of recently renewed facilities.
The Board has carried out an assessment in accordance with the 
FRC’s “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies 2009” and, based on the assumptions noted 
above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They therefore continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.

Communisis is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance for which the Board is accountable. This Report, 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, describes how the 
Board applies the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council, which is publicly 
available at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
COMPLIANCE 
During the year under review, the Company has complied with 
the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“Code”).
BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY
Details of the business model and strategy are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Review and the Finance Review.
BOARD STRUCTURE
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, four executive 
directors and two independent non-executive directors.
During the year, the following changes were made:
 • Peter King resigned from the Board as Executive 
Director and relinquished his role as Finance Director 
on 4 March 2011. Nigel Howes took on the additional 
responsibility of Finance Director from this date;
 • Alistair Blaxill resigned from the Board as 
Executive Director on 22 November 2011.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and Chief Executive which is set out in writing and approved by 
the Board. The Chairman has primary responsibility for leading 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its 
role. The Chief Executive is responsible for operations and the 
development of strategic plans and initiatives for consideration 
by the Board. 
Michael Firth is, and was throughout the year, the Senior 
Independent Director to whom concerns can be conveyed by 
shareholders if they have issues which have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or 
Finance Director.
Biographical details of the Board as at 31 December 2011 can 
be found on pages 30 to 31. The Chairman does not have any 
other significant commitments other than those detailed in his 
biography. During the year under review he was appointed as 
Non-Executive Chairman of UK Coal plc and resigned as Senior 
Independent Director of London and Continental Railways 
Limited and as Non-Executive Director of Kazakhmys plc.
In approving his new appointment to UK Coal plc, the Board was 
satisfied that the time commitment required for this appointment 
did not represent an issue for the Company.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Under the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 each 
Director must seek authorisation before taking up any position 
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. All existing external appointments for each director 
have been authorised by the Board and a register is kept and 
reviewed on an annual basis. All directors are aware of the need 
to consult the Company Secretary about any further possible 
conflict that may arise, so that prior consideration can be given 
by the Board to whether or not such conflict will be approved. 
BOARD PROCEEDINGS 
The Board schedules nine or ten meetings each year, and also 
meets at other times as appropriate. The table below shows the 
attendances of each director at meetings of the Board and its 
standing committees during the year. Details of which directors 
sit on which committees are set out on page 32.

† Peter King resigned from the Board on 4 March 2011.
†† Alistair Blaxill resigned from the Board on 22 November 2011.
The powers of the Board are set out in a formal schedule of 
matters reserved for Board approval which is reviewed annually. 
Matters reserved for the Board include:
 • strategy;
 • budget approval and monitoring of performance;
 • acquisitions and disposals;
 • approval of the annual report, interim, preliminary 
and interim management statements;
 • approving significant contracts; and
 • approving group policies. 
The Company ensures that the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. Directors may seek independent professional advice 
when necessary. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. 
During the year under review the Chairman held meetings 
with the non-executive directors to discuss a range of issues 
including strategy, financial performance, progress towards 
targets, management performance and management 
succession. 
re-eLeCtIoN
In line with the Code, all directors seek re-election every three 
years and any director appointed during the year also seeks 
re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. However, in line 
with best practice, the entire Board will be submitting itself for 
re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting and plans to 
do so in future years, save that, as announced on 1 March 2012, 
Roger Jennings will retire from the Board at the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting and will not therefore stand for 
re-election. 
Although Michael Firth and Roger Jennings have now been 
appointed to the Board for nine years, the Board is satisfied that 
both Roger and Michael remain independent, as neither director 
has served more than five concurrent years with any of the 
executive directors, and Roger will be retiring at the upcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
The Board is satisfied that all the directors continue to 
demonstrate the level of skills and commitment to be fully 
effective in their respective roles as members of the Board.
The Company’s search for a successor to Roger Jennings is well 
underway in order to ensure a smooth and effective transition of 
responsibilities.

The Company’s search for a successor to Roger Jennings is well 
underway in order to ensure a smooth and effective transition of 
responsibilities.
INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
A formal and comprehensive induction process is in place 
for new directors, which includes an information pack and 
personalised induction programme. This programme is tailored 
to the needs of each director and agreed with him or her so that 
he or she can gain a better understanding of the Company. 
In order to ensure that directors continue to further their 
understanding of the issues facing the Company, the non-
executive directors make at least two site visits per year. 
This gives them the opportunity to meet the management 
teams across the business and improve their knowledge and 
understanding of the different areas of the business.
BOARD EVALUATION
A Board performance evaluation was undertaken in 2011. 
The evaluation process was based on a series of questions 
devised for the purpose and circulated to the directors. 
The process reviewed issues such as: the assessment and 
monitoring of the Company’s strategy; the mix of knowledge 
and skills on the Board; succession; and performance of the 
Board committees. The results were collated by the Company 
Secretary and considered by the Chairman or, in the case of 
the Chairman, by the Senior Independent Director. The Senior 
Independent Director, after consultation with the other directors, 
also conducted an appraisal interview with the Chairman. The 
performance of the Board as a whole and of each of its principal 
Committees was considered. The results of the evaluation will 
form the basis of Board objectives for 2012. 
With the Company’s increasing focus on data and digital 
services, it was felt that the Board would benefit from additional 
knowledge and experience in this area and this has been 
included in the criteria for a new Non-Executive Director to be 
appointed following Roger Jennings retirement from the Board at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting in May 2012.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has four Committees: Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Administration & Finance, all of which have terms 
of reference which deal specifically with their authorities and 
duties. The terms of reference may be viewed on the Company’s 
website, www.communisis.com.
Only the Committee chairmen and members of the Committees 
are entitled to be present at the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committee meetings but others may attend by 
invitation.

Audit Committee
During the year, the Audit Committee comprised:
 • Roger Jennings (Chairman);
 • Michael Firth.
Michael Firth brings recent and relevant financial expertise to 
the Committee. Appointments to the Committee are made by 
the Board, which considers that the membership of the Audit 
Committee as a whole has the recent and relevant financial 
experience required to fulfill its duties.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to 
undertake its duties. It has access to the Company Secretary, 
who acts as secretary to the Committee, and all other 
employees. The Committee may take independent legal or 
professional advice when it believes it is necessary.
The Committee meets as required but not less than three times a 
year. The Committee also meets in the absence of management 
for discussions with the external auditor and in the absence of 
the external auditor when undertaking its annual appraisal of the 
performance of the auditor.
The main roles and responsibilities of the Committee are to 
monitor:
 • the financial reporting process;
 • the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control, internal 
audit function, and risk management systems; 
 • the statutory audit of the Annual Report and 
Consolidated Financial Statements; and
 • the independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor, particularly with regard to the 
scope and expenditure on non-audit work.
The Committee will recommend to the Board any action required 
if a material cause for concern, or scope for improvement is 
discovered.
The main activities of the Committee in 2011 were:
 • assessing the implications of the significant 
financial reporting issues related to the preparation 
of the Group’s Financial Statements;
 • assessing the effectiveness of the systems 
established to identify, assess, manage and 
monitor financial and non-financial risks;
 • monitoring the integrity of the Group’s internal financial 
controls;
 • monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness 
of the internal audit function, including action taken 
following any significant failure in internal control;
 • monitoring the Group’s implementation of any new 
accounting policies;
 • reviewing with the external auditor the findings of its work 
and the effectiveness of the external audit process; and
 • reviewing the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor.
The Committee has established a policy determining the non-
audit services that the external auditor can provide and the 
procedures required for pre-approval of any such engagement. 
This policy provides for the auditor to be engaged only for 
work that is not prohibited by professional or other regulatory 
requirements and specifies services that may not be provided, 
and also details a cost threshold above which engagement will 
be carefully considered. This allows the Committee to satisfy 
itself that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded. 
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year to 
31 December 2011 and information on the nature of the 
non-audit fees incurred appear in Note 5.5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The non-audit fees were paid in respect 
of taxation services. T otal fees paid to the auditor were less than 
£40,000 and therefore these matters are not considered by 
the Committee to affect the independence or objectivity of  
the auditor. 
The external auditor’s appointment is subject to regular review 
and the lead audit partner is rotated at least once every five 
years.
Nomination Committee
The composition of the Nomination Committee during the year 
was:
 • Peter Hickson (Chairman);
 • Michael Firth;
 • Roger Jennings.
Committee appointments are made by the Board.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to 
undertake its duties. It has access to the Company Secretary, 
who acts as secretary to the Committee, and all other 
employees. The Committee may take independent legal or 
professional advice when it believes it necessary.
The Committee meets as required.
The main roles and responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 • review the composition of the Board and make 
recommendations to the Board of any changes needed;
 • consider, at the request of the Board or the Chairman, the 
making of any appointment or re-appointment, to the Board;
 • evaluate the skills, knowledge and experience 
of the Board and, taking these into account, 
prepare a description of the role and capabilities 
required for a particular appointment; and
 • identify and nominate, for Board approval, 
candidates to fill any Board vacancies.
As part of its role is to review the composition of the Board, the 
Nomination Committee met in the year to discuss a successor 
for Roger Jennings who is to retire at the 2012 Annual General 
Meeting. A detailed candidate specification was prepared and 
agreed with the Chief Executive which defined the criteria for the 
new non-executive director. In accordance with the requirements 
of that specification, an independent external search agency 
was sought and retained to assist with the search for suitable 
candidates. A short-list of potential candidates was produced. 
The short-listed candidates will be interviewed by the Senior 
Independent Director and Chief Executive. Following these 
interviews, the final candidates will be selected and interviewed 
by the Chairman and the Chief Executive. 
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 45.
Administration and Finance Committee
The Committee comprises any two directors, one of whom must 
be the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Finance Director. 
It may appoint its own Chairman and it meets when necessary.
It is empowered by the Board to:
 • administer the Company’s share schemes in accordance 
with the Board’s policy (and any specific decisions 
of the Remuneration Committee that concern 
participation by directors and/or senior employees);

needed by the business, enter into finance leases and 
operate existing banking facilities (within the limit set by 
the Group’s borrowing facilities immediately before taking 
action and subject to a transaction limit of £10 million); and
 • enter into guarantees or indemnities where they are a 
necessary incidental of the exercise of the powers above.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control in the Group and reviewing its effectiveness.  
This system, designed to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Company’s assets, provides reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Company has an internal audit function which is 
independent in action and reporting, and has a direct line of 
communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. The principal 
role in fulfilling the internal audit function is to review the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the controls operating within the 
business by undertaking an agreed schedule of independent 
audits each year. The nature and scope of this annual audit 
programme is agreed in advance by the Audit Committee each 
year and may be revised from time to time according to changing 
business circumstances and requirements. The findings of these 
audits are reported in accordance with the internal audit terms 
of reference and any necessary corrective actions are agreed 
and monitored. Summaries of these reports are presented to, 
and discussed with, the Audit Committee along with details of 
progress against action plans as appropriate.
An ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the 
significant risks faced by the business is embedded in the Group. 
These procedures, which reflect the guidance of the T urnbull 
Committee, have been in place throughout 2011 and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
The main risks affecting the Group are set out on pages  
16 to 17.
The key features of the internal control and risk management 
systems include:
 • management structure which has clearly defined levels of 
responsibility, limits of authority and reporting procedures;
 • regular meetings of the Group’s Executive Board  to discuss 
performance and plans;
 • Code of Business Ethics sets out the standards of 
business conduct;
 • group-wide information security, health and safety, 
environmental and quality management systems which 
are subject to regular external accreditation;

 • senior managers review and challenge the business unit 
risk registers on a quarterly basis and produce a Group risk 
register for review by the Executive Board and the Board; and
 • annual risk-based audit plan approved by the 
Audit Committee.
The Group has in place internal control and risk management 
systems specific to the financial reporting and consolidation 
process to ensure that adequate accounting records are 
maintained and transactions are fairly and accurately recorded. 
These include:
 • formal written financial policies and procedures contained 
in the Group Accounting Manual;
 • monthly certification by Divisional Finance Directors 
on the compliance with appropriate policies and 
the accuracy of the financial information; 
 • detailed review of monthly management accounts, interim 
and year-end accounts by the Executive Board and 
the Board;
 • self-assessment questionnaire enabling financial controls 
across the Group to be measured and evaluated.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management. The review covers all material controls, in 
particular the financial, operational and compliance controls 
in place across the Group. The results are reported to and 
considered by the Board. Further details on this process are set 
out in the Audit Committee report on page 40.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board is aware of the importance of there being a dialogue 
with shareholders so that the Board keeps abreast of, and 
understands, shareholders’ views and opinions. 
It achieves this in a variety of ways:
 • the Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly meet 
institutional shareholders; 
 • there is communication with major shareholders on specific 
matters such as performance, strategy and governance;
 • there are presentations with analysts and investors after 
the announcement of results;
 • at the Annual General Meeting, shareholders have the 
opportunity to raise questions with the Board during 
the meeting; 
 • directors also make themselves available before and after 
the Annual General Meeting to talk informally to 
shareholders, should they wish to do so.
Information in relation to those who have a significant direct 
or indirect holding in the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 35.
STRUCTURE OF COMPANY’S CAPITAL
Details of the structure of the Company’s capital are set out in 
the Directors’ Report on pages 33 to 37.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER IFRS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and regulations and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
must not approve the financial statements for the Group unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. Under IFRS, the directors are required to prepare financial 
statements that present fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and apply 
them consistently;
 • present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
 • make judgments and estimates that are reasonable;
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s financial position and financial performance;
 • state that the Group has complied with IFRS, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records, which show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER  
UK GAAP
The directors are responsible for preparing the parent company 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(“UK GAAP). Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the profit and loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are  
required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 • make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 • state whether applicable accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
STATEMENTS PURSUANT TO DTR4
Each of us, for himself and on behalf of each other director who 
held office on 31 December 2011, confirms that, to the best of 
his knowledge:
 • the Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole; and
 • the Business Review (comprising pages 5 to 29 and 
pages 33 to 37) includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces.

REMUNERA TION POLICY
The policy of the Board is to:

all levels across the Group;
 • give employees the periodic opportunity to own Communisis 
shares through the Communisis Sharesave Scheme; and
 • provide consistency in and alignment with the Company’s 
approach to performance-based pay and our overall 
executive compensation strategy.
The implementation of this policy involves:
 • paying a base salary that reflects individual roles, 
performance and contribution, taking into account 
salaries at companies of similar size and complexity;
 • linking rewards to group performance and sustainable 
shareholder value by providing bonus opportunities; and
 • giving executives the opportunity to increase their base salary 
by meeting and outperforming key objectives that support 
the Company’s strategy, thereby linking executive rewards 
to the Company’s performance and shareholder interests.

Basic Salary and Benefits
Executive directors’ base salaries are reviewed each year with 
any changes taking effect from 1 July. The review takes into 
account Group and individual performance. All the executive 
directors excluding Andy Blundell received a 2% salary increase 
which was in line with pay increases across the Group. The 
Committee decided, further to a benchmarking exercise and due 
to his performance over the last 18 months, that Andy Blundell’s 
salary be increased from £260,000 to £300,000 with effect from 
1 July 2011. Dave Rushton received a further salary increase 
with effect from 21 November 2011 in respect of his additional 
responsibilities as announced on 22 November 2011.
Life assurance cover for Andy Blundell and Dave Rushton is a 
facet of their membership of the Communisis Pension Plan (see 
below), and was provided for Peter King until his resignation. Life 
assurance for John Wells is provided for under a separate policy 
that is linked to the Group Life Assurance policy. The same was 
provided for Alistair Blaxill until the end of his notice period. Nigel 
Howes does not participate in the Communisis Pension Plan and 
does not have a separate life assurance policy.
This table shows the annual rates of basic pay for each executive 
director, effective at the date of this Report:
 Current basic salary (£)
Andy Blundell  300,000
Nigel Howes  209,100
Dave Rushton  210,000
John Wells  191,500
Annual performance bonus in  respect of 2011
Any annual bonus is paid in cash immediately after the audited 
results for the year are published. At the start of 2011, the 
Committee decided that it should be possible to earn a bonus 
potential of up to 75% of basic pay for meeting EBIT targets. 
Payment under the Scheme was 19.5% of basic pay.
As was disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
2010, the Board (including the members of the Remuneration 
Committee) tasked John Wells with further specific strategic 
business objectives in 2011 that were linked to key customer 
contract renewals and the development of new target accounts. 
Having successfully achieved these strategic business objectives,  
John Wells was awarded an additional bonus. The directors’ 
remuneration table on page 51 records the payment to John 
Wells of a bonus of £100,000, being the maximum available under 
this arrangement, as previously disclosed.
The annual cash bonuses payable to executive directors also 
appear in the remuneration table on page 51.
Annual performance bonus in respect of 2012
The Committee has used an appropriate EBIT target for the 
Executive Directors. A bonus of up to 100% of basic pay may be 
earned. The achievement against the EBIT target will be reported 
next year.
Pension benefits
Company pension benefits are provided through the Defined 
Contribution (“DC”) section of the Communisis Pension Plan. The 
Defined Benefit (“DB”) section of the Plan was closed to future 
accrual for existing members on 30 November 2007.
Until 2004, John Wells was a contributing member of the DB section. 
In 2006 Mr Wells, in conjunction with a change in HM Revenue & 
Customs (“HMRC”) rules, opted to draw early retirement benefits 
from the DB section. Further details are provided on page 51.
Details of the individual directors’ pension arrangements, during 
2011 and for 2012, are shown below:
SHARE SCHEMES
The Company had five share schemes during the year.
The Sharesave Scheme
This is an all-employee scheme approved by HMRC and follows 
the usual form for such schemes. The Committee agreed that 
a Sharesave award be made in 2011 and invitations were made 
to all employees. The scheme and details of the 2011 grant are 
described in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
No directors took up the opportunity to apply for shares in 2011. 
However, John Wells took his full entitlement in the 2009 grant. 
The Communisis Matched Award Plan
There are no extant awards to directors under this scheme 
and the Committee has no intention of making any further 
awards. The scheme was aimed at encouraging selected senior 
employees of the Company to invest up to 50% (or any other 
percentage determined by the Committee) of any payment 
under any performance-related incentive plan in the Company’s 
shares by offering a one-for-one matching award under the 
scheme with the right to the shares vesting after three years and 
proportionately to the proportion of the original purchase still held 
by the beneficiary at vesting. 
The Executive Share Option Scheme 2000
This scheme expired on 7 June 2010. All previous awards 
were subject to performance conditions. The scheme and the 
performance conditions are fully described in Note 13 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no extant awards to 
directors under this scheme. 
The Executive Share Option Scheme 2010
This scheme is open, at the Board’s discretion, to executive 
directors and senior managers. All awards are made subject 
to performance conditions. The Committee’s intention is to 
use the HMRC-approved part of this new scheme only in 
flexible combination with the Long T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”). 
Having determined the appropriate size of any L TIP award, the 
Committee may choose the appropriate combination of awards 
under the two schemes, allowing it to deliver the desired benefits 
to individuals in the most tax efficient manner within HMRC’s 
£30,000 individual limit for approved share options. No awards 
were made under this scheme in 2011.

use the HMRC-approved part of this new scheme only in 
flexible combination with the Long T erm Incentive Plan (“L TIP”). 
Having determined the appropriate size of any L TIP award, the 
Committee may choose the appropriate combination of awards 
under the two schemes, allowing it to deliver the desired benefits 
to individuals in the most tax efficient manner within HMRC’s 
£30,000 individual limit for approved share options. No awards 
were made under this scheme in 2011.
The Communisis Long T erm Incentive 
Plan 2007 (“L TIP”)
Since its inception, the L TIP has been the main share incentive 
plan for executive directors and key employees and is operated in 
combination with the Executive Share Option Scheme.
L tIp awards in financial year 2010
The performance conditions for L TIP awards made to directors 
in 2010 were based on absolute share price growth targets, the 
main details of which are:
 • the performance measurement period will be three years 
from the date of an award. The attainment of a share price 
threshold in that period will produce vesting of a proportion 
of the award shares in accordance with the table below;
 • to achieve a share price threshold, the Company’s three-
monthly average share price must be above the specified 
threshold. This three-monthly average test will be applied 
to ensure that only sustained recovery is rewarded;
 • no vested shares will be released before the third 
anniversary of the award date and no vested shares 
will be released for at least two years after a threshold 
has been achieved. This means that attainment of a 
threshold in, for example, the third year of the performance 
period would lead to delivery of any relevant vested 
shares only after a further two-year period; and
 • as an underpin, no shares will vest unless the Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied as to the Company’s underlying 
financial performance in financial years 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Share price thresholds* % of Award vesting
30p  10%
50p  30%
70p  60%
90p  100%
*  Attainment between the specified thresholds can deliver vesting on a 
straight-line basis
In March 2010, the Company granted an award to the executive 
directors which were within the individual annual award limit of 
less than 150% of base salary per annum permitted under the 
L TIP rules. Details of the award are set out on page 53.
During 2011, the three-monthly average share price reached 
32.7142p. This equates to a potential percentage vesting of 
12.7142% of the award, subject to the requirement to achieve the 
further conditions of the 2010 L TIP award. 
The scheme and the performance conditions are fully described 
under the relevant heading in Note 13 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

COM-P113-R+A11-1.indd   47 15/03/2012   18:06 Communisis plc – Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011
L tIp awards in financial year 2011
As disclosed in the 2010 report, the Remuneration Committee 
agreed that the L TIP scheme be used to provide an appropriate 
and direct incentive to new members of the management team. 
Following his appointment as the Group Finance Director on 4 
March 2011, it was agreed that an award under the L TIP be made 
to Nigel Howes and that the award was within the individual annual 
award limit of less than 150% of base salary per annum permitted 
under the L TIP rules. Details of the award are set out below.
The Committee made this award to Nigel Howes on terms that 
would, as closely as possible, be consistent with the terms of 
the L TIP awards which were made to the other members of the 
executive team in 2010, as described above. Accordingly, the 
performance conditions for the L TIP award made to Nigel Howes 
in 2011 were based on the absolute share price growth targets 
applied to 2010 awards. This is intended to promote an alignment 
of interests throughout the executive team group by having 
awards that are consistent in the potential outcomes that may be 
achieved.
However, it was also viewed as important that Nigel Howes would 
not benefit from any share price performance achieved against 
the targets for the 2010 L TIP awards before his appointment. 
Accordingly, for the awards made to Nigel Howes in 2011, the 
Committee have both raised the initial target for threshold vesting, 
and scaled back the level of award from what it could have been, 
had it been made in 2010 when the other L TIP awards were 
originally made.
The main details of the performance conditions for Nigel Howes’ 
award are further summarized below:
 • to ensure that no benefit was received for performance 
achieved prior to Nigel Howes’ appointment, the number of 
shares over which the award was made were reduced by a 
factor that reflected the vesting of awards achieved in the first 
year of the performance period of the original 2010 awards;
 • the performance measurement period mirrors the 
performance period for the 2010 award, and will therefore 
run until 24 March 2013. The attainment of a share price 
threshold in that period will produce vesting of a proportion 
of the award shares in accordance with the table below. 
The lowest threshold is set at the highest share price 
level actually achieved for 2010 L TIP awards prior to 
the Finance Director’s grant of award (see page 47);
 • to achieve a share price threshold, the Company’s three-
monthly average share price must be above the specified 
threshold. This three-monthly average test will be applied 
to ensure that only sustained recovery is rewarded;
 • no vested shares will be released before the third anniversary 
of the award date and no vested shares will be released for 
at least two years after a threshold has been achieved; and
 • as an underpin, no shares will vest unless the Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied as to the Company’s underlying 
financial performance in financial years 2011 and 2012.
Share price thresholds* Potential award vesting
Less than 32.7142p Nil Option Shares
50p 129,448 Option Shares
70p 354,445 Option Shares
90p 654,442 Option Shares
*  Attainment between the specified thresholds can deliver vesting on a 
straight-line basis.
Provision of shares for share plans – dilution
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including 
executive and all-employee share awards, and assuming, which 
is most unlikely, that all subsisting options vest in full, is less 
than 6.03% of the shares in issue at the date of this report. All 
equity-based plans are assumed to be funded through the issue 
of new shares. However, the Company has an Employee Benefit 
T rust which currently holds 886,138 shares which may be used 
to satisfy options granted under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme and the Long T erm Incentive Plan. Awards are managed 
to confine commitments within an overall dilution limit for all 
employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any 
ten-year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten-year 
period for the Company’s discretionary share plans. 
SERVICE AGREEMENTS
The Committee’s policy is that each executive director’s service 
agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination 
at normal retirement age, and should otherwise be terminable 
by the Company on no more than 12 months’ notice and by the 
director on six months’ notice. The service agreements of all 
executive directors comply with that policy. None of the service 
agreements include provision for compensation payments 
on early termination. Whether any such compensation would 
be payable and the amount of any compensation would be 
determined according to the law of contract as it applies to the 
particular circumstances of an individual case. 
The date of each executive director’s contract is:
 Contract date
Andy Blundell 2 November 2009
Nigel Howes 13 September 2010
Dave Rushton 9 May 2011
John Wells 1 September 1987
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
None of the executive directors, with the exception of Nigel 
Howes, is a director of any company apart from subsidiaries of 
Communisis. Nigel Howes’ external appointments are outlined on 
page 30. During 2011 he received fees of £12,000 for his role as 
Non-Executive Chairman of Acceleris Marketing Communications 
Limited which the Committee agreed he should retain. 
No N-eXeCutIVe DIreC tor S
The fees payable to the non-executive directors are determined 
by the Board, based on salary information available in the market.
In 2011, the Board decided that there should be no increases in 
fees during the year to non-executive directors. 
The basic fee payable to each non-executive director (other 
than the Chairman of the Board) is £35,000 per annum with a 
further £5,000 payable to the Chairman of each of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. Michael Firth is paid a further £5,000 
for his role as Senior Independent Director. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the 
Chairman’s fee and agreed during the year to increase his fee 
by £15,000 following a review of market rates. The Chairman 
receives a fee of £75,000 per annum (increased to £90,000 from 
1 July 2011), inclusive of his responsibilities as Chairman of the 
Nominations Committee. 
Medical insurance has been provided for Peter Hickson and his 
spouse since 1 December 2009.
Peter Hickson was made a conditional award of options over 
250,000 shares in the Company at an exercise price of £nil per 
share as part of his recruitment arrangements. This award was 
dependent on Peter Hickson acquiring, at his own expense, 
and retaining 250,000 shares in the Company. These options 
vested on 20 December 2010 and are exercisable until  
20 December 2012.

Provision of shares for share plans – dilution
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including 
executive and all-employee share awards, and assuming, which 
is most unlikely, that all subsisting options vest in full, is less 
than 6.03% of the shares in issue at the date of this report. All 
equity-based plans are assumed to be funded through the issue 
of new shares. However, the Company has an Employee Benefit 
T rust which currently holds 886,138 shares which may be used 
to satisfy options granted under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme and the Long T erm Incentive Plan. Awards are managed 
to confine commitments within an overall dilution limit for all 
employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any 
ten-year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten-year 
period for the Company’s discretionary share plans.

T erm of Office
Each non-executive director is engaged for initial and subsequent 
periods of three years each. These can be terminated by either 
party on six months’ notice, in the case of the Chairman, and at 
any time at the discretion of either party in the case of the other 
non-executive directors. 
Other than Peter Hickson, the non-executive directors cannot 
participate in the Company’s share option schemes, are 
not entitled to any pension benefit and are not entitled to 
any payment in compensation for early termination of their 
appointment.

2.3 Significant accounting judgements 
and estimates
estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.
impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at 
least an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value 
in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is 
allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to 
make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the 
cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 december 2011 was 
£153,697,000 (2010 £152,147,000). Additional information is 
included in note 12.
Business combinations
Upon acquisition of another entity the Group evaluates 
intangibles arising using methodologies recognised under 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Judgment is required as to 
which intangibles meet the recognition criteria of separable 
or contractual, and estimates involving cash flow forecasts 
are performed to quantify the value of these assets arising. 
Intangibles arising are assessed for indicators of impairment 
annually.
pensions
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about 
discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary 
increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to 
significant uncertainty. Additional information is included in note 14.
provisions
The measure of surplus property provisions requires estimation 
of a suitable discount rate and future costs to be incurred 
(see note 21). This requires judgment in estimating the likely 
outcomes of negotiations and time frames for settlement.
2.4 Summary of significant accounting policies
foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional 
currency at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and exchange differences arising are recognised in 
the Income Statement.

n on-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the initial transaction. non-monetary items measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries is the 
Euro. The assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries 
are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date and their Income Statements are translated 
at the weighted average exchange rates for the year where this 
is a reasonable approximation to actual translation rates. The 
exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken 
directly to a separate component of equity described as the 
‘cumulative translation adjustment’. o n disposal of a foreign 
entity, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to 
that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Income 
Statement. The cumulative translation adjustment reserve was 
set to zero on 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. land is not 
depreciated.
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold property 25 to 50 years 
l ong leasehold property 25 to 50 years 
Short leasehold property 10 to 20 years 
plant, equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 10 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to 
their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Useful 
economic lives, depreciation methods and residual values are 
reviewed annually. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income 
Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or 
sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. 
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an 
entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. The 
Group capitalises borrowing costs for all eligible assets where 
construction was commenced on or after 1 January 2009. 
goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination, including directly 
attributable transaction costs, over the acquirer’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
amortised. Any unamortised goodwill on 1 January 2004, the 
date of transition to IFRS, was frozen from that date.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying 
value may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management for the 
purpose of impairment testing.
w here goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
(or group of cash-generating units) and an operation within that 
unit (or group of units) is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal 
of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance 
is measured based on the relative values of the operations 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit 
(or group of units) retained.
intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets created within the business are not capitalised (unless 
specific conditions are met) and expenditure is charged to  
the Income Statement in the year in which the expenditure 
is incurred. 
(a) Acquired from a business combination
Intangibles arising from a business combination are capitalised 
at fair value at the date of acquisition, where it can be measured 
reliably. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to 
the class of intangible assets. The useful lives of these intangible 
assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Amortisation 
charged on assets with a finite life is recognised in amortisation 
expense in the Income Statement over the expected life of the 
asset. Intangible assets currently recognised are being amortised 
over between five and ten years. 
(b) Customer relationships
Amounts paid to secure customer contracts are capitalised and 
amortised over the length of the contract. An impairment review 
is carried out when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(c) Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on a 
development project, such as computer software, which is 
reliably measurable, is capitalised when the technical feasibility 
and commercial viability of the project is demonstrated. The 
Group must intend to and have available the resources to 
complete the project and be satisfied that the intangible asset 
arising from the development project will generate probable 
future economic benefits. Capitalisation ceases when the 
product is ready for launch. 
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, 
the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the 
period of expected future sales from the related project, from the 
date the asset is available for use.
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed when there 
is an indicator of impairment. In addition it is reviewed annually 
when the asset is not yet in use.
(d) Computer software costs
Acquired computer software and licenses are capitalised.  
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives 
(three to eight years). 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs 
are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are 
directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique 
software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate 
probable economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, 
are recognised as intangible assets. direct costs include the 
costs of software development employees. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years). 
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and 
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are stated at purchase cost on a first-in, first-out 
basis. For finished goods and work in progress, costs include 
directly attributable material and labour costs and certain 
overhead costs that contribute in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. Selling expenses and other 
administrative overhead expenses are excluded.
n et realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or 
sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. 
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an 
entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. The 
Group capitalises borrowing costs for all eligible assets where 
construction was commenced on or after 1 January 2009. 
goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination, including directly 
attributable transaction costs, over the acquirer’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
amortised. Any unamortised goodwill on 1 January 2004, the 
date of transition to IFRS, was frozen from that date.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying 
value may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management for the 
purpose of impairment testing.
w here goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
(or group of cash-generating units) and an operation within that 
unit (or group of units) is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal 
of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance 
is measured based on the relative values of the operations 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit 
(or group of units) retained.

course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the

provision is made for items of stock that are damaged, obsolete 
or slow-moving.
trade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables, which generally have 30-90 days’ 
credit terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.  
An estimate for doubtful debts is made. Bad debts are written  
off when identified.
impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is 
any indication that an asset may be impaired. where an indicator 
of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of 
recoverable amount. w here the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. Recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s, or cash-generating unit’s, fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined 
for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets 
or groups of assets, in which case impairment is determined 
at the cash-generating unit level. The carrying amounts of 
the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated and 
intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually 
or more frequently when there is an indication of impairment.
value in use is determined by the estimated future pre-tax cash 
flows, discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash 
at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
trade and other payables
T rade and other payables, which generally have 30-90 days’ 
credit terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount.
Contingent consideration
The amount of contingent consideration on business 
combinations is determined by discounting the amounts 
payable to their present value at the date of acquisition, taking 
into account any premium or discount likely to be incurred in 
settlement. Contingent consideration is determined by reference 
to the appropriate factors that influence the possible payment 
of that consideration. Contingent consideration is recognised 
where the payment is probable and the amount can be reliably 
measured. w here the future event does not occur or the amount

of consideration may be different from the original estimate, 
the cost of the business combination is adjusted to reflect the 
actual outcome and the amount finally paid. For acquisitions 
undertaken prior to 1 July 2009, any change in contingent 
consideration, other than the effect of the unwinding discount, 
will result in a change to goodwill. For acquisitions undertaken 
after 1 July 2009, this change will be recognised in the Income 
Statement.
financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
financial assets
The Group’s financial assets can all be classified as ‘loans and 
receivables’. 
loans and receivables
T rade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. l oans and receivables 
are measured at amortised cost, less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, 
except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether a 
financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets 
carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the 
loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate 
(i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced, through the use of an 
allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in other 
operating expenses.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment 
loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any 
subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the 
Income Statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the 
asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is 
made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability 
of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) 
that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of 
the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as 
irrecoverable.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset to the extent 
of its continuing involvement and an associated liability reflecting 
obligations retained. If the Group retains substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, 
the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also 
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all risks 
and rewards and does not control the transferred asset, then it 
derecognises the asset.
financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade 
and other payables, which are all classified as ‘other financial 
liabilities’. o ther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair 
value, net of transaction costs. other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method 
of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and 
of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the financial 
liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward 
currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign 
currency and interest rate risks respectively. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. derivatives are carried 
as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on 
derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting and the ineffective portion of an effective hedge, are 
taken directly to the Income Statement.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is the difference 
between the forward exchange rate and the contract rate. The 
forward exchange rate is referenced to current forward exchange 
rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the difference between the 
fixed rate and the one month l IBo R rate implied at the balance 
sheet date, calculated monthly, and discounted to present value.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as 
cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash 
flows, that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction, or when hedging the foreign currency risk in an 
unrecognised firm commitment.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which 
hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
formally designated and documented at its inception. This 
documentation identifies the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged 
and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. 
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an 
ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly 
effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which 
they were designated.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while 
any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Income 
Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, 
such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense 
is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. where the 
hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial 
liability, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer 
expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are 
transferred to the Income Statement. If the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement 
or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in other comprehensive 
income until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its 
exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and 
firm commitments. 
In the first half of 2010 the Group had two interest rate swaps in 
place that were used as hedges for the exposure to changes in

risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, 
the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer 
expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are

expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement 
or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in other comprehensive 
income until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its 
exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and 
firm commitments. 
In the first half of 2010 the Group had two interest rate swaps in 
place that were used as hedges for the exposure to changes in 
interest rates on two £5,000,000 variable loans (see note 23 for 
more details).
provisions
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made, but there is some uncertainty about 
the timing of the future expenditure required in settlement. If 
the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. w here discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
pensions and similar obligations
Group companies operate defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension plans.
payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged 
as an expense to the Income Statement as incurred when the 
related employee service is rendered. The Group has no further 
legal or constructive payment obligations once the contributions 
have been made.
For defined benefit pension plans, the cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the projected Unit method and the service 
cost relating to the benefit earned in the period is recognised in 
employee benefits expense in the Income Statement. An interest 
cost representing the unwinding of the discount rate on the 
scheme’s liabilities, net of the expected return on scheme assets, 
is charged to the Income Statement. The liability recognised in 
the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of AA rated corporate bonds that have terms 
of maturity approximating to the terms of the relevant pension 
liability.
w hen a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already 
accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result 
of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction 
in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and the related plan 
assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and 
the resultant gain or loss recognised in the Income Statement 
during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of 
plan assets are recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

share-based payment transactions
Certain directors and management are eligible to participate in 
share-based payment schemes, all of which are equity-settled.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to their fair value at the date at which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external 
valuer using an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other 
than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Communisis 
plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date 
on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(“vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
n o expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting or non-vesting is conditional 
upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that 
all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
The Group has an employee share ownership plan (“ESop”) for 
the granting of non-transferable options. Shares in the Group 
held by the ESop are accounted for in the same way as treasury 
shares and presented in the Balance Sheet as a deduction from 
equity described as the ‘ESop reserve’. 
The Group took advantage, on transition to IFRS, to apply IFRS 2 
to equity-settled awards granted after 7 november 2002 not 
vested by 31 december 2004.
w here an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if 
it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet 
recognised in the Income Statement for the award is expensed 
immediately. This includes any awards where non-vesting 
conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are 
not met. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award 
at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, 
with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the 
Income Statement.
w here an equity-settled award is forfeited, the total cost 
recognised in the Income Statement to date for the award is 
reversed. 
esop reserve
Communisis plc shares held by the Group are classified in 
shareholders’ equity as the ‘ESop reserve’ and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
n o gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a 
lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception 
date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the 
use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a 
right to use the assets.
For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date 
of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2005 in accordance with 
the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the 
risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of 
the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. l ease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease liability on a straight-line 
basis. Finance charges are recognised in the Income Statement.
l eased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
h owever, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will 
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the 
asset and the lease term.
o perating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
revenue
Revenue represents the turnover, net of discounts, derived from 
services provided to customers and sales of products applicable 
to the year.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria 
must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably; this is usually on 
despatch by the Group. 
Provision of services
The provision of print sourcing services includes the sourcing 
and supply of printed and other marketing material (included 
within SpS revenue). Revenue from such services is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
material have passed to the customer and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably; this is usually on despatch by 
the supplier.
Revenue from Creative, data & Analysis services (included within 
IdC revenue), is recognised when the service has been provided 
and customer acknowledgement of completion has been 
received.
Revenue from Campaign management services (included within 
IdC revenue), is recognised when the service has been provided 
under the terms of the contract, on a time basis which is either a 
monthly or annual charge, or on a management fee basis.
Revenue from postal Sortation services (included within IdC 
revenue) is recognised on despatch of the post to the postal 
carrier.
 Revenue from software licences is recognised over the period 
of the licence.
Pass through revenue
pass through revenue is defined as those pre-agreed or 
contracted revenues representing charges for print, postal and 
other marketing material which are passed onto clients at cost 
as part of a wider service. postal charges are recognised on 
despatch to the postal carrier, and print and other marketing 
material charges are recognised on despatch by the supplier.
Interest
Finance revenue is recognised as the interest accrues using the 
effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial instrument to the net carrying amount.
exceptional items
The Group presents separately, on the face of the Income 
Statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better the elements of financial 
performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior 
periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.
income tax
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current year are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the T axation Authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior

income tax
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current year are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the T axation Authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill, or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets 
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax 
assets and unused tax losses can be utilised. In respect of 
deductible temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sales tax except:
 • where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods 
and services is not recoverable from the T axation 
Authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised 
as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of the expense item as applicable; and
 • receivables and payables which are stated 
with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
T axation Authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the Balance Sheet.
Dividend distribution
The final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders 
is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements 
in the year in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the year in 
which they are paid.

2.5 Adoption of new and revised standards
during the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following 
standards and interpretations with an effective date after  
1 January 2011:
International Accounting Standards 
(IAS/IFRS/IFRIC)  Effective date*
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments: 
Classification and 
measurement 1 January 2015
Amendments disclosures – T ransfer of 
to IFRS 7  financial assets 1 July 2011
Amendments deferred tax: Recovery of 
to IAS 12  Underlying Assets 1 January 2012
IFRS 10  Consolidated Financial 
Statements 1 January 2013
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013
IFRS 12  d isclosure of Interests in 
o ther Entities 1 January 2013
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013
IAS 27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2013
IAS 28 (Revised)  Investments in Associates and 
Joint ventures 1 January 2013
Amendment presentation of Items of o ther 
to IAS 1  Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012
IAS 19 (revised) Employee benefits 1 January 2013
* The effective dates stated here are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC 
standards and interpretations, As the Group has elected to prepare their 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject 
to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement 
mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date 
consistent with that given in the original standard and interpretation 
but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion to adopt 
standards early.
The Group has not early adopted these amended standards and 
interpretations.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these 
standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the 
Group’s Financial Statements, other than additional disclosures, 
in the period of initial application.
3 segmentAl informAtion
Business segments
management has determined the operating segments based 
on the reports reviewed by the Board that are used to make 
strategic decisions.
The Group’s activities are focused in two main areas which are:
 • Intelligence driven Communications (“IdC”) which aims to 
help businesses increase the revenue that they generate 
from their customer base, utilising data to deliver more 
targeted and relevant marketing programmes across a 
range of different channels. Four key services are offered 
under the IdC banner – data & Analysis, Campaign 
management, Creative and postal Sortation.
 • Specialist production and Sourcing (“SpS”) which aims 
to help businesses improve the efficiency and quality of 
their supply chains at reduced cost. Four key services 
are offered under the SpS banner – print Sourcing, 
direct mail, T ransactional Services and Cheques.
Certain revenues are classed as pass through revenues, which 
are pre-agreed or contracted revenues that include an element 
regarding print, postal and other marketing material which are 
passed onto clients at cost as part of a wider service. where 
it is agreed that these revenues will be recharged at cost, 
management classifies these items as pass through for internal 
reporting purposes.
The Communisis Board considers the performance of IdC 
and SpS in assessing the performance of the Group and 
making decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental 
disclosures have therefore been presented on this basis.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit 
or loss and is measured consistently with operating profit 
or loss in the Consolidated Financial Statements. however, 
Group financing (including finance costs and finance income) 
and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not 
allocated to operating segments.
A software asset with a net book value of £1,831,000 (2010 
£2,063,000) has been allocated to segment assets as follows: 
IdC £546,000, SpS £1,185,000 and Corporate Costs £100,000. 
The amortisation charge on the asset for 2011 has been 
allocated to segments as follows: IdC £30,000 (2010 £30,000) 
and SpS £202,000 (2010 £202,000). parts of this asset are still in 
development and so are not being depreciated (see note 11).
T ransfer pricing between business segments is set on an 
arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third 
parties. Segment revenue, segment expense and segment 
profits include sales between business segments. Those sales 
are eliminated on consolidation and are not included in the 
segmental revenue figures.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical 
information are based on the customers’ geographical location.

Acquisition and set up costs totalling £236,000 relate to the acquisition of the trade and assets of o rchestra Bristol l imited (see note 7) 
and were fully paid during the year. A further £1,452,000 incurred in relation to the closure of the Bristol site is included in the £3,697,000 
exceptional restructuring costs.
during the year the Group incurred costs of £3,697,000 in respect of the orchestra Bristol l imited acquisition and the second phase 
of our restructuring and organisational change project which included further site consolidation and head count reduction across the 
Group. o f this amount, £1,266,000 is included in provisions and £1,724,000 is included in accruals at 31 december 2011.
l egal and consultancy costs of £400,000 relate to a pension deficit reduction project undertaken during 2011. n one of this had been 
paid at 31 december 2011.
last year the Group incurred costs of £2,894,000 in respect of restructuring, of which £1,094,000 related to the closure of the l eicester 
facility and the remainder related to further optimisation of the overall cost base of the Group to create the right organisational structure 
to move the Group forward. Since the project related to transforming the business for the future, these costs were not directly related to 
current operations and therefore disclosed as exceptional.
The £2,585,000 settlement gain relates to an Enhanced T ransfer value exercise completed in 2010 for deferred members of the defined 
benefit pension scheme. The amount is the net of the £5,526,000 settlement gain partially offset by £2,941,000 enhancements and 
associated fees.

Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has unrecognised losses, which arose outside of the UK, of £820,000 (2010 £3,079,000) that are available for offset against 
future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. no deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of any of 
these losses as their future utilisation is uncertain and they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.

It was announced in the budget on 23 march 2011 that the rate of corporation tax will reduce to 26% from 1 April 2011 with a further 
reduction to 25% from 1 April 2012; there would be a further one percentage point reduction in each of the subsequent two tax years 
culminating in a rate of 23% to be effective from 1 April 2014. The legislation dealing with the reduction in rate to 25% was included in 
the Finance Act 2011 with further rate reductions to be confirmed in future Finance Acts. The provision for deferred tax at 31 december 
2011 has been made at 25%. If the further rate changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date the deferred tax 
asset would have reduced by approximately £125,000.

future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. no deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of any of 
these losses as their future utilisation is uncertain and they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.

       2011 2010 
       £000 £000

       2011 2010 
       £000 £000

It was announced in the budget on 23 march 2011 that the rate of corporation tax will reduce to 26% from 1 April 2011 with a further 
reduction to 25% from 1 April 2012; there would be a further one percentage point reduction in each of the subsequent two tax years 
culminating in a rate of 23% to be effective from 1 April 2014. The legislation dealing with the reduction in rate to 25% was included in 
the Finance Act 2011 with further rate reductions to be confirmed in future Finance Acts. The provision for deferred tax at 31 december 
2011 has been made at 25%. If the further rate changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date the deferred tax 
asset would have reduced by approximately £125,000.

As from 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is now subject to annual impairment testing 
(n ote 12). The cumulative impairment loss is £30.2m (2010 £30.2m).
o n 22 december 2008 the Group acquired the whole issued share capital of Communisis data Intelligence l imited (formerly Absolute 
Intuistic l imited). The maximum amount of contingent consideration of £8m was payable against growth targets achieved during 
the period to 31 August 2010. The relevant targets were partially met and at 31 december 2010 negotiations with the vendors were 
ongoing with the expectation that the additional consideration payable would be £5.4m. At 31 december 2010 a further £1.5m of 
deferred consideration had been accrued with an equal increase in the amount attributed to Goodwill. during 2011 the final payment 
was made with a £134,000 increase to the anticipated consideration.
Software assets are amortised evenly over their useful economic lives of between three and eight years and have between nil and five 
years left to be amortised. Included in software assets is £1,558,950 (2010 £1,749,769) currently in development. Amortisation will 
commence in 2012. Software assets currently in development have been assessed for impairment, and management are satisfied that 
their value is fully recoverable through their value in use.
l icences include amounts spent during the year for the development of software which Communisis will have the exclusive right to sell 
within the UK once complete. At 31 december 2011, the asset was still in development. Amortisation will commence on completion of 
the asset.

As from 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is now subject to annual impairment testing 
(n ote 12). The cumulative impairment loss is £30.2m (2010 £30.2m).
o n 22 december 2008 the Group acquired the whole issued share capital of Communisis data Intelligence l imited (formerly Absolute 
Intuistic l imited). The maximum amount of contingent consideration of £8m was payable against growth targets achieved during 
the period to 31 August 2010. The relevant targets were partially met and at 31 december 2010 negotiations with the vendors were 
ongoing with the expectation that the additional consideration payable would be £5.4m. At 31 december 2010 a further £1.5m of 
deferred consideration had been accrued with an equal increase in the amount attributed to Goodwill. during 2011 the final payment 
was made with a £134,000 increase to the anticipated consideration.
Software assets are amortised evenly over their useful economic lives of between three and eight years and have between nil and five 
years left to be amortised. Included in software assets is £1,558,950 (2010 £1,749,769) currently in development. Amortisation will 
commence in 2012. Software assets currently in development have been assessed for impairment, and management are satisfied that 
their value is fully recoverable through their value in use.
l icences include amounts spent during the year for the development of software which Communisis will have the exclusive right to sell 
within the UK once complete. At 31 december 2011, the asset was still in development. Amortisation will commence on completion of 
the asset.

Discount rates
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the IdC cash flow projections is 10.0% (2010 11.0%) and to the SpS cash flow projections is 11.5% 
(2010 11.0%). This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to a pre-tax rate and adjusted to reflect management’s view 
of the market assessment of specific risks associated with each separate CGU.

Further details on the CGUs are detailed below.
Goodwill was allocated to each individual CGU using a relative value approach during the resegmentation exercise which was completed 
in 2010. The growth rates used in years two to five are below the growth rates expected by management for the business.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could erode the headroom by which the carrying value of the CGUs 
exceed their recoverable amount. The sensitivity to each of these reasonably possible changes is detailed below.
All other items remaining equal the following changes to key assumptions would remove headroom as follows:
In IdC short-term revenue growth rates in years two to five would need to reduce from between 6% and 9% to between 4% and 5% to 
remove all headroom on the IdC impairment test.
The SpS forecast used in the impairment model has short-term revenue growth at -6% in year two followed by relatively flat growth 
rates through to year five. If instead these growth rates were to fall by between -3% and -4% every year then all headroom would be 
removed on the SpS impairment test.
The discount rate would need to increase by 1% to 11% to remove all headroom within the IdC impairment test and by 1.1% to 12.6%  
to remove all headroom within the SpS impairment test.
o n average, long-term profit growth rates would need to be reduced to 2% and 1.4% to remove all headroom on the I dC and SpS 
impairment tests respectively.
Impairment
In 2011 no impairment charge has been made against goodwill for either of the CGUs (2010 £nil). The headroom in the I dC segment is 
£17m (2010 £23m) and the SpS segment is £12m (2010 £21m).
12 impAirment of gooDwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated for impairment testing purposes to two cash-generating units (“CGUs”), 
which are reportable segments, as follows:
 • Intelligence driven Communications (“IdC”) and
 • Specialist production and Sourcing (“SpS”)
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to CGUs is as follows:
       2011 2010 
       £000 £000
IdC       79,312 79,178
SpS       74,385 72,969
       153,697 152,147
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill using value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
included in the value in use calculation are revenue growth, product and services mix / profit margins, the long-term growth rates and the 
discount rate applied.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for these CGUs based on the most recent annual budgets approved by the Board. These are 
based upon detailed budgets for the coming year and internal forecasts of future growth over a five-year period (2010 three-year period) 
and cash flows beyond the five-year period (2010 three-year period) are extrapolated using external forecasts of expected growth rates. 
Further information on the assumptions used within the major CGUs is detailed below.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The calculation of value in use for all CGUs is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
 • revenue growth rates
 • product and services mix / profit margins; and
 • growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period
In addition the calculation of value in use is sensitive to movements in the discount rate.
Revenue growth included in the approved financial budgets
The revenue growth forecast in the risk-adjusted IdC cash flow projections based on financial budgets is 9% in 2012 and between 6% 
and 9% in years two to five.
The revenue growth forecast in the risk-adjusted SpS cash flow projections based on financial budgets is 1% in 2012 and between -6% 
and 1% in years two to five.
Product and services mix / profit margins
IdC is expected to have an increased share of Group revenues relative to SpS over the five-year forecast period. higher margins are 
generated in IdC as this CGU benefits from a relatively fixed overhead base which does not flex up as revenues increase. 
The Group profit margin is projected to increase from 5.5% in 2011 (excluding pass through revenue) to 10.4% by the end of the detailed 
forecast period. 
Profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period
The profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period for all CGUs is considered to be a 
representative rate for the markets to which these segments are dedicated and in line with long-term economic growth forecasts. 
profit growth rates have been assessed individually for each CGU. IdC profit growth rates of 2.9% (2010 3.5%), and SpS profit growth 
rates of 2.4% (2010 2.6%) have been used.

The Communisis l ong T erm Incentive plan 2007
Certain directors and managers are eligible to participate in this plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise 
price in respect of options granted under the scheme is £nil. For all options granted up to 31 december 2009, up to 50% of the options 
may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the Support Services sector of the FTSE 
All Share Index (excluding FTSE 100 companies), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. The other 50% of the options 
may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding 
investment trusts), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. 30% of each tranche of options will vest for performance at 
the median of the comparator group rising, on a straight-line basis, to 100% vesting for performance in the top decile of the comparator 
group. If the performance conditions are not fulfilled within the three-year period from the date of grant, the options lapse. The 
contractual life of each option granted is five years. There are no cash settlement alternatives.
For options granted under this scheme in 2010, the options will vest if the share price of the Company attains certain thresholds 
measured by reference to a rolling three-month average at any time within three years of the date of award. If the share price increases 
to 30p 10% of the options vest, at 50p 30% vest, at a share price of 70p 60% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if the share 
price exceeds 90p. 
For the options granted under this scheme in 2011, no options will vest unless the three-month rolling average share price increases to 
more than 32.742p. At 50p 19.78% of the awards will vest, at a share price of 70p 52.78% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if 
the share price exceeds 90p.
For the options granted in both 2011 and in 2010 vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis between the thresholds outlined 
above. n o vested shares will be released before the third anniversary of the award date and no vested shares will be released for at least 
two years after the attainment of the threshold. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee will only sanction vesting of these awards if 
they are satisfied as to the Company’s underlying financial performance in the performance period.
The fair value of options granted under the l ong T erm Incentive plan 2007 in the year to 31 december 2011 has been estimated on 
the date of grant using a binomial simulation option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life of five years; share price at the 
date of grant of £0.30 (2010 £0.165); estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5% (2010 5.2%); risk-free interest rate of 
approximately 2.53% (2010 2.83%) and expected volatility of 48% (2010 48%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 under this plan was £0.13523 (2010 
£0.0461).
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns which may occur.  
The expected volatility reflects historical volatility adjusted for future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.  
Both the historical and expected volatilities reflect the volatility of the share prices of Communisis plc and comparator companies.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2010
This scheme was introduced in 2010 to replace the Executive Share option Scheme 2000. Certain directors and managers are eligible 
to participate in this scheme at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of the options granted under this 
scheme is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. 
n o options were granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2011 nor in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2000
This scheme has now been superseded by the Executive Share option Scheme 2010. Under this scheme, certain directors and 
managers were eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of options granted under this 
scheme were equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. In respect of options granted prior to 1 January 2005, which 
have not yet lapsed, the options vest if the percentage increase in normalised earnings (i.e. before intangibles amortisation, restructuring 
costs and other exceptional items) per share over any three consecutive financial years exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail 
prices Index over that period by an average of at least 3% per annum. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There are 
no cash settlement alternatives. In respect of options granted since 1 January 2005 if the performance condition is not met within three 
years from the date of grant, the options lapse. There are no outstanding options which were issued after 1 January 2005.

o ptions awarded to the Chairman
o n 19 december 2007, shortly after his appointment, peter hickson was awarded 250,000 nil cost share options in the Company, and 
on 20 december 2007 he entered a contract with RBC T rust Company (Jersey) l imited (“RBC”) for these options, on exercise, to be 
satisfied by the transfer of ordinary shares already held by the Company’s Employee Benefit T rust, of which RBC is the T rustee.  
The grant of those options was conditional upon the purchase by him of 250,000 ordinary shares in the Company, this purchase was 
executed on 18 december 2007. o n 20 december 2010 the options which had been awarded to the Chairman vested. These have not 
yet been exercised. Exercise may take place at any time up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. n o further options have been 
awarded to the Chairman in any subsequent year.
The Sharesave Scheme
All UK employees (including directors) are eligible to participate in the Communisis Sharesave Scheme. The exercise price of the options 
is usually equal to the market price of the shares at the date of invitation to participate less a maximum discount of 20%. The options 
vest on either the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the savings period. Any options which have not been exercised 
within six months of the vesting date lapse.
The weighted average fair value of sharesave options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 was estimated at the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: option holders 
will exercise their option at expiry; share price at the date of grant of £0.31; estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5%; 
risk-free interest rate of 2.52% and expected volatility of 48%. The volatility has been determined by reference to Communisis plc’s 
and comparator companies’ historical volatility over a three-year period, adjusted for expected future trends, to reflect the share price 
of Communisis plc in the future. The exercise price is £0.26 for options exercisable three years after the date of grant. no options 
exercisable five years after the date of grant were granted in 2011. The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the 
year ended 31 december 2011 was £0.095. There were no options granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (“w AEp”) of, and movements in, share options during 
the year.

The Communisis l ong T erm Incentive plan 2007
Certain directors and managers are eligible to participate in this plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise 
price in respect of options granted under the scheme is £nil. For all options granted up to 31 december 2009, up to 50% of the options 
may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the Support Services sector of the FTSE 
All Share Index (excluding FTSE 100 companies), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. The other 50% of the options 
may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding 
investment trusts), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. 30% of each tranche of options will vest for performance at 
the median of the comparator group rising, on a straight-line basis, to 100% vesting for performance in the top decile of the comparator 
group. If the performance conditions are not fulfilled within the three-year period from the date of grant, the options lapse. The 
contractual life of each option granted is five years. There are no cash settlement alternatives.
For options granted under this scheme in 2010, the options will vest if the share price of the Company attains certain thresholds 
measured by reference to a rolling three-month average at any time within three years of the date of award. If the share price increases 
to 30p 10% of the options vest, at 50p 30% vest, at a share price of 70p 60% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if the share 
price exceeds 90p. 
For the options granted under this scheme in 2011, no options will vest unless the three-month rolling average share price increases to 
more than 32.742p. At 50p 19.78% of the awards will vest, at a share price of 70p 52.78% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if 
the share price exceeds 90p.
For the options granted in both 2011 and in 2010 vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis between the thresholds outlined 
above. no vested shares will be released before the third anniversary of the award date and no vested shares will be released for at least 
two years after the attainment of the threshold. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee will only sanction vesting of these awards if 
they are satisfied as to the Company’s underlying financial performance in the performance period.
The fair value of options granted under the l ong T erm Incentive plan 2007 in the year to 31 december 2011 has been estimated on 
the date of grant using a binomial simulation option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life of five years; share price at the 
date of grant of £0.30 (2010 £0.165); estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5% (2010 5.2%); risk-free interest rate of 
approximately 2.53% (2010 2.83%) and expected volatility of 48% (2010 48%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 under this plan was £0.13523 (2010 
£0.0461).
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns which may occur.  
The expected volatility reflects historical volatility adjusted for future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.  
Both the historical and expected volatilities reflect the volatility of the share prices of Communisis plc and comparator companies.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2010
This scheme was introduced in 2010 to replace the Executive Share option Scheme 2000. Certain directors and managers are eligible 
to participate in this scheme at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of the options granted under this 
scheme is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. 
n o options were granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2011 nor in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2000
This scheme has now been superseded by the Executive Share option Scheme 2010. Under this scheme, certain directors and 
managers were eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of options granted under this 
scheme were equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. In respect of options granted prior to 1 January 2005, which 
have not yet lapsed, the options vest if the percentage increase in normalised earnings (i.e. before intangibles amortisation, restructuring 
costs and other exceptional items) per share over any three consecutive financial years exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail 
prices Index over that period by an average of at least 3% per annum. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There are 
no cash settlement alternatives. In respect of options granted since 1 January 2005 if the performance condition is not met within three 
years from the date of grant, the options lapse. There are no outstanding options which were issued after 1 January 2005.

o ptions awarded to the Chairman
o n 19 december 2007, shortly after his appointment, peter hickson was awarded 250,000 nil cost share options in the Company, and 
on 20 december 2007 he entered a contract with RBC T rust Company (Jersey) l imited (“RBC”) for these options, on exercise, to be 
satisfied by the transfer of ordinary shares already held by the Company’s Employee Benefit T rust, of which RBC is the T rustee.  
The grant of those options was conditional upon the purchase by him of 250,000 ordinary shares in the Company, this purchase was 
executed on 18 december 2007. o n 20 december 2010 the options which had been awarded to the Chairman vested. These have not 
yet been exercised. Exercise may take place at any time up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. n o further options have been 
awarded to the Chairman in any subsequent year.
The Sharesave Scheme
All UK employees (including directors) are eligible to participate in the Communisis Sharesave Scheme. The exercise price of the options 
is usually equal to the market price of the shares at the date of invitation to participate less a maximum discount of 20%. The options 
vest on either the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the savings period. Any options which have not been exercised 
within six months of the vesting date lapse.
The weighted average fair value of sharesave options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 was estimated at the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: option holders 
will exercise their option at expiry; share price at the date of grant of £0.31; estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5%; 
risk-free interest rate of 2.52% and expected volatility of 48%. The volatility has been determined by reference to Communisis plc’s 
and comparator companies’ historical volatility over a three-year period, adjusted for expected future trends, to reflect the share price 
of Communisis plc in the future. The exercise price is £0.26 for options exercisable three years after the date of grant. no options 
exercisable five years after the date of grant were granted in 2011. The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the 
year ended 31 december 2011 was £0.095. There were no options granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (“w AEp”) of, and movements in, share options during 
the year.

options were granted on or before 7 november 2002. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted 
for in accordance with IFRS 2.
2   The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised in the year ended 31 december 2011 was £0.27726 (2010 £nil).
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 december 2011 is 2.65 years 
(2010 3.388 years).
The weighted average fair value of all options granted during the year was £0.1066 (2010 £0.0461).
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £nil – £1.6267 (2010 £nil – £1.6267). The number of 
share options for which the exercise price is £nil total 4,422,500 (2010 5,565,000).

14 retirement Benefit plAns
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a UK defined contribution arrangement within three UK Group Companies, Communisis plc, Communisis UK 
l imited and Communisis data Intelligence l imited (formerly Absolute Intuistic l imited). The assets of the arrangements are held 
separately from those of the Group.
Group companies are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the 
benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £1,483,761 (2010 £1,505,507) represents contributions payable to these arrangements by the 
Group at specified rates. As at 31 december 2011 all contributions due in respect of the current reporting period had been paid over to 
the arrangements (2010 all paid over).
The Group expects to contribute £1.5 million to the defined contribution pension arrangements in 2012.
defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members on 6 April 2005 (with the exception of ex- h SBC members). Following the 
statutory consultation period, the defined benefit pension plan closed to future service accruals from 30 n ovember 2007. The scheme 
was closed for all members with the exception of the ex-hSBC members. 
The defined benefit sections are as follows:
final salary
The final salary section provides a pension of one sixtieth or one eightieth (depending on the level of employee contribution) of final 
salary at normal retirement age for each year of pensionable service. This is subject to the benefit not exceeding one thirtieth of the 
scheme specific earnings cap for each year of pensionable service, which applies to members who joined the plan on or after 1 June 
1989. n ormal retirement age is 65 (60 for ex-hSBC members).
Career average revalued earnings
The career average revalued earnings section provides an accrual each year of a unit of one forty-fifth, one sixtieth or one eightieth 
(depending on the level of employee contribution) of pensionable salary for that year. The unit is then revalued in each subsequent year 
by the rate of growth in the Retail prices Index until normal retirement age. The normal retirement age under this section is 65 except for 
certain executives whose normal retirement age is set at 62, where the accrual rate is one forty-fifth.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 
year are analysed as follows:

14 retirement Benefit plAns (continued)
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income is a gain of £1,190,000 (2010 gain of £10,058,000). The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme 
deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of £38,240,000 is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since 
inception of the Group’s pension scheme. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses 
that would have been recognised in the Group Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income before 1 January 2004 .
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit income recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the 
funded status and amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the defined benefit pension plan.

In February 2012 the Group and the T rustees agreed to an arrangement involving the securitisation of a rental stream on one of the 
Group’s freehold properties. See note 30 for full details.

n one of the above represents equities or bonds issued by the Group, nor properties owned by the Group.
Assumptions
The valuation has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the scheme as at 30 September 2008 (the date of the last 
completed triennial valuation at the balance sheet date) updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements 
of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 december 2011.
T o develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the year ended 31 december 2011, the Group considered 
the current level of expected return on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium 
associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.  
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the asset allocation, to develop the assumed expected  
long-term rate of return on assets of 5.86% for the portfolio for the year ended 31 december 2011 (2010 6.98%).

The Group expects to contribute £1.95 million to the defined benefit pension scheme in 2012 (2011 £4.0 million).
In February 2012 the Group and the T rustees agreed to an arrangement involving the securitisation of a rental stream on one of the 
Group’s freehold properties. See note 30 for full details.

Assumptions
The valuation has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the scheme as at 30 September 2008 (the date of the last 
completed triennial valuation at the balance sheet date) updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements 
of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 december 2011.
T o develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the year ended 31 december 2011, the Group considered 
the current level of expected return on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium 
associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.  
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the asset allocation, to develop the assumed expected  
long-term rate of return on assets of 5.86% for the portfolio for the year ended 31 december 2011 (2010 6.98%).

prepayments, accrued income and other receivables includes £450,000 (2010 £450,000) of deferred consideration due to the Group 
on the disposal of the Bath business.
T rade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally on 30-90 days’ credit terms. The carrying value of trade receivables is 
considered a reasonable approximation of fair value. All of the Group’s trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indicators of 
impairment. Certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and a provision of £344,000 (2010 £360,000) is carried at the year end.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. The top 
10 customers make up 71% of the receivables balance (2010 65%). Generally, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts is not significant. The concentration of credit risk is limited to the carrying value of trade debtors. Accordingly the 
directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
In addition, some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. The age of financial assets past due but not 
impaired is as follows:

Bank overdrafts
The bank overdrafts are principally denominated in sterling and bear interest at rates set by reference to the UK Base Rate. The overdrafts 
are secured by cross guarantee arrangements with the relevant banks. At 31 december 2011 and 31 december 2010 bank overdraft 
facilities of £5,000,000 were available but not utilised.

£40,000,000 Bank l oan
This loan is secured by a cross guarantee arrangement and is repayable on 24 August 2014. Interest is charged at l IBo R plus a rate of 
between 2.50% and 3.50% depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITdA in the preceding performance period.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing, which, if breached, would result in its loans becoming 
immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of EBIT dA, interest payable as a 
multiple of EBITA and cash flow as a multiple of debt service costs. At the year end the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants.
At 31 december 2011, the Group had available £4,000,000 (2010 £31,000,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of 
which all conditions precedent had been met.
w ith the exception of hire purchase agreements, early repayment is possible under the terms of all the borrowing facilities listed above, 
at no cost, by giving more than five days notice.

Bank overdrafts
The bank overdrafts are principally denominated in sterling and bear interest at rates set by reference to the UK Base Rate. The overdrafts 
are secured by cross guarantee arrangements with the relevant banks. At 31 december 2011 and 31 december 2010 bank overdraft 
facilities of £5,000,000 were available but not utilised.

This loan is secured by a cross guarantee arrangement and is repayable on 24 August 2014. Interest is charged at l IBo R plus a rate of 
between 2.50% and 3.50% depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITdA in the preceding performance period.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing, which, if breached, would result in its loans becoming 
immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of EBIT dA, interest payable as a 
multiple of EBITA and cash flow as a multiple of debt service costs. At the year end the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants.
At 31 december 2011, the Group had available £4,000,000 (2010 £31,000,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of 
which all conditions precedent had been met.
w ith the exception of hire purchase agreements, early repayment is possible under the terms of all the borrowing facilities listed above, 
at no cost, by giving more than five days notice.

Forward currency contract – cash flow hedge
At 31 december 2010, the Group held a forward exchange contract designated to hedge expected future sales to customers in the 
United States for which the Group had highly probable forecasted transactions. This matured in August 2011. The fair value of this 
forward currency contract at 31 december 2011 was £nil (2010 £26,000) and the amount removed from other comprehensive income 
was £nil (2010 19,000).  
The forward exchange contract was being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the firm commitments.
Interest rate swaps
At 31 december 2011, the Group had two interest rate swap agreements in place with a notional amount of £5,000,000 each whereby 
the Group pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.48% and 5.68% respectively, and receives a variable rate equal to l IBo R+1.50% and 
l IBo R+2.75% respectively on the notional amounts. 
during the first half of 2010 the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the 
interest rates on the three-year variable loans. w ith the refinancing of the Group’s committed debt facilities these swaps are no longer 
designated as cash flow hedges as the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, therefore amounts totalling £401,000 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income were recycled through the Income Statement in 2010.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group used the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique;
l evel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
l evel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable either directly  
or indirectly
l evel 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable  
market data.
As at 31 december 2011, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:
     2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 
     £000 £000 £000 £000
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Interest rate swaps    108 – 108 –
during the year there were no transfers between l evel 1 and l evel 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into or out of l evel 3 fair 
value measurements.

Business restructuring
The provision for business restructuring represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s expected costs of property dilapidation 
repairs. It is expected that the costs will be incurred within 1 year of the balance sheet date.
o nerous leases
The exceptional property provisions relate primarily to the estimated costs for the rental obligations, dilapidations and other costs of surplus 
premises which are long-term in nature. The provision reflects the estimated discounted net cost to the Group over the remainder of the 
lease period. It is expected that the costs will be incurred within 4 years of the balance sheet date.
l itigation provisions
This provision represents management’s best estimate of the outcome of ongoing negotiations relating to environmental issues for which 
the Group has an obligation for clean-up costs. It is thought that all costs will be incurred within 1 to 2 years of the balance sheet date.

26 finAnCiAl risk mAnAgement oBjeCtives AnD poliCies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts (note 27), cash and short-term deposits (note 18) and 
forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps (note 23). The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the 
Group’s operations and to manage exchange rate and interest rate risk. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such 
as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and 
credit risk.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s medium-term debt obligations with a 
floating interest rate.
All borrowings are held on floating rate terms and so the Group is exposed to interest rate movements on these borrowings. The 
Group’s policy is to monitor interest rate exposure on this floating rate debt and maintain interest rate swaps through separate financial 
instruments where appropriate. during 2011 the Group had two interest rate swap arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of 
floating interest rates on 44.1% of the year end net debt (2010 63.3%). These arrangements mature in 2012.
At 31 december 2011, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher for the full financial year, with all other variables held constant, 
this would have resulted in a reduction of pre-tax profits of £360,000 and a post-tax reduction in equity of £265,000; if interest rates had 
been lower by 25 basis points throughout the financial year the pre-tax profits would have been £90,000 higher and the post-tax impact 
on equity would have been an increase of £66,000. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates principally in the UK with approximately 2.2% (2010 2.0%) of sales arising from companies operating with functional 
currencies other than sterling. The value of currency exposure is not significant to the Group. where there are known material future 
currency inflows consideration will be given to hedging these receipts. Forward currency contracts over US $1.6m were entered into 
by the Group in 2008; the remainder of these matured in 2011 (note 23). no forward currency contracts were entered into in the year 
ended 31 december 2011.
l iquidity risk
The Group regularly monitors its risk to a shortage of funds taking account of the maturity profile of its financial assets and liabilities and 
the projected cash flows from operations.

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through a mix of medium-term funding of 
committed floating rate facilities supplemented by uncommitted bank overdraft facilities. At 31 december 2011 none of the Group’s 
medium-term debt matures in less than twelve months (2010 40%) nor between one and two years from the balance sheet date (2010 
60%). 100% of the medium-term debt matures between two and five years from the balance sheet date.
The directors consider this funding structure to be adequate for the Group’s current requirements.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 december 2011 is shown in note 27.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Generally, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to 
credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure 
to bad debts is not significant. provision is made against any doubtful debts. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed 
in n ote 16. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these instruments. As at the balance sheet date there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, is managed by Group 
T reasury in accordance with Group policy. Investments of surplus funds are only made with established banks approved by the Board. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of 
these instruments.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in 
order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being bank debt divided by equity plus bank debt. The policy is to maintain the gearing 
ratio below 50%. w ithin bank debt the Group includes all interest-bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

29 Contingent liABilities
Communisis plc has provided rental guarantees to landlords in respect of certain leasehold properties occupied by subsidiaries that 
have subsequently been sold. T o the extent that they have not already been called, these guarantees represent contingent liabilities of 
the Group. o ther than those leases for which the liability is considered to be remote, the Group has guaranteed rentals on leases with 
remaining terms that vary from one month to seven years and with annual rentals that range from £9,000 to £329,000. n o provision 
for these guarantees has been made in the Financial Statements because, at the balance sheet date, the directors believe that it is not 
probable that any further guarantees will be called.

pension deficit reduction project
In February 2012 the Group and the T rustees agreed to an arrangement involving the securitisation of a rental stream on one of the 
Group’s freehold properties. Under the arrangement the pension Scheme will be entitled to annual rent of £1.15m for 15 years. The 
present value of the rental stream of £9.8m will be treated as an additional pension contribution and an asset that reduces the deficit by 
the same amount. 
As part of the arrangement the T rustees have agreed that the £9.8m constitutes a prepayment of contributions for the three years from 
2012 to 2014 inclusive. Consequently the annual payments to the pension Scheme will be limited to the annual rental on the property of 
£1.15m between 2012 and 2014 and then increase to £4.15m from 2015 onwards.
Facilities extension
The Bank facilities which are provided under a syndicated arrangement with Barclays, l loyds Banking Group and hSBC were agreed to 
be extended by £5m to £45m in February 2012, and committed until August 2014.

applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. o ur audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on pages 43 to 44, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial 
Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify any material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become of aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1 ACCounting poliCies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The Company Financial Statements are prepared in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards 
and under the historical cost convention and are made up to 31 
december each year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided 
by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its 
individual profit and l oss Account and related notes.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption in 
paragraph 2d of FRS 29 and have excluded disclosures relating 
to financial instruments from these Financial Statements 
as disclosures are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group.
The Company has net current liabilities of £3,285,000 (2010 
£20,489,000) as at 31 december 2011. The Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its liquidity risk, 
as well as potential exposure to cash flow interest rate risk, are 
described in note 26 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Through the Group, the Company has considerable financial 
resources and, as a consequence, the directors believe that 
the Company is well-placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the continuing uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Financial Statements.
1.2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies

1.2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies
t angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets in the Financial Statements of the 
Company are stated at cost, less aggregate depreciation and 
any provision for impairment.
Depreciation
The charge is calculated at rates appropriate to write off the 
cost less residual value of individual assets from the time they 
become operational by equal annual instalments over their 
estimated useful economic lives which are principally as follows:
Freehold property 25 to 50 years
plant, equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 10 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for 
impairment.
impairment
In accordance with FRS 11 ‘Impairment of fixed assets and 
goodwill’, fixed assets are subject to an impairment review if 
circumstances or events change to indicate that the carrying 
value may not be fully recoverable. The review is performed by 
comparing the carrying value of the fixed asset to its recoverable 
amount, being the higher of the net realisable value and value in 
use. The net realisable value is considered to be the amount that 
could be obtained on disposal of the asset. The value in use of 
the asset is determined by discounting, at a market-based pre-tax 
discount rate, the expected future cash flows resulting from its 
continued use, including those arising from its ultimate disposal.
w hen the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by any 
impairment amount, the loss is recognised in the profit and l oss 
Account in the period in which it occurred. Should circumstances 
or events change and give rise to a reversal of a previous 
impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and l oss 
Account in the period in which it occurs and the carrying value of 
the asset is increased. The increase in the carrying value of the 
asset will only be up to the amount that it would have been had 
the original impairment not occurred.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, income 
generating units are considered to be groups of assets and 
liabilities that generate income, and are largely independent 
of other income streams. They also include those assets and 
liabilities directly involved in producing the income and a suitable 
proportion of those central assets used to produce more than 
one income stream.
t axation
Current tax, being UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
deferred tax is recognised as a liability or asset in respect of all 
timing differences that have originated but not reversed if the 
transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more 
tax in future, or a right to pay less tax in future, have occurred by 
the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions:
 • provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation 
(and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and 
gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled 
over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at 
the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to 
dispose of the assets concerned. however, no provision 
is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at 
the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the 
taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and 
charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold; 
 • provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on 
remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the 
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as 
receivable.

COM-P113-R+A11-2.indd   101 15/03/2012   12:47 Communisis plc – Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the 
directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will 
be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax 
rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also 
recognised in equity.
foreign currencies
The Company’s functional currency and presentation currency is 
pounds sterling. T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded 
at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. m onetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. All differences are taken to the profit and l oss Account. 
n on-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. non-monetary 
items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was 
determined.
pension costs
The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension plans.
payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged 
as an expense to the profit and l oss Account as incurred when 
the related employee service is rendered. The Company has 
no further legal or constructive payment obligations once the 
contributions have been made.
The defined benefit pension plan is a Group scheme. The 
Company’s share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme has 
been allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.
An interest cost representing the unwinding of the discount rate 
on the scheme’s liabilities, net of the expected return on scheme 
assets, is charged to the profit and l oss Account. The liability 
recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of the plan is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance 
sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets net of deferred 
tax. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates of AA rated corporate bonds 
that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the 
relevant pension liability.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets are recognised immediately in the Statement of T otal 
Recognised Gains and l osses.
leases
o perating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
profit and l oss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
employee share ownership plan
The Company maintains an Employee Share ownership plan 
(‘ESop’). All assets and liabilities of the ESop are accounted for 
in accordance with UITF 38 ‘ Accounting for ESop T rusts’. The 
investment in Communisis plc shares held by the ESop trust 
is classified at original cost as a deduction from shareholders’ 
funds.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the profit 
and l oss Account over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
provisions
provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made, but there is some uncertainty about 
the timing of the future expenditure required in settlement. If 
the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. w here discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
share-based payment transactions
Certain directors and management are eligible to participate in 
share-based payment schemes all of which are equity-settled, 
in return for services provided to Communisis plc.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external 
valuer using an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other 
than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Communisis 
plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the performance or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award (“vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised 
for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the 
Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
n o expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance or service 
conditions are satisfied.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions 
of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied 
FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 november 
2002 that had not vested on or before 31 december 2004.
w here an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not 
yet recognised in the profit and l oss Account for the award is 
expensed immediately. This includes any award where non-
vesting conditions within the control of the Company or the 
employee are not met. Any compensation paid up to the fair 
value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is 
deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being 
treated as an expense in the profit and l oss Account.
w here an equity-settled award is forfeited, the total cost 
recognised in the profit and l oss Account to date for the award 
is reversed.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge 
its foreign currency and interest rate risks respectively. Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. derivatives are 
carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on 
derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting and the ineffective portion of an effective hedge, are 
taken directly to the profit and l oss Account.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is the difference 
between the forward exchange rate and the contract rate. The 
forward exchange rate is referenced to current forward exchange 
rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the difference between the 
fixed rate and the one month l IBo R rate implied at the balance 
sheet date, calculated monthly, and discounted to present value.

leases
o perating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
profit and l oss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
employee share ownership plan
The Company maintains an Employee Share ownership plan 
(‘ESop’). All assets and liabilities of the ESop are accounted for 
in accordance with UITF 38 ‘ Accounting for ESop T rusts’. The 
investment in Communisis plc shares held by the ESop trust 
is classified at original cost as a deduction from shareholders’ 
funds.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction 
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the profit 
and l oss Account over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
provisions
provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made, but there is some uncertainty about 
the timing of the future expenditure required in settlement. If 
the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. w here discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
share-based payment transactions
Certain directors and management are eligible to participate in 
share-based payment schemes all of which are equity-settled, 
in return for services provided to Communisis plc.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external 
valuer using an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other 
than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Communisis 
plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the performance or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award (“vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised 
for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the 
Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
n o expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance or service 
conditions are satisfied.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions 
of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied 
FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 november 
2002 that had not vested on or before 31 december 2004.
w here an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not 
yet recognised in the profit and l oss Account for the award is 
expensed immediately. This includes any award where non-
vesting conditions within the control of the Company or the 
employee are not met. Any compensation paid up to the fair 
value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is 
deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being 
treated as an expense in the profit and l oss Account.
w here an equity-settled award is forfeited, the total cost 
recognised in the profit and l oss Account to date for the award 
is reversed.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge 
its foreign currency and interest rate risks respectively. Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. derivatives are 
carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on 
derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting and the ineffective portion of an effective hedge, are 
taken directly to the profit and l oss Account.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is the difference 
between the forward exchange rate and the contract rate. The 
forward exchange rate is referenced to current forward exchange 
rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the difference between the 
fixed rate and the one month l IBo R rate implied at the balance 
sheet date, calculated monthly, and discounted to present value.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as 
cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash 
flows, that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction, or when hedging the foreign currency risk in an 
unrecognised firm commitment.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which 
hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
formally designated and documented at its inception. This 
documentation identifies the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged 
and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. 
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an 
ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly 
effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which 
they were designated.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the profit and l oss Account.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and l oss 
Account when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such 
as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is 
recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. w here the hedged 
item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, 
the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying 
amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer 
expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity 
are transferred to the profit and l oss Account. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without 
replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is 
revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in 
equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts as hedges of its 
exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and 
firm commitments.

It was announced in the Budget on 23 march 2011 that the rate of corporation tax would be reduced to 26% from 1 April 2011 with a 
further reduction to 25% from 1 April 2012; there would be a further one percentage point reduction in each of the subsequent two 
tax years culminating in a rate of 23% to be effective from 1 April 2014. The legislation dealing with the reduction in rate to 25% was 
included in the Finance Act 2011 with further rate reductions to be confirmed in future Finance Acts. The provision for deferred tax at 
31 december 2011 has been made at 25%. If the further rate changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date the 
deferred tax asset would have reduced by approximately £50,000.

The recoverable amount of investments has been determined based on the value in use of assets comprising the Company’s 
investment in subsidiaries, which are in turn allocated across the Income Generating Units (“IGUs”) of the Group. These are based upon 
detailed budgets for the two IGUs of the Group, Intelligence driven Communications (“IdC”) and Specialist production and Sourcing 
(“SpS”), for the coming year and internal forecasts of future growth over a five-year period (2010 three-year period). Cash flows beyond 
the five-year period (2010 three-year period) are extrapolated using external forecasts of expected growth rates.
Revenue growth included in the approved financial budgets
The revenue growth forecast in the risk-adjusted IdC cash flow projections based on financial budgets is 9% in 2012 and between  
6% and 9% in years two to five. The revenue growth forecast in the risk-adjusted Sp S cash flow projections based on financial budgets 
is 1% in 2012 and between -6% and 1% in years two to five.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for these IGUs based on the most recent annual budgets approved by the Board.  
Further information on the assumptions used within the major IGUs is detailed below.
profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period
The profit growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period for the IGUs is considered to be a 
representative rate for the markets to which these IGUs are dedicated and in line with long term economic growth forecasts.
profit growth rates have been assessed individually for each IGU. IdC profit growth rates of 2.9% (2010 3.5%), and SpS profit growth 
rates of 2.4% (2010 2.6%) have been used.

immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of EBIT dA, interest payable 
as a multiple of EBITA and cash flow as a multiple of debt service costs. At the year end the Company was not in breach of any bank 
covenants.

Forward currency contract – cash flow hedge
At 31 december 2010, the Company held a forward exchange contract designated to hedge expected future sales to customers in the 
United States for which the Company had highly probable forecasted transactions. This matured in August 2011. The fair value of this 
forward currency contract at 31 december 2011 was £nil (2010 £26,000) and the amount removed from equity was £nil (2010 19,000).
The forward exchange contract is being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the firm commitments.
Interest rate swaps
At 31 december 2011, the Company had two interest rate swap agreements in place with a notional amount of £5,000,000 each 
whereby the Company pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.48% and 5.68% respectively, and receives a variable rate equal to l IBo R+1.50% 
and l IBo R+2.75% respectively on the notional amounts.
during the first half of 2010 the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the interest 
rates on the three-year variable loans. w ith the refinancing of the Company’s committed debt facilities these swaps are no longer 
designated as cash flow hedges as the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, therefore amounts totalling £401,000 
previously recognised in equity were recycled through the profit and l oss Account in 2010.

The career average revalued earnings section provides an accrual each year of a unit of one forty-fifth, one sixtieth or one eightieth 
(depending on the level of employee contribution) of pensionable salary for that year. The unit is then revalued in each subsequent year 
by the rate of growth in the Retail prices Index until normal retirement age. The normal retirement age under this section is 65 except for 
certain executives, where the accrual rate is one forty-fifth, whose normal retirement age is set at 62.

of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 december 2011.
T o develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the year ended 31 december 2011, the Company 
considered the current level of expected return on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk 
premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset 
class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the asset allocation, to develop the assumed expected 
long-term rate of return on assets of 5.86% for the portfolio for the year ended 31 december 2011 (2010 6.98%).

may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the Support Services sector of the FTSE 
All Share Index (excluding FTSE 100 companies), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. The other 50% of the options 
may vest if the TSR of the Company, as compared to the TSR performance of all companies in the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding 
investment trusts), is at or above the median level over a three-year period. 30% of each tranche of options will vest for performance at 
the median of the comparator group rising, on a straight-line basis, to 100% vesting for performance in the top decile of the comparator 
group. If the performance conditions are not fulfilled within the three-year period from the date of grant, the options lapse. The 
contractual life of each option granted is five years. There are no cash settlement alternatives.
For options granted under this scheme in 2010, the options will vest if the share price of the Company attains certain thresholds 
measured by reference to a rolling three-month average at any time within three years of the date of award. If the share price increases 
to 30p 10% of the options vest, at 50p 30% vest, at a share price of 70p 60% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if the share

For the options granted under this scheme in 2011, no options will vest unless the three-month rolling average share price increases to 
more than 32.742p. At 50p 19.78% of the awards will vest, at a share price of 70p 52.78% will vest and 100% vesting will be attained if 
the share price exceeds 90p.
For the options granted in both 2011 and in 2010 vesting will occur on a straight-line pro rata basis between the thresholds outlined 
above. n o vested shares will be released before the third anniversary of the award date and no vested shares will be released for at least 
two years after the attainment of the threshold. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee will only sanction vesting of these awards if 
they are satisfied as to the Company’s underlying financial performance in the performance period.
The fair value of options granted under the l ong T erm Incentive plan 2007 in the year to 31 december 2011 has been estimated on 
the date of grant using a binomial simulation option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life of five years; share price at the 
date of grant of £0.30 (2010 £0.165); estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5% (2010 5.2%); risk-free interest rate of 
approximately 2.53% (2010 2.83%) and expected volatility of 48% (2010 48%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 under this plan was £0.13523 
(2010 £0.0461).
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns which may occur.  
The expected volatility reflects historical volatility adjusted for future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.  
Both the historical and expected volatilities reflect the volatility of the share prices of Communisis plc and comparator companies.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2010
This scheme was introduced in 2010 to replace the Executive Share option Scheme 2000. Certain directors and managers are eligible 
to participate in this scheme at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of the options granted under this 
scheme is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
n o options were granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2011 nor in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The Executive Share o ption Scheme 2000
This scheme has now been superseded by the Executive Share option Scheme 2010. Under this scheme, certain directors and 
managers were eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The exercise price of options granted under this 
scheme were equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. In respect of options granted prior to 1 January 2005, which 
have not yet lapsed, the options vest if the percentage increase in normalised earnings (i.e. before intangibles amortisation, restructuring 
costs and other exceptional items) per share over any three consecutive financial years exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail 
prices Index over that period by an average of at least 3% per annum. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There are 
no cash settlement alternatives. In respect of options granted since 1 January 2005 if the performance condition is not met within three 
years from the date of grant, the options lapse. There are no outstanding options which were issued after 1 January 2005.
o ptions awarded to the Chairman
o n 19 december 2007, shortly after his appointment, peter hickson was awarded 250,000 nil cost share options in the Company, 
and on 20 december 2007 he entered a contract with RBC T rust Company (Jersey) l imited (“RBC”) for these options, on exercise, 
to be satisfied by the transfer of ordinary shares already held by the Company’s Employee Benefit T rust, of which RBC is the T rustee.  
The grant of those options was conditional upon the purchase by him of 250,000 ordinary shares in the Company; this purchase was 
executed on 18 december 2007. o n 20 december 2010 the options which had been awarded to the Chairman vested. These have not 
yet been exercised. Exercise may take place at any time up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. n o further options have been 
awarded to the Chairman in any subsequent year.
The Sharesave Scheme
All UK employees (including directors) are eligible to participate in the Communisis Sharesave Scheme. The exercise price of the options 
is usually equal to the market price of the shares at the date of invitation to participate less a maximum discount of 20%. The options 
vest on either the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement of the savings period. Any options which have not been exercised 
within six months of the vesting date lapse.
18 ShaRe-baSeD Pa ymentS (continued)
The weighted average fair value of sharesave options granted in the year ended 31 december 2011 was estimated at the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: option holders 
will exercise their option at expiry; share price at the date of grant of £0.31; estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5%; 
risk-free interest rate of 2.52% and expected volatility of 48%. The volatility has been determined by reference to Communisis plc’s 
and comparator companies’ historical volatility over a three-year period, adjusted for expected future trends, to reflect the share price 
of Communisis plc in the future. The exercise price is £0.26 for options exercisable three years after the date of grant. no options 
exercisable five years after the date of grant were granted in 2011. The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the 
year ended 31 december 2011 was £0.095. There were no options granted under this scheme in the year ended 31 december 2010.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

20 Contingent liABilities
Communisis plc has provided rental guarantees to landlords in respect of certain leasehold properties occupied by subsidiaries that 
have subsequently been sold. T o the extent that they have not already been called, these guarantees represent contingent liabilities of 
the Company. o ther than those leases for which the liability is considered to be remote, the Company has guaranteed rentals on leases 
with remaining terms that vary from one month to seven years and with annual rentals that range from £9,000 to £329,000. n o provision 
for these guarantees has been made in the Financial Statements because, at the balance sheet date, the directors believe that it is not 
probable that any further guarantees will be called.

pension deficit reduction project
In February 2012 the Group and the T rustees agreed to an arrangement involving the securitisation of a rental stream on one of the 
Group’s freehold properties. Under the arrangement the pension Scheme will be entitled to annual rent of £1.15m for 15 years. The 
present value of the rental stream of £9.8m will be treated as an additional pension contribution and an asset that reduces the deficit by 
the same amount.
As part of the arrangement the T rustees have agreed that the £9.8m constitutes a prepayment of contributions for the three years from 
2012 to 2014 inclusive. Consequently the annual payments to the pension Scheme will be limited to the annual rental on the property of 
£1.15m between 2012 and 2014 and then increase to £4.15m from 2015 onwards.
Facilities extension
The Bank facilities which are provided under a syndicated arrangement with Barclays, l loyds Banking Group and hSBC were agreed to 
be extended by £5m to £45m in February 2012, and committed until August 2014.

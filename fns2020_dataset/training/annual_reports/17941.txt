Company Overview
Borders & Southern was incorporated in June 2004 
and listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: BOR) 
in 2005. Its Falkland Islands acreage was signed in 
November 2004. The exploration programme has 
included the acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic data 
followed by the drilling of two wells. This resulted in a 
significant gas condensate discovery, Darwin, which 
is currently being evaluated prior to appraisal drilling.

Darwin, our  
gas condensate  
discovery
The Darwin discovery consists of two 
adjacent tilted fault blocks containing 
a high quality clastic reservoir , clearly  
imaged on 3D seismic data.
Brent crude slumped dramatically from over 
$110 per barrel in mid 2014 down to below $30 
per barrel in January 2016. This price drop has 
had a profound effect on the industry.
Borders & Southern has been affected like all of 
our peer group, notably the delay to Darwin’s 
appraisal drilling, due to the challenge in 
securing funding.
BRENT CRUDE
The chart illustrates the price of Brent 
Crude oil ($/barrel) from May 2014 to

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
The Darwin reservoir comprises Early 
Cretaceous shallow marine sandstone. 
The hydrocarbons have been trapped in 
two simple tilted fault blocks, fault sealed 
to the north and dip closed to the south. 
The gas condensate is highlighted 
seismically by amplitude conformance to 
structure and an associated flat spot. 
The gas condensate/water contact was 
not seen in the discovery well.

Industry setting
The industry downturn, triggered by the 
decline in the oil price, has had a significant 
impact on the Company’s fortunes. Brent has 
fallen from around $110 per barrel in mid 2014, 
to around $35 per barrel at the end of 2015. 
This sustained low oil price has caused 
companies to make dramatic reductions in 
their expenditure, delay major capital projects 
and reduce or stop taking on new 
opportunities. This has made it a particularly 
challenging environment for us in which to 
conduct a farm-out. There are as many views 
on future oil price trends as there are analysts 
and commentators, with little consensus at 
the moment. Most believe a recovery will 
occur, but to what level and exactly when, there 
is no agreement. Consequently, companies 
are trying to re-base their operations to 
weather a low cost, low oil price world. 
Financial position
Borders & Southern’s financial status is 
relatively robust in the current environment, 
with a strong balance sheet and no debt. We 
ended the year with a cash balance of $14.0 
million, compared to $16.1 million at the end of 
2014. Like most companies in our sector, we 
have reduced our expenditure. The 2015 
administrative expense was $1.97 million 
compared to $3.04 million in the previous year. 
This reduced expenditure has not impacted 
our ability to progress technical work and 
advance our understanding of our assets. We 
intend to maintain this capital discipline 
throughout 2016 and beyond.
Project status
The industry recession has delayed the timing 
of the next operations phase on our 
Production Licences. We had hoped to have 
secured partners and funding for a new 
exploration and appraisal drilling programme 
by now, but have had to reset our expectations. 
So whilst the current Production Licence 
period extends through to the end of October 
2017 , we have applied to the Falkland Islands 
Government for an extension.
From a sub-surface point of view we have 
continued to make good progress. Earlier in 
2015, we announced an upgrade in the 
combined Darwin East and West recoverable 
resource estimate (Best estimate P50: 360 
million barrels of condensate) and described 
some of the surrounding prospects in more 
detail. We continue to work the Early 
Cretaceous shallow marine sandstone play 
fairway in detail, re-mapping the discovery and 
analysing the seismic response on near -field 
prospects with the aim of developing reliable 
predictive models for hydrocarbon presence 
and phase.
Additionally, we have spent time re-assessing 
our basin models, incorporating the results 
from recent drilling activity by other operators. 
The Humpback well was located over 250km 
northeast of Darwin and its findings have no 
impact on the prospectivity of our licences. 
In fact, our recent regional basin analysis has 
re-enforced our belief that our licences are 
optimally located in the South Falkland Basin.
Current technical work is aimed at re-assessing 
how a Darwin development would fit into a low 
oil price world. We know that the combination 
of competitive fiscal terms in the Falkland 
Islands and excellent reservoir characteristics 
of the Early Cretaceous shallow marine 
sandstone makes a development competitive 
on the cost curve against other deep water 
developments. However, we need to assess 
just how commercial a project would be in a 
period of sustained low oil prices. Previously we 
had considered 2 to 3 appraisal wells and 10 
development wells (6 producers, 4 gas 
re-injectors) with sub-sea tie back to an FPSO. 
New reservoir engineering studies are looking 
at reduced well count models. Outputs from 
this work will feed into a fresh look at facilities 
engineering concepts and costs and, in turn, a 
new economic evaluation. If we can clearly 
demonstrate the commercial viability of a 
development in a low oil price environment, it 
should assist the farm-out process. 
Outlook
All our technical and commercial work to date 
suggests that Darwin is a robust project, even 
in a low oil price environment. The principal risk 
for the Company over the next 12 months is 
that a sustained low oil price will cause further 
delay to our farm-out and hence funding for 
the next phase of operations. We have 
positioned the Company so that our strong 
balance sheet will allow us to withstand an 
extended period of reduced industry activity. 
As we move forward, we will continue to 
control costs, undertake good science and 
maintain our resolve to monetise the Darwin 
discovery.
Finally, Stephen Posford, 69, one of the 
Company’s founders and a member of the 
Board since the Company’s inception, has 
announced that he intends to retire from 
business activities and will step down from the 
Board prior to the AGM. Stephen has played an 
influential role in the development of the 
Company, which included the significant gas 
condensate discovery in 2012. On behalf of all 
the Directors I would like to thank Stephen for 
his contribution and wish him a healthy, happy 
and long retirement.
Chairman’s Statement
All our technical and commercial work 
to date suggests that Darwin is a 
robust project, even in a low oil price 
environment. The principal risk for the 
Company over the next 12 months is 
that a sustained low oil price will cause 
further project delay.

Corporate Responsibility
Borders & Southern’s business is to 
create value through the discovery 
and monetisation of hydrocarbons. 
T o be successful we need to ensure that 
all our stakeholders benefit, including 
shareholders, host governments, 
the communities in which we operate, 
employees and our partners. Corporate 
Responsibility is therefore central to 
everything we do. We aim to conduct our 
operations safely, in line with industry 
best practice, demonstrating 
environmental and social responsibility. 
We will maintain good governance, 
identifying and managing risks, and will 
ensure high standards of business ethics.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT A GLANCE Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 6
Our business model is all about value creation through  
the discovery and monetisation of hydrocarbons.
How we create value Description
1. ACCESS
New opportunities
The first stage is to access new opportunities, either 
through Licence Rounds or Open Door policies.
Our Frontier Exploration strategy directs us to focus 
on untested or emerging basins where significant 
acreage positions can be accessed at relatively 
low cost.
Comprehensive technical screening prior to access 
helps mitigate geological risk, however the project 
risk profile is relatively high at this stage.
Economic modeling of fiscal terms and potential 
discovery volumes is undertaken to ensure project 
rewards merit the investment decision.
2. EXPLORE
Commence operations
Our technical work is underpinned by rigorous 
petroleum systems analysis.
Operations will typically begin with the acquisition of 
2D seismic, at limited financial exposure.
If interpretation of the 2D seismic data provides 
confidence in a working source rock, reservoirs and 
trapping geometries, then further investment will be 
made in the acquisition of 3D seismic data.
Detailed analysis of the 3D seismic will result in the 
development of a prospect inventory, outlining the 
estimated prospect sizes and their associated risks.
Finally, prospects will be high-graded and the 
preparation for a drilling programme will commence.
3. APPRAISE
Assess the commerciality
If the drilling campaign leads to the discovery of 
hydrocarbons, then the well results will be evaluated 
and integrated back into the 3D interpretation.
An appraisal programme will be designed and 
executed in order to constrain the resource 
estimates and to assess the commerciality of a 
potential development project.
T ypically, several more wells will be drilled. Coring and 
reservoir flow tests will be undertaken and 
exhaustive reservoir studies completed.
Positive results from the appraisal programme will 
lead to detailed facilities engineering studies prior to 
a final investment decision to proceed with a 
development.
4. ACCRETE
Build a strong position
Once a working petroleum system has been 
demonstrated through the discovery of 
hydrocarbons, the objective will be to maximise the 
acreage position and add value to the asset.
Near field targets will be tested to extend the 
discovery and exploration will continue focusing on 
analogue prospects within the prospect inventory.
Alternative play types will also be tested in order to 
assess the overall value of the acreage.
5. MONETISE
Maximise asset value
Monetisation can occur at all stages of the business 
cycle. Partners can be brought in at the access, 
exploration or appraisal stages in order to help fund 
new phases of work.
Alternatively, partnering could occur after the 
appraisal stage in order to help fund a development 
project. Significant capital investment is required at 
this stage.
In order to return value to our shareholders, a dilution 
of interest or an asset sale might occur once a 
discovery has been brought into production.
Business Model & Strategy 7 www.bordersandsouthern.com Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements
Our technical work is making great strides forward. Our aim is to reduce 
sub-surface risk and enhance our chance of success.
Progress in 2015 Outlook
In 2014 we had consolidated 2,521 square kilometres of high quality 
PSDM 3D seismic data. This allowed us to undertake a number of 
technical studies during 2015, focused on the main Darwin reservoir 
interval, both within the mapped limits of the discovery and its regional 
extrapolation. Some highlights are outlined below.
Sub-surface analysis will continue to be refined, focusing on our proven 
reservoir along with other potential targets. We also aim to reassess the 
facilities options for a Darwin development scheme, taking a fresh look 
at costs and timing to reflect the current industry environment.
Seismic inversion/Reservoir characterisation
• The objective was to investigate three reservoir intervals: the main 
Darwin Early Cretaceous reservoir, a slightly shallower Early 
Cretaceous sand and a deeper high-amplitude target not penetrated 
by the discovery well.
• Reservoir properties were estimated using seismic data calibrated by 
well-log data. The study integrated pre-stack inversion elastic 
attributes and AVO attributes.
• Statistical results from the study have given us an insight into the 
spatial distribution of porosity and water saturation across the Darwin 
East and West structures and helped characterise the reservoir 
heterogeneity. The results have also provided an understanding of 
the potential reservoir characteristics of nearby prospects.
• The results have allowed us to generate better resource estimates 
and will help us optimise future well locations.
Resource assessment
• The objective was to provide new resource estimates based on 
revised mapping and inputs from the reservoir characterisation 
study.
• Analysis focused on the Early Cretaceous shallow marine sandstone 
play fairway, but incorporated an older, deeper interval that had a 
strong AVO anomaly.
• The study revised the un-risked best estimate (P50) for the 
combined Darwin East and Darwin West structures to be 360 million 
barrels of recoverable condensate.
• Additionally, near -field prospects highlighted by the seismic inversion 
study were defined: Covington, Morgan, Sulivan, Stokes and 
Wickham (described in an RNS, May 2015).
Basin evaluation
• Our understanding of the geological history of the South Falkland 
Basin is constantly evolving. New findings from the detailed studies 
are integrated into our regional models with the objective of 
enhancing our ability to predict the distribution of source rocks, 
reservoirs and seals.
• Drilling results from other operators are also integrated into regional 
models.
• Results from the Humpback well, drilled 250 km northeast of Darwin, 
have little bearing on the prospectivity of our acreage.
• Our current regional models suggest that very good Early 
Cretaceous reservoir development occurs south of the Falkland 
Islands. These models predict that our acreage may contain further 
hydrocarbon accumulations, with potential for oil, gas condensate 
and gas discoveries. Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 8
Despite the challenges facing the 
industry today, we remain optimistic 
that our project will find the funding 
necessary to move it forward.
With Howard Obee and Peter Fleming
Our aim for 2015 had been to secure funding 
for the next phase of operations in the Falkland 
Islands, but the continued low oil price and the 
industry’s significant reduction in capital 
expenditure meant that we were unable to 
achieve all our goals.
The industry downturn caused us to move 
quickly to reduce expenditure in order to 
preserve funds, but we ensured that our 
sub-surface work continued to move forward. 
Good progress has been made on that front. 
During the year we reported on a resource 
upgrade for the Darwin discovery and 
described near -field prospects along with their 
resource estimates. We also revised our basin 
geological models, incorporating new findings 
including the well results from other operator’s 
drilling programmes. These regional geological 
studies reinforce our belief that our acreage 
sits in the right part of the South Falkland Basin, 
in an area where we can demonstrate high 
quality reservoirs, mature source rocks that 
have generated both oil and gas and a variety 
of trapping configurations. Our efforts to 
continually enhance our prospect and regional 
interpretations are driven by a need to 
minimise sub-surface risks ahead of the 
next exploration/appraisal campaign.
Current sub-surface work is focused on a field 
development study, remodelling and 
reassessing the reservoir performance in light 
of new mapping. We are considering several 
development possibilities using different 
numbers of production and gas re-injection 
wells, looking to determine the optimum 
commercial solution.
Once completed, this work will feed into a fresh 
look at facilities design, building on an earlier 
screening feasibility study. The objective is to 
assess different alternatives for bringing the 
discovery into production quickly and cost 
effectively. The low oil price environment has 
seen a reduction in many service company 
costs. We need to reassess our project 
economics in light of current cost estimates. 
Previous project economics for a Darwin 
development have suggested that it would be 
competitive against many other global 
opportunities, sitting relatively low on the 
global cost curve, due to the attractive fiscal 
terms and a low well count (a function of the 
high quality reservoir).
Our hope is that this new work will increase the 
commercial attractiveness of the project, 
which can only help our farm-out objectives. 
The industry as a whole continues to be on a 
run of disappointing exploration results, 
particularly for liquids. In this context, the 
South Falkland Basin represents an appealing 
place to explore. From our perspective, the 
Darwin discovery and our licensed acreage has 
many attractions. We can point to our 
assessment of a large volume of recoverable 
condensate, a high quality reservoir and a 
potentially straight forward FPSO 
development that is commercially attractive 
and able to withstand relatively low oil prices. 
Additionally, we have upside potential within 
near -field prospects.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
RISK STATUS KEY 
(*RS refers to Risk Status)
Risk Nature of risk RS* Mitigation
EXPLORATION 
SUB-SURFACE
Exploration for oil and gas is inherently risky and 
whilst many of these risks can be mitigated, they 
cannot be eliminated.
The Company has a disciplined approach to 
exploration, using industry leading techniques for 
data acquisition and interpretation. Its employees 
and contractors are all very experienced 
geoscientists and engineers.
HEALTH, SAFETY, 
SECURITY AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Conducting operations in a remote, 
environmentally sensitive location presents 
many challenges.
Prior to operations, detailed risk assessments and 
mitigation plans are put in place. Policies, plans and 
actions closely follow industry’s best practice.
FUNDING
The Company has a strong balance sheet with 
sufficient funds for overheads in the foreseeable 
future. The challenge is to secure funds for the 
next phase of drilling.
Darwin’s high quality reservoir and attractive fiscal 
terms mean that it is commercially competitive 
against similar global projects. Therefore we are 
confident of securing the necessary partners/
funding.
OIL PRICE
The industry is impacted by the commodity cycle. 
A protracted period of low oil price can result in 
serious constraints for capital investment.
The economics of a Darwin development indicate 
that it is robust in a low oil price environment. 
Whilst the Company cannot influence the 
commodity price, it can work on low cost 
development options.
KEY PERSONNEL
Like many others in our peer group, the Company 
is reliant upon a small number of experienced 
personnel.
The Company has service contracts with key 
employees that provide for notice periods that 
would allow sufficient time to source 
replacements. Also, the Company has a wide 
network of experienced contractors to call upon.
SUPPLY CHAIN
The geographical location and political backdrop 
provide significant logistical challenges.
Meticulous planning with in-built contingency is 
essential for successful operations. Several drilling 
campaigns have now been undertaken by the 
industry so there is a wealth of experience to 
draw upon.

POLITICAL
There is an ongoing dispute over the sovereign 
status of the Falkland Islands.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report, the Strategic Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and 
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and elected 
to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on AIM.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the company’s website is the responsibility of the 
directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Auditor
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the 
Company’s auditor for the purposes of its audit and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware.
BDO LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 31 December 2015
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied to all 
years presented.
These consolidated and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and 
IFRIC interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
New and revised standards effective for 31 December 2015 year end
There were no new standards issued in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 that were relevant for adoption by the Group.
New and revised standards issued but not effective for 31 December 2015 year end
We are still considering the impact of IFRS 15 and 16 and it is not anticipated that the other new standards issued but not effective for the year ended 
31 December 2015 would be relevant for adoption by the Group.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed 
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used 
by other members of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a business is the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred 
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date.
Going concern
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to undertake its planned programme of exploration and 
appraisal activities for a period of at least 12 months.
Loss for the financial year
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own income 
statement in these financial statements. The group loss for the year includes a loss after tax of $2,599,393, (2014 – loss after tax of $3,887 ,512) which 
is dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
The Parent Company’s subsidiaries are carried at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
Finance income
Finance income consists of interest on cash deposits and foreign exchange gains.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as 
the Board of Directors.
Property, plant and equipment
Office equipment is initially recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on office equipment so as to write off the cost, less any estimated residual 
value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment 33 1/3%
Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition and on a straight -line basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in respect of its exploration and evaluation 
expenditure. The requirements of IFRS 6 are not applied to expenditure incurred by the Group before legal title to explore for and evaluate 
hydrocarbon resources in a specific area, generally referred to as pre-licence expenditure. Likewise the group do not apply the requirements of IFRS 6 
after the point at which the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons are demonstrable. Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 26
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the Year Ended 31 December 2015
The costs of exploring for and evaluating hydrocarbon resources are accumulated and capitalised as intangible assets by reference to appropriate 
cash-generating units (CGU), generally referred to as full cost accounting. Such CGUs have been determined by the Group to be a Darwin CGU and a 
Stebbing CGU and are noted as not being larger than an operating segment as determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure may include, amongst other costs, costs of licence acquisition, third party technical services and 
studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing but do not include general overheads. Any property, plant and equipment (PPE) acquired 
for use in exploration and evaluation activities is classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the extent that such PPE is consumed in 
developing an intangible exploration and evaluation asset the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible 
exploration and evaluation asset.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are not depreciated and are carried forward, subject to the provisions of the Group’s impairment of 
exploration and evaluation policy, until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons are demonstrable. At such point 
exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment and any impairment loss is recognised before reclassification of the assets to a 
category of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the 
exploration and evaluation assets may exceed the assets recoverable amount.
In accordance with IFRS 6 the Group firstly considers the following facts and circumstances in their assessment of whether the Group’s exploration 
and evaluation assets may be impaired:
• whether the period for which the Group has the right to explore in a specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, and 
is not expected to be renewed;
• whether substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in a specific area is neither budgeted nor planned;
• whether exploration for and evaluation of hydrocarbons in a specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of 
hydrocarbons and the Group has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; and
• whether sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development in a specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration 
and evaluation assets is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
If any such facts or circumstances are noted, the Group, as a next step, perform an impairment test in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36. In 
such circumstances the aggregate carrying value of the exploration and evaluations assets is compared against the expected recoverable amount of 
the CGU. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell.
The Group has identified two cash-generating units, a Darwin CGU and a Stebbing CGU. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 6 the level identified for 
the purposes of assessing the Group’s exploration and evaluation assets for impairment may comprise one or more cash-generating units.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the closing rates at the reporting date and the 
exchange differences are included in the statement of comprehensive income. The functional and presentational currency of the parent and all 
Group companies is the US dollar.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight -line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Non-employee options granted as part of 
consideration for services rendered are valued at the fair value of those services. Where information on the fair value of services rendered is not 
readily available, the fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments the resulting cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of 
the options. The amount of charge is adjusted each year to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Where equity-settled share options are awarded, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The 
cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before 
and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the remaining vesting period.
1 Accounting policies continued 27 www.bordersandsouthern.com Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows:
• T rade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest, net of 
allowances for impairment.
• T rade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest.
• Financial instruments issued by Group companies are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. 
The Group’s and Company’s ordinary shares are all classified as equity instruments.
• Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank on demand and balances on deposit with an original maturity of three months or less. Some of 
these funds are held in restricted deposits or escrow accounts as security for suppliers to the Company.
Taxes
The major components of tax on the profit or loss include current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based upon the profit or loss for the year adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
T ax is charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income, except where the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in 
which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs to its 
tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference 
can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when deferred tax liabilities and assets are settled or recovered.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such 
estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual 
circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change. Where 
necessary, the comparatives will be reclassified from the previously reported results to take into accounts presentational changes.
Management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
Expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset by reference to appropriate CGUs and is assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that 
the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to:
(i) the timing of future development of the asset;
(ii) funding structures and financing costs of development;
(iii) commercial development opportunities for extracting value from the asset; and
(iv) modelling inputs such as the appropriateness of discount rates, reserve and resource estimates, oil and gas pricing predictions, etc.
Share options
The Group’s share-based payments were recognised at fair value using a 60% volatility rate based on long-term average standard deviation of the 
Company’s share price and a 1.5% risk free rate based on current UK Government bond yields.

3 Basic and dilutive (loss)/earnings per share
The calculation of the basic and dilutive loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year. The loss for the financial year for the Group was $2,599,393 (2014 – loss $3,887 ,512) and the weighted 
average number of shares in issue for the year was 484,098,484 (2014 – 484,098,484). During the year the potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive 
and therefore diluted loss per share has not been calculated. At the statement of financial position date, there were 6,150,000 (2014 – 6,150,000) 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares being the share options (see note 7 for further details).
4 Segment analysis
The Company operates in one operating segment (exploration for oil and gas) and in substantially one geographical market (the Falkland Islands), 
therefore no additional segmental information is presented.
Of the Group’s total non-current assets, the property, plant and equipment is based in the UK and all other non-current assets are located in the 
Falkland Islands.

Factors that may affect future tax charges

31 December 2015 (2014 – $2,734,239). The rate of tax used in the calculation of the deferred tax asset is 18% (2014 – 20%). The deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in the financial statements as the timing of the economic benefit is uncertain.

20 Financial instruments
The main risks arising from the Group’s operations are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency translation risk and credit risk. The Group monitors 
risk on a regular basis and takes appropriate measures to ensure risks are managed in a controlled manner.
Liquidity is not considered to be a risk due to the sufficient cash funds readily available by the Group at the year end.
The Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. There have been no substantive changes in the group’s exposure to financial 
instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless 
otherwise stated in the note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the group from which financial instrument risk arises, held by category, are as follows:
• Other receivables.
• Cash and cash equivalents.
• T rade and other payables.
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 and as at 31 December 2015 are materially equivalent to the carrying 
value as disclosed in the statement of financial position and related notes.
Market risk
a) Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from monies held at bank and on deposit at variable rates. The considerations below and the 
figures quoted are the same for both Group and Company.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities accrue interest at prevailing floating rates in the United Kingdom or at pre-arranged fixed rates, as 
described further below. The Group does not currently use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2015 the Group held cash at bank and in deposits under its control of $14,011,005 (2014 – $16,078,547) which forms the majority of 
the Group’s working capital. Of the cash at bank and in deposit $13,011,005 (2014 – $539,971) relates to deposits placed with banking institutions that 
are available on demand which carry interest at prevailing United Kingdom deposit floating rates. The balance represents restricted deposits of 
$1,000,000 (2014 – $15,569,416) with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.2% (2014 – 0.2%) for 3 months. If there was 1% change in interest 
rates the impact on the statement of comprehensive income would be $132,610 (2014 – $44,427).
b) Foreign currency translation risk
The operational currency of the oil and gas exploration and evaluation activities of the Group is US$ and the Group’s functional and presentational 
currency is US$. Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group’s services and treasury function is UK sterling, which results in gains or losses on 
retranslation into US$. T o minimise this foreign currency risk cash balances are held in both £ sterling and US$.
The foreign currency profile of financial assets and liabilities of the Group and the Company are as follows:

Credit risk
Neither the Group nor the Company have customers so formal credit procedures are in the process of being established. During drilling operations, 
the Group incurred 100% of costs that were shared with other companies and these were invoiced to these companies with all amounts due for 
these shared costs paid to the group during the year. Credit risk on cash balances is managed by only banking with reputable financial institutions with 
a high credit rating. The only significant concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis is cash held at bank and the maximum credit risk exposure for 
the Group and Company is detailed in the table below:

The maximum credit risk for the Company is $303,780,000 (2014 – $306,222,000). The amounts owed by Group undertakings of $289,796,000 
(2014 – $290,143,000) are considered to have no credit risk exposure from the Parent Company’s point of view.
Capital
The objective of the Directors is to maximise shareholder return and minimise risk by keeping a reasonable balance between debt and equity. T o date 
the Group has minimised risk by being purely equity financed. The Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium, 
accumulated retained deficit and other reserves.

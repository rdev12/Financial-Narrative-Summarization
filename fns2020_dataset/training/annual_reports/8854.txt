CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Sir John Banham
Chairman
I am very pleased to report that 2007/08 was another good year for Johnson Matthey.
Your company has continued to build on its strong position in environmental technologies
and is seeing the benefit of the investments that it has made over many years in research
and development and in manufacturing facilities to serve growing markets around the world.
During the year we have continued to make substantial investments to ensure future
growth. These have included new production facilities that have been completed in South
Korea, the Russian Federation and in the UK and the acquisition of Argillon which has
complemented our existing technology for controlling harmful emissions of oxides of
nitrogen, or NOx, from both mobile and stationary sources. This will provide opportunities
in new markets as future legislation focuses on emissions from power generation and
other large scale sources such as ships. As you will read later in this report we have also
announced the construction of additional manufacturing facilities and the expansion of
existing plants to serve growing demand for our high technology products around the world.
Most importantly, the year has seen us continue to make excellent progress towards
achieving the board’s main objective, that of delivering superior value to you, our shareholders.

Your board is fully committed to reporting on Johnson
Matthey’s sustainability performance. In my statement last
year I wrote to you about the work that the management
team had been doing to develop a sustainability strategy
for the company. This year has seen a great deal of work
being undertaken to define our vision for a sustainable
future for our business and to begin to embed this in 
all of our operations around the world. A review of our
performance and activities in this important area during the
year is included in pages 29 to 35 of this Annual Report.
Our first full Sustainability Report will be published on our
website at www.matthey.com this July.
Our non-executive directors play a vital role in the
governance of your company. Johnson Matthey is extremely
fortunate to benefit from the knowledge and many years
of experience of its strong team of independent directors.
During 2007/08 we welcomed two new non-executive
directors to the board, Dorothy Thompson, who is
currently the Chief Executive of Drax Group plc, and
Michael Roney, who is currently Chief Executive of Bunzl
plc. Biographical details of Mrs Thompson and Mr Roney
are presented in the Board of Directors information on
pages 36 and 37 of this Annual Report.
As I announced in my statement last year, Charles
Mackay and Mike Dearden retired from the board on
31st March 2008, having both served nine years as 
non-executive directors of Johnson Matthey. Charles Mackay
joined the board in January 1999 and served as our Senior
Independent Director from July 2003 until his retirement.
He was also Chairman of the Management Development
and Remuneration Committee. Mike Dearden joined the
board in April 1999. During their time on the board
Charles and Mike both made invaluable contributions to
the strategic development of the company as the group
was refocused on its core skills in catalysis, precious metals,
fine chemicals and process technology and emerged as a
world leading speciality chemicals company. We are very
fortunate to have had the benefit of their vast experience
of business in the UK and around the world and we will
miss their strong contribution to the work of the board
and their wise counsel. On behalf of all of us at Johnson
Matthey, I would like to thank both Charles and Mike for
the important contributions that they have made to the
success of Johnson Matthey and to wish them all the very
best for their retirement.
Following Charles Mackay’s retirement, Alan Thomson
has been appointed as Senior Independent Director and
Robert Walvis as Chairman of the Management
Development and Remuneration Committee. Alan Thomson
remains Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Our employees at all levels of the organisation never
fail to impress me with their enthusiasm, professionalism
and dedication. On your behalf, I would like to thank all
of them around the world for their contribution to the
success of the company during the past year.
In conclusion, Johnson Matthey is in excellent shape
and continues to make good progress towards delivering
superior shareholder value. Our strategy has placed us in
a very strong position to maintain growth despite the
challenges presented by the state of many of the world’s
economies. Indeed, I believe that the company is
exceptionally well positioned to make a significant
contribution as rapidly developing economies such as
China and India seek to tackle the major issues that they
face in reducing air pollution and in responding to the
escalating price of oil.
I am confident that Johnson Matthey will continue
to achieve good growth for many years ahead and I look
forward to reporting on further success in 2008/09.
Sir John Banham
Chairman 4 Johnson Matthey
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Neil Carson
Chief Executive
Johnson Matthey performed very well in 2007/08. Revenue and sales excluding precious
metals were more than 20% up on last year at £7.5 billion and £1.8 billion respectively.
Profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangibles was 16% higher at £265.4 million.
All three of our divisions achieved good results. Our new Environmental Technologies
Division increased its operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles by 20%
to £147.3 million. Despite the slowdown in the US economy and the likely impact on the
rest of the world, we believe that the division will continue to deliver strong growth over
the next few years. The division’s Emission Control Technologies (ECT) business
performed very well with sales excluding the value of precious metals 32% up on last
year. This performance was driven by strong growth in sales of catalysts for heavy duty
diesel vehicles, diesel particulate filters in Europe and autocatalysts in Asia. The Process
Technologies business also had a good year. Sales excluding the value of precious metals
were 10% up with high energy prices continuing to underpin demand for our catalysts,
purification materials and process technologies.
Precious Metal Products Division’s operating profit was 20% up at £102.1 million.
The division’s Platinum Marketing and Distribution business achieved strong growth,
benefiting from high platinum group metal (pgm) prices and good demand for the pgms.
Its manufacturing businesses also saw good growth and high metal prices boosted demand
for our pgm recycling services.
Johnson Matthey’s new manufacturing facility and technical centre in South Korea. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 5
Our new Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division achieved
good growth in 2007/08. Sales rose by 13% and operating
profit by 6% on a constant currency basis to £67.1 million.
The division’s Catalysts and Chemicals business was well ahead
in Asia, particularly in China and India. The Pharmaceutical
Materials businesses achieved steady growth and Research
Chemicals also performed well, particularly in Asia.
The acquisition of Argillon Group, which was concluded
in February 2008 following the receipt of German regulatory
approval, is a further step in our strategy of long term
investment. Argillon brings to the group leading catalyst
technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen
(NOx). Its products include catalysts for mobile and
stationary emission control including heavy duty diesel
vehicles, stationary diesel engines, marine applications and
coal, oil and gas fired turbines for power generation. This
acquisition has added to our portfolio of emission control
technologies to meet increasingly challenging regulations to
control harmful NOx emissions. With increasing concern
about the effects of poor air quality on human health and
the environment, legislation to control NOx emissions from
an expanding range of sources will continue to tighten
around the world.
Sustainability 201 7
Johnson Matthey is a world leader in environmental
technologies and with more than 50% of our profits
generated by products that directly benefit the
environment, sustainability is a key element of our strategy
for the future growth of our business. Sustainability is
fundamentally about the best long term way to run a
business. It gives us the opportunity to be more profitable
through being more careful with the world’s resources. For
Johnson Matthey there are two main sustainability thrusts.
The first is about being more efficient with the resources
that we use as a business, the cost of which will inevitably
continue to rise, and the second is about designing new
products that will help our customers to be more
sustainable and competitive.
In December 2007 we launched Sustainability 2017,
a long term vision for the whole group that is playing an
important role in helping all of us at Johnson Matthey to
set our direction and aspirations for what we want to
achieve in the future. Our aims for Sustainability 2017 are
to at least double our earnings per share whilst achieving
zero waste to landfill, zero accidents and halving the key
resources that we consume per unit output by 2017, the
year marking the 200th anniversary of the founding of
the company. This is the first time that we have set out a
vision in this very important area and we wanted it to be
challenging and long term. I know that every member of
the Johnson Matthey team will rise to the challenge.
Outlook
Environmental Technologies achieved strong growth in
2007/08. We are currently seeing a slowdown in the US
economy which might have an adverse effect on growth in
the rest of the world. Despite this more difficult economic
backdrop we still expect Emission Control Technologies
to deliver another year of double digit growth in sales
and profits. Global car sales are expected to grow, with
weakness in the USA more than offset by growth in Asia,
Eastern Europe and South America. In Europe, fitment of
diesel particulate filters will also continue to rise ahead of
the legislation. We expect sales of trucks to grow again in
the USA in the second half of our financial year, particularly
in the final quarter, partly as a result of pre-buying ahead
of the introduction of the next level of emissions legislation.
ECT’s operating profit should also benefit from a continuation
of the improved efficiencies achieved in the second half of
2007/08.
Our Process Technologies business is also experiencing
strong demand, particularly for catalysts for synthesis gas,
methanol, ammonia and hydrogen production. Prospects
for Process Technologies are encouraging, driven by the
very high oil price and the need to make cleaner and more
sophisticated hydrocarbon products from dirtier and more
intractable feedstocks.
Precious Metal Products Division enjoyed strong
growth in 2007/08, benefiting from buoyant trading
conditions in platinum group metals and good growth in its
manufacturing businesses. If the current favourable market
conditions continue we expect the division to show further
growth in 2008/09. Fine Chemicals & Catalysts should
deliver another year of steady growth. Many of the markets
in which the division operates, such as generic
pharmaceuticals, are unlikely to be particularly adversely
affected by a general economic slowdown.
Overall, the group should continue to perform well in
2008/09. Although Johnson Matthey is not immune to the
effects of a recession, prospects for all our businesses are
good, particularly for Environmental Technologies where
global concerns about pollution, climate change and making
the most efficient use of energy resources will continue to
create significant opportunities for future growth.

Group Activities
Johnson Matthey is a global speciality chemicals company. We
serve our customer base from operations in over 30 countries
and employ around 8,700 people worldwide. The group is
organised into three global divisions: Environmental Technologies;
Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts.
Environmental T echnologies is a global supplier of catalysts
and related technologies for applications which benefit the
environment such as pollution control, cleaner fuel, more
efficient use of hydrocarbons and the hydrogen economy.
The division comprises three businesses:
• Emission Control Technologies is a global leader in catalytic
systems for emissions control from vehicles and industrial
processes.
• Process Technologies serves the world’s chemical, oil, gas
and refining industries. It manufactures catalysts, provides
specialist services and designs and licenses chemical
processes.
• Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells develops and manufactures
catalysts and catalysed components for a wide range of
clean energy fuel cell systems.
Precious Metal Products’ activities comprise the marketing,
distribution, refining and recycling of platinum group metals,
fabrication of products using precious metals and related
materials, and refining of gold and silver.
Fine Chemicals & Catalysts is a global supplier of fine chemicals,
catalysts and other speciality chemical products and services to
a wide range of chemical and pharmaceutical industry customers
and research institutes.
Strategy and Objectives
Johnson Matthey’s strategic intent is to achieve consistent
growth in earnings by concentrating on the development of
high added value products and services in areas where our
expertise provides a competitive edge, particularly in catalysis,
precious metals, fine chemicals and process technology.
The group’s financial objectives are:
• To continue to achieve consistent and above average
growth in underlying earnings per share.
• To grow dividends in line with underlying earnings while
maintaining dividend cover at about two and a half times
to ensure sufficient funds are retained to support organic
growth.
• T o deliver a return on investment above the group’s cost
of capital. We estimate Johnson Matthey’s post tax cost of
capital is currently about 8% (11.3% pre-tax). In addition we
have a long run pre-tax target rate for the group of 20%.
The board’s strategies to achieve these financial objectives are:
• Focus the business on the group’s core skills in catalysis,
precious metals, fine chemicals and process technology.
• Position the group in growth markets where our core
skills are applicable. Catalysis is a key technology in many
developing markets for the 21st century, particularly those
concerned with protecting the environment such as in
emission control, cleaner fuel, more efficient use of
hydrocarbons and the hydrogen economy. Environmental
Technologies Division, which combines our skills in catalysts
and process technology, is well positioned to serve these
emerging markets. Catalysis is also important in the
manufacture of fine chemicals where Johnson Matthey
has a number of strong niche market positions. Johnson
Matthey’s expertise and international strength in precious
metals, particularly platinum group metals, was the starting
point for many of our businesses. The market for platinum
has grown steadily for many decades and demand is
expected to grow significantly over the next ten years.
• Differentiate ourselves by using our world class technology.
We will continue to invest significantly in research and
development to develop new products and manufacturing
processes. Technology is the key driver for most of our
businesses and Johnson Matthey has a strong science base
with technical centres located in all our major markets.
• Maintain strong relationships with our major customers,
suppliers, government bodies and other stakeholders by
investing resources on joint projects to ensure the group
is well positioned for future market development.
• Continue to invest in Johnson Matthey’s employees to
ensure they are well trained, motivated and encouraged
to meet the challenges of the future.
• Ensure the business is run in a sustainable way by using
resources efficiently, minimising waste in our manufacturing
processes and designing new products that help our
customers to be more sustainable and competitive. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008

Key Performance Indicators
The group uses a range of key performance indicators (KPIs)
to monitor performance over time in line with the financial
objectives and strategy summarised in the previous section.
The principal KPIs, together with the group’s performance
against them in 2007/08, are described below:
Financial
Underlying earnings per share growth and return on invested
capital are two of the principal financial KPIs we use to measure
the group’s performance. In calculating these measures we
exclude the following items which can distort the trend in
measuring results:
• Profits and losses on disposal of businesses.
• Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of
businesses (acquired intangibles).
• Major restructuring or impairment charges.
• Major tax items arising from changes in legislation.
In 2007/08 the only adjustment in calculating underlying
earnings per share and return on invested capital was
amortisation of acquired intangibles, mainly arising on the
acquisition of Argillon Group in February 2008. Underlying
earnings per share were 89.5 pence, 9% up on 2006/07. Total
earnings per share were 88.5 pence, 9% below 2006/07 which
included the profit on sale of Ceramics Division. Over the five
years from 2003/04, underlying earnings per share have grown
at a compound annual rate of 9% p.a. The group’s five year
financial record is shown on page 104.
In accordance with our policy of increasing dividends in
line with earnings, the board is recommending a final dividend
of 26.0 pence taking the total for the year to 36.6 pence, a 9%
increase on 2006/07. Over the last five years dividends have also
grown at a compound annual rate of 9%, in line with earnings.
We define return on invested capital (ROIC) for the group
as underlying operating profit divided by average capital
employed (equity plus net debt). ROIC for individual divisions is
calculated using average segment assets minus average segment
liabilities as the denominator.
In 2007/08 the group’s return on invested capital increased
by 0.9% to 18.5%, well ahead of our long run pre-tax cost of
capital, which we estimate to be 11.3% on a pre-tax basis. Over
the five years from 2003/04, the group’s ROIC has increased by
2.3%. In 2007/08 Precious Metal Products Division achieved a
return of 54.3%, well ahead of the group’s target of 20%.
Environmental Technologies Division and Fine Chemicals &
Catalysts Division achieved returns between our cost of capital
and the 20% target of 15.2% and 13.9% respectively.
In measuring sales growth and return on sales we focus
on sales excluding the value of precious metals. Total revenue
can be distorted by trading activity as well as fluctuations in
precious metal prices and do not provide a good guide to
underlying growth or profitability. As it happens in 2007/08
both revenue (£7.5 billion) and sales excluding precious metals
(£1.8 billion) grew at similar rates (22% and 20% respectively).
Over five years sales excluding precious metals have grown by
9% p.a. despite the sale of Ceramics Division.
Johnson Matthey is a global business with operations in
many countries around the world which report in different
currencies. We report sales and operating profit translated both
at actual exchange rates and at constant rates (translating last
year’s results at this year’s rates) to measure underlying growth.
We also monitor several key cash flow and capital ratios both for
the group and individual divisions. More details of financial KPIs
are given in the Financial Review on pages 10 to 13 and
Operations on pages 15 to 21.

Market Shares
One measure we use to monitor the commercial performance
of our businesses is market share. We aim to achieve a leading
position (usually number one or two) in the global markets in
which we operate. In Emission Control Technologies we
estimate we have a 31% share of the available market
(excluding in house manufacture by car companies) for light
duty catalysts. Our two major competitors have similar shares
with the remaining 5% of the market supplied by smaller
competitors (mainly in China). In the new market for heavy duty
diesel catalysts to original equipment manufacturers Johnson
Matthey is the market leader with a share in excess of 45%.
The market for sales of platinum group metals (pgms) to
end customers is more fragmented and precise shares are
more difficult to estimate. Johnson Matthey is the global market
leader. We are also the leader in fabricated pgm products for
the industrial market with a worldwide share of about a third.
In Process Technologies and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts
we sell a wide range of products into niche markets. Johnson
Matthey is the market leader in syngas catalysts used in the
manufacture of ammonia, methanol and hydrogen from
hydrocarbon feedstocks. We are also the leader in the available
market for catalysts used in pharmaceutical production.
Research and Development (R&D)
We monitor progress on all our R&D projects on a regular
basis against individual milestones. One measure of ultimate
success is the proportion of new products in our sales
launched in the last four years as a result of R&D activity. Most
of our R&D is concentrated in Environmental Technologies
Division.We estimate that about 70% of the division’s sales are
for products introduced in the last four years.
Employees
Our employees are our most valuable resource. We are
committed to recruiting high calibre employees and providing
them with the information, training and working environment
they need to perform at the highest standards. Johnson Matthey
has a relatively low voluntary staff turnover (7.6% in calendar
year 2007 compared with 7.5% in 2006) with many employees
staying with the company for the whole of their careers. More
details of the group’s training and employment policies are
given on page 33.
Health and Safety
We monitor health and safety performance very closely across
all our sites. We collect data on near misses as well as actual
accidents using an electronic AirsWeb system. Over the last five
years the rate of greater than three day accidents has reduced
from 9.1 per 1,000 employees to 2.7 per 1,000 in 2007/08.
Further KPIs relating to our health and safety performance are
set out on page 32 and in our Sustainability Report on the
company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Environment
Johnson Matthey is committed to running its business in a
sustainable way which includes minimising the impact of our
own activities on the environment. On pages 30 to 32 we set
out the company’s five year record for total acid gas emissions,
total global warming potential, energy consumption, water
consumption and total waste. Many of Johnson Matthey’s
products and technologies provide a significant positive benefit
to the environment and details of some these are described in
our Sustainability Report on the company’s website. For example,
the amount of pollutants removed from the atmosphere by the
company’s autocatalyst products since their introduction in
1974 now amounts to over four billion tonnes.

Group Finance Director
Financial Review
Introduction
Johnson Matthey achieved very good results in 2007/08, with revenue well ahead of last
year as a result of strong underlying volume growth and rising precious metal prices. Sales
excluding the value of precious metals increased by 20% with all three divisions achieving
good growth. Demand for catalysts was strong with expanding sales of diesel particulate
filters and a full year’s sales of heavy duty diesel (HDD) catalysts to original equipment
manufacturers in Europe and North America. The group also achieved strong growth in
Asia, particularly in China, both for emission control catalysts and process catalysts.
On 6th February 2008 we completed the acquisition of Argillon Group for €214 million.
Argillon is an international group specialising in catalysts and advanced ceramic materials,
with leading technology for the control of emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Within
its portfolio Argillon has non catalyst businesses manufacturing ceramic insulators and
alumina products which Johnson Matthey has offered for sale. Under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) these businesses are classified as “assets held for sale” and their
results shown in discontinued businesses below profit after tax in the income statement.
Also under IFRS we are required to capitalise certain intangible assets upon
acquisition such as the fair value of customer relationships, technology and trademarks
and then amortise their value through the income statement. In presenting the group’s
results we have focused on operating profit before amortisation of these “acquired
intangibles” which we believe provides a better guide to the underlying performance
of the group.

Sales
Revenue increased by 22% to £7.5 billion. Precious metal
prices grew strongly over the year which boosted sales in both
Environmental Technologies Division and Precious Metal
Products Division. Sales excluding the value of precious metals
rose by 20% to £1,750 million reflecting good underlying
volume growth and increased non precious metal material
costs, some of which are a pass through for Johnson Matthey.
Environmental Technologies Division grew its sales excluding
precious metals by 27% to £1,140 million. Emission Control
T echnologies (ECT) provided most of the growth with sales up
32%. Sales excluding precious metals of HDD catalysts to original
equipment manufacturers trebled to £159 million as new emission
standards applied for the full year. Sales of light duty products were
also well ahead with good growth in diesel particulate filters in
Europe and autocatalysts in Asia. Process Technologies had a
good year with sales excluding precious metals up 10%.
Precious Metal Products Division’s sales excluding precious
metals increased by 6% to £307 million with good growth in
the manufacturing businesses. Fine Chemicals & Catalysts sales
excluding precious metals increased by 13% to £303 million.
The division achieved good growth in Asia and sales were also
boosted by the high price of nickel.

Operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles divided by
sales excluding precious metals.
We measure return on sales as operating profit before
amortisation of acquired intangibles divided by sales excluding
precious metals. Return on sales for the group fell by 0.5% to
17.0% in 2007/08 as a result of increased material costs.
ECT’s return on sales has fallen in each of the last two
years as a result of the rapid growth in sales of new products,
particularly filters. The uncoated filter substrates are currently
very expensive. The price is agreed between the car company
and the substrate supplier and the cost is a pass through for
Johnson Matthey. Filter costs are now coming down and we
expect ECT’s return on sales to stabilise at current levels
despite continued growth in these new products.
Operating Profit
Operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles
rose by 16% to £296.8 million. Exchange translation was 
again adverse. The impact on individual divisions is shown 
in the table above.
Environmental Technologies Division had an excellent year
with operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles
up 20% at £147.3 million. Argillon, acquired in February 2008,
contributed £2.9 million of this profit growth. Excluding
acquisitions profits were 17% higher. ECT generated most of
the growth with profits up in all three regions. More details of
the division’s performance are set out on pages 15 to 17.
Precious Metal Products Division also had a strong year
with operating profit 20% up at £102.1 million. The division’s
marketing and distribution business benefited from the favourable
conditions in the platinum group metal (pgm) markets with the
average price of platinum rising by 20% in sterling terms. The
manufacturing businesses also had a good year. Precious Metal
Products Division’s results are set out on pages 18 and 19.
Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division achieved mid single
digit growth in operating profit, in line with volume growth in its
underlying markets, with profits 5% higher than last year (6% at
constant exchange rates) at £67.1 million. The division’s results
are set out in more detail on pages 20 and 21.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Exchange Rates
The main impact of exchange rate movements on the group’s
results comes from the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ profits
into sterling. Around a quarter of the group’s profits are made
in North America, mainly in the USA. The average rate for the
US dollar was $2.007/£ compared with $1.896/£ for 2006/07.
Each one cent change in the average rate for the dollar has just
under a £0.4 million effect on operating profit in a full year. The
fall of 11 cents in the average exchange rate for the dollar in
2007/08 reduced reported group operating profit by £4.1 million.
The South African rand also weakened, from R13.4/£ to R14.3/£.
However, the catalysts manufactured by our South African
business are ultimately for export and the benefit of a weaker
rand on margins more than offsets the translational effect.
Sterling weakened against a number of other currencies,
particularly the euro, which partly offset the translation loss on
the US dollar. Overall, excluding the rand, exchange translation
reduced group profits by £2.6 million compared with 2006/07.
Interest
The group’s net finance costs rose by £3.5 million to £30.3 million
as a result of higher average borrowings, partly offset by the
benefit of lower US dollar interest rates towards the end of
the year. Average borrowings were higher than last year when
net debt fell towards the end of the year following the sale
of Ceramics Division. In 2007/08 net debt increased by
£245.6 million with most of the rise occurring in February 2008
following the acquisition of Argillon Group. Interest rates for
short term US dollar borrowing fell towards the end of the
year as the US government tried to stimulate the US economy.
Profit before T ax
Profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangibles rose
by 16% to £265.4 million. After amortisation, profit before tax
was also 16% up at £262.3 million. Included in profit before tax
is a loss of £1.1 million in associates compared with a profit of
£0.9 million last year. This relates to AGR Matthey, the
Australian gold refining business in which the group has a 20%
stake, which is taking a restructuring charge to reduce the cost
base of its business.
Taxation
The group’s tax charge for the year was £77.2 million, an
increase of £12.5 million on 2006/07 reflecting the growth in
profit before tax and a slightly higher overall average tax rate.
The average tax rate for the continuing businesses was 29.4%,
an increase of 0.8% on last year. The increase in the rate partly
reflected higher taxable profits in countries where marginal tax
rates are above the group average, such as Japan and the USA.
Tax paid was £71.5 million which was below tax payable and
less than tax paid in 2006/07. The difference arises from timing of
tax payments. We are expecting tax paid to rise again in 2008/09.
Earnings per Share
Underlying earnings per share were 9% up at 89.5 pence. The sale
of the group’s Ceramics Division in February 2007 and a slightly
higher average tax rate have had the effect of slowing the growth
in earnings per share in 2007/08 compared with growth in profit
before tax. T otal earnings per share were 88.5 pence, 9% below
2006/07 which included the profit on sale of Ceramics Division.
Dividend
The board is recommending to shareholders a final dividend of
26.0 pence, making a total dividend for the year of 36.6 pence,
an increase of 9%, which is in line with the growth in underlying
earnings per share. The dividend would be covered 2.45 times
by underlying earnings per share.
Pensions
The surplus on the group’s UK pension schemes increased by
£19.6 million to £65.1 million on an IFRS basis at 31st March
2008. This increase was attributable to the rise in the discount
rate from 5.4% to 6.5% which reflected market rates applying
at 31st March 2008. Long term inflation expectations have also
risen, from 3.1% p.a. to 3.5% p.a., giving an increase in “real”
interest rates (i.e. inflation adjusted) from 2.3% to 3.0% which
has resulted in a reduction in the actuarial valuation of the
pension scheme’s liabilities under IFRS.
Worldwide, including provisions for the group’s
post-retirement healthcare schemes, the group had a net
surplus of £17.2 million on employee benefit obligations at
31st March 2008 compared with £0.9 million at 31st March 2007.
Return on Invested Capital
The group’s return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by
0.9% to 18.5%, despite high capital expenditure to support
future growth and the acquisition of Argillon in February 2008.
On a post tax basis the group’s return was 13.1% which is 5.1%
above our estimated cost of capital of 8%.
Our long run group target for ROIC on a pre-tax basis is
20% and we made good progress in 2007/08 towards that goal.
All our divisions were comfortably above our pre-tax cost of
capital of 11.3%. Precious Metal Products Division was also
ahead of the 20% target with a return of 54.3%. Environmental
Technologies Division’s and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts
Division’s ROICs were 15.2% and 13.9% respectively.

Cash Flow
Johnson Matthey had a net cash outflow of £239.0 million in
2007/08. After taking into account the impact of exchange
translation on foreign currency borrowings and debt acquired
with subsidiaries the group’s net debt increased by £245.6 million
to £610.4 million.
The group spent £159.9 million on acquisitions and disposals
in the year and a net £44.6 million on share buy-backs. Excluding
these items the group had a free cash outflow of £34.5 million.
This outflow was the result of major investments in the year
on capital expenditure and working capital to support the growth
of Environmental Technologies Division, particularly Emission
Control Technologies. In addition, working capital grew as a result
of the sharp rise in precious metal prices towards the end of the
financial year which affected both inventories and receivables.
In total, the cash outflow on working capital was £90.5 million,
although the ratio of working capital to revenue fell once again.

Environmental Technologies spent £105.8 million in 2007/08
with major investments in new capacity. Emission Control
Technologies completed three new factories in the year: in
South Korea; the Russian Federation; and Royston, UK. Two
new factories are now under construction in Macedonia and
Pennsylvania, USA to manufacture diesel catalysts. Additional
capacity is being installed in India, China and Japan. Process
Technologies is investing in additional capacity in Clitheroe, UK
to manufacture the latest generation of synthesis gas catalysts.
Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division increased its capital
expenditure in the year to 1.4 times depreciation with the
investment above depreciation focused on Catalysts and
Chemicals, where a new factory was completed in Shanghai,
China, and on Research Chemicals for a new facility in Germany.
Capital Structure
Johnson Matthey has excellent growth prospects in its major
markets. The board’s policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet
to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be
able to invest in future growth. We have a long term target
range for gearing (net debt / equity) of 50% to 60% although in
any given year gearing may fall outside this range depending on
future plans.
In February 2007 we sold Ceramics Division for £146.0
million. Gearing fell to 33.8% at the end of the 2006/07 financial
year. In the first half of 2007/08 the group purchased 2.4 million
shares into treasury for £39.1 million taking the total number of
shares acquired over two years to 6 million at a total cost of
£91.7 million (an average price of £15.28 a share). In 2007/08
a further £5.5 million was spent on purchasing shares for the
group’s employee share ownership trust (net of proceeds of
option exercises). On 10th December we announced we had
reached agreement to acquire Argillon Group for €214 million.
That acquisition took us over the 50% gearing threshold and
we suspended the share buy-back programme. With continued
heavy investment in capital expenditure and working capital, net
debt increased by £245.6 million to £610.4 million and gearing
rose to 52.6% at 31st March 2008. Despite the increased
investment, return on invested capital for the group improved.
In 2008/09 we plan to spend about 1.8 times depreciation
on capital expenditure, with further increases in working capital
likely to be needed to support sales growth. We are also
planning to sell the Insulators and Alumina businesses acquired
with Argillon and expect to reinvest the proceeds in further
bolt-on acquisitions.

following the receipt of the proceeds of sale of Ceramics
Division, we had only drawn £15.4 million under these facilities.
At 31st March 2008 drawings had risen to £230.7 million out
of total committed facilities of £ 310.0 million. To increase our
headroom we have recently agreed a further £100 million
long term loan facility from the European Investment Bank
which is provided to support the group’s investment in research
and development. 14 Johnson Matthey

Performance in 2007/08
Our new Environmental Technologies Division achieved strong
growth in the year. Revenue rose by 23% to £2,290 million;
sales excluding precious metals were 27% up at £1,140 million;
and underlying operating profit (before amortisation of acquired
intangibles) increased by 20% to £147.3 million. Translated at
constant exchange rates, sales excluding precious metals increased
by 29% and underlying operating profit was 21% higher.
Emission Control Technologies
Emission Control Technologies’ sales excluding precious metals
grew by 32% to £903 million. Sales of heavy duty diesel (HDD)
catalysts to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) accounted
for £105 million of the increase rising from £54 million in
2006/07 to £159 million in 2007/08. Sales of light duty products
were also well ahead with good growth in Asia and increasing
fitment of particulate filters on new diesel cars in Europe.
The acquisition of Argillon added £11.4 million to sales and
£2.9 million to operating profit before amortisation of acquired
intangibles in the last two months of the year. Profit growth was
stronger in the second half of the year than the first with the
division benefiting from improved efficiencies.
Return on sales (operating profit / sales excluding precious
metals) for ECT in 2007/08 was lower than in 2006/07 reflecting
the change in product mix with rapid growth in products using
expensive filter substrates (which are a pass through cost for
Johnson Matthey). The cost of substrates for these new products
is now beginning to come down. Going forward, ECT’s return
on sales is expected to stabilise at current levels despite the
continued growth in sales of new products. 16 Johnson Matthey
BUSINESS REVIEW
In Johnson Matthey’s financial year to 31st March 2008
global light duty vehicle sales increased by 4.5% to 70.0 million.
Production rose by 5.7% reflecting an overall increase in
inventories. Around half of the growth in production came in
Asia, which was 8.4% up on last year. Within Asia, sales grew by
20% in China and 12% in India. Other markets showing strong
growth include South America, Eastern Europe and Russia. ECT
is well represented in all these locations. Light duty vehicle sales
in North America were 3.9% down in our financial year.

We continue to see increasing demand from many of the
leading car companies in Europe for diesel particulate filters
(DPFs) to remove particulates from diesel exhaust emissions.
Although legislation requiring such emission control devices does
not come into full force in Europe until October 2010, most car
manufacturers have started to fit these devices earlier. Nearly
8 million diesel cars were sold in Western Europe last year of
which less than half were fitted with DPFs. Over the next two
and a half years the DPF market is set to double as all new diesel
cars will require fitment. In 2007/08 we constructed a new
factory in Royston, UK to manufacture catalysed DPFs, doubling
our existing capacity to meet the anticipated market growth.
During the year we also completed construction of a new
autocatalyst manufacturing facility in the Russian Federation. This
plant will produce catalysts to meet demand from both local
and global car manufacturers following the introduction of
emissions legislation requiring autocatalyst fitment in Russia in
the spring of 2006.
Our business in Asia continues to perform very well. Over
the next decade we expect that most of the growth in world car
production will take place in the Asian region. In 2007/08 we
achieved strong volume growth in China, India and Japan and our
operation in Malaysia also continued to perform well. Our new
plant in South Korea (our fifth in the Asian region) was opened in
February 2008. This new plant will manufacture catalysts for both
diesel and petrol powered vehicles and will carry out research
and development activities to support the rapidly growing Korean
motor industry. Further capacity expansions are planned for each
of our factories in China, India and Japan.
Despite continued weakness in the domestic car market,
our North American business achieved good growth in the
year with the introduction of new diesel products. Most of the
growth was for HDD products but light duty diesel catalyst
sales for pick up trucks also increased significantly.
We expect the value of the global market for HDD catalysts
to grow from an estimated US $700 million (excluding precious
metals) by the end of 2008 to approximately US $3 billion by
the end of 2014. New standards are scheduled to be introduced
in Europe in October 2009 and North America and Japan in
2010 which will require the use of additional catalysts. Legislation
is also planned in South Korea, China, India and Brazil. In 2011
legislation will start for non road vehicles in Europe and North
America. To meet this rapid growth in demand, and further
expansion in the light duty diesel market, Johnson Matthey is
constructing new factories in Macedonia and Pennsylvania, USA
which should be operational by the end of 2009.
The acquisition of Argillon in February 2008 adds valuable
technology to ECT’s existing emission control capabilities for
controlling oxides of nitrogen (NOx). As well as products for the
HDD truck market,Argillon manufactures catalysts for power
plants, industrial applications and waste incineration plants. These
products have application in coal fired power stations to reduce
harmful NOx emissions. This could become a major market in a
few years’ time as coal is increasingly used to produce electricity
and people around the world become more concerned about air

quality. The acquisition of Argillon also adds to ECT’s existing
business selling NOx control systems for large stationary engines
and in marine applications.
Process Technologies
Process T echnologies’ sales excluding precious metals grew by 10%.
The Ammonia, Methanol, Oil and Gas (AMOG) business was
well ahead of last year with continued strong demand for catalysts
and purification materials for industries where hydrogen or
synthesis gas are key intermediates. Demand for methanol
catalysts was strong and, with new capacity for methanol coming
on stream or under construction, the outlook for future growth
of catalyst sales continues to be encouraging. In China a significant
number of projects are based on utilising the country’s large
coal reserves and thereby reducing its reliance on expensive
imported oil.
The high price of oil is encouraging the use of more catalysts
for hydrogen production in oil refineries and increased sales of
purification materials to remove pollutants such as sulphur and
mercury. Sales of ammonia catalysts were also buoyant in 2007/08
with growth stimulated by significantly increased demand for
ammonia used in the production of fertiliser.
Davy Process Technology, which develops and licenses
chemical process technologies, had another good year. Major
licensing contracts included oxo alcohol projects in China and
India, a methylamine and choline chloride project in Thailand and
a methanol licence for a coal to methanol project in the USA.
Tracerco, Process Technologies’ oil services business, also
achieved good growth in the year, successfully integrating Quest
TruTec which was acquired in April 2006. The high oil price
continued to stimulate strong demand for Tracerco’s specialist
diagnostic services and equipment for oil production platforms
and refineries.
A major expansion programme is underway at our UK
factory in Clitheroe to manufacture the latest generation of
catalysts for AMOG. We are also continuing to invest heavily
in research and development on new products including novel
catalysts and technologies for converting gas and coal into
petrochemical intermediates and fuels.
Fuel Cells
The net expense of our Fuel Cells business continues to fall as
demand for its products grows. In 2007/08 the net expense fell
by £0.9 million to £6.4 million. The order book for its products
is strong and reflects an increasing range of applications as
customers start to commercialise niche fuel cell products. Sales
of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) grew over a broad
base to companies that are commercialising fuel cells using
hydrogen, methanol and natural gas as fuels.
Fuel cells fuelled directly by methanol (DMFC) sustained
the growth seen last year and the number of companies
supplying this type of technology also grew. Applications include
portable power supplies and battery rechargers that remove
the dependence of batteries on mains charging. This is useful
not only in areas remote from the grid but also in situations
when the time taken to recharge a battery offline affects
productivity.
During the year many automotive companies were publicly
robust in their view that hydrogen powered fuel cell cars were
the way forward and the California Authorities have confirmed
that the timescale for zero emission vehicle introduction is
unchanged. The combination of fuel cells with batteries that can
be recharged from the mains is attractive to car companies and
legislators alike.
In a significant development, the use of natural gas
powered fuel cells to provide combined heat and power to
commercial buildings has progressed well and we have seen
growth in sales of both catalysts and MEA components to this
sector this year. Interest in these products is supported by the
increasing concern over carbon dioxide emissions from
buildings and the sensitivity of developers and major companies
to this issue.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Description of the Business
Precious Metal Products Division is organised into five businesses:
Platinum Marketing and Distribution
The business consists of our worldwide platinum marketing and
distribution activities. Marketing is headquartered in Royston,
UK with support facilities in Philadelphia, USA and Hong Kong.
We are the world’s leading distributor of platinum group metals
(pgms) and the sole marketing agent for Anglo Platinum, the
world’s largest producer of platinum.
Noble Metals
Noble Metals produces a wide range of precious metal and
other fabricated products for industrial and medical applications.
Johnson Matthey is the market leader in pgm fabricated
products for industrial applications. Manufacturing takes place in
the UK and USA.
Pgm Refining and Recycling
Our Pgm Refining and Recycling business includes the recovery
of pgms from spent catalysts and other secondary materials and
refining primary pgms from global mining operations. We have
facilities in the UK and USA.
Colour Technologies
Headquartered in the Netherlands, our Colour Technologies
business manufactures black obscuration enamels and silver
conductive materials for automotive glass. It also makes colours,
enamels and decorative precious metal products for other glass
applications such as bottles and architectural glass as well as for
tableware and other ceramic applications. Manufacturing takes
place in the Netherlands, USA and South Korea.
Gold and Silver
Gold and Silver comprises our gold and silver refining and
bullion manufacturing operations. The business serves the
world’s mining industries and recycles secondary scrap material.
Gold and silver refining operations are located in the USA 
and Canada.
Key Statistics
Return on sales excluding precious metals 33.2%

Capital expenditure £12.0m
Capex / depreciation 0.9 times
Average invested capital £188m
Employees 1,959
Performance in 2007/08
Precious Metal Products Division’s revenue increased by 23%
to £4,688 million, boosted by higher prices for pgms. In sterling
terms the average price of platinum rose by 20%. Sales excluding
the value of precious metals were 6% up at £307 million with
good growth in the division’s manufacturing businesses.
Operating profit grew by 20% to £102.1 million. Translated at
constant exchange rates, sales excluding precious metals
increased by 7% and operating profit grew by 21%.
Platinum Marketing and Distribution
The Platinum Marketing and Distribution business achieved
strong profit growth in favourable market conditions. Global
demand for platinum in volume terms rose by 9% in the
calendar year 2007. Demand for platinum in autocatalysts also
increased by 9%, with much of the growth generated in Asia.
Heavy duty diesel emission control catalysts also contributed
additional demand. Off-take from jewellery manufacturers was
surprisingly resilient, only slightly down in the face of the rising
price of platinum, which encouraged de-stocking and recycling
of old jewellery.
The price of platinum was greatly influenced by supply side
concerns in 2007/08. The first nine months of the financial year
saw a steadily rising price supported by a series of production
problems in South Africa. In January 2008, the price began to
increase dramatically as power shortages threatened to severely
curtail South African platinum production. Platinum peaked at
an all time high of $2,276/oz in early March, averaging
$1,474/oz for the year. Supplies of platinum declined in 2007/08

due to these production problems in South Africa. The platinum
market was therefore in significant supply / demand deficit,
adding to the pressure on the price.
The palladium price also reached its peak in March 2008,
touching $588/oz. Although South Africa is only the world’s
second largest palladium producer, the bullish platinum
sentiment arising from production problems spilled over to its
sister metal. The average price for the year was $381/oz.
Physical demand for palladium rose by 4% in 2007.
Autocatalyst demand increased due to higher gasoline vehicle
production outside Europe. However, demand from Chinese
jewellery manufacturers fell after pipeline filling in previous
years. Palladium supply was higher than in 2006 due to an
increase in Russian sales, increasing the substantial surplus of
supply over demand.
The price of rhodium rose sharply in 2007/08, touching a
peak of $9,425/oz in March 2008. The average price increased
significantly for a third successive year to reach $6,753/oz.
Steady demand from the automotive and glass fabrication
industries left little metal to be offered in the spot market.
Supply showed a slight increase as South African producers
sold more metal from refined rhodium stocks, but this was
insufficient to eliminate a supply / demand deficit and relieve
pressure on a market which was already illiquid.
After the dramatic rise last year, the price of ruthenium
declined steadily in 2007/08 as demand from the electronics
industry for hard disk memory storage was met by adequate
supply and expanded recycling capacity.
Noble Metals
Johnson Matthey’s Noble Metals business had a very good year.
Our operations in the UK and USA both enjoyed good
demand for high quality wires and fabricated products. Sales of
catalyst gauzes for nitric acid production also grew. Sales to the
medical industry from our three sites in California were slightly
down as customers experienced lower demand. The market for
catalysts used in the abatement of nitrous oxide, a powerful
greenhouse gas produced as a by product in the manufacture
of nitric acid, has continued to develop. Early sales have been
made and we have developed a strong position in this market
which should generate good revenue growth in the future.
Pgm Refining and Recycling
Our Pgm Refining and Recycling business had another good
year assisted by higher pgm prices and increased intakes of
secondary material, especially autocatalyst scrap. Due to process
improvements and better utilisation of global refining capacities
the business delivered further reductions in the amount of pgms
held in the refining circuit. The business continues to work closely
with key customers to develop processes and refining services
that will support them in being successful in their markets.
Colour Technologies
Colour Technologies achieved further good growth in 2007/08.
The business maintained its reputation for innovation by
commercialising several new products during the year. These
included some highly chemically resistant obscuration enamels
for the automotive industry and a range of environmentally
friendly decorative enamels and porcelain colours. New
products for the fire retardant and photovoltaic markets also
achieved initial sales and these are expected to continue to
grow strongly in the near future.
Gold and Silver
On 4th May 2007 we sold our small Hong Kong gold refinery
to Metalor Technologies. The group’s remaining gold and silver
refining operations are now located in Salt Lake City, USA and
Brampton, Canada. These operations had a good year, benefiting
from the high gold and silver prices which stimulated good
flows of primary and secondary materials.

Key Statistics
Return on sales excluding precious metals 22.1%
Return on invested capital (ROIC) 13.9%
Capital expenditure £25.0m
Capex / depreciation 1.4 times
Average invested capital £483m
Employees 1,713
Performance in 2007/08
Our new Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division achieved good
growth in the year. Revenue increased by 13% to £521 million,
sales excluding precious metals rose by 13% to £303 million
and operating profit grew by 5% to £67.1 million. Translated
at constant exchange rates, sales excluding precious metals
increased by 15% and operating profit grew by 6%.
Return on sales (operating profit / sales excluding precious
metals) was below last year but still satisfactory at 22.1%. The
division achieved good growth in sales of nickel containing
catalysts, where the high price of nickel boosted sales value but
reduced the overall percentage return on sales.
The integration of the new division has gone well with a
number of initiatives to cross sell products and services as well
as to capitalise on the common, key competencies that run
across the division which should support future sales growth.
The majority of the speciality chemicals markets into which the
division sells continue to expand and most of the division’s
pharmaceutical industry customers are generic drug
manufacturers who are also currently enjoying good sales growth.
Catalysts and Chemicals
The Catalysts and Chemicals business performed well in the
year generating about 40% of the division’s sales excluding
precious metals. The business experienced strong growth in the
Asian region, notably in China, and in heterogeneous catalyst

sales in India, supporting the rapidly expanding pharmaceutical
industry there. We completed an expansion of capacity in
China for platinum chemicals and catalysts and we are investing
in a number of other new facilities: in China for manufacturing
sponge nickel catalysts for the local market; in India to provide
improved service levels; and also in Germany for catalyst
production.
Our facilities in Germany achieved good volume growth
with increased sales of catalysts used in the manufacture of
edible oils and chemical products. Our business developing
chiral ligands, which are used in highly specialised catalysts for
the pharmaceutical industry, also showed good growth from a
low base and offers good prospects for the future.
Macfarlan Smith
Macfarlan Smith’s sales of specialist opiates, particularly
oxycodone, showed good growth, more than offsetting a
decline in hydromorphone as a result of increased competition.
The world market for opiate drugs, which are primarily used to
treat pain, continues to grow. Use of these products increases
as the world’s population ages and health care improves in
developing economies. In addition growth is supported by the
introduction of new applications and new dosage forms,
particularly for specialist opiates, which enable broader, more
controlled use of these medications.
Pharmaceutical Materials and Services
In North America, the division’s Pharmaceutical Materials and
Services business achieved steady growth in revenue. Sales of
platinum based anticancer APIs were slightly below last year but
sales of opiate products showed good growth. Revenue from
contract research also continued to increase.
There is an opportunity for additional growth from the
launch of new products, including the agreed launch in April
2009 of Barr’s generic version of ADDERALL XR
®
. We expect
to see steady growth in sales of APIs for generic controlled
drugs, particularly those used in the treatment of pain which
is a growing market, and in speciality niches like prostaglandins.
Prostaglandin APIs manufactured by the business have been
used by customers in developing new generic products and
several of these are in the process of review for regulatory
approval.
Research Chemicals
Research Chemicals achieved good growth in the year with
increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia. The business
received a good contribution from its joint venture in China,
which started operation last year, achieving rapid growth from a
low base. With increasing demand for its products, the business
is investing in the expansion of facilities in India and Europe.
Research Chemicals’ main brand name is Alfa Aesar which
sells through a globally recognised catalogue. In January 2008,
Alfa Aesar launched the latest edition of the catalogue. The
catalogue includes 30,000 chemicals, metals and other materials
of which 3,000 were new compared with the last edition.
These new products included many novel fine organics, fuel cell
components, pure metals and catalyst / ligand kits. Under IFRS
the costs of preparing the catalogue are expensed when the
catalogue is issued to customers, although the catalogue itself
will last two to three years. This has the consequence of
reducing the business’ reported margins in the year of launch
and increasing them in the following years.

Research & Development
Research and development is an integral part of Johnson
Matthey’s high technology businesses. One of the group’s
strategies is to differentiate ourselves by using our world class
technology and we invest significantly in research and
development to develop new products and manufacturing
processes. In 2007/08 Johnson Matthey spent £73.0 million
gross on R&D.
We have a group technology centre located at Sonning
Common in the UK which is focused on longer term research
and has a worldwide reputation for excellence in catalysis and
precious metals technology. In addition we have important
research centres at Royston, Billingham and Stockton-on-Tees
in the UK located close to some of our major businesses.
Worldwide we have technical centres in many countries
including the US, Japan, Sweden and the Netherlands.
Johnson Matthey Technology Centre
The Johnson Matthey Technology Centre (JMTC) is the group’s
central resource for longer term research and employs over
180 world class scientists. It supports the research and
development of new products and technology across all of
Johnson Matthey’s businesses and has expertise in catalysis,
precious metals, materials science and many other fields in
which Johnson Matthey operates.
JMTC has state of the art facilities and resources for the
development and testing of catalysts as well as one of the most
advanced analytical science groups in the world, equipped with
the latest tools for materials characterisation.
Collaboration is important and JMTC works closely with
the group’s global network of business specific technology
centres and development groups. It also participates in external
collaborative research and development programmes
worldwide.
Many projects at JMTC are sponsored by the operating
divisions to meet their longer term objectives alongside which
run a number of core science projects to address the
fundamental science that lies at the heart of many of our
businesses. Our core science projects also address sustainability
issues such as energy efficiency, waste reduction, resource
thrifting and low carbon technology. These projects focus on
improving the sustainability performance of our own operations
and on developing the next generation of sustainable products
and technologies for our customers. Knowledge gained in the
core science programmes is used to accelerate and improve
product development across the group, reducing time to
market and improving our ability to design products to meet
customers’ needs.
Materials characterisation is a key component of all our
R&D programmes. We have state of the art facilities and unique
expertise in house as well as access to some of the world’s
most advanced equipment. These techniques provide us with
an insight into the structure of materials at an atomic level
which gives us the ability to relate the chemical structure of our
products to their performance. This provides knowledge and
information which is vital to the design and optimisation of new
and enhanced products for our customers.
Three examples of how this approach is being used to
deliver advanced new catalysts for the Environmental
Technologies Division are outlined below.
Fischer Tropsch Chemistry at the Nano Scale
Fischer Tropsch (FT) catalysis is a key step in gas to liquids
(GTL) processes and will be a key enabler in the conversion
of coal and biomass to liquid fuels. Although FT catalysis was
discovered nearly one hundred years ago, 21st century
applications will require the design of catalysts with specific
functionalities. Johnson Matthey has pioneered the use of
advanced characterisation techniques to examine the structure
of FT catalysts from micron scale catalyst particles right through
to individual atoms at the nano scale.
Using our in house expertise and working in collaboration
with world leading academic groups, Johnson Matthey has been
able to fully characterise FT catalysts at the nano scale. This
detailed understanding is enabling us to assist customers in the
design of advanced FT catalyst systems with specific functionalities,
tailored to their individual requirements.
Fuel Cell Catalyst Design
In fuel cell catalysts, the specific arrangement of surface and bulk
atoms holds the key to optimising catalytic activity and selectivity.
Determining the detailed structure of catalyst particles is
therefore fundamental to developing the optimum fuel cell
catalyst. Johnson Matthey has been working in collaboration
with a number of academic partners to study the arrangement
of atoms within individual fuel cell catalyst particles. Advanced
techniques such as solid state nuclear magnetic resonance and
x-ray absorption spectroscopy have been used to provide vital
information about the arrangement of atoms and their nearest
neighbours. In addition a specially designed fuel cell allows us to
characterise catalysts in situ under realistic operating conditions.
Scientific knowledge gained from these advanced techniques will
enable Johnson Matthey to design and manufacture optimum
fuel cell catalysts of the future.
Advanced Characterisation of Autocatalysts
Johnson Matthey’s Emission Control Technologies business
manufactures platinum group metal (pgm) containing catalyst
systems to remove harmful pollutants from automotive
exhausts. Catalysts must perform to meet legislated limits for
exhaust emissions but must also have the durability and
longevity to operate effectively under the harsh operating
conditions of a vehicle.
Understanding how and why these catalysts deactivate
over time is key to the manufacture of the next generation
of highly active, highly durable products. Deactivation of the
catalyst is usually due to a reduction in surface area of the
active metal species caused by particle size enlargement. At
JMTC we are using our characterisation expertise to examine
the sizes of pgm nanoparticles in autocatalysts and the routes
by which they intermix over time.
In our laboratories we subject catalysts to accelerated
ageing and use a range of advanced techniques to characterise
the aged materials. The data obtained enables us to examine
and understand how metal particles aggregate over time. This in
turn can be related to catalyst performance. Further developing
our understanding of the relationship between metal particle
aggregation and catalyst ageing enables us to design more
effective products for our customers. 24 Johnson Matthey
BUSINESS REVIEW
Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which
could have a material impact on the group’s long term
performance.
Technological Change and Patents
Much of the group’s business is focused on selling products
which are technologically advanced or employ technologically
advanced processes in their manufacture. In most cases these
products are subject to continuous improvement as new
technology is developed. The group is exposed to the risk that
if it does not keep up with changes in the market place its
products will no longer be competitive. This is both a threat
and an opportunity since Johnson Matthey can gain business as
well as lose it. The group’s strategy to meet this risk is to invest
significantly in research and development to maintain or achieve
leadership positions in those markets which offer sufficient
added value to justify the long term investment required.
The group’s results are also impacted by the status of
patents. These include patents which the group itself registers
and maintains, as well as the risks arising from new third party
patents and the benefits that arise from the expiry of third
party patents. All the group’s divisions have significant registered
intellectual property. The pharmaceutical materials businesses
supply active pharmaceutical ingredients to generic
manufacturers and can benefit when third party patents expire.
If actual patent lives differ from the expectations of the relevant
group business, such as by being extended or successfully
challenged, this can affect the group’s results. The group has
established policies both to monitor its existing patent portfolio
and those of third parties, taking appropriate action as
necessary in respect of infringement.
Legislation
Much of the stimulus for the development and growth of
Johnson Matthey’s products arises from new legislation
governing the environmental or health impact of its customers’
products in different jurisdictions worldwide. This is most
significant for Emission Control Technologies where historic and
future growth depends on global tightening of emissions limits
for on road and non road vehicles. Legislation is also relevant
for some of the group’s other businesses. Process Technologies
and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts manufacture products to
remove contaminants or to produce particularly pure
chemicals. Colour Technologies is supported by legislation
phasing out lead, cadmium and other heavy metals from glass
and ceramic glazes. The development of the fuel cells industry
is also impacted by clean air regulations and the drive towards
zero emissions within both local and national legislation.
Whilst the group has benefited considerably from the
development of such legislation its growth could be adversely
affected if the pace of legislative change slowed significantly.
Johnson Matthey monitors the development of legislation
globally and coordinates its development work to ensure it can
achieve greatest advantage from each new requirement. Regular
reviews are undertaken at the business and group level to
monitor growth and to investigate other areas of potential if
legislation slows.
Global, Political and Economic Conditions
Johnson Matthey operates in over 30 countries around the
world including several within Africa, Asia and Latin America.
While benefiting from the opportunities and growth in these
regions the group is exposed to the economic, political and
business risks associated with such international operations. The
group encounters different legal and regulatory requirements
including those for taxation, environmental, operational and
competitive matters. It is exposed to the effect of political risk
which can include sudden changes in regulations, expropriation
of assets, imposition of trade barriers and wage controls, limits
on the export of currency and volatility of prices, taxes and
currencies. The group is exposed to possible natural catastrophe
risk, for example through major earthquake or flood, and
possible terrorist action. Management monitor such risks,
maintaining adequate insurance cover and amending business
procedures as appropriate to mitigate any exposure while
remaining in compliance with local and group requirements.
Environmental Liabilities
The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual
and potential obligations on the group to remediate
contaminated sites, both those currently owned and, also in
some cases, those which have been sold. Johnson Matthey’s
environmental policies are set out on the company’s website at
www.matthey.com. The group incurs costs annually in meeting
these obligations and also maintains provisions for potential
liabilities. If existing provisions are inadequate to cover any
liabilities or the associated costs arising from environmental
obligations this could materially impact the group’s results.
Commercial Relationships
Johnson Matthey benefits from close commercial relationships
with a number of key customers and suppliers. The loss of any
of these key customers or suppliers, or a significant worsening
in commercial terms could have a material impact on the
group’s results.
Johnson Matthey devotes significant resources to
supporting these relationships to ensure they continue to
operate satisfactorily. From time to time the group undertakes
surveys of customer satisfaction which are reviewed by the
board. Some of the relationships are supported by long term
contracts, notably the group’s relationship with Anglo Platinum. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 25
Foreign Exchange
Johnson Matthey operates globally with the majority of the
group’s operating profit earned outside the UK. It has significant
investments outside the UK with the single largest investment
being in the USA. As such the group is exposed to movements
in exchange rates between sterling and other world currencies,
particularly the US dollar, which could adversely or positively
impact results. The group’s policies for managing its foreign
currency exposures are set out in more detail on pages 27
and 90.
Precious Metal Prices and Controls
A large proportion of the group’s activities involve managing
precious metals which have inherent risks associated with them
in addition to bringing valuable business opportunities.
While the group could be vulnerable to a global disruption
in the supply of platinum group metals, it has access to world
markets for these metals and is not dependent on any one
source for obtaining supplies for operations.
Precious metals have high prices which can fluctuate
significantly and this can have a material impact on Johnson
Matthey’s results. The group’s policies for managing this risk are
set out in more detail on page 27. The high value of precious
metals means that any process losses could be material and
there remains the possibility of theft or fraud. Johnson Matthey
has extensive experience in operating with precious metals and
employs strict security, assay and other process controls and
reviews to minimise any exposure. Policies are reviewed
regularly by the Chief Executive’s Committee and reported to
the Audit Committee.
Pensions
The group’s defined benefit pension funds are well funded with
a net surplus at 31st March 2008 of £46.1 million. However,
this position is exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates
and the market values of investments as well as inflation and
increasing longevity of the members. The assumptions used in
calculating the funding position of the pension funds are shown
in detail on pages 71 and 72. These risks are mitigated by
paying appropriate contributions into the funds and through
an investment asset allocation policy which has a high level of
probability of avoiding a material deficit based on the results
of an asset / liability matching study.
Customer Market Dynamics
The group sells products to manufacturers who in turn use
these products to serve a diverse range of end markets. The
group’s performance is therefore impacted by the dynamics of
its customers’ end markets and their performance within these
markets. A significant loss of market share at or by a major
automotive customer could negatively impact the group’s
results. The group also has exposure to the wider automotive
sector as a whole which is served by a number of the group’s
divisions. While global car production levels have some effect
on the sales of Johnson Matthey’s products, other factors such
as tightening emissions legislation and the increasing technical
demands from catalysts play a more significant role.
Risks are mitigated by monitoring both industry
developments and market share at customers to prevent the
group from becoming unduly dependent on any single customer.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Competitor Risk
The group operates in highly competitive markets. Significant
product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of
price competition could all adversely affect the group’s results.
Johnson Matthey invests significant resources in research and
development in order to ensure the introduction of both new
products and improved production processes to allow the
group to be at the forefront of its chosen markets. The group
also continually works to streamline its cost base to ensure it
remains competitive.
Litigation and Investigations
The group is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and
standards in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Failure to comply properly with these laws, regulations and
standards could significantly damage the reputation and
performance of Johnson Matthey.
Regular internal reviews are undertaken to assess
compliance with local and group policies, and provisions are
made to rectify or compensate for any breaches. In the
ordinary course of business, Johnson Matthey is subject to
inspections and monitoring by certain regulatory or
enforcement bodies and by the quality departments of some of
its major customers. If existing provisions are inadequate to
cover any liabilities arising from such investigations this could
materially impact the group’s results.
Energy and Raw Materials
The group’s products contain a broad array of raw materials
and its operations require significant levels of energy, notably
electricity and natural gas. Any increases or volatility in prices
and any significant decrease in the availability of energy or raw
materials could affect the group’s results. Johnson Matthey
coordinates its global purchasing activities to obtain the best
possible prices and uses hedging and other contractual means
where appropriate to minimise this risk and to benefit where
possible. The high price of oil also benefits the group by
stimulating demand for new catalysts and technologies supplied
by Process Technologies.
Credit Risk
The group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from
sales to major customers, particularly in Emission Control
Technologies. Sales to individual customers are frequently high if
the value of precious metals is included in the price. The failure
of any such company to honour its debts could materially
impact the group’s results.
Johnson Matthey derives significant benefit from trading
with its large customers and manages the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly
monitors its exposure. The Audit Committee receives a report
every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts
due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant
actions being taken. As at 31st March 2008, no single outstanding
balance exceeded 2% of the group’s market capitalisation.
Further details of the group’s credit control procedures are set
out on page 89.

Treasury Policies
Financial Risk Management and Treasury Policies
The group uses financial instruments, in particular forward
currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage the financial
risks associated with its underlying business activities and the
financing of those activities. The group does not undertake any
trading activity in financial instruments. Our treasury department
is run as a service centre rather than a profit centre.
Interest Rate Risk
At 31st March 2008 the group had net borrowings of
£610.4 million. Some 30% of this debt was at fixed rates with
an average interest rate of 5.20%. The remaining 70% of the
group’s net borrowings was funded on a floating rate basis.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.6% impact
on profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangibles.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
Liquidity
The group’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure that we
always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank
facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing
requirements. At 31st March 2008, the group had borrowings
under committed bank facilities of £230.7 million. Total
committed bank facilities amounted to £310.0 million of which
£79.3 million was undrawn at 31st March 2008. To increase our
headroom we have recently agreed a further £100 million long
term loan facility from the European Investment Bank. The
group also has a number of uncommitted facilities, including
metal leases, and overdraft lines at its disposal.
The “credit crunch” and continued turbulence in the
financial markets so far has had little direct impact on Johnson
Matthey. We do not invest in risky financial instruments or
financial derivatives and the group’s strong balance sheet and
financial performance mean that all the normal credit markets
are still open to us.
Foreign Currency Risk
Johnson Matthey’s operations are located in over 30 countries,
providing global coverage. The majority of its profits are earned
outside the UK. In order to protect the group’s sterling balance
sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most
of its investment in the USA, Europe, Japan and China by
borrowing US dollars, euros, yen and renminbi respectively.
Although an element of this funding is obtained by directly
borrowing the relevant currency, a large part is achieved
through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce
costs and credit exposure. The group uses forward exchange
contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on
forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies. Currency
options are occasionally used to hedge foreign exchange
exposures, usually when the forecast receipt or payment
amounts are uncertain. Details of the contracts outstanding
on 31st March 2008 are shown on pages 86 and 87.
Precious Metal Prices
Fluctuations in precious metal prices can have a significant
impact on Johnson Matthey’s financial results. Our policy for all
manufacturing businesses is to limit this exposure by hedging
against future price changes where such hedging can be done
at acceptable cost. The group does not take material exposures
on metal trading.
All the group’s stocks of gold and silver are fully hedged by
leasing or forward sales. Currently the majority of the group’s
platinum stocks are unhedged because of the lack of liquidity in
the platinum market.

BUSINESS REVIEW Annual Report & Accounts 2008 29
Sustainability
For a number of years, Johnson Matthey has adopted the principles
of corporate social responsibility (CSR), embedded these into its
risk management processes and reported on its performance in
this important area. In 2006/07 the Chief Executive launched an
initiative to broaden the company’s definition of these principles
to ensure a more sustainable business for the future.
Sustainability is fundamentally about the best long term way
to run a business. There is growing concern globally, including
among our employees, our customers, our communities and
others with whom we work closely, about the way countries,
companies and people are using the world’s resources. This is
affecting people now in many ways and our decisions and actions
today will affect future generations for a long time to come.
Work continued throughout 2007/08 and we have made
considerable progress in a number of areas. In the early part
of the year we considered the implications for sustainability
through discussions at the company’s management conference
and a series of high level seminars across the group which
sought to reach a consensus on how best to manage this
emerging topic. The conclusions stemming from this work were
reviewed and adopted by the Chief Executive’s Committee
(CEC) and gained the full support of the board.
One of the key conclusions is that sustainability should be
fully embedded into our routine management processes and
the CEC has agreed that this will apply from the 2008/09
budget year. It was also concluded that if we are to make solid
progress we need to further refine our measures of
performance, set more challenging targets and measure our
achievement against these targets.
In December 2007, the Chief Executive launched Johnson
Matthey’s Sustainability 2017 Vision to all employees which sets
out the group’s aspirations for the next ten years. The full
statement is available on the company’s website at
www.matthey.com and is presented in summary below:
• We are committed to the principles of sustainable
development and strive for outstanding resource efficiency
and carbon neutrality.
• We aim to further develop and enhance sustainability as a
core competence and key driver of competitiveness for
our business.
• We seek to encourage suppliers and customers to adopt
the values of sustainability which we uphold.
• We will apply our expertise to the development of a new
generation of sustainable products and services.
• We aim to more than double our earnings per share whilst
achieving zero waste to landfill and halving key resources
that we consume per unit output by 2017, our 200th
anniversary.
The Sustainability 2017 Vision encompasses the commitments,
aims and targets which will drive the business forward into its
third century of operation. For Johnson Matthey, there are two
key thrusts to the vision. The first is about being more efficient
with the resources we use as a business and the second is
about designing new products that help our customers to be
more sustainable and competitive. Some of the ways in which
we are working towards achieving the vision are presented in
summary in this report.
Sustainability is a challenging area for business but also
a very exciting one for Johnson Matthey. It presents an
opportunity to improve the efficiency of our offices, internal
operations and processes whilst also developing current and
future products and services to meet the sustainability needs of
our customers. There is a burgeoning market, in which we already
participate, for products which benefit the environment. There is
also a nascent market for a new generation of products which
enable the more efficient use of materials and other resources.
This represents a key opportunity for us. Our active participation
in this emerging area also helps us to identify and manage the
risks of sustainability.
Since the launch of the vision we have begun the process of
embedding sustainability into every aspect of our business. From
2008/09 all businesses will be required to include their plans for
sustainability as an integral part of the annual financial budgeting
process. These plans were presented and discussed with
management then agreed by the CEC at the budget discussions
in February 2008.
We have also begun an extensive training programme for
employees designed to help them put the Sustainability 2017
Vision into practice in their day-to-day work. The first session
was held in March and workshops will continue in 2008/09.
During the next year, businesses will be working towards
their plans and setting appropriate targets. We expect this
process to evolve over a number of years and will be working
very hard to refine our measures of performance so as to
monitor our progress against the business level targets and group
targets in the vision. Further work is aimed at developing the tools
of sustainability including those necessary to better estimate the
carbon intensity of our products and their complete life cycle.
We will continue to report on our plans, targets and
performance in this area. As in previous years we will publish
a separate more detailed report on-line during July 2008. This
year’s report will be our first Sustainability Report and will
provide more detail on our vision for 2017, what sustainability
means for us and how we will deliver this for our customers
and society through better products and fewer impacts.
Managing Improvement and Compliance
Johnson Matthey embraces a culture of continuous improvement
in all aspects of sustainability. Continuous improvement is driven
through corporate policies, a comprehensive management system
and the commitment of our employees. Johnson Matthey has
three key policy areas which provide the framework for the
management of environmental, social and governance matters:
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS); Employment; and Business
Integrity and Ethics.
Our ethical, social and environmental policies are well
established and over the last year further initiatives have been
undertaken to improve our operational performance in these
areas. Details of these policies, initiatives and our progress can
be found in Johnson Matthey’s Sustainability Report and are
presented here in summary. The full report can be found on
the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
As outlined in the Corporate Governance section (page 42)
the board has embedded environmental, social and governance
matters into its risk management processes and formally reviews
the area once a year. These matters are monitored by the CSR
Compliance Committee which is a sub committee of the CEC.
A description of the committee can be found on page 42. 30 Johnson Matthey
BUSINESS REVIEW
Stakeholder Engagement
Johnson Matthey undertakes a wide range of engagement
activities focused on communication with individuals and
organisations who are impacted by its operations or who may
impact on its business, both at corporate and divisional level.
These include shareholders, fund managers, employees,
customers, communities and national and international trade
associations. The company plays an active role within the
Chemical Industries Association (CIA) with representation on
the CIA Council and other strategy boards. Johnson Matthey
has also continued to play a leading advisory role through its
participation in a number of sector trade associations and
national and local government organisations. The company is
also actively involved more broadly with other international
trade and government bodies to inform the development of
policy in areas where Johnson Matthey’s technology and
products can play a pivotal role, for example in improving air
quality and enabling the shift towards more sustainable
consumption and production. Neil Carson, Chief Executive of
Johnson Matthey, chairs the UK government’s Business Taskforce
on Sustainable Consumption and Production and is a
prominent member of the Corporate Leaders Group which
has provided valuable suggestions to UK government and the
European Commission on climate change issues. A number of
the company’s senior management are involved in the UK
government’s sustainability and climate change initiatives.
In addition to our work with the UK government, last
October Neil Carson was invited to give testimony on Business
Opportunities in a Low Carbon Economy in the US House of
Representatives’ Select Committee on Energy Independence
and Global Warming. This was very well received and resulted
in a number of follow up questions from members of the
committee.
Further details of Johnson Matthey’s stakeholder
engagement activities can be found in the Sustainability Report
on the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Environment, Health and Safety
Environmental, Health and Safety Policy Statement
The Chief Executive’s Committee formulates and agrees a
written policy statement which forms the basis of the group
EHS management system. The board approves this policy
statement which is signed by the Chief Executive and is
available at each site throughout the group, as well as being
published externally. This policy is presented in full in the
Sustainability Report and on the company’s website at
www.matthey.com.
Environmental, Health and Safety Management
Johnson Matthey is firmly committed to managing its activities
throughout the group so as to provide the highest level of
protection to the environment and to safeguard the health and
safety of its employees, customers and the community. Our EHS
policies provide the guiding principles that ensure high standards
are achieved at all sites around the world and are used to
promote continuous improvement based on careful risk
assessment and a comprehensive EHS management system.
The group EHS management system is reviewed regularly
to ensure that it reflects international best practice and our
growing understanding of the practical application of sustainable
development.
The corporate objectives, policies and group EHS
management system define accountability and set the standards
against which conformance audits are assessed. This system is
available to all employees via the company intranet. All facilities
have developed local policies to meet the requirements of
these corporate policies.
EHS compliance audits are an integral part of Johnson
Matthey’s corporate EHS management system and are vital for
the achievement of continuous improvement in all aspects of
EHS. All Johnson Matthey operated manufacturing and research
and development facilities are included in the audit programme.
The audit frequency for each facility is determined by the
scale, inherent risk and past performance of the operation.

Audits review conformance with the group EHS management
system and compliance with national legislation, as well as
providing an opportunity to share best environmental, health
and safety practices.
The Group Occupational Physician undertakes business
health management reviews to provide consulting advice to
guide the prioritisation and planning of programmes to optimise
workplace health protection and promote workforce
sustainability. The final year of the three year programme to
implement a revised corporate health management strategy
throughout the business was completed successfully. All business
units now undertake annual health management continuous
improvement planning as a formal exercise to structure
appropriate programmes and services that meet changing
business needs.
All audit reports (including health management reviews)
are reviewed by the CSR Compliance Committee and
appropriate follow up is taken on any outstanding issues. A total
of 42 detailed compliance audits were completed in 2007/08.
Accidents and incidents are investigated to gain shared
learning and drive continuous EHS improvement. We also
monitor relevant events in our industry sectors to derive
additional learning and assurance that we are working to the
highest standards and best practices. Following the publication
of the investigation reports on the incidents at BP’s Texas City
refinery and at the Buncefield oil storage facility, we reviewed
these reports with a view to integrating any relevant learning
into our existing EHS management systems. The review
generated a number of actions that will be completed during
the next financial year.
ISO 14001
Over the past year continued progress has been made with the
implementation of ISO 14001, in line with our target of
achieving registration at all major manufacturing sites by 2010.
Three manufacturing sites, two in India and one in South Korea,
achieved ISO 14001 registration during the last year.
Regulation
The REACH regulation which introduces the new EU chemical
management framework is now in force and Johnson Matthey
has been preparing for its implementation since the final shape
of the legislation became clear several years ago. This included
establishing a centrally coordinated REACH compliance
programme covering all of our operating units and products
within the scope of the regulation. Key objectives of the
programme are to assure uninterrupted product flows to
customers and ensure our high rate of product innovation
is not affected. To avoid unnecessary testing and reduce the
cost and technical burden of compliance, the company is
collaborating with other industrial companies under the
auspices of key trade associations. Considerable effort has been
made to maintain dialogue and information flow throughout
the supply chain so that product and process materials and
their uses are well characterised. Individual Johnson Matthey
business units will be progressing substance pre-registration 
and registration actions in line with REACH timelines from 
June 2008 onwards.
The company has also commenced its preparation for the
anticipated widespread international rollout of the Globally
Harmonised System for hazard classification of chemicals.
Training
Training is vital to ensuring continuous improvement in
environmental, health and safety performance. A number of
seminars on high priority health and safety topics were
completed during the year across the group. A series of project
management training courses have been completed in the US
and Europe, in which facility managers and engineers were able
to gain greater understanding and share best practice on how
to improve the EHS aspects and impacts of significant
development projects. This training will be extended to Asia
during 2008/09.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Environmental, Health and Safety Performance
Johnson Matthey undertakes a comprehensive annual review of
group environmental performance covering all manufacturing
and research and development facilities. Where necessary, past
environmental data has been restated to reflect changes in the
business, for example divestments and site closure. The group
sold its Ceramics Division on 28th February 2007 and, as such,
the data presented in this Sustainability section excludes any
contribution from Ceramics Division.
All of the manufacturing facilities across the group made
progress against their individual environmental improvement
targets during the year and our five year performance is shown
in the tables on pages 30 to 32. The group’s total energy
consumption and total global warming potential reduced by 3%
and 2% respectively during the year. Relative to sales excluding
precious metals, both decreased by 24% compared to the
previous year. Total emissions of acid gas (primarily oxides of
nitrogen, NOx) reduced by 8% in absolute terms and by 28%
relative to sales excluding precious metals. The total amount
of waste generated during the year increased by 8% across
the group although relative to sales excluding precious metals,
waste generated decreased by 16%. During the year, water
consumption for the group increased by 7% as a direct result
of increased production by our Emission Control Technologies
business.When calculated relative to sales excluding precious
metals, water consumption reduced by 17% across the group.
There is a group reporting system to record and investigate
occupational illness incidents arising as a result of exposure to
workplace health hazards. An overall reduction of more than
25% has been achieved in the annual incidence of occupational
illnesses since the reporting scheme was introduced in 2005.
Accidents are actively monitored and detailed statistics are
compiled monthly at group level. In April 2006 the CEC set a
new group target of zero greater than three day accidents.
Our safety performance has improved during the past year
with the incidence of greater than three day accidents at Johnson
Matthey calculated as 2.65 per 1,000 employees in March 2008,
a reduction of 39% from 4.38 reported in March 2007. The total
number of accidents that resulted in lost time was 68, an 11%
reduction compared to the previous year (76, restated). During
the same time period, the total accident rate reduced by 8%
from 8.77 to 8.05 per 1,000 employees per year.
In 2007/08 the number of days lost per 1,000 employees
per year was 68, a reduction of 12% compared with 2006/07.
All accidents were thoroughly investigated to determine root
causes and assign appropriate preventative and corrective actions.
On 27th July 2007 Avocado Research Chemicals Limited,
a subsidiary of the company, was fined £600 and ordered to
pay £100 costs after pleading guilty at the City of London
Magistrates’ Court to the unlawful exportation of a controlled
chemical substance. Following the incident, the business has
improved its automated ordering system and recruited a
dangerous goods compliance specialist to prevent recurrence.
Environmental, Health and Safety T argets
Johnson Matthey continually monitors environmental, health
and safety performance in order to identify those issues most
pertinent to the business and to drive improvement.
Sustaining the continued reduction in the incidence of
occupational illnesses, particularly those attributable to exposure
to chemical hazards, remains the highest priority health
protection issue for the business. Each business is now also
addressing the development of health and wellness programmes
to secure and enhance the longer term health, wellbeing and
work ability of employees, as part of the people and communities
element of the new corporate sustainability strategy.
All sites within the group will aim to continue to make
progress against the target of zero greater than three day
accidents. Leading and lagging indicators are now an integral
component of site improvement plans in order to better
monitor performance against these improvement conditions.
We will continue our process risk management review of
Johnson Matthey facilities and analyse our results in conjunction
with external experts to ensure that the policies, guidance and

We will complete new environmental, health and safety
guidance to support the existing policies within the group EHS
management system. This guidance will be issued to all sites and
appropriate training will follow.
Human Capital Management
Johnson Matthey’s people are the group’s most valuable
resource.We are committed to recruiting high calibre
employees and providing them with the information, training
and working environment they need in order to perform at the
highest standards. We encourage all our employees to develop
to their maximum potential and we are committed to
supporting them with effective human resources policies and
practices that are strategically linked to the needs of our
business and our customers.
Implementation of Johnson Matthey Human Resources Policies
Johnson Matthey’s human resources policies are implemented
through the corporate human resources standards which set
requirements for operations throughout the group to follow.
These standards, which are generally in advance of legal
requirements, provide internal consistency and are supported
either by detailed regional procedures and / or business unit
procedures. All of these policies and procedures are subject
to regular review to ensure that they continue to reflect both
regional best practice and local legislation. Site specific human
resources policies and procedures are communicated to staff
at inductions and through staff handbooks. Human resources
policies and risks are examined by the Chief Executive’s
Committee and the CSR Compliance Committee.
Key Employment Policies
Equal Opportunities
It is the policy of the group to recruit, train and develop
employees who meet the requirements of the job, regardless of
gender, ethnic origin, age, religion, sexual orientation or disability.
The policy recognises that people with disabilities are often
denied a fair chance at work because of misconceptions about
their capabilities and seeks to enhance the opportunities
available by attempting wherever possible to overcome obstacles,
such as the need to modify equipment, restructure jobs or to
improve access to premises, provided such action does not
compromise health and safety standards. Equally, employees who
become disabled are offered employment consistent with their
capabilities. The business values the diversity of its people and
employment applications are welcomed and encouraged from
all sections of the community including minority groups.
Training and Development of People
The Management Development and Remuneration Committee
of the board takes a special interest in ensuring compliance with
the Training and Development of People Policy objectives to:
• Ensure highest standards in the recruitment of employees.
• Assess training needs in the light of job requirements.
• Ensure relevance of training and link with business goals.
• Employ and evaluate effective and efficient training methods.
• Promote from within, from high potential pools of talent.
• Understand employees’ aspirations.
• Provide development opportunities to meet employees’
potential and aspirations.
Johnson Matthey recognises the need to maintain its ability
to recruit well qualified staff to support the development of the
business in new and emerging markets. This challenge will be
met through appropriate manpower planning, local recruitment
and the encouragement of international mobility.
Cross divisional management development activities are
coordinated worldwide to ensure longer term management
succession and the retention of high potential employees.
Included are programmes providing key skills, interactive learning
and Johnson Matthey business awareness at career foundation,
middle and senior manager levels. These are delivered at Johnson
Matthey facilities throughout Europe, the USA and Asia to meet
current and future management requirements worldwide and
are being extended in number and variety to meet the growing
needs of the business. Presentations from senior executives
anchor these programmes to the company’s progress and
priorities and align attendees with our strategic intent.
A continuing high level of attendance by employees from
Asia, particularly from our operations in Japan, China, Korea
and India, reflects the increasing importance of this region.
Attendance from acquired businesses is also encouraged as a
well proven way of exposing individuals to the wider company
culture and assisting rapid integration with the rest of the group.
Johnson Matthey has a steady requirement for high calibre
graduate recruits to meet immediate technical and commercial
job needs and for development to meet future management
requirements. The combination of direct scientific contact with
key university departments and a streamlined recruitment
procedure ensures a reliable supply of high calibre applicants
worldwide. A variety of career foundation training, including a
new technology awareness programme, quickly engages new
recruits in intellectual challenge and early responsibility.
Employee Relations and Communication
The quality of its employee relationships is a priority for Johnson
Matthey. The company has a low voluntary staff turnover (7.6%
in the calendar year 2007, see page 9) with many employees
staying with the company for their whole careers.
Johnson Matthey recognises the importance of effective
employee communications and particularly the value of face
to face dialogue. Information and comment is exchanged with
employees through the company’s in house magazine, regular
news bulletins, presentations to staff and team briefings.
Employees are also encouraged to access the company’s
intranet and website.
Johnson Matthey continues to maintain good and
constructive relations with all recognised trade unions which
collectively represent 34% of all group employees worldwide.
From 12th to 25th September 2007, production was affected 
at the company’s emission control catalyst plant in Germiston,
South Africa by a 14 day national strike in the components
industry, led by NUMSA (National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa). Other than this event no working time was lost
within the group due to employee action. 34 Johnson Matthey
BUSINESS REVIEW
The company supports employee share ownership and
where practicable offers employees the opportunity to
participate in share ownership plans which provide the facility
to purchase company shares with a company funded matching
component. Employees in six countries worldwide are able to
contribute to a company share ownership plan or a 401k
approved savings investment plan. Through these ownership
plans Johnson Matthey current and former employees collectively
held 1.55% of the company’s shares at 31st March 2008.
Johnson Matthey also sponsors pension plans for
employees of its operations throughout the world. These
pension plans are a mixture of defined benefit or defined
contribution pension arrangements, savings schemes and
provident funds designed to provide appropriate retirement
benefits based on local laws, custom and market practice.
Activities over the Last Year
There have been a number of key initiatives at Johnson Matthey
sites during the past year with a strong emphasis on sustainability,
employee recognition, people development and wellbeing.
Improvements to employee communications and engagement
have continued to focus on the use of site satisfaction and
attitude surveys as a means of strengthening and enhancing the
two way dialogue with employees. Based on the success of a
pilot survey, during the year a decision was taken to run a global
employee attitude survey within each of the group’s operating
divisions on a rotational basis. The first global business to run the
survey will be Emission Control Technologies. It will be conducted
during the summer of 2008 using a confidential and independent
survey administrator and a combination of web hosted and
paper survey questionnaires. The results of the survey will be
published and it is hoped that its findings will help to identify
issues for action and guide management to build the optimum
working environment for employees.
Cross divisional movement of employees as part of their
career development is encouraged and monitored as an
important part of the annual management development and
succession planning review process. The further development
of the management skills inventory database provides the group
with a powerful means of helping to identify and match suitably
qualified internal candidates to promotional and development
opportunities both cross divisionally and globally.
Continuing priority is given to manager and employee
understanding of Johnson Matthey’s policies and commitment
to their implementation to maintain and enhance the reputation
of the company. Appropriate compliance training for managers
in their responsibilities for employees, commercial contracts and
company assets has been maintained during the year through
on-line learning programmes and seminars where appropriate.
The reduction in sickness absence rates across the business
over the last three years has been sustained in the past year
through continued focus on attendance management and
rehabilitation support programmes. There has also been an
increased investment in programmes to improve employee
health and wellbeing and promote attendance and work
performance.
Going forward, the commitment of Johnson Matthey’s
employees will be key in delivering our Sustainability 2017
Vision. During the year we have commenced a global
programme of employee engagement activities and
management seminars to enhance employees’ understanding,
promote local action and spread best practice across the group.
This will continue in 2008/09 to support our employees in
working towards achieving the vision.
Social and Ethical Matters
Business Integrity and Ethics
A reputation for integrity has been a cornerstone of Johnson
Matthey’s business since Percival Norton Johnson founded it
in 1817. It gives customers the confidence that the company’s
products meet the standards claimed for them and that they
may safely entrust their own precious metals to Johnson
Matthey for processing and safe keeping. Employees at all
levels are required to protect Johnson Matthey’s reputation
for integrity.

The company strives to maintain the highest standards of
ethical conduct and corporate responsibility worldwide. All
employees have a duty to follow the principles set out in
Johnson Matthey’s Business Integrity and Ethics Policy Statement
which is presented here in summary and available in full on our
website at www.matthey.com. It is the responsibility of directors
and senior management to ensure that all employees who
directly or indirectly report to them are fully aware of Johnson
Matthey’s policies and values in the conduct of the company’s
businesses. It is also the responsibility of directors and senior
management to lead by example and to demonstrate the
highest standards of integrity in carrying out their duties on
behalf of the company. These issues are further safeguarded
through corporate governance processes and monitoring by
the board and sub-committees of the board.
Johnson Matthey facilities have established policies and
procedures through which employees can raise employment
related issues for meaningful consideration and resolution. In
the US a confidential and secure website and telephone
helpline was established in 2006 to give employees an
additional means to raise any issue of personal concern. These
confidential reporting arrangements have been extended to all
Johnson Matthey employees worldwide during 2007.
Supply Chain
Management of the supply chain and contractor activities is a
core component of the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 series of
standards. Supply chain and contractor management
questionnaires are a requirement of achieving and maintaining
registration and as such, ISO registered Johnson Matthey sites
require the completion of appropriate questionnaires. For those
sites without ISO registration, the group EHS management
system provides policy and guidance on both supply chain
management and contractor control.
Whilst we are confident of the human rights performance
of our own operations we recognise that business practices in
the supply chain are not always transparent and represent a risk
that must be managed. We support the principles defined
within the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the International Labour Organisation Core
Conventions including the conventions in relation to child
labour, forced labour, non-discrimination, freedom of association
and collective bargaining.
Community Engagement Activities
Johnson Matthey is actively involved in programmes worldwide
that promote good community relations to foster a relationship
of understanding, trust and credibility. Guidance on site
requirements is detailed in the group EHS management system.
An annual review of community engagement activities
across the group has been carried out and shows that 100%
of Johnson Matthey operations with over 50 employees
participate in activities within their local communities. These
activities are wide ranging and include charitable giving, support
for educational projects, the advancement of science and
economic regeneration projects. Johnson Matthey employees
also participate in activities or hold community related roles
outside of the work environment. The company is supportive
of this broader community engagement, allowing employees
time off during working hours as appropriate. The review also
demonstrates that a higher proportion of sites are setting
objectives for their community engagement activities and
planning specific activities in their community programmes.
Sustainability issues are also important to the communities
in which Johnson Matthey operates. As such, businesses are
encouraged to integrate community elements into their
sustainability plans for the coming year. We will continue to
offer further support to sites in developing and implementing
meaningful community programmes and facilitate the sharing
of best practice across the group. A review of site community
engagement activities will be conducted once again and we will
continue to focus on how best to measure and improve the
impact of our community involvement.
Charitable Programmes
Johnson Matthey’s long history of support for charitable causes
is matched today through programmes at both a group and a
business unit level. The causes supported are aligned to issues
to which the Johnson Matthey business makes a contribution
and issues on which employees are passionate.
In 2007/08, Johnson Matthey supported 36 charitable
causes through its corporate annual donations programme.
These included support for organisations working in the areas
of arts and the environment, medical and health, science and
education and social welfare. 50% of these corporate donations
were in support of social welfare causes. A total of 78
additional charitable causes received one-off donations through
the corporate programme during the year.
In the UK, Johnson Matthey continues to operate its
annual charity of the year programme and employee views
are considered when deciding on the charity. EveryChild was
chosen as our charity of the year for 2007/08 and further
details on the partnership are available in the Sustainability
Report. Johnson Matthey sites around the world also lend
support to many other charities locally and nationally through
donations, employee time or loans of company facilities.
In the financial year to 31st March 2008 Johnson Matthey
donated £415,000 to charitable organisations. This figure only
includes donations made by Johnson Matthey and does not
include payroll giving, donations made by staff or employee
time. The company made no political donations in the year.
We will continue to support a wide range of charitable
causes in 2008/09. In particular we are developing a specific
programme of support focused on promoting the understanding
and awareness of science among children and young people.
Johnson Matthey believes that encouraging the next generation
of scientists is very important to the sustainability of our industry
and we will continue to contribute our resources and expertise.
Verification
The board, Audit Committee, Chief Executive’s Committee and
CSR Compliance Committee review sustainability issues as part
of the company’s risk management processes. The board
believes that the internal measures taken to review the
sustainability information provide a high level of confidence.
However, for the first time, third party verification of our full
Sustainability Report has been commissioned. The full
Sustainability Report will be published on the company’s
website at www.matthey.com in July 2008. 36 Johnson Matthey

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The directors submit to shareholders their one hundred and
seventeenth Annual Report, together with the audited accounts of
the group for the year ended 31st March 2008.
Principal Activities
A review of the group’s principal activities and an indication of likely
future developments for the company and its subsidiaries are set
out on pages 5 to 21 and a description of the group’s activities in
research and development can be found on page 23, both of which
are incorporated into this directors’ report by reference.
Business Review
The company is required to set out in this report a fair review of the
business of the group during the financial year ended 31st March
2008 and of the position of the group at the end of that financial
year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing
the group, consistent with the size and complexity of the business
(known as a ‘Business Review’). The Business Review is set out on
pages 6 to 35.
Dividends
The interim dividend of 10.6 pence per share (2007 9.9 pence) was
paid in February 2008. The directors recommend a final dividend of
26.0 pence per share in respect of the year ended 31st March 2008
(2007 23.7 pence), making a total for the year of 36.6 pence per share
(2007 33.6 pence), payable on 5th August 2008 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 13th June 2008.
A Dividend Reinvestment Plan is in place which allows shareholders
to purchase additional shares in the company with their dividend
payment. Further information and a mandate can be obtained from
the company’s registrars, Equiniti, whose details are set out on
page 109.
Share Capital 
As at 31st March 2008, the company’s authorised share capital was
£291,550,000 divided into 291,550,000 ordinary shares of £1.00
each. The issued share capital of the company at 31st March 2008
was 214,675,736 ordinary shares of £1.00 each, excluding
5,997,877 shares held as treasury shares.
During the year 196,330 ordinary shares of £1.00 each were allotted
pursuant to the exercise of executive share options. 
At the 2007 annual general meeting (AGM), shareholders renewed
the company’s authority to make market purchases of up to
21,707,361 ordinary shares (representing 10% of the issued share
capital of the company (excluding treasury shares) as at 31st May
2007).
During the year the company purchased 2,397,877 of its own
ordinary shares of £1 each (representing 1.1% of the called-up
share capital of the company as at 31st March 2008) for an
aggregate consideration of £39.1 million. All such purchases were
made on-market and all of the purchased shares are held by the
company as treasury shares. Authority to purchase up to
19,309,484 shares remained in place at 31st March 2008. At the
forthcoming AGM the board will again seek shareholders’ approval
to renew the annual authority for the company to make purchases
of its own shares through the market.
Rights and Obligations Attaching to Shares
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when
declared, the company’s report and accounts, to attend and speak
at general meetings of the company, to appoint proxies and to
exercise voting rights.
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of
ordinary shares and no requirements to obtain prior approval to any
transfers except where the company has exercised its right to
suspend their voting rights, withhold a dividend or prohibit their
transfer following the failure by the member or any other person
appearing to be interested in the shares to provide the company
with information requested under section 793 of the Companies Act
2006. The directors may, in certain circumstances, also refuse to
register the transfer of a share in certificated form which is not fully
paid up, where the instrument of transfer does not comply with the
requirements of the Articles of Association, or if entitled to do so
under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. No ordinary
shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the
company and there are no restrictions on voting rights except that
a shareholder has no right to vote in respect of a share unless all
sums due in respect of that share are fully paid. There are no known
agreements between holders of securities that may result in
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights and no
known arrangements under which financial rights are held by a
person other than the holder of the shares.
Shares acquired by employees through the Johnson Matthey
employee share schemes rank equally with the other shares in issue
and have no special rights. 
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the 2008 AGM of the company to be held on Tuesday
22nd July 2008 at 11.00 am at The Institution of Engineering and
Technology (The Lecture Theatre), 2 Savoy Place, London, WC2R 0BL

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
The Articles of Association provide that the number of directors is
not subject to any maximum but must not be less than six, unless
otherwise determined by the company by ordinary resolution.
Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the
members or by a resolution of the directors. A director appointed by
the directors must retire at the next following AGM and is not taken
into account in determining the directors who are to retire by
rotation at the meeting.
At every AGM at least one third of directors must retire by rotation.
The directors to retire by rotation must include any director who has
not been subject to election or re-election at the time of the two
preceding AGMs, and (if so required to constitute one third of
directors) those directors who have been longest in office since their
last appointment or re-appointment. 
A director may be removed by an extraordinary resolution of the
company. In addition, a director must automatically cease to be a
director if (i) he ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of
the Companies Acts or he becomes prohibited by law from being a
director, or (ii) he becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or
composition with his creditors generally, or (iii) he is suffering from a
mental disorder, or (iv) he resigns from his office by notice in writing
to the company, or in the case of an executive director, his
appointment is terminated or expires and the directors resolve that
his office be vacated, or (v) he is absent for more than six
consecutive months without permission of the directors from
meetings of the directors and the directors resolve that his office be
vacated or (vi) he is requested in writing, or by electronic form, by all
the other directors to resign.
Powers of the Directors
The powers of the directors are determined by the company’s
Memorandum and Articles of Association, the Companies Act 1985
and Companies Act 2006 and any directions given by the company
in general meeting. The directors have been authorised by the
Articles of Association to issue and allot ordinary shares and to
make market purchases of shares. These powers are referred to
shareholders at the AGM for renewal. Any shares purchased may be
cancelled or held as treasury shares.
Directors’ Interests
Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and interests in
the shares of the company are set out in the Remuneration Report
on pages 45 to 51.
Other than service contracts, no director had any interest in any
material contract with any group company at any time during the year.

Change of Control
The company and its subsidiaries are party to a number of
commercial agreements that may allow the counterparties to alter or
terminate the arrangements on a change of control of the company
following a takeover bid. Other than the matters referred to below,
these are not deemed by the company to be significant in terms of
their potential effect on the group as a whole. 
The group has a number of loan notes and borrowing facilities 
which may require prepayment of principal and payment of accrued
interest and breakage costs if there is change in control of the
company. The group has also entered into a series of financial
instruments to hedge its currency, interest rate and commodity
exposures which provide for termination or alteration if a change 
of control of the company materially weakens the creditworthiness
of the group. 
The company is party to a marketing agreement with a subsidiary 
of Anglo Platinum Limited, originally entered into in 1992, under
which the company was appointed as sales and marketing agent 
for refined platinum group metals worldwide excluding the US and
the company agreed to provide certain marketing services. The
agreement contains provisions under which the counterparty may
have the right to terminate the agreement on a change of control of
the company. 
The rules of the company’s employee share schemes set out the
consequences of a change of control of the company on
participants’ rights under the schemes. Generally such rights will
vest and become exercisable on a change of control subject to the
satisfaction of relevant performance conditions.
The executive directors’ service contracts each contain a provision
to the effect that if the contract is terminated by the company within
one year after a change of control of the company, the company will
pay to the director as liquidated damages an amount equivalent to
one year’s gross basic salary and other contractual benefits less the
period of any notice given by the company to the director.
Disabled Persons
Details of the company’s policy relating to the employment and
training of disabled persons can be found on page 33.
Use of Financial Instruments
Information on the company’s financial risk management and
policies and its exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and
cash flow risk can be found on pages 87 to 91.
Employee Involvement
Information on the action taken by the company during the year
relating to employee involvement can be found on pages 29 to 35.
Policy on Payment of Commercial Debts
The group’s policy in relation to the payment of all suppliers (set out
in its Group Control Manual, which is distributed to all group
operations) is that payment should be made within the credit terms
agreed with the supplier, subject to the supplier having performed its
obligations under the relevant contract. At 31st March 2008, the
company’s aggregate level of ‘creditor days’ amounted to 5 days.
Creditor days are calculated by dividing the aggregate of the
amounts which were outstanding as trade payables at the end of
the year by the aggregate of the amounts the company was
invoiced by suppliers during the year and multiplying by 365 to
express the ratio as a number of days.
Charitable Donations
During the year the group donated £415,000 (2007 £330,000) to
charitable organisations worldwide, of which £264,000 (2007 £259,000)
was in the UK. 40 Johnson Matthey
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
The company has applied all of the principles set out in section 1 of
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) relating
to the structure and composition of the board, the remuneration of
the directors, relations with shareholders and procedures for
financial reporting, internal control and audit. This statement
describes how the principles of the Code have been applied.
The group was in compliance with the provisions of the Code
throughout the year except that the board has taken the view that it
is not necessarily practical, efficient or desired by shareholders for
the Senior Independent Director to attend meetings with major
shareholders in order to learn their issues and concerns unless such
discussions are requested by shareholders. The methods by which
major shareholders’ views are communicated to the board as a
whole are discussed under ‘Relations with Shareholders’ on pages
41 and 42.
Directors and the Board
The board is responsible to the company’s shareholders for the
group’s system of corporate governance, its strategic objectives and
the stewardship of the company’s resources and is ultimately
responsible for social, environmental and ethical matters. The board
held seven meetings in the year and in addition met separately to
review the group’s long term strategy. The board delegates specific
responsibilities to board committees, as described below. The board
reviews the key activities of the business and receives papers and
presentations to enable it to do so effectively. The Company
Secretary is responsible to the board, and is available to individual
directors, in respect of board procedures.
The board comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, four other
executive directors and five independent non-executive directors.
Mr N A P Carson is the Chief Executive. Sir John Banham is the
Chairman. Sir John’s other commitments are disclosed on page 36.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate. The
Chairman leads the board, ensuring that each director, particularly
each non-executive director, is able to make an effective contribution.
He monitors, with assistance from the Company Secretary, the
information distributed to the board to ensure that it is sufficient,
accurate, timely and clear. The Chief Executive maintains day-to-day
management responsibility for the company’s operations, implementing
group strategies and policies agreed by the board. 
The role of non-executive directors is to enhance independence and
objectivity of the board’s deliberations and decisions. Mr M J Roney
and Mrs D C Thompson joined the board as non-executive directors
on 1st June 2007 and 1st September 2007 respectively. Mr C D
Mackay and Mr M B Dearden both retired from the board on 
31st March 2008. Mr C D Mackay was the Senior Independent
Director until his retirement from the board. He has been succeeded
in this role by Mr A M Thomson with effect from 1st April 2008. All
non-executive directors are independent of management and free
from any business or other relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment. The
executive directors have specific responsibilities, which are detailed
on pages 36 and 37, and have direct responsibility for all operations
and activities.
Charitable Donations (continued)
Further details of contributions made by the group worldwide are
given on page 35 and in the Sustainability Report which can be
found on the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Political Donations and Expenditure
It is the policy of the group not to make political donations. During
the year to 31st March 2008, no donations were made to EU
political organisations (2007 £ nil), no EU political expenditure was
incurred (2007 £ nil) and no contributions to political parties outside
the EU were made within the meaning of Part XA of the Companies
Act 1985 or Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (2007 £ nil).
Directors’ Indemnities
The company has granted indemnities in favour of directors under
Deed Polls. These provisions were in force during the year ended
31st March 2008 and remain in force as at the date of this report.
Copies of the Deed Polls and the company’s Articles of Association
are available for inspection during normal business hours at the
company’s registered office and will be available for inspection at
the AGM.
Going Concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has
sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future and have, therefore, adopted the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Corporate Governance and Remuneration
The board’s statement on corporate governance matters is given on
pages 40 to 42 and its report on directors’ remuneration is set out
on pages 45 to 51.
Auditors and Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a
resolution is to be proposed at the forthcoming AGM for the
reappointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company and
to authorise the directors to determine their remuneration.
So far as each person serving as a director of the company at the
date this report is approved is aware, there is no relevant information
needed by the company’s auditors in connection with preparing its
report set out on page 53 (audit information) of which the company’s
auditors are unaware. Each director hereby confirms that he or she
has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a
director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are
aware of that information.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 3rd June 2008
and is signed on its behalf by:
Simon Farrant
Company Secretary Annual Report & Accounts 2008 41
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors and the Board (continued)
In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association, all
directors submit themselves for re-election at least once every three
years. The board composition allows for changes to be made with
minimum disruption.
The board has undertaken a formal evaluation of its performance
and the performance of its committees and the individual directors.
Questionnaires, prepared by the Chairman with the assistance of
the Company Secretary, were completed by all directors. The
questionnaires focused on the operation of the board and its
committees and on individual directors’ contributions. In addition,
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director held a series of 
one-to-one discussions with every director, which provided each
director with the opportunity both to expand on their questionnaire
responses and to raise any broader issues relating to the company’s
strategy and governance. A summary of the responses was prepared
by the Company Secretary and discussed at a board meeting.
One area covered by the board evaluation related to the training
needs of the executive and non-executive directors. Regular
business presentations from senior managers at board meetings
assist the non-executive directors in familiarising themselves with the
group’s businesses. The board also usually holds at least one board
meeting per year at one of the group’s operational sites and takes
the opportunity to tour the site and discuss issues with local senior
and middle management. Individual non-executive directors also
undertake site visits. Such presentations, meetings and site visits
help to give a balanced overview of the company. They enable the
non-executive directors to build an understanding of the company’s
businesses, the markets in which the company operates and its
main relationships and to build a link with the company’s employees.
This is important in helping the non-executive directors to continually
develop and refresh their knowledge and skills to ensure that their
contribution to the board remains informed and relevant.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive directors
met without the Chairman present to consider evaluation of the
Chairman’s performance.
Committees of the Board
The Chief Executive’s Committee is responsible for the
recommendation to the board of strategic and operating plans and
on decisions reserved to the board where appropriate. It is also
responsible for the executive management of the group’s business.
The Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and meets
monthly. It comprises the executive directors and five senior
executives of the company.
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the board whose
purpose is to assist the board in the effective discharge of its
responsibilities for financial reporting and corporate control. The
Committee meets quarterly and is chaired by Mr A M Thomson.
It comprises all the independent non-executive directors with the
group Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director
and the external and internal auditors attending by invitation. A report
from the Committee on its activities is given on page 44.
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the board
responsible for advising the board and making recommendations on
the appointment of new directors. The Committee is chaired by Sir
John Banham, the group Chairman, and also comprises all the
independent non-executive directors. A report from the Committee
on its activities is given on page 43.
The Management Development and Remuneration Committee
(MDRC) is a sub-committee of the board which determines on
behalf of the board the remuneration of the executive directors. The
Committee was chaired by Mr C D Mackay until his retirement from
the board on 31st March 2008. He was succeeded by Mr R J W
Walvis with effect from 1st April 2008. It comprises all the
independent non-executive directors of the company together with
the group Chairman. The Chief Executive and the Director of Human
Resources attend by invitation except when their own performance
and remuneration are discussed. Further details are set out in the
Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51.

Directors’ Remuneration
The Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51 includes details of
remuneration policies and of the remuneration of the directors.
Relations with Shareholders
The board considers effective communication with shareholders,
whether institutional investors, private or employee shareholders,
to be extremely important.
The company reports formally to shareholders twice a year, when its
half year and full year results are announced and a half-yearly report
and a full report are issued to shareholders. These reports are
posted on Johnson Matthey’s website (www.matthey.com). At the
same time, executive directors give presentations on the results to
institutional investors, analysts and the media in London and other
international centres. Copies of major presentations are also posted
on the company’s website. 42 Johnson Matthey
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Relations with Shareholders (continued)
The company’s annual general meeting (AGM) takes place in
London and formal notification is sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days in advance of the meeting. The directors are
available for questions, formally during the AGM and informally
afterwards. Details of the 2008 AGM are set out in the notice 
of the meeting accompanying this Annual Report.
Contact with major shareholders is principally maintained by the
Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director, who ensure that
their views are communicated to the board as a whole. The
Chairman also discusses governance and other matters directly with
major shareholders. The board believes that appropriate steps have
been taken during the year to ensure that the members of the
board, and in particular the non-executive directors, develop an
understanding of the issues and concerns of major shareholders
about the company. The board is provided with brokers’ reports and
feedback from shareholder meetings on a six-monthly basis. The
canvassing of major shareholders’ views for the board in a detailed
investor survey is usually conducted every two years by external
consultants. The board has taken the view that these methods,
taken together, are a practical and efficient way both for the Chairman
to keep in touch with major shareholder opinion on governance and
strategy and for the Senior Independent Director to learn the views
of major shareholders and to develop a balanced understanding of
their issues and concerns. The Senior Independent Director is
available to attend meetings with major shareholders if requested.
Accountability, Audit and Control
The statement of the Responsibility of Directors for the preparation
of the Annual Report and the accounts is set out on page 52.
In its reporting to shareholders, the board aims to present a
balanced and understandable assessment of the group’s financial
position and prospects.
The group’s organisational structure is focused on its three divisions.
These are all separately managed but report to the board through a
board director. The executive management team receives monthly
summaries of financial results from each division through a
standardised reporting process.
The group has in place a comprehensive annual budgeting process
including forecasts for the next two years. Variances from budget
are closely monitored.
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s systems of internal
control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The internal control
systems are designed to meet the group’s needs and address the
risks to which it is exposed. Such systems can provide reasonable
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the company, which has
been in place during the financial year and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The board regularly
reviews this process.
The assessment of group and strategic risks is reviewed by the
board and updated on an annual basis. At the business level, the
processes to identify and manage the key risks are an integral part
of the control environment. Key risks and internal controls are the
subject of regular reporting to the Chief Executive’s Committee.
The Group Control Manual, which is distributed to all group
operations, clearly sets out the composition, responsibilities and
authority limits of the various board and executive committees and
also specifies what may be decided without central approval. It is
supplemented by other specialist policy and procedures manuals
issued by the group, divisions and individual business units or
departments. The high intrinsic value of many of the metals with
which the group is associated necessitates stringent physical
controls over precious metals held at the group’s sites.
The internal audit function is responsible for monitoring the group’s
systems of internal financial controls and the control of the integrity
of the financial information reported to the board. The Audit
Committee approves the plans for internal audit reviews and
receives the reports produced by the internal audit function on a
regular basis. Actions are agreed with management in response to
the internal audit reports produced.
In addition, significant business units provide assurance on the
maintenance of financial and non-financial controls and compliance
with group policies. These assessments are summarised by the
internal audit function and a report is made annually to the Audit
Committee.
The directors confirm that the system of internal control for the year
ended 31st March 2008 and the period up to 3rd June 2008 has
been established in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance included
with the Code and that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the
system of internal control.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Measures to ensure responsible business conduct and the
identification and assessment of risks associated with social, ethical
and environmental matters are managed in conjunction with all other
business risks and reviewed at regular meetings of the board and
the Chief Executive’s Committee.
A review of the group’s policies and targets for corporate social
responsibility (CSR) is set out in the Sustainability section of the
Business Review on pages 29 to 35. A full version of the
Sustainability Report is available on the company’s website.
The identification, assessment and management of environment,
health and safety (EHS) risks are the responsibility of the CSR
Compliance Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Chief
Executive’s Committee. It comprises the division directors, the
Director of EHS, the Company Secretary and senior representatives
of Group Legal, Internal Audit and Group EHS and has specific
responsibility for setting and overseeing compliance with the
standards for group CSR performance through the development,
dissemination, adoption and implementation of appropriate group
policies and other operational measures. Performance is monitored
using monthly statistics and detailed site audit reports. EHS
performance is reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive’s
Committee and an annual review is undertaken by the board.
Risks from employment and people issues are identified and
assessed by the Chief Executive’s Committee and reported to the
board.
Employment contracts, handbooks and policies specify acceptable
business practices and the group’s position on ethical issues. The
Group Control Manual and security manuals provide further
operational guidelines to reinforce these.
The Audit Committee reviews risks associated with corporate social
responsibility on an annual basis and monitors performance through
the annual control self-assessment process conducted by the
internal audit function. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 43
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the board whose
purpose is to advise the board on the appointment and, if
necessary, dismissal of executive and non-executive directors. The
full terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are provided on
the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises all the independent 
non-executive directors together with the group Chairman. The
quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of
whom must be an independent non-executive director. Biographical
details of the independent directors and the group Chairman are set
out on pages 36 and 37. Their remuneration is set out on page 48.
The group Chairman acts as the Chairman of the Committee,
although the group Chairman may not chair the Committee when it
is dealing with the matter of succession to the Chairmanship of the
company. A non-executive director may not chair the Committee
when it is dealing with a matter relating to that non-executive
director. 
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee
meetings. However, other individuals, such as the Chief Executive,
the Director of Human Resources and external advisers, may be
invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when
appropriate. 
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that it
requires from any officer or employee of the company or its
subsidiaries. In connection with its duties, the Committee is
authorised by the board to take such independent advice (including
legal or other professional advice, at the company’s expense) as it
considers necessary, including requests for information from or
commissioning investigations by external advisers. 
Main Activities of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met once during the financial year
ended 31st March 2008. On 2nd October 2007 the Nomination
Committee met to consider non-executive succession given the
pending retirement from the board of two of the independent 
non-executive directors, Mr Mackay and Mr Dearden, on 
31st March 2008. The meeting considered further terms for each 
of Mr Strachan, Mr Thomson and Mr Walvis, who would reach 
six years’ service on the board on 22nd January, 23rd September
and 23rd September 2008 respectively. After review, taking into
account the need to ensure the planned and progressive refreshing
of the board and to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and
experience, the Committee agreed to recommend to the board that
Mr Strachan, Mr Walvis and Mr Thomson be appointed at the end
of their then current terms for further terms to 31st March 2009,
23rd September 2010, and 23rd September 2011 respectively.
The board approved the recommendations at its meeting on 
27th November 2007. The Committee went on to consider the
requirement for the appointment of a new non-executive director 
on the proposed retirement of Mr Strachan on 31st March 2009
given the need to ensure that at least half the board, excluding the
Chairman, should comprise non-executive directors determined by
the board to be independent. The Committee also considered the
process to be followed for the board to appoint one of the
independent non-executive directors to be the Senior Independent
Director in the place of Mr Mackay on his retirement from the board
on 31st March 2008 and to identify a replacement for Mr Mackay 
as Chairman of the Management Development and Remuneration
Committee.
The Nomination Committee met on 1st April 2008 to discuss and
make recommendations to the board for the appointment of a
Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Management
Development and Remuneration Committee following the retirement
of Mr Mackay. After full discussion, taking into account all relevant
factors and considering the corporate governance and Combined
Code background to the proposed appointments (including the role
of the Senior Independent Director under the Combined Code), the
Committee agreed to recommend to the board that Mr Thomson be
appointed Senior Independent Director and that Mr Walvis be
appointed Chairman of the Management Development and
Remuneration Committee. The board approved the recommendations
at its meeting on 1st April 2008 and the appointments were
announced on that day. The Committee went on to discuss 
and agree the process for the selection and appointment of a
replacement for Mr Strachan, who will be retiring from the board on
31st March 2009, including the proposed use of search consultants.
The Committee discussed the relevant factors which would be
important in bringing experience to and ensuring balance on the
board. The Nomination Committee met again on 28th April 2008 
to review the selection process further.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the board whose
responsibilities include:
• Reviewing the half-yearly and full year accounts and results
announcements of the company and any other formal
announcements relating to the company’s financial performance
and recommending them to the board for approval.
• Reviewing the group’s systems for internal financial control and
risk management.
• Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s

shareholders for approval at a general meeting.
• Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness and independence of
the external auditors, agreeing the nature and scope of their
audit, agreeing their remuneration, and considering their reports
on the company’s accounts, reports to shareholders and their
evaluation of the systems of internal financial control and risk
management.
The full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are provided on
the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all the independent non-executive
directors. Biographical details of the independent directors are set
out on pages 36 and 37. Their remuneration is set out on page 48.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee is Mr A M Thomson, who
was formerly Finance Director of Smiths Group plc and is currently
chairman of the Technical Policy Board of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland (ICAS). The group Chairman, Chief
Executive, Group Finance Director, Head of Internal Audit and
external auditors (KPMG Audit Plc) attend Audit Committee
meetings by invitation. The Committee also meets separately with
the Head of Internal Audit and with the external auditors without
management being present. The Company Secretary is secretary to
the Audit Committee.
Main Activities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met four times during the financial year ended
31st March 2008. At its meeting on 31st May 2007 the Committee
reviewed the company’s preliminary announcement of its results for
the financial year ended 31st March 2007, and the draft report and
accounts for that year. The Committee received reports from the
external auditors on the conduct of their audit, their review of the
accounts, including accounting policies and areas of judgment, and
their comments on risk management and control matters. The
Committee also reviewed shareholder resolutions to be proposed at
the forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee met on 23rd July 2007 to receive reports on
internal controls from both the internal and external auditors. The
external auditors also presented their proposed fees and scope for
the forthcoming year’s audit. The Committee also reviewed the
performance of both the internal and external auditors. The group’s
Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2006/07 was also reviewed,
which is available on the company’s website at www.matthey.com.
At its meeting on 26th November 2007 the Audit Committee
reviewed the company’s half-yearly results, the half-yearly report and
the external auditors’ review.
At its meeting on 23rd January 2008 the Audit Committee reviewed
management’s and internal audit’s reports on the effectiveness of
the company’s systems for internal financial control and risk
management. The Committee reviewed the group’s credit control
procedures and risks, controls over precious metals and IT controls.
The group’s corporate social responsibility reporting arrangements
and whistleblowing procedures were also reviewed. Changes to the
Group Control Manual were ratified.
Independence of External Auditors
Both the board and the external auditors have for many years had
safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditors’
objectivity and independence could be compromised. Our policy in
respect of services provided by the external auditors is as follows:
• Audit related services – the external auditors are invited to
provide services which, in their position as auditors, they must or
are best placed to undertake. This includes formalities relating to
borrowings, shareholders’ and other circulars, various other
regulatory reports and work in respect of acquisitions and
disposals.
• Tax consulting – in cases where they are best suited, we use the
external auditors. All other significant tax consulting work is put
out to tender.
• General consulting – in recognition of public concern over the
effect of consulting services on auditors’ independence, our
policy is that the external auditors are not invited to tender for
general consulting work.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year ended 
31st March 2008 and information on the nature of non-audit fees
appear in note 4 on the accounts.
Internal Audit
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed the performance of
the internal audit function, the findings of the audits completed
during the year and the department’s resource requirements and
also approved the internal audit plan for the year ending 31st March
2009.
Internal audit independently reviews the risks and control processes
operated by management. It carries out independent audits in
accordance with an internal audit plan which is agreed with the
Audit Committee before the start of the financial year.
The plan provides a high degree of financial and geographical
coverage and devotes significant effort to the review of the risk
management framework surrounding the major business risks.
Internal audit reports include recommendations to improve internal
controls together with agreed management action plans to resolve
the issues raised. Internal audit follows up the implementation of
recommendations and reports progress to senior management and
the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee receives reports from the Head of Internal
Audit on the department’s work and findings.
The effectiveness of the internal audit function is reviewed and
discussed on an annual basis with the Head of Internal Audit.

Remuneration Report to Shareholders
Management Development and Remuneration Committee and
its Terms of Reference
The Management Development and Remuneration Committee of the
board comprises all the independent non-executive directors of the
company as set out on pages 36 and 37 and the group Chairman.
The Chairman of the Committee throughout the year was Mr C D
Mackay. Mr Mackay retired as a non-executive director of the
company and as Chairman of the Committee on 31st March 2008.
Mr R J W Walvis was appointed Chairman of the Committee on
1st April 2008.
The Committee’s terms of reference include determination on behalf
of the board of fair remuneration for the Chief Executive, the other
executive directors and the group Chairman (in which case the
group Chairman does not participate), which, while set in the
context of what the company can reasonably afford, recognises their
individual contributions to the company’s overall performance. In
addition, the Committee assists the board in ensuring that the senior
management of the group are recruited, developed and
remunerated in an appropriate fashion. The Director of Human
Resources, Mr I F Stephenson, acts as secretary to the Committee.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the
company’s website at www.matthey.com.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration is determined by the board,
within the limits prescribed by the company’s Articles of Association.
The remuneration consists of fees, which are set following advice
taken from independent consultants and are reviewed at regular
intervals.
Executive Remuneration Policy
The Committee believes strongly that remuneration policy should be
closely aligned with shareholder interests. The Committee recognises
that, in order to maximise shareholder value, it is necessary to have
a competitive pay and benefits structure. The Committee also
recognises that there is a highly competitive market for successful
executives and that the provision of appropriate rewards for superior
performance is vital to the continued growth of the business. To
assist with this, the Committee appoints and receives advice from
independent remuneration consultants on the pay and incentive
arrangements prevailing in comparably sized industrial companies in
each country in which Johnson Matthey has operations. During the
year, such advice was received from the Hay Group, which also
provided advice on job evaluation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provided expatriate tax advice,
tax audit work, completion of overseas tax returns, advice on set up
of new overseas operations and some overseas payroll services.
The Committee also receives recommendations from the Chief
Executive on the remuneration of those reporting to him as well as
advice from the Director of Human Resources. Total potential
rewards are earned through the achievement of demanding
performance targets based on measures that represent the best
interests of shareholders.
The remuneration policy is reviewed by the Committee annually 
and a formal review is undertaken every three years. Remuneration
consists of basic salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and
other benefits. Salaries are based on median market rates with
incentives providing the opportunity for upper quartile total
remuneration, but only for achieving outstanding performance.
To ensure the interests of the executive directors remain aligned 
with those of the shareholders, they are encouraged to build up 
over time and hold a shareholding in the company equal to at 
least their basic salary. As at 31st March 2008, all of the executive
directors held shares in the company approximately equal to or in
excess of their basic salary.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive Remuneration
During 2006/07 the Committee undertook a formal comprehensive
triennial review of the executive director and senior management
incentive arrangements within the group, which included advice from
independent external consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
consultation with the company’s major institutional shareholders and
representative organisations. 
Through the review the Committee sought to ensure that the
incentive arrangements within the group support the objectives of
the business, based on the following principles:
• Motivation of management – by having performance measures
with strong line of sight to their performance and targets that are
realistically achievable.
• Simplicity – through a single long term incentive plan with easily
understood performance targets.
• Close alignment with shareholders – by requiring outstanding
performance for full vesting and encouraging share ownership.
• Cohesion within the organisation – through the participation of all
800 of the group’s senior and middle management in the same
programme and by maintaining fair and appropriate reward
differentials throughout the business.
Under the new arrangements resulting from the review, which were
approved at the company’s annual general meeting in 2007, these
principles have all been achieved within the Committee’s objective
not to increase the overall expected accounting costs of the
remuneration arrangements.
The Committee reviewed the total value and structure of
remuneration for all executive directors and senior management and
also considered the objectives of the business going forward.
Overall, the Committee found that the potential value of
remuneration and the proportion of fixed and variable pay were
appropriate. Accordingly, the new arrangements proposed by the
Committee broadly maintained the levels of overall remuneration and
the balance between fixed and variable remuneration. However, the
Committee considered that improvements could be made to the
structure and performance measures of both the short and long
term incentives in order to align them with Johnson Matthey’s
objective of delivering consistent and above average earnings per
share growth over the long term. As a result of the review, changes
were proposed to remuneration relating to annual bonus, long term
incentive plan and share options. Proposals in respect of the
introduction of a new long term incentive plan and the cessation of
the granting of share options were submitted to and approved by
shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting in 2007. 
Executive directors’ remuneration consists of the following:
• Basic Salary – which is in line with the median market salary for
each director’s responsibilities as determined by independent
surveys. Basic salary is normally reviewed on 1st August each
year and the Committee takes into account individual
performance and promotion during the year. Where an internal
promotion takes place, the median salary relative to the market
would usually be reached over a period of a few years, which
can give rise to higher than normal salary increases while this is
being achieved.
• Annual Bonus – which is paid as a percentage of basic salary
under the terms of the company’s Executive Compensation Plan
(which also applies to the group’s 170 or so most senior
executives). The executive directors’ bonus award is based on
consolidated underlying profit before tax (PBT) compared with
the annual budget. The board of directors rigorously reviews the
annual budget to ensure that the budgeted PBT is sufficiently
stretching. An annual bonus payment of 50% of basic salary
(prevailing at 31st March) is paid if the group meets the annual
budget. This bonus may rise on a straight line basis to 75% of
basic salary if the group achieves PBT of 105% of budget and a
maximum 100% of basic salary may be paid if 110% of budgeted
PBT is achieved. PBT must reach 95% of budget for a minimum
bonus of 15% to be payable. The Committee has discretion to
vary the awards made. The bonus awarded to executive directors
for 2007/08 was 89.5% of salary at 31st March 2008 based on
an achieved PBT of 107.9% of budget.
• Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) – which is designed to achieve
above average performance and growth. 
Share Allocations made in 2007 and onwards – share allocations
made in 2007 and onwards, under the terms of the Johnson
Matthey Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 (which also applies to
the group’s 800 senior and middle managers), are subject to an
earnings per share (EPS) performance target. Although the plan
allows share allocations of up to a maximum of 200% of basic
annual salary each year (to take account of evolution of market
practice if required), it is the Committee’s current intention that
allocations will initially be no higher than 150% of basic salary
each year which is considered appropriate based on current
market conditions. It is intended that this level of allocation
should normally only be made to the Chief Executive. The
Committee would not seek to make awards above 150% of
basic salary without first consulting major shareholders. 
The allocation in 2007 was 150% for the Chief Executive and
120% of basic annual salary for executive directors. The release
of the share allocation is subject to the achievement of a
performance target measured over a three year performance
period commencing in the year of allocation. The performance
target is based on the compound annual growth in the
company’s EPS. The minimum release, of 15% of the allocation,
will commence at EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over
the three year period, with no retesting of the performance
target. For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS
must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum over
the three year performance period. The number of allocated
shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these
points. Allocations will lapse if EPS growth is less than 6%
compound per annum over the three year performance period.
Although growth in EPS is the primary financial measure, it is
also a key objective of the company to achieve earnings growth
only in the context of a good performance on return on invested
capital (ROIC). Accordingly, the Committee is required to make
an assessment of the company’s ROIC over the performance
period to ensure EPS growth has been achieved with ROIC in
line with the company’s planned expectations. The Committee
may scale back vesting to the extent that ROIC has not
developed appropriately.  Annual Report & Accounts 2008 47
REMUNERATION REPORT
Share allocations made prior to 2007 – Share allocations made
prior to 2007 were made under the Johnson Matthey Long Term
Incentive Plan which was established in 1998. The last allocation
of shares under this plan was made in 2006. No further
allocations will be made under this plan. The outstanding
allocations under this plan are subject to a relative total
shareholder return (TSR) performance target. This compares the
company’s TSR over a three year performance period
commencing in the year of allocation with that of a comparator
group which comprises those companies placed 51-150 in the
FTSE Index. All of the allocated shares are released if the
company ranks in the 76th percentile or above. None of the
shares are released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile
or below. If the company ranks between these percentiles 35%
to 100% of the shares are released on a straight line basis. In
addition, the company’s EPS must be at least equal to the
increase in UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year
performance period before any release is made.
• Share Options – the Johnson Matthey Long Term Incentive Plan
2007 is now the company’s single means for the provision of
long term awards and from 2007 replaced the granting of share
options under the Johnson Matthey 2001 Share Option Scheme
(the 2001 Scheme). Accordingly no share options were granted
in 2007. From 2001 to 2006 options were granted each year
under the 2001 Scheme. Options were granted at the market
value of the company’s shares at the time of grant and are
subject to performance targets over a three year period. Options
may be exercised upon satisfaction of the relevant performance
targets. Approximately 800 employees were granted options
under the 2001 Scheme each year.
Options granted from 2004 to 2006 – Grants made in 2004,
2005 and 2006 are subject to a three year performance target of
EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum. If the performance
target is not met at the end of the three year performance
period, the options will lapse. There is no retesting of the
performance target. In addition, to reduce the cost calculated
under the International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 2 –
‘Share-based Payment’, gains made on the exercise of options
are capped at 100% of the grant price.
The Committee had the discretion to award grants greater than
100% of basic annual salary. Grants which have been made
above this threshold are, however, subject to increasingly
stretching performance targets. Grants between 100% and
125% of basic annual salary are subject to EPS growth of UK
RPI plus 4% per annum and grants between 125% and 150% of
basic annual salary are subject to EPS growth of UK RPI plus
5% per annum. The executive directors were granted options
equal to 150% of basic annual salary.
Options granted prior to 2004 – Prior to 2004, options granted to
the executive directors under the 2001 Scheme were up to a
maximum of 100% of basic annual salary each year. Such
options can only be exercised if the company’s EPS has grown
by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three
consecutive years during the life of the option. These options are
subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth
anniversary of grant.
There are also options outstanding under the Johnson Matthey
1995 UK and Overseas Executive Share Option Scheme. The
last option grant under this scheme was made in 2000. All
options were granted in annual tranches up to the maximum
permitted of four times earnings and were subject to a
performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the
three year performance period. Option grants were not made to
executive directors in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000.
• Pensions – All the executive directors are members of the
Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme (JMEPS) in the
UK. Mr Carson and Dr Hawker ceased to accrue pensionable
service in JMEPS on 31st March 2006 and Mr Sheldrick ceased
to accrue pensionable service on 31st March 2008. Mr Pentz, a
US citizen, joined JMEPS on 1st January 2006. Prior to this he
was a member of the Johnson Matthey Inc. Salaried Employees
Pension Plan in the US. None of the non-executive directors are
members of JMEPS.
Under JMEPS, members are entitled to a pension based on their
pensionable service and final pensionable salary. JMEPS also
provides life assurance cover of four times annual salary. The
normal scheme pension age for directors is 60. Details of the
individual arrangements for executive directors are given on
pages 50 and 51.
• Other Benefits – Other benefits available to the executive
directors are private medical insurance, a company car and
membership of the group’s employee share incentive plans which
are open to all employees in the countries in which the group
operates such schemes.
• Service Contracts – The executive directors are employed on
contracts subject to one year’s notice at any time. On early
termination of their contracts the directors would normally be
entitled to 12 months’ salary and benefits.

Pensions
Pensions and life assurance benefits for the executive directors are provided through the company’s final salary occupational pension scheme
for UK employees – the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme (JMEPS) – which is constituted under a separate Trust Deed. JMEPS is
an exempt approved scheme under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It is a registered scheme for the
purposes of the Finance Act 2004. 
The Finance Act 2004 introduced changes to the taxation of benefits payable from registered UK pension schemes. Unless protected under
transitional arrangements, retirement benefits that exceed a capital value – called the Life Time Allowance – will be subject to an additional tax
charge. Any such tax charge arising out of membership of JMEPS will be paid by the trustees at the point of retirement and the member’s
benefits will be reduced accordingly. Executive directors whose retirement benefits are valued in excess of the Life Time Allowance may
withdraw from pensionable service in JMEPS and receive instead a supplemental payment of 25% of basic salary each year. Mr Carson and 
Dr Hawker withdrew from JMEPS and ceased paying member contributions on 31st March 2006 and Mr Sheldrick did so on 31st March 2008.
No pensionable service in JMEPS has been accrued by these directors since those dates. The increase in accrued pension in the tables below
is attributable to the increase in basic salary. The supplemental payments received by Mr Carson and Dr Hawker are reflected in the table on
page 47. Supplemental payments to Mr Sheldrick commenced with effect from 1st April 2008.
The Finance Act 2004 also enables authorised schemes to remove the restriction imposed by the ‘earnings cap’ under the Finance Act No. 2,
1989. As a result, the accrued pensions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick for service from 6th April 2006 are calculated by reference to normal
JMEPS rules and actual basic salary. Their accrued pensions in respect of service prior to that date remain restricted by reference to the
‘earnings cap’ (see note 5 below).
From 1st April 2007, member contributions paid by executive directors to JMEPS increased from 4% to 5% of pensionable pay (i.e. basic
salary). From 1st April 2008, member contributions increased from 5% to 6% of pensionable pay and there will be a further increase to 7% on
1st April 2009.
Disclosure of directors’ pension benefits has been made under the requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules and in
accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets
of requirements. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 51

Notes
(1)
Member contributions were paid at the general scheme rate of 5% of pensionable pay. This general rate increased to 6% on 1st April 2008 and a further
increase to 7% will become effective on 1st April 2009.
(2)
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
(3)
The entitlement shown under ‘Total accrued pension at 31st March 2008’ is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable
service to 31st March 2008 (except in the case of Mr Carson and Dr Hawker whose pensionable service ceased on 31st March 2006). The pension would,
however, be subject to an actuarial reduction of 0.3% per month for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
(4)
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 11. No allowance has been made in the
transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS. The transfer values in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 have been calculated at the start and the end of the year and, therefore, also take account of market movements. The JMEPS’ trustees
changed the actuarial assumptions used for calculating transfer values during the year. The transfer values shown have been calculated using the actuarial
assumptions which applied at each reporting date. Part of the increase in transfer value over the year, therefore, is due to the change of actuarial basis.
(5)
The JMEPS’ benefits and contributions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick in respect of pensionable service up to 5th April 2006 are restricted by reference to
the ‘earnings cap’ imposed by the Finance Act No. 2, 1989. Between 1st April 2000 and 31st March 2006, contributions were paid to Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefit Schemes (FURBS) to provide retirement and death benefits in relation to basic salary in excess of the ‘earnings cap’. FURBS were not
exempt approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and so payments were also made to meet the tax liabilities in
respect of these contributions. No FURBS payments have been made after 31st March 2006. Benefits and contributions in respect of service from 6th April
2006 have been provided by JMEPS in accordance with the normal scheme rules.
(6)
Mr Pentz is a US citizen but became a member of JMEPS on 1st January 2006. Prior to that he was a member of the Johnson Matthey Inc. Salaried
Employees Pension Plan (a non-contributory defined benefit arrangement) and a US savings plan (401k). He also has benefits in a Senior Executive Retirement
Plan. The pension values reported above are the aggregate for his separate membership of the UK and US pension schemes and the Senior Executive
Retirement Plan. US entitlements have been converted to sterling by reference to exchange rates on 31st March 2007 and 31st March 2008. Mr Pentz’s US
pension was fixed on 31st December 2005. The sterling equivalent of it has fluctuated over the year as a result of exchange rate movements. This is reflected
in the transfer values.
(7) 
The transfer value in respect of Mr Carson decreased during the year. Transfer values for members age 50 are based on equity yields which progressively
change to a bond yield basis over ten years. Transfer values for members aged 60 and over are based entirely on bond yields. Towards the end of last year
equity yields increased significantly, pushing down the transfer values for members more than ten years away from retirement.

RESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECTORS
Responsibility of Directors for the Preparation of the Annual
Report and the Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the group and parent company accounts in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent
company accounts for each financial year. Under that law they are
required to prepare the group accounts in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union (EU) and applicable law and have elected to
prepare the parent company accounts on the same basis.
The group and parent company accounts are required by law and
IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of
the group and the parent company and the performance for that
period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such
accounts that references in the relevant part of that Act to accounts
giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair
presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group and parent company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its
accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have a
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open
to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations the directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance statement that
comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in Respect of the
Annual Report and the Accounts
Each of the directors as at the date of the Annual Report, whose
names and functions are set out on pages 36 and 37, confirms that
to the best of their knowledge:
• the group and parent company accounts, prepared in
accordance with applicable UK law and in conformity with IFRS,
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position
and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report (which comprises the Directors’ Report
and the Business Review) includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties they face.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors
on 3rd June 2008 and is signed on its behalf by:
Sir John Banham
Chairman Annual Report & Accounts 2008 53
We have audited the group and parent company accounts (the ‘accounts’) of Johnson Matthey Plc for the year ended 31st March 2008
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent
Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Recognised Income and Expense and the related
notes. These accounts have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the tabulated information and
related footnotes set out in the directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51 disclosing the directors’ emoluments and compensation,
share options, long term incentive plan, pensions and other matters specified by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ Remuneration Report, the Corporate Governance statement and
the accounts in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU are set out in
the Responsibility of Directors statement on page 52.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts and the part of the directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group
accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the accounts. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business
Review as cross referenced from the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you, if in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not
disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited accounts. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the part of the directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of the group’s affairs as at
31st March 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the parent company accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31st March 2008;
• the accounts and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the accounts.

CONSOLIDATED AND PARENT COMPANY STATEMENTS
OF RECOGNISED INCOME AND EXPENSE
for the year ended 31st March 2008 58 Johnson Matthey
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the year ended 31st March 2008
The group’s and parent company’s significant accounting policies, together with the judgments made by management in applying those
policies which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts, are:
Basis of accounting and preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) or the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) as adopted by the
European Union. For Johnson Matthey, there are no differences between IFRS as adopted by the European Union and full IFRS as published
by the International Accounting Standards Board and so the accounts comply with IFRS.
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value as explained below.
The parent company has not presented its own income statement and related notes as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the parent company and all its subsidiaries, including employee share ownership trusts,
and include the group’s interest in associates.
Entities over which the group has the ability to exercise control are accounted for as subsidiaries. Entities that are not subsidiaries or joint
ventures but where the group has significant influence (i.e. the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions) are
accounted for as associates.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are included in the consolidated accounts using the equity method of accounting.
The results of businesses acquired or disposed of in the year are consolidated from or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal
respectively. The net assets of businesses acquired are incorporated in the consolidated accounts at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated. No profit is taken on transactions between subsidiaries and the group’s share
of profits on transactions with associates is also eliminated.
In the parent company balance sheet, businesses acquired by the parent company from other group companies are incorporated at book
value at the date of acquisition. Where the consideration given exceeds the book value of the assets acquired this difference is accounted for
as goodwill.
Revenue
Revenue comprises all sales of goods and rendering of services at the fair value of consideration received or receivable after the deduction of
any trade discounts and excluding sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when it can be measured reliably and the significant risks and rewards
of ownership are transferred to the customer. With the sale of goods this occurs when the goods are despatched or made available to the
customer, except for the sale of consignment products located at customers’ premises where revenue is recognised on notification that the
product has been used. With the rendering of services revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion as measured by the
proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs. With royalties revenue is recognised in accordance with the
substance of the relevant agreement.
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion. This is measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense
immediately.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, associate or branch at the exchange rate at
the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange
rate at the balance sheet date.
Income statements and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and branches are translated into sterling at the average rates for the year.
Balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries, associates and branches, including any fair value adjustments and including related goodwill, are
translated into sterling at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries, associates and branches, less exchange
differences arising on related foreign currency financial instruments which hedge the group’s net investment in these operations, are taken
to a separate component of equity. The group has taken advantage of the exemption allowed in IFRS 1 – ‘First-time Adoption of International
Reporting Standards’ to deem the cumulative translation difference for all overseas subsidiaries, associates and branches to be zero at
1st April 2004.
Other exchange differences are taken to operating profit.
Finance costs and finance income
Finance costs and finance income are recognised in the income statement in the year incurred. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 59
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the year ended 31st March 2008
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year incurred unless it meets the IFRS recognition criteria for
capitalisation. When the recognition criteria have been met any further development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. Finance costs are not
capitalised.
Depreciation is provided using the straight line method to write off the cost less estimated residual value over the useful life of the asset. The
estimated useful lives vary according to the class of the asset, but are typically: leasehold property 30 years (or the life of the lease if shorter);
freehold buildings 30 years; and plant and equipment 4 to 10 years. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the fair value of the consideration given exceeds the fair value attributed to the net
assets acquired (including contingent liabilities). It is subject to annual impairment reviews.
The group and parent company have taken advantage of the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 and so goodwill arising on acquisitions made
before 1st April 2004 is included at the carrying amount at that date less any subsequent impairments. Up to 31st March 1998 goodwill was
eliminated against reserves.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. They are amortised in accordance with
the relevant income stream or by using the straight line method over their useful lives from the time they are first available for use. The estimated
useful lives vary according to the specific asset but are typically: 1 to 8 years for customer contracts and relationships; 3 to 8 years for capitalised
software; 3 to 10 years for patents, trademarks and licences; and 3 to 8 years for capitalised development currently being amortised.
Intangible assets which are not yet being amortised are subject to annual impairment reviews.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the parent company’s balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment. Any distributions from
pre-acquisition profits are recognised as a reduction to the cost of the investment.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the group. The assets
are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance
leases. The assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter. The interest element of the
lease rental is included in the income statement.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and the lease costs are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Grants
Grants related to assets are included in deferred income and released to the income statement in equal instalments over the expected useful
lives of the related assets.
Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Precious metal inventories
Inventories of gold, silver and platinum group metals are valued according to the source from which the metal is obtained. Metal which has
been purchased and committed to future sales to customers or hedged in metal markets is valued at the price at which it is contractually
committed or hedged, adjusted for unexpired contango and backwardation. Other precious metal inventories owned by the group, which are
unhedged, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the weighted average cost formula.
Other inventories
Non precious metal inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including attributable overheads, and net realisable value. Except where costs
are specifically identified, the first-in, first-out or weighted average cost formulae are used to value inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand, including short term deposits with a maturity date of three months or less from the
date of acquisition. The group and parent company routinely use short term bank overdraft facilities, which are repayable on demand, as an
integral part of their cash management policy. Therefore cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements are cash and deposits less
bank overdrafts. Offset arrangements across group businesses have been applied to arrive at the net cash and overdraft figures. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the year ended 31st March 2008
60 Johnson Matthey
Derivative financial instruments
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage
the financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities. The group and parent company do
not undertake any trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value. Derivative financial instruments may be designated at inception as fair value
hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges if appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instruments that are not designated as or are not determined to be effective hedges are
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, together
with the related changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the designation is revoked.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity, to the extent that the
hedges are effective. Ineffective portions are recognised in the income statement immediately. If the hedged item results in the recognition of a
non-financial asset or liability, the amount recognised in equity is transferred out of equity and included in the initial carrying amount of the
asset or liability. Otherwise, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item is
recognised in the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the
criteria for hedge accounting or the designation is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the
income statement.
For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity,
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the
foreign operations are sold.
Other financial instruments
All other financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is as follows:
• Unhedged borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
• Available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. On disposal of the
investment the amount recognised in equity will be transferred to the income statement at the trade date.
• All other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are measured at amortised cost less any impairment
provision.
Taxation
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, except when they relate to items recognised directly in equity when the
related tax is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the amount of income tax expected to be paid in respect of the taxable profits using the tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amount in the balance sheet. It is provided using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset or liability
is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and a reliable estimate can be made of a
probable adverse outcome, for example warranties, environmental claims and restructurings. Otherwise, material contingent liabilities are
disclosed unless the transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are only disclosed if an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
The group considers financial guarantees of its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associates to be insurance contracts.
The parent company considers financial guarantees of its subsidiaries’ borrowings and precious metal leases to be insurance contracts.
These are treated as contingent liabilities unless it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments and employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs)
The fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees and shares allocated to employees under the long term incentive plans after
7th November 2002 is calculated using an adjusted Black-Scholes options valuation model and the resulting cost is charged to the income
statement over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting where appropriate.
The group and parent company provide finance to the ESOTs to purchase company shares in the open market. Costs of running the ESOTs
are charged to the income statement. The cost of shares held by the ESOTs are deducted in arriving at equity until they vest unconditionally
in employees. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 61
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the year ended 31st March 2008
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The group operates a number of contributory and non-contributory plans, mainly of the defined benefit type, which require contributions to be
made to separately administered funds.
The costs of the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit plans, the group and parent company recognise the net assets or liabilities of the schemes in their balance sheets.
Obligations are measured at present value using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate reflecting yields on high quality
corporate bonds. Assets are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The changes in scheme assets and liabilities, based on
actuarial advice, are recognised as follows:
• The current service cost is spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees’ services based on
the most recent actuarial valuation and is deducted in arriving at operating profit.
• The interest cost, based on the discount rate at the beginning of the year and the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the
year, is included in operating profit.
• The expected return on plan assets, based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for returns over the entire life of the related
obligation and amended for changes in the fair value of plan assets as a result of contributions paid in and benefits paid out, is included in
operating profit.
• Actuarial gains and losses, representing differences between the expected return and actual return on plan assets and reimbursement rights,
differences between actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year, and changes in actuarial
assumptions, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in the year they occur.
• Past service costs are spread evenly over the period in which the increases in benefit vest and are deducted in arriving at operating profit.
If an increase in benefits vests immediately, the cost is recognised immediately.
• Gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments are included in operating profit.
Standards and interpretations adopted in the year
The standards and interpretations which were adopted during the year were IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, Amendment to
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 – ‘Capital Disclosures’ and IFRIC 10 – ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’. There were no
changes in accounting policy and no effect on current or prior year results or net assets of the group and parent company.
IFRIC 11 – ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ was also adopted during the year. There were no changes in accounting policy
and no effect on current or prior year results or net assets of the group. In the parent company the cost of share-based payments granted to
its subsidiaries’ employees (to the extent that it is not recharged) is accounted for as an additional investment in subsidiaries. The cost has
been recharged to its subsidiaries this year and so this is the only change to the results for the year ended 31st March 2008. The parent
company has restated its comparatives for the year ended 31st March 2007 and so investments in subsidiaries and equity at 31st March
2007 have been increased by £6.6 million.
Standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied
IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’ was issued in November 2006 and is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after
1st January 2009. It replaces IAS 14 – ‘Segment Reporting’ and requires the identification of operating segments based on internal reporting
to the chief operating decision maker and changes the disclosure requirements. Johnson Matthey has not yet completed its evaluation of the
impact on its disclosures but adoption of the standard will not affect the reported results or net assets of the group and parent company.
IFRIC 12 – ‘Service Concession Arrangements’ was issued in November 2006 and is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on
or after 1st January 2008. This will not affect the reported results or net assets of the group and parent company.
IAS 23 – ‘Borrowing Costs’ was revised in March 2007 and is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009.
It requires that borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which takes a substantial
period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. The effect on the group and parent company
is still being evaluated.
IFRIC 13 – ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ was issued in June 2007 and is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after
1st July 2008. This will not affect the reported results or net assets of the group and parent company.
IFRIC 14 – ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ was issued in July 2007 and is
required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2008. The effect on the group and parent company is still being
evaluated.
IAS 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ was revised in September 2007 and is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on
or after 1st January 2009. It requires a number of presentational changes but will not affect the reported results or net assets of the group and
parent company.
IFRS 3 – ‘Business Combinations’ was revised and IAS 27 – ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ was amended in January 2008
and are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1st July 2009. They require changes to the accounting for future
business combinations and the accounting in the event of the loss of control over a subsidiary and so will not result in any restatement of
reported results or net assets of the group and parent company.
Amendment to IFRS 2 – ‘Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’ was issued in January 2008 and is required to be applied for annual periods
beginning on or after 1st January 2009. The effect on the group and parent company is still being evaluated. 62 Johnson Matthey
NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS
for the year ended 31st March 2008
1 Segmental information
By business segment
As described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2007, the group reorganised its divisional structure on
1st April 2007 creating a new Environmental Technologies Division and a new Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division. Fine Chemicals &
Catalysts was created by adding the businesses which serve the speciality chemicals and pharmaceutical markets previously reported
in Catalysts to Pharmaceutical Materials. Environmental Technologies is made up of the remaining Catalysts’ businesses. Hence, for
management purposes the group is now organised into three operating divisions – Environmental Technologies, Precious Metal
Products and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts. Their principal activities are described on pages 15 to 21. Sales between segments are
made at market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.

1 2 Share-based payments
Share options
Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the company’s shares over the three
days prior to the date of grant and are subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employee’s salary and from 2001 to 2006
approximately 800 employees have been granted options each year. In 2007 a new long term incentive plan was introduced and
allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options. No share options were granted in the year ended 
31st March 2008.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 are subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share (EPS) growth of UK
RPI plus 3% per annum. Other performance targets are EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus
5% per annum. If the performance targets are not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options will lapse. Also,
gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over
any three consecutive years during the life of the options. They are subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary
of grant. Since the targets have been met all these options are exercisable.
Some options granted in 2000 and before are still outstanding. These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI
plus 2% over the three year performance period. Since that target has been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP)
The new LTIP also replaced share allocations made under the previous LTIP . Under the new LTIP , shares are allocated to approximately 800
employees based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period. At 31st March 2008, shares
allocated in 2007 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired. The minimum release of 15% of the
allocation is subject to the achievement of a EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period. For the maximum release
of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum. The number of allocated shares released will
vary on a straight line basis between these points. Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the
three year performance period.
Under the old LTIP, shares were allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and
are subject to performance conditions over a three year period. At 31st March 2008, shares allocated in 2005 and 2006 (at 31st March
2007, shares allocated in 2004, 2005 and 2006) were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired. The
release of shares is subject to a relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE
index over a three year period. All shares are released if the company ranks in the 76th percentile or above. None of the shares are
released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile or below. If the company ranks between these percentiles 35% and 100% of the
shares are released on a straight line basis. In addition EPS growth must be at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three
year performance period before any release is made.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) – UK and Overseas
Under the SIP , all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company
are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a £125 per month limit. The SIP trustees buy shares
(partnership shares) at market value each month with the employees’ contributions. For each partnership share purchased, the group
purchases two shares (matching shares) which are allocated to the employee. In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers
partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited. In the Overseas SIP,
partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time. 70 Johnson Matthey

The fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31st March 2007 was 234.3 pence per option. An adjusted Black-
Scholes option pricing model was used to determine the fair value of the options granted. The inputs to the model were share price
1,299 pence, exercise price 1,282 pence, expected volatility 18.7%, expected option life 5 years, expected dividend rate 2.32% and
risk free interest rate 4.77%. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over
the previous three years. The expected option life took into account the effects of expected early exercise restrictions and behavioural
considerations based on the history of previous option grants. Given the low employee turnover and the consistency of the historical
average option life Black-Scholes was considered to be a suitable stochastic model to use for fair valuing Johnson Matthey’s share
options. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was adjusted to take account of the cap which reduces the benefit and cost
appearing in the accounts. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 71

1 2 Share-based payments (continued)
The fair value of the shares allocated during the year under the LTIP was 1,613.5 pence per share allocation (2007 504.7 pence per
share allocation). The fair value was based on the share price at the date of allocation of 1,711.0 pence (2007 1,283.0 pence) adjusted
for the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received at an expected dividend rate of 1.96% (2007 2.35%). The fair
value of the shares allocated in the year ended 31st March 2007 was adjusted to take account of the TSR performance condition.

223,335 (2007 289,696) matching shares under the SIP and 58,876 (2007 71,879) shares under the 401k plans were allocated to
employees during the year. They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses
due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was £9.8 million (2007 £11.8 million).
1 3 Post-employment benefits
13a Group
The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with
conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be
made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees’ pensionable salary and
length of service. Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising
from contributions paid in respect of each employee. The group also makes payments to employees’ personal pension plans. The
amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was £3.1 million (2007 £2.8 million).
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US. The pension plans are
final salary plans except for the new section of the UK plan which is a career average salary plan and the US hourly plan which is a
fixed benefit based upon years of service. Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2006 for the main UK pension plan and
30th June 2007 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2008 by
qualified independent actuaries.

The group uses certain mortality assumptions when calculating plan obligations. The current mortality assumptions for all major plans
retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience. 72 Johnson Matthey

The mortality tables used for the group’s largest plan, which is in the UK, at its last full actuarial valuation were PMA92C2006 with a
one and a half years positive age rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2006 with a one and a half years
positive age rating for female members retiring in normal health. Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the
medium cohort versions of these tables. Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health. These
tables have been carried through into the 31st March 2008 update allowing for the expected improvements over the intervening two
years. These tables lead to a future lifetime of average members currently at age 63 (the plan’s normal retirement age for the majority of
its members) and 65 and average members at age 63 and 65 in 23 and 25 years time (i.e. members who are currently aged 40 years)

1 3 Post-employment benefits (continued)
1 3b Parent company
The parent company is the sponsoring employer of the group’s UK defined benefit pension plan and the UK post-retirement medical
benefits plan. There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan to the individual
group entities. The main assumptions used for these plans are disclosed in note 13a.
The fair values and expected rates of return for defined benefit pension plan assets were:

The defined benefit pension plan does not invest directly in Johnson Matthey Plc shares and no property or other assets owned by the
pension plan is used by the company. The overall expected rate of return is determined by reference to market expectations for each
class of asset. It is based upon the forecasts of actuaries and market professionals.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. As a result of the change in divisional structure (note 1) the cash-generating units have been
reorganised onto the same basis. Goodwill is allocated as follows:

The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be
impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based
on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period. The budgets and plans are based on
a number of key assumptions including market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, the likelihood and timing
of new product launches, foreign exchange rates, precious metal prices and other direct input costs. Market share, changes in selling
prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and management’s
expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate. Foreign exchange rates are
based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the three years. New product launches are
based on management’s best estimate of what may happen. Apart from as discussed below, it is not considered that a reasonably
possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome. These cash flows are then
extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the group’s estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.3% (2007 11.2%), as this is
considered to be a discount rate a typical third party purchaser would also use to value the significant CGUs.
For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate is 8% (2007 5%), for Research Chemicals 5% (2007 5%), for Catalysts
and Chemicals 5% (2007 4%), for Macfarlan Smith 5% (2007 5%) and for Argillon Group 10%.
For Pharma Services / Ireland, where its cash flows are expected to grow significantly due to new prostaglandin product launches
over the next few years, cash flow projections cover a four (2007 five) year period and then a long term average growth rate of 5%
(2007 6%) is used to extrapolate these cash flows. If some of these product launches do not happen as expected an impairment
loss may arise. 82 Johnson Matthey

28 Financial risk management
The group’s and parent company’s activities expose them to a variety of financial risks including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk. The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company,
under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The group and parent
company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial
risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities. Some derivative financial instruments used
to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as ‘held for trading’. The group and parent company do not
undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
28a Interest rate risk
The group’s and parent company’s interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings
(cash flow risk). Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity. They manage their risk by
reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in
appropriate currencies and at competitive rates. The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar
floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates. The
group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash
flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar / sterling
exchange rate. The cash flows are expected to occur in 2010 and 2015 when the respective bonds which they hedge mature. The
interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be
realised in the income statement in 2010 and 2015. At 31st March 2008, 30% (2007 51%) of the group’s net debt and 30% (2007
45%) of the company’s net debt was at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.20% (2007 5.20%). The remaining debt is funded
on a floating rate basis. Based on the group’s net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1%
change in all interest rates would have a £4.3 million (2007 £1.8 million) impact on the group’s profit before tax. This is within the range
the board regards as acceptable.
28b Liquidity risk
The group’s and parent company’s policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed
bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements. At 31st March 2008, the group and parent company had
borrowings under committed bank facilities of £230.7 million (2007 £15.4 million). The group and parent company also have a number 
of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.

for the year ended 31st March 2008
28 Financial risk management (continued)
28c Credit risk
Within certain businesses, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price. The failure of any such company
to honour its debts could materially impact the group’s and parent company’s results. The group and parent company derive significant
benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels. Each business and division has a credit committee
that regularly monitors its exposure. The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits,
amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken. At 31st March 2008 trade receivables for the
group amounted to £568.9 million (2007 £469.5 million) (parent company £234.1 million (2007 £185.0 million)). £382.5 million (2007
£286.7 million) of these receivables at group level (£161.5 million (2007 £124.2 million) at parent company level) arose in Emission Control
Technologies (ECT) which is part of Environmental Technologies Division and mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and
truck manufacturers and component suppliers. Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers the concentrated nature of
this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large. Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of
customers and amounts owed tend to be lower. As at 31st March 2008 (and at 31st March 2007) for the group as a whole, no single
outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the company’s market capitalisation. No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the group’s and parent company’s customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and closely monitored. The
scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits. Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other
markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which
imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt. Trade receivables can be analysed as:

Financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances
are banks with high credit ratings (not less than AA). As at 31st March 2008, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits
was £36.3 million (2007 £11.3 million) for the group and £13.0 million (2007 £7.0 million) for the parent company, whilst the largest
mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was £1.8 million (2007 £0.8 million) for the group and
parent company. The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the group’s and parent company’s maximum exposure to credit risk
on cash and deposits.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associates and its exposure at 31st March 2008 was
£1.1 million (2007 £0.8 million). At 31st March 2008 the group and parent company guaranteed £ nil (2007 £3.3 million) of the borrowings
of subsidiaries of Endeka Ceramics, former subsidiaries of the group (note 40). The parent company also guarantees some of its
subsidiaries’ borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2008
was £62.1 million (2007 £16.1 million). 90 Johnson Matthey

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing
at the year end. It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the group’s unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a
book value of £5.2 million (2007 £4.8 million) as there is no active market. These are investments in a company that is in the start up
phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values. Given their size it
would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
28e Foreign currency risk
The group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK. In order to protect the group’s sterling balance sheet
and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA, Europe, Japan and China by borrowing US dollars,
euros, yen and renminbi respectively. Although an element of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a large
part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure. The group has designated
the currency swaps and one loan (fair value £18.1 million (2007 £15.4 million)) as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as
they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries’ net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps were:

The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts, and occasionally currency options, to hedge foreign exchange exposures
arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies. These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The majority
of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2009.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the group’s results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries’ profits into
sterling. The group’s largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% (10.0 cent (2007 9.5 cent)) movement in the average exchange rate
for the US dollar against sterling would have had a £3.6 million (2007 £3.7 million) impact on operating profit. The group is also
exposed to the euro and a 5% (7.1 cent (2007 7.4 cent)) movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would
have had a £1.7 million (2007 £1.5 million) impact on operating profit. This exposure is part of the group’s economic risk of operating
globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 91
NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS
for the year ended 31st March 2008
28 Financial risk management (continued)
28e Foreign currency risk (continued)
For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast
receipts and payments. A 5% (9.9 cent (2007 9.8 cent)) movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would
have had a £1.9 million (2007 £2.4 million) impact on operating profit and an £11.4 million (2007 £9.9 million) impact on equity for these
instruments. A 5% (6.3 cent (2007 7.4 cent)) movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 
£2.4 million (2007 £3.4 million) impact on operating profit and a £28.0 million (2007 £14.1 million) impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact in operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and
payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items. Similarly, the
impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries’ net assets and so would be offset by
an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries’ net assets. The remaining impact on equity of £3.7 million
(2007 £1.9 million) for the US dollar and £6.7 million (2007 £2.4 million) for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging
the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
28f Capital management
The group’s policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources
to be able to invest in future growth. The group has a long term target range for gearing (net debt / equity) of 50% to 60% although in
any given year gearing may fall outside this range depending on future plans. See the section on capital structure in the financial review
on page 13 for more information.

Details of outstanding share options and allocations under the company’s long term incentive plan which have yet to mature are
disclosed in note 12.
At the last annual general meeting on 24th July 2007 shareholders approved a resolution for the company to make purchases of its
own shares up to a maximum number of 21,707,361 shares. The resolution remains valid until the conclusion of this year’s annual
general meeting. The company will purchase its own shares when the board believes it to be in the best interests of the shareholders
generally and will result in an increase in earnings per share.
The group’s employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs) also buy shares on the open market and hold them in trust for employees
participating in the group’s executive share option schemes and long term incentive plan. At 31st March 2008 the group’s ESOTs held
4,265,151 shares (2007 6,121,013 shares) which had not yet vested unconditionally in employees. Computershare Trustees (CI)
Limited, as trustee for the ESOTs, has waived its dividend entitlement. At 31st March 2008 the parent company’s ESOT held 4,241,462
shares (2007 6,056,432 shares) which had not yet vested unconditionally in employees. 94 Johnson Matthey

37 Precious metal operating leases
The group leases precious metals from banks for specified periods (typically a few months) and for which the group pays a fee. These
arrangements are classified as operating leases. The group holds sufficient precious metal inventories to meet all the obligations under
these lease arrangements as they fall due. At 31st March 2008 precious metal leases were £86.1 million (2007 £93.2 million).

39 Acquisitions
If all acquisitions had been completed on 1st April 2007 the revenue for the group would have been £7,561.4 million and its profit for
the year for continuing operations £194.0 million.
Argillon Group
On 6th February 2008 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Argillon Group (Argillon). Argillon specialises in catalysts
and advanced ceramic materials and sells a range of products into a number of different industries.
The goodwill arising is attributable to the synergistic opportunity to take the existing Argillon technology together with Johnson
Matthey’s capital resources, technological expertise and commercial teams in businesses across the world, to develop new products to
service new markets. There will also be synergies in combining the group and Argillon’s complementary catalyst operations. The
acquisition of Argillon adds valuable technology to Johnson Matthey’s existing emission control capabilities for controlling oxides of
nitrogen (NOx). As well as products for the heavy duty diesel (HDD) truck market, Argillon manufactures catalysts for power plants,
industrial applications and waste incineration plants. These products have application in coal fired power stations to reduce harmful
NOx emissions. This could become a major market in a few years’ time as coal is increasingly used to produce electricity and people
around the world become more concerned about air quality. The acquisition of Argillon also adds to Emission Control Technologies’
existing business selling NOx control systems for large stationary engines and in marine applications. Johnson Matthey estimates that
the HDD catalyst market for mobile applications will grow from approximately US $700 million of sales excluding precious metals in
2008 to US $3 billion by the end of 2014 driven by legislation requiring much reduced levels of emissions which is due to come into
force over the next six years. Argillon’s products can be used to meet some of these legislative standards but they are more likely to be
used in combination with other technology which has been developed by Johnson Matthey. By combining Argillon’s and Johnson
Matthey’s technology, testing facilities and global sales capability sales of Argillon’s products are likely to be significantly higher than
Argillon could achieve on its own. In addition, in the next decade the board believes there will be significant opportunities for new
products for NOx control to meet standards yet to be promulgated given global concerns about air quality and global warming. The
combination of Argillon’s and Johnson Matthey’s technology and research and development capabilities should provide significantly
better opportunities for developing successful products for these markets than the sum of the two businesses on a stand alone basis. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 99

39 Acquisitions (continued)
Qingdao Johnson Matthey Hero Catalyst Company Limited
In September 2007 the group acquired 49% of Qingdao Johnson Matthey Hero Catalyst Company Limited (Hero), a Chinese catalyst
company, for £0.2 million and incurred costs of £0.2 million. The group controls Hero and so it is accounted for as a subsidiary. The fair
value of the assets acquired were £0.1 million for a customer contract, £0.1 million for plant and equipment and £0.3 million for cash.
The minority interest was £0.2 million, giving goodwill of £0.1 million. Since acquisition it has contributed £0.1 million to the group’s
profit for the year and its results are included in Environmental Technologies.
United Farmaceuticals Limited acquired in the year ended 31st March 2007
On 13th April 2006 the group purchased most of the business of United Farmaceuticals Limited for £1.9 million plus costs of £0.1 million.
The fair value of the assets acquired were plant and machinery of £0.3 million and inventories of £0.6 million giving goodwill of £1.1 million.
The goodwill arising is attributable to future synergies arising from the combination. It has been fully integrated with Macfarlan Smith
and so its post acquisition results are not identifiable and are included in Fine Chemicals & Catalysts.
Process diagnostics business acquired in the year ended 31st March 2007
On 21st April 2006 the group purchased the process diagnostics business of Quest TruTec for £3.8 million plus costs of £0.1 million.
The fair value of the assets acquired were customer contracts and relationships of £0.4 million, property, plant and equipment of
£0.3 million giving goodwill of £3.2 million. The goodwill arising is attributable to future synergies arising from the combination. It has
been fully integrated with the group’s existing processing services business and so its post acquisition results are not identifiable and
are included in Environmental Technologies.

42 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on those
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The group and parent company have made appropriate estimates when applying the
accounting policies, but the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:
Post-employment benefits
The group’s and parent company’s defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified independent actuaries. The details of the
plans and assumptions used are described in note 13.
Goodwill
The group has capitalised goodwill of £482.8 million and the parent company has £249.5 million. Annual impairment reviews are
performed which require various assumptions. More details are given in note 15.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets which are not yet being amortised (note 16) are also subject to annual impairment reviews based on discounted
cash flow projections. No impairment has been found.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
As described in note 29 and the accounting policies, the group and parent company measure provisions and contingent liabilities at
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date.
Taxation
The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which
the group operates. Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to
determine the tax charge included in the accounts. If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally
estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the accounts for the year in which it is determined.

Dividend Policy
It is Johnson Matthey’s policy to grow dividends in line with
underlying earnings while maintaining dividend cover at about two
and a half times to ensure sufficient funds are retained to support
organic growth. Over the last five years from 2003/04, underlying
earnings per share have grown at a compound annual growth rate
of 9% p.a. The board is proposing a final dividend for 2007/08 of
26.0 pence to take the total for the year to 36.6 pence, which is 9%
up in line with growth in underlying earnings. The dividend will be
covered 2.45 times by underlying earnings. For further discussion
of the group’s financial objectives see the Strategy and Objectives
section of the Business Review on page 7 of this Annual Report.
Dividend Payments and DRIP
Dividends can be paid directly into shareholders’ bank or building
society accounts. Shareholders wishing to take advantage of this
facility should contact the company’s registrars, Equiniti, or complete
the dividend mandate form attached to their dividend cheque. A
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is also available which allows
shareholders to purchase additional shares in the company. Further
information can be obtained from Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer
Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA. Telephone 0871 384 2268*.
They can also be contacted via their website at www.shareview.co.uk.
American Depositary Receipts
Johnson Matthey has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary
Receipt (ADR) programme which The Bank of New York administers
and for which it acts as Depositary. Each ADR represents two
Johnson Matthey ordinary shares. The ADRs trade in the US over-
the-counter (OTC) market under the symbol JMPLY. When dividends
are paid to shareholders, the Depositary converts such dividends
into US dollars, net of fees and expenses, and distributes the net
amount to ADR holders. For enquiries, The Bank of New York can
be contacted on 1-888-BNY-ADRS (1-888-269-2377) toll free if you
are calling from within the United States. Alternatively, they can be
contacted by e-mail at shareowners@bankofny.com or via their
website at www.adrbnymellon.com.
Share Price and Group Information
Information on the company’s current share price together with
copies of the group’s annual and half-yearly reports and major
presentations to analysts and institutional shareholders are available
on the Johnson Matthey website: www.matthey.com.
The website’s Investor Centre contains extensive information and a
number of tools which will be of assistance to investors including
historic share price information downloads and a share price
charting facility.
For capital gains tax purposes the mid-market price of the
company’s ordinary shares on 31st March 1982 was 253 pence.

Cautionary Statement
The Business Review and certain other sections of this
Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are
subject to risk factors associated with, amongst other things,
the economic and business circumstances occurring from
time to time in the countries and sectors in which the group
operates. It is believed that the expectations reflected in
these statements are reasonable but they may be affected by
a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to
differ materially from those currently anticipated.

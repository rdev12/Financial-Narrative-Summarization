Creating quality  
outcomes...
AMS has had another year of strong performance 
and continues to progress as a leading, 
international provider of high quality, high 
value, innovative and technologically advanced 
products for the surgical and advanced  
woundcare markets. We are pleased that we have 
delivered another year of strong revenue growth, 
profit performance and good cash generation.
I am pleased to report a 20% increase in 
revenue to £82.6 million (2015: £68.6 million), 
representing growth of 13% on a constant 
currency basis and an increase in adjusted
6
 profit 
before tax before exceptional items of 13% to 
£19.7 million (2015: £17.4 million), and an increase 
in profit before taxation of 12% to £19.1 million 
(2015: £17.0 million). The continued strong cash 
flow generation of the business has resulted 
in the Group ending the year with net cash 
of £51.1 million (2015: £34.2 million).
Our strategy of having multiple products and 
multiple routes to market continues to pay off 
and we have made good progress across all 
Business Units in the last year. Whilst revenue 
growth was steady in our Branded Direct 
Business Unit, our Branded Distributed Business 
Unit’s success in the US has continued with 
LiquiBand
®
 gaining market share, and surpassing 
our initial 20% target market share. We have 
also launched a range of dental sutures into 
the US through a new partner and we intend 
to expand our distribution network more widely 
by targeting market opportunities in Asia-Pacific 
and South America.
04
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc

performed well. Our partners have delivered 
good growth supported by a number of new

our success with LiquiBand

™
 Hernia 
Mesh Fixation Device, our first surgical device 
using medical adhesive inside the body, with 
plans in place for open surgery hernia use 
and other secondary indications subject to 
regulatory approval. The success of these 
launches demonstrates the strength and 
breadth of our innovation and our product 
development pipeline.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.62p 
per share, making a total dividend for the year 
of 0.92p per share (2015: 0.80p), an increase of 
15%. If approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
this dividend will be paid on 16 June 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 26 May 2017.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
of our employees for their contributions during 
the past year which have been central to the 
Company’s strong performance. I would also 
like to thank our customers, suppliers, business 
partners and shareholders for their continued 
support in helping AMS achieve its goals.
We ensure that the Group is managed in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code as far as is reasonably practicable, 
although it is not a requirement for an AIM 
quoted company. The Board believes that 
effective corporate governance will assist in the 
delivery of shareholder value and safe-guarding 
shareholders’ long-term interests.
AMS continues to be in robust financial health 
and is well positioned to invest in both internal 
and external opportunities in line with the 
Group’s long-term strategy priorities and 
growth objectives.

Creating quality  
outcomes...
I am pleased to report another strong set of results 
across the Group. Our revenue has increased 
20% to £82.6 million (2015: £68.6 million) and we 
have improved our adjusted
6
 profit before tax and 
before exceptional items by 13% to £19.7 million 
(2015: £17.4 million), marking the twelfth 
consecutive year we have delivered growth in 
revenue, profits and earnings per share.
We continue to deliver on our strategy for growth 
by expanding into new geographies, increasing 
our distribution of surgical products through 
our direct sales forces, enhancing our product 
portfolio and providing high quality products that 
add value to payors in our advanced woundcare 
and surgical markets.
Branded Distributed
The Branded Distributed Business Unit reports 
the sales of our brands through third party 
distributors where the Group does not have a 
direct sales force.
Branded Distributed reported revenue was 42% 
higher at £20.8 million (2015: £14.6 million) 
and 30% higher at constant currency. The main 
contributor to this growth continues to be the 
sales of our LiquiBand
®
 range of products into 
the US, which accounted for 60% of the Business 
Unit’s total sales.

 up from the 
half year and exceeding the initial target of 20% 
set when we first launched this product into 
the US in 2010.
Our LiquiBand

 range of products utilises 
different formulations of cyanoacrylate that 
meet the needs of the surgeon and are sold by 
our distributors throughout the whole of the US. 
LiquiBand
®
 products combine cyanoacrylate 
adhesive technology with innovatively 
designed applicators that are able to meet the 
requirements of the surgeon and the treatment 
of the full spectrum of wounds that they need 
to close and protect. Our US based product sales 
specialists continue to work closely with our 
distributors to convert more hospitals and we are 
now targeting a further 10% market gain above 
our initial target over the next three years, to take 
our market share by volume to at least 30%.
LiquiBand

Outside of the US, in the EU and ROW, our 
sales of LiquiBand

 have increased by 29% to 
£2.2 million (2015: £1.7 million) at reported 
currency and 28% at constant currency. We have 
now started to increase our sales in Asia-Pacific 
by signing distributorships in these regions and 
are supporting these with personnel based in the 
region. We are already seeing some early success 
with an additional seven distributorships agreed, 
selling our tissue adhesives, haemostats and 
sutures. This provides a significant opportunity 
for us in the medium-term.
Our regulatory approval process for LiquiBand
®
 
in China has proved challenging and has been 
paused. The tissue adhesive market in China 
is small and nascent and will take some time 
to develop. In the meantime we will invest 
resources into gaining access into the more 
readily accessible markets in Asia and the 
Middle East.

Annual Report 2016 Hernia Mesh Fixation Device - LiquiBand

 Fix8
™
AMS received approval to market LiquiBand
®
 
Fix8
™
 in Europe in May 2014. This was the Group’s 
first application using medical cyanoacrylate 
technology inside the body. It is used to hold 
hernia meshes in place within the body instead 
of traditional tacks and staples. This accurate 
laparoscopic application of adhesive is expected 
to reduce surgical complications, in particular 
the potential pain associated with the use of 
tacks and staples, thereby improving the patient 
experience and reducing healthcare costs overall.
Surgeon response to LiquiBand
®
 Fix8
™
 has been 
very positive about the ease of use of this device 
and the benefit it brings to patients regarding 
the reduced incidence of post-operative pain. 
Sales of LiquiBand
®
 Fix8
™
 in our Branded 
Distributed Unit increased by 69% to £1.1 million 
(2015: £0.7 million). A number of surgeons 
have endorsed the product and have provided 
valuable feedback about enhancements to the 
device as well as other possible non-hernia 
applications. The Company is actively exploring 
these opportunities. Having had more than 
12 months’ feedback from European usage, 
we have made improvements to the device. 
We are now in a position to start the process 
to gain approval to market this device in the 
US. As this will be a first-to-market device into 
the US, the regulatory process will be a full 
Pre Market Approval (PMA) involving clinical trials. 
Our estimate is that it will take around three years 
to achieve, requiring an investment of at least 
£3.0 million.
RESORBA
®
Sales of RESORBA
®
 products to all export 
markets (excluding Russia) increased by 
25% at reported currency to £3.9 million 
(2015: £3.1 million), and by 12% at constant 
currency. Within this, our sales of dental products 
have increased 33% to £1.9 million and 20% at 
constant currency. This includes our first sales of 
dental sutures into the US following their approval 
from the FDA in 2015.
We launched a range of dental sutures into the 
US with a specialised dental distributor in March 
2016 and have achieved £0.2 million of sales 
in the first year. Gaining US approval for the 
RESORBA
®
 product range has been an aim for 
the Group since we acquired the business in late 
2011 and now provides a significant opportunity 
for the Group in the medium-term. The total 
US surgical suture market is estimated to be 
in excess of $1 billion in size and is dominated 
by a few major brands.
Sales in Russia increased by 28% at constant 
currency, and increased 29% at reported 
currency to £1.0 million (2015: £0.8 million) 
reflecting improved market conditions.
Research and Development
In R&D our focus is on continuing to improve 
the formulations of the base monomers 
that are used in our adhesives as well as 
improving the design and innovation around 
our devices. We have modified the tip and 
priming mechanism of our hernia fixation device 
following surgeon feedback and have started the 
process to get FDA approval to sell this product 
into the US.
Development work has also started on an open 
hernia mesh fixation device which we hope will 
gain approval in Europe this year.
In addition, work has begun on gaining approval 
in Europe for the LiquiBand
®
 Fix 8

 device for 
new indications and it is expected we will be 
selling the first of these in 2018.
Branded Direct
The Branded Direct Business Unit reports sales 
of our branded products through our own 
sales teams in the UK, Germany and Czech 
Republic. Reported revenue increased 10% to 
£24.6 million (2015: £22.3 million) and grew by 
3% at constant currency.
UK
Within the UK we supply our range of woundcare 
dressings, ActivHeal

 into the NHS, supplying 
both hospitals and community care. We supply 
LiquiBand

, haemostats and sutures as part of 
our surgical offering.
ActivHeal
®
ActivHeal
®
 is our range of high quality 
woundcare dressings that offer the NHS 
significant cost savings without compromising 
on clinical outcomes or patient care. Sales of our 
ActivHeal
®
 range decreased by 5% to £6.0 million 
(2015: £6.4 million) as we failed to make up the 
lost ground that occurred during destocking 
in the first half of the year. We have been 
disappointed by this performance and have 
taken a number of initiatives to reinvigorate sales. 
We have refocused our sales efforts, provided 
further training to our commercial team and 
have enhanced our education and marketing 
materials. We have also strengthened our brand 
by broadening the product range being offered 
to include our antimicrobial and atraumatic 
foam dressings. ActivHeal
®
 offers a compelling 
proposition for the NHS and remains a significant 
opportunity for the Group.

 branded products in 
Germany and the Czech Republic increased 
15% at £13.1 million (2015: £11.3 million) at

Within this, sales of haemostats increased 
by 21% to £3.9 million (2015: £3.3 million) 
and by 9% at constant currency, sales of 
sutures and collagens into the dental market 
increased by 14% to £3.5 million and by 3% at 
constant currency, whilst sales of sutures into 
hospitals were increased by 11% to £4.7 million 
(2015: £4.1 million) and flat at constant currency. 
We are seeing some success in targeting smaller 
accounts that should prove quicker to convert. 
However, it can take some time for conversions 
to be fully effective. We believe our ability to 
supply a comprehensive range of high quality 
sutures that provide cost savings to hospitals 
remains compelling.
Sales of RESORBA
®
 sutures and haemostats 
into the NHS increased by 18% to £0.2 million 
(2015: £0.2 million) and this still remains a 
sizeable opportunity for us, even though 
conversion remains slower than we would like.
Research and Development
In R&D, our focus is on extending the attributes 
of our collagens to meet the needs of dental 
surgeons as well as including new antibiotics 
in our haemostats. We also may consider 
licensing our technology to other parties if 
this will result in products being quicker to 
launch. Longer term we are looking to develop 
innovative applications for collagen to address 
unmet clinical needs or improve the outcome 
of current surgical procedures.
OEM
The OEM Business Unit reports the sales of 
products that are sold under third parties’ brands. 
We have been working with several of the world’s 
major woundcare companies for a number 
of years. We provide manufacturing services 
to supply their woundcare dressings, new 
products they can incorporate into their portfolio 
of brands, as well as regulatory assistance in 
obtaining product approvals in overseas markets.
OEM revenue increased by 16% at reported 
currency to £32.1 million (2015: £27.7 million) 
and by 12% at constant currency.
Our OEM business is dependent on the success 
of the customers that our partners serve and 
the outcome of their strategies. Historically, it is 
prone to volatility as a result of ordering patterns, 
pipeline filling associated with new product 
launches and variability surrounding tender 
award allocations. Consequently, revenues and 
product mix can vary from year to year and can 
impact operating margin. In general, as we work 
with a large number of partners, the potential 
effects of this volatility are mitigated. Through the 
latter part of 2016 we have identified that there 
has been a slowdown in activity in the Middle 
East resulting in delays in the determination 
of some hospital tender awards; this is having 
an impact on some of our partners that have 
significant business in the region. We are yet 
to see a reversal of this trend in 2017. This may 
impact performance of this Business Unit in the 
short term, however, we continue to believe in 
the long-term potential of this growth market.
In 2016 we introduced two new ranges of 
foam products; our antimicrobial foam range 
containing Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) 
and our atraumatic foam range incorporating 
silicone, facilitating easy dressing removal from 
sensitive skin. These have been successfully 
launched this year.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 We received CE approval in Europe for 
our antimicrobial dressing on 1 September 
2015. PHMB has been shown to be effective 
against several bacteria including, amongst 
others, Staphylococcus Aureus including the 
methicillin resistant type, (MRSA) and Escherichia 
Coli (E-Coli) and this dressing may be used 
throughout the healing process on moderate to 
heavily exuding chronic and acute wounds that 
are infected or are at risk of infection as well as 
on pressure ulcers, leg and foot ulcers, diabetic 
ulcers and surgical wounds. 
Our PHMB foam dressing range augments our 
antimicrobial, silver alginate dressing ranges 
and provides an alternative method of treating 
infected wounds. We are currently working to 
achieve approval for our PHMB foam dressings 
in the US and once this is received we expect 
to be able to launch later this year. 
Our silver alginate business grew by 4% to 
£16.2 million (2015: £15.5 million) at a reported 
level, but sales were flat at constant currency with 
the silver range taken by one specific partner 
being particularly affected by the slow-down in 
the Middle East. Excluding this partner’s sales, 
the rest of the silver alginate business grew 5% 
at constant currency. 
Our new PHMB dressings may have had some 
impact on our silver alginate business, however, 
our combined sales of all antimicrobial ranges 
have increased by 13% at a reported level to 
£17.5 million (2015: £15.5 million) and by 9% 
at constant currency.
The launch of our range of atraumatic foam 
dressings into our advanced woundcare range 
has further extended our foam portfolio and 
sales of all our foam-based dressings have 
increased 196% to £5.3 million (2015: £1.8 million) 
and by 191% at constant currency.
Sales of other woundcare products have also 
continued to perform well and have increased 
by 9% to £10.5 million (2015: £9.7 million) and by 
5% at constant currency.
During 2016, we renegotiated the supply 
agreement with an OEM partner for collagen 
products, from an exclusive to a non-exclusive 
arrangement, allowing us to now supply an 
enhanced range of collagen products through 
our distributors into the EU and through our 
direct sales force in the UK. In the medium-term, 
we expect increased sales in both our Branded 
Direct and Branded Distributed Business Units, 
as our collagen product portfolio is extended. 
As anticipated, given that the OEM partner is no 
longer required to meet a minimum amount 
of sales to maintain exclusivity, this has resulted 
in a decline of the sales of collagen products 
in the Business Unit, which reduced by 85% to 
£0.1 million and by 87% at constant currency.
Research and Development
We continue to work on extending our advanced 
woundcare portfolio with focus on extending our 
antimicrobial range, improving the absorbency of 
dressings and combining a number of materials 
to enhance product performance.
Bulk Materials
The Bulk Materials Business Unit reports sales of 
bulk materials to third party converters as well as 
supplying foam into the OEM and Branded Direct 
Business Units as a key material in our foam-
based wound dressings.
Bulk Materials revenue increased by 33% at reported 
currency to £5.2 million (2015: £3.9 million) and by 
21% at constant currency.
Rollstock foam contributed around 93% of Bulk 
Materials revenue and good growth was seen 
by several partners.
Research and Development
In R&D, the focus is on developing new foam 
formulations, working in conjunction with the 
OEM Business Unit.
Operations
Efficiency and gross margins
We continue to make operational improvements 
by reducing set up times, eliminating non-value 
added activities and increasing outputs wherever 
possible. These incremental efficiencies help to 
improve gross margins across the Group.
The launches of the two new foam dressing 
ranges have required new converting processes 
to be developed and the success of the launches 
has resulted in significant volumes of new 
product being required. We are pleased that we 
met these significant volume demands, however, 
the initial efficiencies of these processes have 
been lower than for our more established 
ranges and lower than we would expect to 
obtain on a regular basis. We estimate that these 
operating effects have had a negative impact 
of around 400 basis points on the operating 
margins for the OEM Business Unit, where 
most of the sales of these products have been 
recorded. Changes are currently being made 
to the manufacturing processes to improve our 
efficiencies and we would expect to see margin 
improvement in 2017.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive’s Statement continued Capacity and resource
Investment is being made in The Netherlands 
to increase our foam capacity by approximately 
40%. A new line is expected to be operational in 
the second half of 2017.
We continue to invest in improving our ERP 
(Enterprise Resource Planning) management 
and reporting systems and having already 
successfully completed the implementation 
in Winsford, Plymouth and The Netherlands 
facilities where we have converted to Oracle ERP. 
We are now working on implementing Oracle 
ERP in Germany. The project is expected to 
complete in the second half of 2017.
Regulatory and quality assurance
With the regulatory framework becoming 
increasingly complex, we have continued to 
invest in both Regulatory and Quality functions 
and systems to ensure that we are able to 
support our partners with winning approvals in 
new markets as well as obtaining approval for our 
own products.
The FDA conducted its first ever routine 
inspection at the Group in June 2016 at our 
Winsford site and we were pleased with the 
positive outcome.
On the back of our success with LiquiBand
®
 
Fix 8
™
 in Europe we have started work to gain 
approval to market this product in the US which 
will involve a full PMA and is likely to take at 
least three years with an investment of at least 
£3 million.
We are also working on identifying the regulatory 
pathway to approve the inclusion of antibiotics 
in collagens and progressing with obtaining 
approval to sell our collagen products in the 
US. The latter approval is expected in late 2017 / 
early 2018.
Our regulatory approval process for LiquiBand
®
 
in China has continued to be challenging. 
Having resubmitted our files to the Chinese FDA 
further extensive Chinese based clinical trials 
have been requested. As there is a lack of clarity 
around the nature of the trials we have decided 
to cease the process until there is more certainty 
around what is required for approval.
Our culture
As a Group that is highly dependent on the 
innovation and creativity of our employees for 
our future growth and success, it is important 
that we have a culture and set of values that is 
clearly understood across the business. We have 
adopted the business motto of ‘The AMS Care, 
Fair, Dare approach’ to summarise our culture, 
underpin our values, and to deliver results, 
building a sustainable future for our business. 
Under this motto, we have defined the principles 
and expectations of how we will operate 
together to deliver success.
We recognise the importance of our people to 
the Group and that it is only by their effective 
engagement that we will continue to be highly 
successful. We value their commitment and 
determination to achieve and deliver good 
results. Our working environment encourages 
openness, teamwork, an understanding 
of others’ needs and the ability ‘to make a 
difference’. We continue to develop the talent at 
AMS by training and by providing a place to work 
where our employees feel valued, incentivised 
and fulfilled.
Acquisition strategy
The Group is actively looking for businesses that 
fit its acquisition strategy. During the period, an 
opportunity was identified and work undertaken 
to understand the business in more detail. As a 
result of the outcome of this work, a decision 
was taken not to proceed. An exceptional charge 
of £0.4 million has been incurred relating to this 
activity. The Group continues to actively review 
suitable acquisition opportunities.
Referendum vote to leave the EU
There has been no immediate impact on 
the Group’s operations following the UK’s 
referendum vote to leave the EU other than the 
positive impact on currency exchange rates. 
The Group is considering the potential impact 
to the business once the UK leaves the EU 
and has started to plan for this outcome.

ActivHeal

 is the Group’s brand of advanced 
woundcare dressings that it sells into the NHS 
in the UK. The proposition of this brand is that 
it provides a range of ‘good value’, advanced 
woundcare dressings that deliver cost savings 
to the NHS without compromising on clinical 
outcomes or patient care. The ActivHeal
®
 range 
is supported by a dedicated team of experienced 
healthcare professionals and by online education 
modules that provide training on the treatment 
of wounds. With the NHS operating under 
budgetary constraints, ActivHeal
®
 continues 
to provide a good growth opportunity for the 
Group. The range has now been extended to 
include atraumatic silicone foam dressings, 
silicone wound contact layers and antimicrobial 
PHMB foam dressings.
The LiquiBand
®
 range of medical adhesives and 
sealants, based on cyanoacrylate, is used to 
close and protect wounds in a safe and secure 
way. In the UK, LiquiBand
®
 is well recognised 
in the majority of Accident and Emergency 
(A&E) units where its attribute of high strength 
makes it the product of first choice for closing 
trauma wounds.
We also sell LiquiBand
®
 into the OR in the 
UK and Germany where it is used to make 
the final topical skin closure following the 
surgical procedure.
In 2014 we launched our innovative LiquiBand

 that are sold into hospitals, private

RESORBA

’s haemostat range includes 
COLLAGEN-resorb and GENTA-COLL-resorb. 
The latter is a very pure collagen that includes the 
antibiotic gentamicin for use in wounds where 
there is a high risk of infection. Combining the 
suture and collagen technologies, RESORBA

has developed products and brands that are 
particularly applicable to the oral surgery market, 
e.g. PARASORB

adding a range of antibiotics into our haemostats. 
Consideration may also be given to licensing 
technologies to other partners to increase speed 
to market.
Our model of providing ‘high quality good 
value’ ranges to the NHS is applicable to 
our RESORBA

 suture range and we are 
actively working to promote our RESORBA

products within the NHS. We are also aiming 
to extend the use of RESORBA

within the German hospital system.
Creating quality outcomes  
with a proactive approach
Joint infection following an incision  
with a utility knife
“ Four days prior to presenting at the hospital, Mr F. had 
cut himself with a utility knife upon the middle joint of 
his right index finger (extensor). The wound was initially 
repaired using cutaneous sutures; following this the case 
was referred to our healthcare facility.
The patient began to experience increased swelling and 
tenderness upon palpation of the joint. Surgery revealed 
that the original incision had severed the central slip of 
the extensor tendon and had opened the articular 
capsule. A cloudy coloured liquid was draining from the 
location of the joint. A swab was taken and the area 
thoroughly rinsed. The cartilage of the adjacent articular 
surfaces was found to be intact, allowing for a 
preservative course of action to be taken. A GENTA-FOIL 
RESORBA
®
 was cropped to meet the required size and 
shape and was then inserted into the joint with forceps.
A joint-spanning external fixator was placed along 
the extended finger in order to temporarily immobilise 
the joint. The swab collected during surgery produced 
a positive culture of Staphylococcus aureus and 
Staphylococcus sp. (coag neg), The fixator was used 
to immobilise the joint for four weeks, after which it 
was removed and then physiotherapy provided. There 
was no need to remove the GENTA-FOIL RESORBA
®
.
Outcome: Thanks to a proactive approach and the use  
of the external fixator to keep the joint immobilised, the 
implementation of GENTA-FOIL RESORBA
®
 was a 
success with the joint being subsequently preserved.”

upon removal of full leg cast following 
fracture to the right patella
“ The Silicone Non Border dressings were applied 
to the category 3 pressure ulcer to assist in the 
management of exudate, prevent adherence and 
trauma at dressing changes along with providing 
a moist wound environment to aid wound healing. 
Reducing the potential mechanism for pain at 
dressing changes helped promote patient comfort 
and improve clinical outcomes.
The dressing was able to provide effective exudate 
handling as no signs of maceration visible to the  
peri wound area, whilst maintaining a moist wound 
environment and promoting wound progression as 
the wound reduced in size and showed areas of 
new epithelial tissue. The Silicone Foam dressing 
was easy to apply and remove and was atraumatic 
to the patient and was able to aid in the 
management of friable, vulnerable traumatic 
damaged tissue, and the achievement of 
satisfactory clinical outcomes for both the 
patient and the clinician.”

Rollstock foam contributes the majority of sales 
from this Business Unit.
Our medical grade hydrophilic polyurethane 
foam is characterised by its ultrasoft, open-pored, 
medium density structure. It is very conformable 
and offers a high rate of absorbancy with good 
lateral control and fluid uptake.
We are looking to extend our foam range. 
The development of our antimicrobial PHMB 
foam which was launched in 2016 is an example 
of the types of products we are working on.
We are also able to supply film membranes 
with excellent moisture vapour transmission 
rates as well as film-foam membranes that have 
applications in scar reduction.
As the range of foam products we manufacture 
increases, we are investing in increasing our foam 
making capacity in the Netherlands. Our new 
line, which will increase capacity by 40%, is 
expected to be operational in the second half 
of 2017.

Annual Report 2016 Financial Review
Group revenue increased by 20% to £82.6 million 
(2015: £68.6 million). At constant currency, revenue growth 
was 13%.
The Group uses alternative performance measures such as 
adjusted operating margin, adjusted profit before tax, net operating 
cash flow pre-exceptional items, together with current revenue 
measures restated at constant exchange rates, to allow the users of 
the accounts to gain a clearer understanding of the performance 
of the business, allowing the impacts of amortisation, exceptional 
items and exchange rate volatility to be separately identified.
The Group incurred an exceptional expense of £0.4 million in the 
year relating to an aborted acquisition (2015: nil).
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets was £0.2 million in the 
period (2015: £0.4 million).
To aid comparison, the Group’s adjusted income statement is 
summarised in Table 1 below.

Annual Report 2016
Company Overview
Strategic Report  
Governance
Financial Statements Financial Review continued
Revenues were favourably impacted by approximately 
£4.9 million due to the effects of currency movements in the year. 
Gross margin reduced overall by 80bps due to adverse operational 
variances on new woundcare ranges, partly offset by mix changes 
and the favourable impact of currency movements.
Adjusted operating profit before exceptional items increased 
by 13% to £19.7 million (2015: £17.4 million) but the adjusted 
operating margin reduced by 150 bps to 23.9% (2015: 25.4%). 
Administration costs excluding exceptional items increased by 
23% to £27.3m (2015: £22.1 million) due to currency movements 
and further investment in selling and marketing, particularly to 
support the Branded Direct Business Unit. There was also a benefit 
from the translation of US dollar receivables. The Group expensed 
£2.3 million of R&D to the Income Statement (2015: £1.8 million). 
Spend as a percentage of sales increased to 2.8% (2015: 2.6%).
Profit before tax for the year was 12% higher at £19.1 million 
(2015: £17.0 million).
Table 2: Taxation %
Weighted average Group tax rate 22.11
Loss utilisation and recognition (1.06)
Patent box relief (1.27)
R&D relief (0.96)
Expenses not deductible, prior year adjustments, depreciation and share based payments (0.97)
Effective taxation rate 17.85
The Group’s effective rate of tax for the year was 17.9% 
(2015: 16.9%). This is reflective of the utilisation of previously 
unrecognised brought-forward UK tax losses, Patent Box relief 
and R&D tax credits. It also reflects the impact of blending profits 
and losses from different countries and the different tax rates 
associated with these countries. The effective tax rate of the Group 
is expected to increase in 2017, as the Group is no longer classified 
as a Small Medium Enterprise (SME) and will no longer be able 
to gain R&D tax credits at the SME rate. We estimate that this will 
increase our taxation rate by approximately 2%.
A reconciliation between the weighted average Group tax rate  
and the Group’s effective rate is summarised in Table 2 above.
Earnings (excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
and before exceptional items) increased by 12% to £16.3 million 
(2015: £14.5 million), resulting in a 12% increase in adjusted basic 
earnings per share to 7.77p (2015: 6.95p) and a 12% increase in 
adjusted diluted earnings per share to 7.66p (2015: 6.86p).
Profit after tax increased by 11% to £15.7 million 
(2015: £14.1 million), resulting in a 10% increase in basic earnings 
per share to 7.48p (2015: 6.78p) and a 10% increase in diluted 
earnings per share to 7.38p (2015: 6.68p).
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.62p per share, to be 
paid on 16 June 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 26 May 2017. This follows the interim dividend of 
0.30p per share that was paid on 28 October 2016 and would, if 
approved, make a total dividend for the year of 0.92p per share 
(2015: 0.80p), a 15% increase on 2015.
The operational performance of the Business Units is shown 
in Table 3 on page 31. The adjusted profit from operations and 
the adjusted margin are shown after excluding amortisation of 
acquired intangibles. To aid comparison and in determining the 
operational margins of the individual Business Units, the revenue of 
the Bulk Materials Business Unit sales made to other Business Units 
of £1.8 million (2015: £0.8 million) is included.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Branded Distributed
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit increased to 
30.9% (2015: 30.7%), supported by US sales growth, but was lower 
than the margin reported in H1 2016 (35.4%), reflecting a higher 
than usual proportion of US sales in H1 and an increase in business 
unit operating expenses as a result of investment in sales and 
marketing personnel.
Branded Direct
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit reduced to 
20.8% (2015: 24.4%) mainly due to continued investment in sales 
and marketing and was lower than the position at H1 2016 (23.7%) 
mainly due to the phasing of fee income which occurred in the 
first six months of the year.
OEM
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit reduced to 
21.5% (2015: 25.9%) due to adverse operational variances on new 
woundcare ranges albeit higher than the margin reported at H1 
2016 (18.1%). It is worth noting that some of the margin benefit 
arising from the substantial increase in OEM foam sales is reported 
in the Bulk Materials Business Unit and is part of the reason for the 
increase in operating margin in that Business Unit.
Bulk Materials
The adjusted operating margin of this Business Unit increased 
to 25.5% (2015: 17.1%), and improved from the position in H1 
2016 (22.9%). Margins were affected by the higher volumes 
of production and sales, including a substantial increase in 
intercompany sales to the OEM Business Unit.

Geographic Breakdown of Revenues
The geographic breakdown of Group revenues in 2016 is shown in 
Table 4 above: 
48% of the Group’s sales are in Europe (excluding the UK) of 
which 59% are denominated in Euros. Approximately 95% of all 
sales to the US are denominated in US Dollars. The Group hedges 
significant transaction exposure by using forward contracts 
and options and aims to have 70% of its estimated transactional 
exposure for the next 12 months hedged. The Group estimates 
that a 10% movement in the £:US$ or £:Euro exchange rate 
will impact Sterling revenues by approximately 2.7% and 3.1% 
respectively and in the absence of any hedging this would have an 
impact on profit of 2.2% and 0.5%.

Financial Statements Adjusted EBITDA increased by 15% to £23.7 million 
(2015: £20.6 million).
Working capital increased in the year in line with the growth of the 
business. 4.4 months of supply of inventory was held across the 
Group (2015: 4.4 months of supply). Trade receivable days were in 
line with prior year at 41 days (2015: 41 days) while trade payable 
days decreased slightly to 33 days (2015: 34 days).
The Group generated net cash from operating activities of 
£21.9 million (2015: £22.5 million) (see Table 5) and had net cash 
of £51.1 million (2015: £34.2 million) at the end of the year.
In the year, we invested £2.6 million in capital equipment, software 
and capitalised R&D (2015: £2.7 million), including ERP software 
and internally developed products.
The Group generated a free cash flow of £17.3 million in the year 
(2015: £18.6 million). The conversion of adjusted operating profit 
into free cash flow was 88% (2015: 107%).
The Group paid its final dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2015 of £1.2 million (2015: for the year ending 2014, £1.0 million) 
on 10 June 2016, and its interim dividend for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 of £0.6 million (2015: £0.6 million) on 
28 October 2016.
In December 2014 the Group entered into a five-year, £30 million, 
multi-currency revolving credit facility with an accordion option 
under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on 
the same terms. The previous facility for £4 million was due to 
expire in 2015. The Group chose to take advantage of favourable 
credit conditions to put in place a more suitable facility to support 
its growth ambitions. The new facility is provided jointly by the 
Group’s existing bankers, HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of 
Scotland PLC. It is unsecured and has not been drawn down. 
This facility carries an annual interest rate of LIBOR or EURIBOR 
plus a margin that varies between 0.65% and 1.75% depending on 
the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
At the end of the period, the Group had net cash of £51.1 million 
(2015: £34.2 million). The movement in net cash from the start of 
the year to net cash at the end of the year is reconciled in Table

Why we measure it
We see revenue growth as a 
contributing factor to our aim 
of providing long-term value for 
our shareholders.
Progress made in the year
Revenue has increased by 
20% in 2016 to £82.6 million 
(2015: £68.6 million), representing 
growth of 20% (13% on a constant 
currency basis). Our strategy 
of having multiple products 
and multiple routes to market 
continues to pay off and we have 
made good progress across all 
Business Units in the last year.
Why we measure it
We see OTIF as a contributing 
factor to our aim of providing 
excellent service to our customers.
Progress made in the year
OTIF fell to 90% in 2016 
(2015: 96%), which is lower 
than the average Group OTIF 
of 96% over the previous four 
years. OTIF was impacted 
by an interruption in service 
from our steriliser, who 
experienced difficulties when 
they commissioned a new plant 
resulting in extended turnaround 
times. These issues have now 
been resolved. OTIF is expected to 
return to levels of previous years 
in 2017.

Why we measure it
We see operating margin 
as important to ensure the 
sustainability of our business and 
to our aim of providing long-term 
value for our shareholders.
Progress made in the year
The launch of the two new foam 
dressing ranges has required 
new converting processes to be 
developed and the success of the 
launches has resulted in significant 
volumes of new product being 
required. The initial efficiencies of 
these processes have been lower 
than for our more established 
ranges and lower than we would 
expect to obtain on a regular 
basis. This has had a negative 
impact at the Winsford site. 
Improvements are being made to 
our processes in 2017.
Why we measure it
We see EPS as an important factor

Health, Safety and Environment
The Health and Safety of our staff, visitors to 
our facilities, and those who carry out work 
on our behalf, is of the utmost importance to 
us. Identifying and complying with applicable 
legislation underpins our Health and Safety 
activities and improvement initiatives. The Board 
provides Health, Safety and Environmental 
(HSE) leadership and the Chief Executive 
Officer has primary responsibility for setting 
the principles. The Chief Financial Officer, 
supported by the Group Operations Director, 
ensures adequate resource is available to support 
operational health, safety and environmental 
improvement plans.
We have established HSE Committees at each 
site which meet monthly. These Committees 
report monthly to the Senior Management Team 
and to the Board. We focus on the prevention 
of accidents and incidents through proactive 
reporting of potential hazards.
Over the last 12 months we have focused our 
resources to improve the level of accountability 
and expectation for continuous improvement 
in Health and Safety. Initiatives to improve 
involvement and accountability will continue 
over the foreseeable future to help us to further 
reduce our accident potential. 
Safety Performance 2016
Our All Injury Rate (AIR) was 5.353 in 2016 and 
has been below the target of 6.0 over the past 3

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Environment
It is the Group’s policy to abide by all laws, 
directives and regulations relevant to its field 
of operations and to act in a manner so as 
to minimise the effects of our operations on 
the environment. 
As AMS has operations across a number 
of countries, local management drives 
environmental performance. Specific  
site-level objectives are established to 
ensure compliance with local legislative and 
external management system requirements. 
AMS uses a variety of indicators to monitor 
environmental performance.
Community
We are committed to supporting and having a 
positive interaction with our local communities. 
The Whitechapel Centre is the leading homeless 
and housing charity for the Liverpool region. 
They work with people who are sleeping rough, 
living in hostels or struggling to manage their 
accommodation. They are committed to helping 
people find and maintain a home and learn 
the life skills essential for independent living. 
AMS has supported the Whitechapel Centre for 
the last two years and at Christmas employees 
provided over two hundred shoe boxes wrapped 
as presents containing essential items such as 
toiletries and warm clothing, and Christmas gifts. 
These contributions are matched financially by 
the Company.
AMS sponsors a number of sports charities and 
clubs in the area. We have sponsored the annual 
Pie & Peas 5 mile race for three years, which 
is organised by the local athletics club based 
in Winsford, Cheshire, Vale Royal A.C. As well 
as sponsoring this local race, employees are 
encouraged to participate in pre-race training 
programs to foster employee well being as well 
as enjoying good-humoured rivalry. AMS aims to 
promote participation in sports and exercise so as 
to encourage healthy lifestyles.
We also sponsor our local ladies football club, 
Witton Albion Ladies FC, who receive no 
other funding and are coached by one of our 
employees in their spare time, as well as a local 
junior rugby team (Crewe and Nantwich RUFC 
Junior Colts).
We are involved with some international charities. 
We sponsor a number of children in Africa 
and Asia through Plan International, a charity 
that promotes child rights and aims to end 
child poverty.
We intend to continue to provide ongoing 
support to these and other events.

Financial Statements Risk Management
Creating quality outcomes  
by managing risk
Risk and uncertainty are an inherent part of 
doing business and could have an impact on our 
business, brands, assets, revenue, profits, liquidity 
and capital resources. To meet our strategic 
objectives, build shareholder value and promote 
our stakeholders’ interests, we must manage 
this risk.
An effective and successful risk management 
process balances risk and reward and is 
dependent on the judgement of the likelihood 
and impact of the risk involved. The Board has 
overall responsibility for ensuring there is an 
effective risk management framework, which 
underpins our business model.
The Business Units, Senior Management Team 
(SMT), Audit Committee and Board review risks 
throughout the year. These risks are documented 
in the Risk Register which is formally reviewed 
by the SMT, Internal Audit and the Board twice 
annually. The plans and actions assigned to 
the Executive Directors and SMT members are 
reviewed to ensure progress in being made with 
risk and mitigation plans.
We believe that the policies, procedures and 
monitoring systems that are in place are 
sufficient to effectively manage the risks faced by 
our business.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Identifying Risks
A robust methodology is used to identify key risks 
across the Group; in Business Units, operations 
and during projects. This is an ongoing process.
Analysing Risks
Once identified, the process will evaluate identified 
risks to establish root causes, financial and non-
financial impacts and likelihood of occurrence. 
We use a scoring system to assess the likelihood 
of a risk materialising and the potential financial 
impact on the Group. The risks are prioritised 
in terms of severity based on the scoring and 
a mitigation plan is prepared to reduce the 
risk. Once controls and mitigating factors are 
considered, the risk is reassessed and re-scored 
(mitigated score) to ascertain the net exposure.
Managing Risk
The SMT, Internal Audit and the Board review 
the Risk Register formally at least twice a year, 
assessing whether the risks are still the most 
significant facing the Group and whether new 
risks have arisen. Effectiveness, adequacy of 
controls and mitigating actions are assessed 
and if additional controls or actions are required, 
these are identified and actions assigned. 
The Risk Register documents this. 
Monitoring and Reporting Risk 
The SMT is responsible for monitoring progress 
to mitigate key risks. The risk management 
process is continuous; key risks are reported  
to the Board following the bi-annual review  
of the Group’s Risk Register. 
Internal Audit
Additionally, the Board is supported by a program 
of Internal Audits. Internal Audit reports to 
the Audit Committee on progress of control 
or process improvements following Internal 
Audit recommendations.

Annual Report 2016 Effectiveness
Board Composition
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and three Non-Executive 
Directors. The Directors’ profiles appear on pages 42 and 43 and detail their experience and 
suitability for leading and managing the Group. Together they bring a valuable range of expertise and 
experience to the Group. No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision making 
process. The Chairman fosters a climate of debate and challenge in the boardroom, built on his 
challenging but supportive relationship with the Chief Executive Officer which sets the tone for Board 
interaction and discussions.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed to the Board following a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process, involving external recruitment agencies, to select individuals who have a depth and breadth 
of relevant experience, thus ensuring that the selected candidates will be capable of making an 
effective and relevant contribution to the Board. The process for the appointment of Non- Executive 
Directors is managed by the Nomination Committee, whose responsibilities are outlined on page 49.
Diversity
We recognise the importance of diversity at Board level and our Board members comprise a number 
of different nationalities with a wide range of skills and experiences from a variety of business 
backgrounds. Our current female representation on the Board is 33.3%, already above the minimum 
representation level which was to be achieved by 2015. Additionally, the Senior Management Team 
also has a diverse experience. Its members comprise of several nationalities and female representation 
is 37.5%.
Terms of Appointment and Time Commitment
All Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years subject to satisfactory 
performance. After this time they may serve additional three year terms following review by the 
Board. All Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper 
performance of their duties. Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings and Committee 
meetings of which they are members and any additional meetings as required.
Further details of their terms and conditions are summarised in the Remuneration Report on page 
62 and the terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available at the 
Company’s Registered Office.
Tenure Chart
The size of the Board during 2016 was six and the tenure was as follows.
The Company follows the Code as far as is practicable. The Board notes the tenure requirement for 
a Non-Executive Director who has served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of first 
election to not be considered to be independent (Code Provision B.1.1.). Steve Bellamy has served 
as a Non-Executive Director for 10 years (February 2017). Due to his extensive experience with the 
Company, and that the Board consider him to be independent of character and judgement, he is 
considered to be an independent Director. As such Steve Bellamy will be subject to annual re-election 
starting in 2017 (Code Provision B.7.1.).
The Board further notes that under Code Provision B.1.2 a smaller company (below FTSE 350) must 
have at least 2 independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board consider Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy, 
Penny Freer and Peter Steinmann to be independent.
Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer own shares in the Company. These holdings have been 
highlighted to shareholders and are small. They are not considered to impact Non-Executive Director 
independence under Code Provision B.1.1.
Code Provision B.2.3. states that any term beyond six years for a Non-Executive Director should 
be subject to rigorous review, taking into account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. 
The Board reviewed the appointments of Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer, and consider that their 
continued appointment does not present any issues.

New Directors are given a formal induction process including details of how the Board and Committees operate, meetings with Senior 
Management and information on Group strategy, products and performance. Training and development needs of Directors are reviewed 
regularly. The Directors are kept appraised of developments in legal, regulatory and financial matters affecting the Group by the Deputy

Committees. The Board reviews the outcomes of the Committee evaluations and assesses their performance. The Chairman confirms 
that the performance of the Non-Executive Directors continues to be effective.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Going Concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position and cash 
flow forecasts for the next 12 months from signing of the accounts. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, 
expenditure and cash flows, taking into account specific business risks and the current economic environment.
With regard to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year end of £51.1 million (2015: £34.2 million) and 
was debt free (2015: debt free). The Group agreed a five-year, £30 million, multi-currency, revolving credit facility in December 2014 with 
an accordion option under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on the same terms. The new facility is provided jointly 
by the Group’s existing bank HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and replaced the previous £4 million facility. It is unsecured 
on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates in a market whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by 
an increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a number 
of long-term contracts with customers across different geographic regions and also with substantial financial resources, ranging from 
government agencies through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration, the Directors have reached the conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements.
Remuneration
The level of remuneration of the Directors is set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 64.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board appreciates that effective communication with the Company’s shareholders and the investment community as a whole 
is a key objective. The Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement and the Strategic Report and Financial Review, together with 
the information in the Annual Report of the Group, provides a detailed review of the business. The views of both institutional and private 
shareholders are important, and these can be varied and wide-ranging, as is their interest in the Company’s strategy, reputation and 
performance. The Executive Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring effective communication and the Company maintains 
a regular dialogue with its shareholders, mainly in the periods following the announcement of the interim and final results, but also 
at other times during the year. The views of shareholders are sought through direct contact and via feedback from advisors and are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. The Board encourages the participation of shareholders at its Annual General Meeting, notice 
of which is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. The AMS website ‘www.admedsol.com’ is regularly updated 
and provides additional information on the Group including information on the Group’s products and technology.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will, as last year, include a presentation by the Chief Executive Officer on the current progress of the business and 
allow the opportunity for questions on this or any of the resolutions. The Company proposes separate resolutions for each issue and 
specifically relating to the report and accounts. The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and indicates the level of proxies on 
each resolution along with the abstentions after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders have the opportunity to talk informally to the Board and raise any further questions or issues they may 
have. The outcome of the AGM, a copy of the AGM presentation and details of the poll results will be posted on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.

in the Annual Report how they have assessed the prospects of the Company, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate. The Committee reviews the analysis undertaken in relation to strategic risk management and 
risk assessment, risk appetite, internal control, risk and control reporting structure and the principal risks identified on an ongoing 
basis. This monitoring and review validates the draft statement which was documented for the first time in 2016.

Terms of Reference
 e The Committee’s Terms of Reference are reviewed annually in line with the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA) 
guidance to reflect the UK Governance Code. 
To assess the effectiveness of our External Auditor, a formal performance review is undertaken on an annual basis to identify the 
adequacy of their approach to: 
Resource quality: – it is important that the External Auditor has achieved the right balance of audit team resource. With the team 
providing both continuity and knowledge, as well as a fresh perspective through new team members to allow processes and accounting 
policies to be challenged. 
Effective communication: – key audit judgements are communicated at the earliest opportunity to promote discussion and challenge 
between the External Auditors and management, informing AMS of audit issues as they arise, so that these can be dealt with in a timely 
manner. Communication regarding good practice, changes to reporting requirements and accounting standards is also needed to 
enable the company to be prepared prior to year end. Timely provision of audit papers is required to enable adequate management 
review and feedback. The quality of the reports and publications provided by the External Auditor in terms of content, relevance and 
presentation is reviewed. 
Scoping and planning: – specifically relating to the year-end audit work: timely provision of the External Audit strategy and timetable 
to Audit Committee and management. 
Fees: – are transparent and communicated prior to the commencement of any work undertaken. Where variations occur, these are 
informed at the earliest opportunity to enable dialogue and negotiation to be undertaken.
Auditor independence: – the Committee continues to monitor the External Auditor’s compliance with applicable ethical guidance and 
guidelines and considers the independence and objectivity of the External Auditor as part of the Committee’s duties. The Committee 
received and reviewed written confirmation from the External Auditor on all relationships that, in their judgement, may bear on their 
independence. The External Auditor has also confirmed that they consider themselves independent within the meaning of UK regulatory 
and professional requirements. 
52
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016
Audit Committee Report continued The External Auditor may be appointed to provide non-audit services where it is in the Group’s best interests to do so, provided a number 
of criteria are met. These are that the External Auditor does not: 
 e Audit their own work
 e Make management decisions for the Group
 e Create a conflict of interest 
 e Find themselves in the role of an advocate for the Group
All projects where forecasted expenditure exceeded £10,000 were approved by the Audit Committee. Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s 
External Auditor for eight financial years and the engagement partner has completed his five years as audit partner. Therefore, to aid in the 
smooth transition of engagement partner in 2017, Deloitte has already commenced the introduction of a new engagement partner to 
the Group and the External Audit team. Following the positive outcome of a performance and effectiveness evaluation undertaken by the 
management, the Audit Committee concluded that it was appropriate to recommend to the Board the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as 
the Group’s External Auditor for the next financial year. 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit at AMS is managed and delivered by an external firm of Auditors, RSM UK, to provide this service under the direction and 
guidance of the Audit Committee. Against an agreed mandate, this function performs independent Internal Audits across the Group. 
A two-year Internal Audit strategy and an annual Internal Audit plan are approved by the Audit Committee each year. Internal Audits target 
areas of risk and provide assurance that key controls are effectively designed and operated consistently. Audit reports are produced to 
convey the extent of control assurance derived from the formal testing of controls. RSM UK’s findings and recommendations are reported 
directly to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee:
 e Reviews and approves the charter of the Internal Audit function and ensures the function has the necessary resources and access 
to information to enable it to fulfil its mandate and is equipped to perform in accordance with appropriate professional standards 
for Internal Auditors;
 e Approves the appointment and the termination of the Internal Auditors;
 e Ensures the Internal Auditor has direct access to the Board Chairman and to the Committee Chairman and is accountable to 
the Committee;
 e Reviews and assesses the annual Internal Audit workplan;
 e Receives a report on the results of the Internal Auditors work at least twice per year;
 e Reviews and monitors management’s responsiveness to the Internal Auditor’s findings and recommendations and the corrective 
actions taken;
 e Meets with the Internal Auditor at least once a year without the presence of management; and
 e Monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s controls in the context of the Company’s overall risk management system.
All Internal Audit reports are discussed with the Audit Committee and the External Auditor, and the recommendations considered 
and acted upon. RSM UK attends Audit Committee meetings twice a year and updates the Audit Committee in writing ahead of each 
Committee meeting.
In 2016 the Internal Auditor undertook detailed audits of the Process Improvement Plan and Group Payroll at Plymouth, together with 
a review of previous audit reports. The recommendations of Internal Audit were accepted by the Audit Committee and acted upon. 
In 2017 audits are scheduled for Cyber Security and Planning and Forecasting. The Group also calls on the services of external bodies 
to review the controls in certain areas of the Group. The quality assurance systems are reviewed by the Group’s notified bodies, the 
British Standards Institute (BSI) and TÜV Rheinland LGA Products GmbH, on a regular basis.
The Internal Controls Framework is available for all employees to view on the Intranet. Updates are driven by an underlying process 
change or by the outcomes of Internal Audit projects. Issues are identified, the policies are updated and then approved by the Group 
Financial Controller and Chief Financial Officer. The updated policies are then formally approved by the Board.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Risk Management and Internal Controls
To achieve good internal controls the Board takes responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness, taking guidance from the Audit Committee. The Board monitors and reviews all material controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls. Risks arising from operations can only be managed rather than eliminated. Only reasonable 
and not absolute assurances can be made against material loss or misstatement. Key features of the internal control system are:
 e The Group has an organisational structure with clear responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group promotes the values 
of integrity and professionalism. The members of the Board are available to hear, in confidence, any individual’s concerns 
about improprieties;
 e The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its consideration. This schedule includes potential acquisitions, capital projects, 
treasury policies and management systems, risk management systems and policies, approval of budgets, re-forecasts and Health 
and Safety
 e The Board or the Audit Committee reviews the Risk Register at least twice a year;
 e The Board monitors the activities of the Group through the management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports on current 
activities and plans. The Senior Management Team, at least monthly, monitors financial and operational performance in detail; 
 e The Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation which must be adhered to as the Group concludes its business; 
 e An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with in-built controls over process and authority, minimising manual intervention and 
overall strengthening controls is in place in the UK and the Netherlands and is being implemented in Germany; and
 e The Group operates a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy enabling any individual with a concern to approach any of the Non-Executive Directors 
in confidence.
As part of the External Auditor’s annual review process, any weaknesses identified in the Group’s internal control system are reported 
to and discussed with the Audit Committee and corrective actions are agreed.
Risk Management
The Group’s corporate objective is to maximise long-term shareholder value, recognising that creating value is the reward for taking and 
accepting risk. The Directors consider risk management to be crucial to the Group’s success and give it a high priority to ensure that 
adequate systems are in place to evaluate and limit risk exposure.
Management formally reviews the Risk Register at least twice a year. Risks are evaluated for both likelihood and financial impact and 
scored against both criteria. This is used to identify the most significant risks the business faces. These risks have been identified and are 
discussed in more detail in the Strategic Review on pages 4 to 41. Actions are agreed to mitigate the risks. 
At each review, progress on actions is assessed and further actions may be identified. Risks are re-scored and the effects of mitigating 
actions taken are used to identify a residual risk score. Management also gives consideration to other risks that have been identified, score 
these risks to understand significance and assign actions to be taken to mitigate, if required. The process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group is ongoing throughout the year.
Management report to the Audit Committee at least twice a year on the Risk Register. The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s Risk 
Register and the effectiveness of Management’s actions to mitigate the risks. 
As part of the External Auditor’s annual review process, any key risks and areas of audit focus are also identified and agreed with the 
Audit Committee. 
In September 2014 the FRC issued guidance on ‘Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial & Business Reporting’. 
The new guidance was applied in the Group’s 2015 accounting period. The Audit Committee believes it meets the FRC requirements.

Remuneration Report Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy is formulated around the need to provide a remuneration structure that is competitive to attract, retain and 
motivate Senior Executives of the calibre required to develop and implement the Company’s strategy and enhance earnings over the 
long-term, whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A cohesive reward structure consistently applied 
with links to corporate performance is seen as crucial in ensuring attainment of the Group’s strategic goals. It is the intention of this policy 
to conform to best practice as far as reasonably practicable. It will continue to apply for 2017 and subsequent years, subject to regular 
review and supported by independent advice. The Committee retains the right for discretion, although no discretion was used in 2016. 
The policy is based around the following key principles:
 e Total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre 
Senior Executives;
 e Total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests;
 e The design of long-term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk; and
 e In considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Group and of each 
individual Executive Director.
Kepler, part of Mercer (previously Kepler Associates), were engaged in 2014 to advise the Committee with regard to the remuneration 
of the Executives and SMT. The Committee took into account recommendations which included the introduction of an Executive 
Shareholding Policy requiring the Executive Directors and SMT to hold a minimum of 100% and 50% respectively, of their pre-tax annual 
salary in Company shares within five years of attaining office, as well as changes to the bonus scheme. As a result of the Committee’s 
recommendations a Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and options have been 
issued under the DAB every year since its introduction. All SMT members exceeded the threshold as at 31 December 2016, except one 
member who had only been appointed 18 months earlier. Each Executive Director’s remuneration package consists of basic salary, 
bonus, LTIPs, health and insurance benefits, and pension contributions. The Committee ensures that there is a balance between fixed 
and performance related remuneration elements.
Consideration of Shareholder Views
In formulating the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholder representative bodies, 
including the Investment Association, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association and Institutional Shareholder Services. 
The Committee also takes into consideration any views expressed by shareholders during the year (including at the AGM) and encourages 
open dialogue with its largest shareholders. Major shareholders are consulted in advance about changes to the remuneration policy.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary 
increases and remuneration for the Executive Directors. For example, as explained on page 59, reflecting the wider cost of living increase 
for the 2017 financial year, the Committee determined to only increase the basic salary for the Executive Directors by the cost of living.
Statement of Voting at General Meeting
At the 2016 AGM, the percentages of votes cast ‘for’, ‘against’ and ‘withheld’ in respect of the Directors’ Remuneration Report were

In line with the policy outlined on page 56 
salary levels of Executive Directors and the SMT 
are set after taking into account experience, 
responsibilities and performance, both on an 
individual and business perspective, and external 
market data (benchmarked against companies of 
a similar size and complexity and other companies 
in the same industry sector).
Salaries are reviewed annually (normally 
December, with any changes effective from 
1 January). Details of the current salaries of the 
Executive Directors are set out below. This review 
was last carried out in November 2016. There is 
no prescribed maximum annual increase. 
The Committee will take into account the general 
increase for the broader employee population in 
the UK but on occasions may need to recognise, 
for example, an increase in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of the role. Current salary levels are 
set out on page 59.
Where there is a change in responsibility, 
progression in the role, change in size or structure 
of the Group or increased experience of the 
Executive Director or member of the SMT, the 
Committee retains the discretion to award a 
higher increase than the UK workforce.

Each of the Executive Directors is entitled 
under the terms of their service agreements to 
receive an Annual Bonus to be determined by 
the Committee based on the Group’s financial 
performance and the achievement of specific 
personal targets set by the Committee.
The maximum Annual Bonus potential is 120% 
of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
100% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, of 
which 85% of the award is dependent on financial 
performance targets and 15% on personal 
objectives. Bonuses are paid in a mixture of cash 
and shares with an element deferred under the 
Deferred Annual Bonus scheme.
The annual performance bonus is focused on the 
delivery of strategically important performance 
targets. These include demanding financial and 
non-financial measures. The financial targets 
are currently set against Group revenue, Group 
profit before tax and Earnings Per Share. 85% 
of the award is dependent upon the financial 
performance of the Group and 15% is achievable 
for meeting personal objectives.
The SMT are entitled to receive up to 50% of 
their salary in bonus, of which 86% of the award 
is dependent on financial performance targets 
and 14% on personal objectives. The Committee 
may use different measures and/or weightings for 
future bonus cycles to take into account changes 
in the strategic needs of the business.
Deferred Annual 
Bonus (DAB)
Provides mechanism 
to exercise 
malus provisions.
Following advice from Mercer (formally Kepler) 
regarding corporate governance developments 
in remuneration, the Committee introduced 
a Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Scheme after 
receiving shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM 
whereby both Executive Directors and the SMT are 
required to defer up to 25% of their Annual Bonus 
into share awards that will vest after three years.

the payment of some bonus to be made in the 
form of shares. It also allows for the provision of 
matching shares if the bonus shares are held for 
a set period. The DSB encourages employees 
to acquire shares in the Company and retain 
those shares to receive additional free shares 
from the Company. It acts as a valuable retention 
tool aligning employees’ interests with those of 
shareholders. The first year that the DSB operated 
was in 2007. The existing scheme received

To align the interests 
of the Executive 
Directors and the SMT 
with shareholders and 
incentivise long-term 
value creation.
The Company introduced a new Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP) at the 2014 AGM, 
replacing the LTIP introduced in 2006. The LTIP 
permits an annual grant of shares that vest subject 
to performance and continued employment. 
The LTIP awards are granted in accordance 
with the rules of the plan. Individuals who are 
entitled to awards under the 2014 LTIP are not 
eligible to receive options under the Company’s 
Share Option Plan or the Executive Share 
Option Scheme.
Under the rules of the LTIP, the maximum annual 
award size is 200% of salary. Details of the 
proposed award level for 2016 are set out below. 
Awards under the LTIP may be granted in the 
form of nil-cost options or cash (where the award 
cannot be settled in shares). Awards are currently 
structured with a consideration of £1.
50% of the Award is determined based on the 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance of 
the Company compared with the AIM Healthcare 
Share Index over the vesting period and 50% of 
the Award is determined by the growth in the 
average Earnings Per Share (EPS) per year of the 
Company over the three-year vesting period 
commencing on the award date. 
Of the 50% of the Award that is determined by 
reference to the AIM Healthcare Share Index, no 
shares will be awarded if the Company is ranked 
below the median. Awards will vest on a sliding 
scale from 25% to 100% for performance above 
median to upper quartile performance against 
the Index. The performance measurement for 
EPS will be based on the percentage increase 
of the Company’s EPS over a three-year period 
commencing on the 1 January. Awards will vest 
on a sliding scale from 25% to 100% for an average 
increase of EPS from target EPS to an average 
increase of EPS of 20% over the vesting period. 
No awards will be made for an average increase 
of EPS below target EPS. In 2014 the EPS target 
was set at 5%.
The Committee has the flexibility to make 
appropriate adjustments to the performance 
conditions to ensure that the Award achieves 
its purpose. Any vesting is also subject to the 
Committee being satisfied that the Company’s 
performance on these measures is consistent with 
the underlying performance of the business.
Pensions To provide a 
market competitive 
remuneration 
package to enable 
the recruitment 
and retention of the 
Executive Directors 
and SMT.
All UK employees are entitled to become 
members of the Group Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme which was set up with effect 
from 1 February 1999. The Scheme entitles 
Executive Directors to contribute up to 10% of 
salary with the Group contributing 10%. All other 
UK employees contribute a minimum of 3% of 
their salary which is matched by a 6% contribution 
of the Group. The Pension Plan is a money 
purchase scheme. In 2011, the Group made 
arrangements allowing individuals to sacrifice their 
salary for pension contributions. 
Following changes in the taxation of personal UK 
pension contributions, and limitations on the size 
of individual personal pension funds, the Group 
has agreed that an employee may substitute the 
pension contributions they would have received 
from the Group for salary.
Automatic enrolment has been implemented for 
all UK employees.

The table above summarises the payments made and additional amounts earned by the Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors for the 2015 and 2016 financial years. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee (Steve Bellamy 
and Penny Freer) received a supplementary fee of £3,000 for chairing the Committees. The Deferred Annual Bonus recorded in the 
table above is in respect of the 2015 and 2016 financial years, to be paid or deferred into shares, which will not be received until 2018 and 
2019 respectively. The Executive Directors were granted further LTIPs as detailed on page 60. All Directors have confirmed that, save as 
disclosed in the single figures of remuneration tables above, they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration.
Salaries and Fees
Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee determined there would be an increase of 2% for Executive Director base salary for 2017. The Group’s 
employees also received a 2% salary increase for the 2017 financial year.
Director 2017 2016 % increase
Chris Meredith £270,300 £265,000 2%
Mary Tavener £209,100 £205,000 2%
Annual Performance Bonus
The Annual Bonus contains two elements — the cash element and the deferred share element. The bonus is determined on both 
financial targets and personal objectives. Up to 25% of the bonus is deferred into shares in line with the malus provisions. The Annual 
Bonus payments presented in the table above were based on performance against growth in Group revenue, adjusted Profit before Tax, 
and EPS, and performance against personal performance objectives measured over the relevant financial year. The maximum bonus 
potential for the year ending 31 December 2017 will remain as 120% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% for the Chief 
Financial Officer. 
The personal objectives for the Executive Directors are usually set on an individual basis. The personal objectives of each Executive 
Director for the year ended 31 December 2016 were linked to the corporate, financial, strategic and other non-financial objectives of 
the Company. 
Up to 18% of salary was payable to the Chief Executive Officer and 15% of salary to the Chief Financial Officer upon achievement of 
personal objectives. Based on the assessment against objectives set, the Committee determined that the performance of the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer warranted a 50% payout in relation to the non-financial elements of their respective 
bonuses, which resulted in payment worth 9% of salary to the Chief Executive Officer and 7.5% of salary to the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Committee consider the 2017 objectives to be commercially sensitive as they give our competitors insight into our business plans 
and therefore are not detailed in this Report.
The bonus for the 2016 financial year is accrued and paid in 2017. Overall the 2016 bonus payments made in respect of the 2015 financial 
year were as follows:

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Approach to Remuneration of Executive Directors on Recruitment
In the cases of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration. 
The salaries of new appointments will be determined by reference to the experience and skills of the individual, relevant market data, 
internal relativities and their current salary. New appointments will be eligible to receive a personal pension, benefits and to participate 
in the Company’s share schemes.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated by either party on six months notice 
and their appointment is reviewed annually. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Executive Directors, taking 
into account the time and responsibility of each role. Additional fees relate to the supplementary fee paid to the Chairmen of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees. No Director or Senior Manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration.  
Non-Executive Directors receive travel expenses but do not participate in any incentive arrangements. All Non-Executive Directors have 
confirmed that, save as disclosed in the single figures of remuneration tables above, they have not received any other items in the nature 
of remuneration. Further details of the Non-Executive Director fees are outlined below.

Executive Director market and the 
broader employee population but 
on occasion may need to recognise, 
for example, an increase in the scale, 
scope or responsibility of the role. 
Current fee levels are set out on 
page 59
Non-Executive Directors do

Service Agreements
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The service contract of each 
Executive Director is not fixed term and is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months’ notice in writing. The Executive 
Directors’ contracts are available to view throughout the year at the Company’s registered office and at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure they reflect best practice. 
Details of the service contracts for the Executive Directors and letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:

Annual Report 2016 Policy on Payment for Loss of Office – Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination and determines compensation 
on a case-by-case basis accordingly, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination 
and any applicable duty to mitigate. There are no special provisions in the event of loss of office or for payment in lieu of notice 
(PILON). The Remuneration Committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination and determines 
compensation accordingly.
If such circumstances were to arise, the Executive Director concerned would have no claim against the Company for damages or any 
other remedy in respect of the termination. The Remuneration Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment 
made to a departing Executive Director and will honour previous commitments as appropriate. 
The table below summarises how the awards under the Annual Bonus and 2014 LTIP are typically treated in different leaver scenarios and 
on a change of control. Whilst the Remuneration Committee retains overall discretion for determining ‘Good Leaver’ status, it typically 
defines a ‘Good Leaver’ for the Annual Bonus and 2014 LTIP as circumstances which include retirement, ill health or injury, disability, 
redundancy and the employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Group. 
The 2014 DAB defines a ‘Good Leaver’ as ceasing to be a Director or employee of a Group Company where that individual is not a ‘Bad 
Leaver’. A ‘Bad Leaver’ is defined as a Director or employee leaving the business due to the financial statements requiring restatement. 
Final treatment is subject to the Committee’s discretion.

Upon exit or change of control DSB awards will be treated in line with the DSB plan rules.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or otherwise) 
to additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle other amounts reasonably 
due to the Executive Director.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including (but 
not limited to) settlement and/or consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Remuneration 
Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
There are no agreements between the Group and its Directors or employees for loss of office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Payments for Loss of Office

Share Options
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), may be granted options over shares in the Company under the 
Company Share Option Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme, under which either approved or unapproved options may be granted. 
Options granted under these schemes are not offered at a discount.
The exercising of options under these schemes is conditional on certain performance conditions which are pre-determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. Options are exercisable normally only after the third anniversary of the date of grant (or such later time as may 
be determined at the time of grant) and cannot, in any event, be exercised later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Awards will 
not vest if the Group is not profitable at the end of the performance period. Full details are included in Note 29 on pages 97 to 101.

and development. In accordance with International Accounting Standards a further £259,000 (2015: £373,000) has been capitalised. 
Following a review of development, £125,000 (2015: £nil) impairments were made in 2016.
Dividends
The Group made a profit before tax for the year to 31 December 2016 of £19.1 million (2015: £17.0 million). The Directors are 
recommending payment of a final dividend of 0.62p per share. The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid 
on 16 June 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 May 2017. This will make a total dividend of 0.92p 
for the full year (2015: 0.80p).
Post-Balance Sheet Events
There have been no adjusting or non-adjusting post-balance sheet events.

Capital Structure
The Group is debt free. A five-year, £30 million, multi-currency, revolving, credit facility was agreed in December 2014 with an accordion 
option under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on the same terms. The new facility is provided jointly by the 
Group’s existing bank HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and replaced the previous £4 million facility. It is unsecured 
on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
Going Concern
After making enquiries and on the basis outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 46 to 50, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Directors’ Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 The Board has agreed procedures for considering and, where appropriate, authorising Directors’ conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. 
Only independent Directors i.e. those who have no interest in the matter under consideration are able to take the relevant decision. 
In taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. 
Directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they believe it is appropriate. The Board will report 
annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s power of authorisation in respect of conflicts of interest operated 
effectively and that procedures have been followed. None of the Directors had any interest during or at the end of the year in any 
contract relating to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Directors and Officers’ Liability Insurance
Insurance cover is in force in respect of the personal liabilities which may be incurred by Directors and Officers of the Company in 
the course of their service with the Group, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. No cover is provided in respect of any fraudulent 
or dishonest act.
Employees
The Group depends on the skills and engagement of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at all levels are encouraged 
to make the fullest possible contribution to the Group’s success. The Group is an equal opportunities employer. It is committed to 
eliminating all forms of discrimination and to giving fair and equal treatment to all employees and job applicants in terms of recruitment, 
pay conditions, promotions, training and all employment matters regardless of age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, marriage 
or civil partnership status, pregnancy, maternity and paternity, gender reassignment, religion or belief. An Equality Policy is in force 
which aims to ensure that all employees are selected, trained, compensated, promoted and transferred solely on the strength of their 
ability, skills, qualifications and merit. The aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees have the opportunity to develop as 
fully as possible in accordance with their individual abilities and the needs of the Group. The Group also believes that all employees 
have a right to work in an environment free from harassment and bullying, and there is an emphasis upon providing a safe and healthy 
working environment.
The Group ensures that every consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons. Should an employee 
become disabled, every effort would be made to retrain the employee if required and offer suitable alternative employment within 
the Group.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through meetings, both formal and informal, those matters likely 
to affect employees’ interests. The Employees’ Consultative Committee in the UK, which comprises representatives of employees 
and management, and the Work’s Council in Germany meet regularly to discuss business issues and areas of concern.
Management also communicates with staff through regular team briefs. Details of policies, procedures and other information of interest 
are regularly updated and are easily accessed by all employees on the Group’s intranet page. The Group undertakes an annual Employee 
Opinion Survey and takes into account comments and feedback received when updating and formulating policies and procedures.
The Group’s aim is to recruit and retain sufficient skilled and motivated employees to meet the needs of the business. The Group operates 
to the internationally recognised medical device standard ISO 13485. Staff work within a defined quality system, and have Personal 
Development Plans that identify their training requirements to help them progress their careers and development. Employees are 
encouraged to become involved in the financial performance of the Group through participation in the Group’s share option plans and 
are incentivised directly through the Company’s bonus scheme, performance reviews and training and development opportunities.
Employee Share Schemes
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP), may be eligible after a period of service to be granted 
options over shares in the Company under the Company Share Option Plan or Executive Share Option Scheme. The Group received 
HMRC approval in 2010 to adopt a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). Under the CSOP, employees are allowed to receive up to 
£30,000 of options in a tax-efficient manner. Options granted under these schemes are not offered at a discount. Further details are 
included in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 64.
The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) in which employees are invited to participate. The DSB encourages 
employee share ownership which helps to align the employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. The details on the DSB Scheme 
are provided in the Remuneration Report on page 58. The original DSB was set up in 2006 and having reached the end of its ten-year 
life a new DSB scheme was introduced on the same terms as the existing scheme following shareholder approval at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting.
The Company no longer satisfies the requirements for granting tax-efficient options under its EMI scheme. Options already granted 
under this scheme will be allowed to vest in accordance with the rules of the scheme. 
1,452,000 Ordinary Shares (2015: 1,170,000) were issued during the year to employees exercising their share options and options 
over other share incentive schemes. Details are given in Note 29 to the Group Financial Statements.

The Group is committed to high standards in health, safety and environmental performance. It is the Group’s policy to abide by, and

Safety Committees at all sites assist with advice on safe working practices and ensure any corrective action is taken where necessary.

Environment
Where possible, the Group aims to reduce its impact on the environment. The facility at Winsford has been built with a high level of 
thermal insulation to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. It incorporates a solar wall, a renewable energy source that captures the sun’s 
warmth and supplements the building’s heating system. Lighting is controlled by movement sensors to avoid wastage and the heating 
system is fully programmable. Further details are available in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 34 to 37.
Corporate Social Responsibility
AMS is committed to ensuring that the business operates in a responsible way across these key areas:

The Group has implemented a Corporate Social Responsibility Policy.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements the Directors are required to:
 e Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 e Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 e State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 e Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 e Properly select and apply accounting policies;
 e Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 e Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 e Make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Reporting Entity
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc ('the Company') is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
(registration number 2867684). The Company’s registered address is Premier Park, 33 Road One, Winsford Industrial Estate, Cheshire, 
CW7 3RT.
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Company for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
'Group').
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development and manufacture of novel high performance polymers (both natural and 
synthetic) for use in advanced woundcare dressings, and distribution of medical adhesives, for closing and sealing tissue, and sutures and 
haemostats for sale into the global medical device market.
2 Basis of Preparation
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the EU.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting except as disclosed in the accounting policies set 
out below.
The individual Financial Statements for each Group Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of 
each Group Company are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency 
for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position and cash 
flow forecasts for the next 12 months. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and cash flows, taking 
into account specific business risks and the current economic environment. 
With regards to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year end of £51.1 million. The Group also has in 
place a five year, unsecured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility for £30 million which was undrawn during 2016.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, the Group operates in markets whose demographics are favourable, underpinned 
by an increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a 
number of long-term contracts with customers across different geographic regions and also with substantial financial resources, ranging 
from government agencies through to global healthcare companies.
After taking the above into consideration, the Directors have reached a conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
In the current year the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the IASB. Their adoption has not had a material 
impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in the Annual Financial Statements. The following amendments were applied:
 e Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative.
 e Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38, Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
 e Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle, specifically amendments to (i) IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, (ii) IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and (iii) IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
3 Accounting Policies
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
Share based payments 
The charge to the Income Statement in relation to options and incentive plans is based on the Black-Scholes Merton or the Monte Carlo 
Option Pricing Model valuation technique. These techniques require a number of assumptions to be made such as those in relation to 
share price volatility, movement in interest rates, dividend yields and staff behavioural patterns. Details of the accounting policies applied 
in respect of share based payments are set out on page 80.
Tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is judged probable that the Group will generate taxable profits which can be offset against tax 
losses. The measurement of the tax benefit recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based upon the largest amount of tax 
benefit that, in management’s judgement, is likely to be realised. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of deferred tax are 
set out on page 77.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, 
are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets
Determining whether goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying 
amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £40.3m and £9.5m respectively (2015: £34.6m and £8.4m). 
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of impairment are set out on page 78.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to retain benefits from its activities. The Financial Statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements on the basis of acquisition accounting, from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the issue of debt or equity. Acquisition related expenses 
are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services rendered, with the exception of directly 
attributable costs incurred as a result of raising equity, which are off-set against share premium, and raising debt, which are capitalised 
and amortised over the term of the debt. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) 
that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are 
recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the 
cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and 
is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of sales of the Group’s products to external customers at amounts excluding value added tax, and is 
recognised when the products have been delivered and title has passed. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue from royalty income receivable under licence agreements from external customers at amounts excluding value added tax 
is recognised as the products under licence are sold and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Other income
This represents non-refundable up-front licence payments received for the grant of rights for the development and marketing of 
products, and other sundry income. The income is recognised in the Income Statement, over the life of each development project, 
in proportion to the stage of completion of each project.
Finance income
Finance income relates to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence, or that the Directors consider should be 
disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results. This includes non-recurring transaction costs (see Note 6). 
Exceptional items have been presented separately on the face of the Income Statement. The Directors consider that this presentation 
gives a fairer presentation of the results of the Group.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Finance costs
Finance costs relate to finance payments associated with financial liabilities. They are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue 
using the effective interest method.
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average 
rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising 
on consolidation are recognised in equity.
Hedging
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect 
of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of 
foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its 
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
Note 24 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Movements in the hedging reserve 
in equity are detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Taxation
Taxation expense includes the amount of current income tax payable and the charge for the year in respect of deferred taxation.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from 
profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure which are not taxable or 
deductible in the year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact that it is taxable or deductible in another period. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on a basis of temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled based on tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Intangible assets
Acquired intellectual property rights
Intellectual property rights that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value. Intellectual property 
rights purchased outright are initially recognised at cost. Intellectual property rights are capitalised and amortised over their estimated 
useful economic lives, usually not exceeding 18 years. In determining the useful economic life each asset is reviewed separately and 
consideration given to the period over which the Group expects to derive economic benefit from the asset.

Development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, is recognised in the 
Income Statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised once it can be demonstrated that the product or process is clearly identifiable, 
technically and commercially feasible, will generate future economic benefits, that the development costs of the asset can be measured 
reliably and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials and 
direct labour less accumulated amortisation.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take 
place, it is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the product’s useful life starting from the date on which serial production 
commences, which is between one and ten years. Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is between three and 20 years.
Software intangibles
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible 
assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its economic useful life, which is in the range of three to ten years.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings and plant and equipment held for use in the production of goods and services or for administrative purposes are 
carried in the Balance Sheet at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The Group elected to use the fair value as the deemed cost in respect of land and buildings at the date of transition to IFRS. Fair value 
was calculated by reference to their existing use at the date of transition.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, over the expected 
useful life of the asset from the date that the asset is brought into use. It is calculated at the following rates:
 e Freehold property and improvements — 4% per annum on cost
 e Leasehold improvements   — over the length of the lease
 e Plant and machinery   — 6.7% to 33.3% per annum on cost
 e Fixtures and fittings   — 33.3% per annum on cost
 e Motor vehicles    — 25% per annum on cost
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment assets, commences when the assets are ready 
for their intended use.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the unit on 
a pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash 
flows. As the Group’s receivables are of short duration they are not discounted.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and an attributable proportion of 
manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
The Group makes provision for inventory deemed to be irrecoverable or where the net realisable value is lower than cost. This provision 
is established on a stock keeping unit (SKU) basis by reference to the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s experience 
and its assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flow.
Financial Instruments
Classification of financial instruments 
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions
 e They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are potentially unfavourable 
to the Group; and 
 e Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Recognition and valuation of financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and cash deposits and amounts under short-term guarantees usually three 
months or less that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are subject to insignificant risk in change in 
value and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash. Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not 
required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an investment.
Investments
Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an 
investment. The Group invests funds which are surplus to requirements in fixed rate deposits operating within parameters for credit 
ratings and credit limits for individual institutions that are approved and monitored by the Board.
Under IAS 39 'Financial instruments; recognition and measurement', such investments are classified as loans and receivables and are 
recognised at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. An impairment is made 
when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. The recoverable amount is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are not discounted due to the relatively short period of time between recognition of trade 
receivables and receipt of cash.
Recognition and valuation of equity instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value. Any premium on issue is taken to the share premium account.
Recognition and valuation of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other loans
Other loans are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ('FVTPL')
A derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument is classified as held for trading. Financial liabilities are classified 
as at FVTPL where the financial liabilities are held for trading.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is determined 
in the manner described in Note 24.

Annual Report 2016 3 Accounting Policies continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details 
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each Balance Sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss (administrative costs) immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss 
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group currently designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable 
forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges). A derivative with a positive fair value 
is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. 
Derivatives with remaining maturity of less than 12 months are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease 
liability and finance charges in the Income Statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the Balance Sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the Income 
Statement. Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the period of the 
lease term on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users’ benefit. 
Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group 
in an independently administered fund. The amount charged against the Income Statement represents the contributions payable 
to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. IFRS has been applied to all options granted after 7 November 
2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The group issues equity–settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity–settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton or Monte Carlo model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Capital management
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group had net funds with no borrowings. Capital is managed by maximising retained 
profits. Working capital is managed in order to generate maximum conversion of these profits into cash and cash equivalents thereby 
maintaining capital. 
Capital includes share capital, share premium, investment in own shares, share-based payments reserve, share-based payments deferred 
tax reserve, other reserve, translation reserve and retained earnings reserve. There are no externally imposed capital requirements on 
the Group.
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): ‘Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc UK Employee Benefit Trust’.
The Group has de facto control of the assets, liabilities and shares held by the Trust and bear their benefits and risks. The Group records 
assets and liabilities of the Trust as its own.
In compliance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation Group’, shares held by the EBT are included in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as a reduction in equity. Gains and losses on Group shares are recognised directly in reserves.

Annual Report 2016 IFRS not yet effective and not adopted early
New accounting standards not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of the Annual Financial Statements, the following new and revised IFRSs that are potentially relevant 
to the Group, and which have not been applied in the Annual Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
 e IFRS 2, Share-based Payment - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
 e IFRS 16, Leases - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
 e IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
 e IAS 12, Income Taxes - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
 e IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
 e IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
 e IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments. This standard covers the 
classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the new hedge 
accounting model. The Group does not expect the transition to the standard to have a material impact on the Financial Statements.
 e IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. 
This standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers, and the contractual value to 
be allocated to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. 
Retrospective application in the comparative year ending 31 December 2017 is optional, however the Group does not expect to 
undertake this option. An initial assessment has been performed and it is not anticipated that transition to IFRS 15 will have a material 
impact on the Group.
 e IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases. 
This standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the 
underlying asset is of low value. As at 31 December 2016, the Group holds a number of operating leases, which currently, under IAS 17, 
are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. Retrospective application in the comparative year ending 31 December 2018 
is optional, however the Group does not expect to undertake this option. An initial assessment has been performed and it is anticipated 
that transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the value of lease assets and liabilities recognised in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. The Group will continue to monitor the impact until the transition date, providing further quantitative and qualitative measures as 
progress is made on implementation planning.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until 
a detailed review has been completed.
4 Segment Information
As referred to in the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Group is organised into four Business Units: Branded Direct, Branded Distributed, 
OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Bulk Materials. These Business Units are the basis on which the Group reports its

The Group has chosen to use a weighted average country tax rate rather than the UK tax rate for the reconciliation of the charge for 
the year to the profit per the Income Statement. The Group operates in several jurisdictions, some of which have a tax rate in excess of 
the UK tax rate. As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most meaningful information to the users of the 
Financial Statements.

Legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% and 17% was passed by Parliament in September 2016 to take effect 
from 1 April 2017 and 1 April 2020. The reduction in the main rate to 17% had been substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date and, 
therefore, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in these Financial Statements at this rate.
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement and other Comprehensive Income, the Group has recognised directly 
in equity:

 representing brand names, know-how and customer listings and contracts.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and the amortisation is recognised within administration costs, the largest 
intangible asset being RESORBA
®
 ‘know-how’ which is being amortised over ten years with five years remaining, with the exception of 
the RESORBA
®
 brand name, which the Directors believe has an unlimited useful economic life and has a carrying value of £8,885,000. 
In reaching this assessment, the Directors have considered that the RESORBA

 brand has existed for over 80 years and is widely 
recognised as a market leader in the surgical market.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £0.6 million (2015: £8.0 million) available for offset against future profits. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this loss (2015: £4.7 million) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

Two cash-generating units (CGU) exist within the Branded Distributed segment whereby goodwill has been allocated. CGU1 has 
goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets of £29.7m and £6.8m (2015: £25.4m and £6.4m) respectively, and CGU2 has £0.8m 
(2015: £1.0m) of goodwill allocated.
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Advanced Medical Solutions B.V. on 30 September 2009 and the acquisition of RESORBA® on the 
22nd December 2011.
The goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful economic life have been allocated to the relevant Business Units in proportion to 
profit from operations on a consistent basis for all four segments, as follows:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation on a cash generating unit basis, which uses 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a 12 month period. These budgets have been 
adjusted for specific risk factors that take into account sensitivities of the projection. The base 12 month projection is extrapolated using 
reasonable growth rates specific to each cash generating unit up to year five of between 0% and 15% and has not been inflated for 
years six to 20 which management believes does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry or forecast company 
growth. The growth rate would have to fall significantly in order for an impairment to be required. A discount rate of between 6.5% and 
7.0% per annum (2015: between 6.0% and 7.5%), being the Group’s current pre tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk, has 
been applied to these cash flows, being an estimation of current market risks and the time value of money. The Group has conducted a 
sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on 
which the recoverable amount is based would not cause any of the carrying amounts to exceed the relevant recoverable amount.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 41 days (2015: 41 days). No interest is charged on the receivables within the 
contracted credit period. Thereafter, interest may be charged at 2% per month on the outstanding balance. In determining the 
recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was 
initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Group’s large and unrelated customer base. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairments.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. 
Limits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and reflect current payment history.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not 
provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable - a large proportion 
of debts overdue over 30 days were recovered post the Balance Sheet date. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit 
enhancements over these balances. The carrying amount and ageing of these debtors are summarised on page 93.

The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 33 days (2015: 34 days). No interest is charged on trade payables that are within 
pre-agreed credit terms. Thereafter, interest may be charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates. The Group has 
financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

of the facility are:
 e The committed value of the facility is £30 million
 e There is an uncommitted accordion of an additional £20 million
 e Is unsecured
 e Facility will expire in December 2019
 e The interest payable on drawings under the loan is based on inter-bank interest (EURIBOR or, if sterling denominated LIBOR) plus 
a sliding scale margin determined by the Group’s leverage: the margin is currently 0.65%
 e The facility has two covenants - interest cover (ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges) must be above 4:1 and leverage (ratio of Total 
Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA) should not exceed 3:1
 e It was undrawn at the end of the year

(c) Currency exposures
At 31 December 2016, the Group had unhedged US Dollar currency exposures of £nil (2015: £nil) and unhedged Euro currency exposures 
of £nil (2015: £nil).
Risk sensitivity
The Group estimates that a 10% movement in the £:US$ or £:Euro exchange rate will impact 2016 Sterling revenues by approximately 
2.7% and 3.1% respectively and in the absence of any hedging this would have an impact on profit of 2.2% and 0.5%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow 
hedges. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss only when the hedged transaction 
impacts the profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the applicable 
accounting policy.
Translation reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries only, 
from their functional currency into the parents functional currency, being Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. 
Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are included in the 
translation reserve.
A £8,851,000 gain has been recorded in the translation reserve during the period, which would otherwise have been recognised in 
administration costs (2015: £3,348,000 loss), if hedge accounting had not been adopted.

Under the terms of the Company’s Share Option Schemes, approved by Shareholders in 2010, the Board may offer options to purchase 
Ordinary Shares in the Company to all employees of the Company at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the 
offer. Since 2005, individuals who are entitled to awards under the LTIP are no longer eligible to receive options under the Company’s 
Share Option Schemes.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant. Once options have vested they can be exercised during 
the period up to ten years from the date of grant.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.
Options have been granted over the following number of Ordinary Shares which were outstanding at 31 December 2016:

Annual Report 2016 Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2016
1 Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101').
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU ('Adopted IFRSs'), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In these Financial Statements, the Company has adopted FRS 101.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a Cash Flow statement, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets business combinations, discontinued operations 
and related party transactions.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments has not been applied to any equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002, nor has 
it been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before 1 January 2005. This treatment is consistent with 
the transitional provisions taken when the Company adopted FRS 20, the UK equivalent standard.
In the transition to FRS 101 from UK GAAP, the Company has made measurement and recognition adjustments which are detailed below.
Critical judgements in applying the company’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, which are described below, the directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
Share-based payments
The charge to the Income Statement in relation to options and incentive plans is based on the Black-Scholes Merton or the Monte Carlo 
Option Pricing Model valuation technique. These techniques require a number of assumptions to be made such as those in relation to 
share price volatility, movement in interest rates, dividend yields and staff behavioural patterns. Details of the accounting policies applied 
in respect of share-based payments are set out on page 105.
Tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is judged probable that the Company will generate taxable profits which can be offset against 
tax losses. The measurement of the tax benefit recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based upon the largest amount 
of tax benefit that, in management’s judgement, is likely to be realised. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of deferred 
tax are set out below.
Impairment of investments and intragroup receivables
Investment and receivable carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit is not recoverable. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, as supported 
by management valuation, less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the profit or loss for the period.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences in respect of the initial recognition of assets 
and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit are not provided for. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016 Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are non-interest bearing and recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance charges
Finance charges comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings and fair value losses on interest rate swap derivative 
financial instruments. Finance charges are recognised in the Income Statement on an effective interest method.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial assets expire or are transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing 
and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and re-measured at each period end. The gain or loss on  
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. The Company has elected not to apply hedge 
accounting. Forward currency contracts are recognised at fair value in the Balance Sheet with movements in fair value recognised 
in the Income Statement for the period. The fair value of the instruments is the estimated amount that the Company would receive 
or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the 
swap counterparties.
Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding 
adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
2 Income Statement
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Income Statement for the year. 
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 of £18,276,000 (2015: profit of 
£18,000,000).
The Auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The average number of employees in the year was 11 (2015: 11). The Directors’ remuneration is detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

8. To authorise the Directors generally and unconditionally for the purposes of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’) 
to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security 
into shares in the Company (each an allotment of ‘relevant securities’) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,508,736 provided that 
this authority is for a period expiring upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 months after

of equity securities:
(a) in connection with an offer of such securities by way of rights to holders of Ordinary Shares in proportion (as nearly as may be 
practicable) to their respective holdings of such shares, but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may 
deem necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal or practical problems under the laws of any territory, 
or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange;
(b) otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,052,620; and
(c) which shall expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and 15 months after the 
date of the passing of this Resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would 
or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any 
such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this Resolution has expired.
10.  That the Company is hereby generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 701 of the 2006 Act to make 
market purchases (within the meaning of Section 693(4) of the 2006 Act) of any of its Ordinary Shares of 5p each in the capital of the 
Company on such terms and in such manner as the Directors may from time to time determine provided that:

(b) the minimum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share is 5p which amount shall be exclusive of expenses, if any;
(c)  the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Ordinary Share shall not be more than 5% above the 
average of the middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share as derived from The London Stock Exchange Daily Official List 
for the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the ordinary share is purchased;
(d) unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, this authority shall expire upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting and 15 months after the date of the passing of this Resolution; and
(e) under this authority the Company may make a contract to purchase Ordinary Shares which would or might be executed wholly or 
partly after the expiry of this authority, and may make purchases of Ordinary Shares pursuant to it as if this authority had not expired.

Notice of Meeting Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the Notice set out on page 109 may appoint a proxy to attend, 
speak and, on a poll to vote in his place. A holder of more than one Ordinary Share may appoint different proxies in relation to each 
or any of those Ordinary Shares.
2. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. 
A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy notice 
must be given to the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting.
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the 
Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out at Note 1 of the proxy form. If you wish 
your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your 
instructions directly to them.
4. On a vote on a Resolution on a show of hands at the meeting, a proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been 
appointed by more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one or more of the members to vote for the resolution 
and by one or more other member to vote against it.
5. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
6. A form of proxy is enclosed for use by members. To be effective, it must be completed and arrive not later than 48 hours before 
the time fixed for the Meeting at Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU. You may also deliver 
by hand to The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU during usual business hours.
7. The Register of Directors’ Interests in the shares of the Company will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company 
during usual business hours on any weekday (public holidays excepted) until the date of the Meeting and also on that date and at the 
place of the Meeting from 9.00 am until the conclusion of the Meeting.
8. The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those shareholders 
registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at close of business on 5 June 2017 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the 
aforesaid Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes in the entries in 
the relevant register of Securities after close of business on 5 June 2017 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person 
to attend or vote at the meeting.
Notes on Special Business
Resolution 8: Authority to Allot Shares and other relevant securities
This Resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to £3,508,736 
(representing 70,174,730 Ordinary Shares of 5p each). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company as at 31 March 2017, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authority sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2018 or, 
if earlier, 15 months after the passing of the resolution.
While the Directors have no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share capital, it is considered prudent and 
appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.
Resolution 9: Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Your Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares 
where they propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Accordingly, 
Resolution 9 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to grant such authority. Apart from rights issues, open offers or any other 
pre-emptive offer as mentioned the authority will be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £1,052,620 (being 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at 31 March 2017, the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this Notice). This is in keeping with the extent for which such authority has been sought and given at each previous 
Annual General Meeting of the Company since 2006.
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (a) of Resolution 9 would be limited to allotments by way of a rights issue only 
(subject to the right of the Directors to impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, for example, fractional entitlements and 
regulatory matters).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2018 or, if earlier, 15 months 
after the passing of the Resolution.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc 
Annual Report 2016
Notice of Meeting continued Resolution 10: Purchase by the Company of its own Shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares. Under section 701 of the 2006 Act, the 
Directors of a Company may make market purchases of that Company’s shares if authorised to do so. Your Directors believe that granting 
such approval would be in the best interests of shareholders in allowing Directors the flexibility to react promptly to circumstances 
requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 10, which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, will give the Directors the authority to purchase issued shares 
of the Company under section 701 of the 2006 Act.
The authority contained in this Resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of £526,310 (representing 5% of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2017 the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice; representing 
10,526,209 Ordinary Shares of 5p each). The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out in the Resolution.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2018 or, if earlier, 15 months after the 
passing of the Resolution.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the Board will use this power 
only if and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels 
and the overall financial position of the Group, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders 
generally and that they will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no dividends 
will be paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow the Company to 
manage its capital base more effectively and to replenish its distributable reserves.
If and when the Board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares purchased 
are to be cancelled or held in treasury.
As at 31 March 2017, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice, there were share options outstanding over Ordinary 
Shares, representing 3.2% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. 
If the buyback authority was to be exercised in full, these options would represent 3.3% of the Company’s ordinary issued share capital.

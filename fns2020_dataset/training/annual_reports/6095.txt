_cover.qxd  14/04/2005  12:52  Page 1 Floors 2 Go is the largest specialist, multi-site retailer of real
wood, engineered and laminate flooring, and related accessories
in the UK. The business sells direct to the public from 125 stores
located nationwide.
Floors 2 Go sells predominantly to the general public, but also
has a large base of trade customers. The Company has built its
reputation through a combination of their broad product range,
convenient store locations, and specialist staff knowledge. 
The product ranges of Floors 2 Go are mainly own label brands,
although they do stock selected branded products too, such as
Quick Step and Bruce flooring. Their laminate ranges are all easy
to fit click products, targeted at the home DIY market.
Floors 2 Go source the majority of their laminate products from
three of Europe’s leading manufacturers, and their real wood
flooring is primarily sourced from the Far East.
Floors 2 Go buy directly from manufacturers, rather than through
distributors, and the Company believes that this relationship with
their suppliers offers them a significant competitive advantage.
Two of their main suppliers hold Floors 2 Go labelled stock in
warehouses in the UK at no extra cost to the Company.

Introduction
My first Chairman’s statement comes at
the end of what has been undoubtedly
a momentous year for Floors 2 Go plc. 
The Company was incorporated as WC Co(8)
Limited on 9 April 2003 and changed its name
to Smart Motive Limited on 18 December 2003.
On 19 December 2003, the Company
re-registered as a public limited company
and changed its name to Smart Motive plc. 
On 25 March 2004, having acquired the
entire issued share capital of Anglo Baltic
Limited, the company undertaking the trade
of the Floors 2 Go business, the Company
was admitted to trading on AIM. On the
same date the Company changed its name
to Floors 2 Go plc.
During 2004 Floors 2 Go consolidated its
position as the leading independent retailer
of laminate and wooden flooring in the UK
and began the implementation of its five year
plan to dominate this market sector. We opened
29 stores including 17 concessions in 2004
and closed four which brought our portfolio
up to 121 by the end of 2004. This expansion
included our first move into Scotland with
47,000 sq feet of concession space in
Texstyle World, a leading home furnishings
retailer. Our plan is to build a chain of
a minimum of 350 stores with an acceleration
towards this target in 2005.
Financial performance
The financial performance in 2004 was
extremely satisfying. As the acquisition of
Anglo Baltic Limited occurred on 25 March 2004,
these accounts comprise the nine months
trading period of the acquired activities to
31 December 2004. Sales for the nine months
ended 31 December 2004 were £61.97m and
resulted in an operating profit before goodwill
amortisation of £7.05m. Goodwill amortisation
and interest accounted for £1.84m, producing
a profit before tax of £5.21m. The tax charge
of £1.53m represents 29.5% of pre tax profits,
a rate which we consider sustainable
in future years.
Earnings per share for the nine month period
was 2.80p with 2.79p on a diluted basis.
I am pleased to report that your board will
be recommending a maiden dividend of
1.00p payable on 27 May 2005.
I think it is important to give shareholders
a fuller appreciation of our performance
to outline our results on a pro forma basis
for the full 12 months. The 2003 actual
comparatives are for Anglo Baltic Limited
for the year ended 31 December 2003.
These figures clearly indicate the strong
financial progress that Floors 2 Go has made.
The 2004 pro forma figures exclude the
impact of any adjustments arising from the
acquisition of the business and consist of
three months trading of Anglo Baltic Limited
and nine months trading post acquisition.
Finally, I would like to state the Company’s
corporate objective, which is to “Create
a highly focused retail chain which will lead
the laminate and wooden floor retailer sector
by providing a range of products in breadth
and quality which will be unsurpassed.
This dedication to quality and service whilst
providing value for money should provide a
financial return which will allow upper quartile
earnings and thereby dividend growth”.

“The financial performance in 2004 was 
extremely satisfying.”
_1F2G_arf04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:53  Page 2 In the period under review the Group has
commenced the implementation of its strategy
to become the dominant retailer of laminate
and wooden flooring within the UK. Total
stores trading at 31 December 2004 stood
at 121, a net increase of 25 over the year. 
Financial performance
As the acquisition of Anglo Baltic Limited
occurred on 25 March 2004, these accounts
comprise the nine months trading period of
the acquired activities to 31 December 2004.
The figures referred to in my review relate
to the twelve month pro forma figures for the
Group. Comparison of these figures to those
for the year ended 31 December 2004 has
been included in the Chairman’s report.
Sales growth has been buoyant in 2004.
The Group achieved a like for like sales
increase of 22.9%, with overall sales up by
78.3% (£44.2m in 2003 to £78.8m in 2004),
based on the proforma results, for the 12 months
to 31 December 2004. This growth compares
favourably with an estimated market growth
of 13%, thus indicating gains in market share
and further consolidating our position
as market leader.
Gross margin improved by 0.9% (2003: 47.1%,
2004: 48.0%). This resulted from improved
purchasing power due to volume growth,
better negotiation with suppliers and increased
sales of accessories which produce higher than
average margins. In addition the final quarter
benefited from newly introduced supplier
rebate schemes. Such schemes will be a focus
of supplier negotiation in 2005 and should
lead to further gross margin enhancement.
Operational review
In December 2004 the Group acquired
the leasehold of a new warehouse facility
in Oldbury, situated next to the M5 motorway.
This will give the Group the necessary capacity
needed for our stated target of 350 stores
in the UK. The warehouse will officially open
in April 2005.
Focus on our stockholding and improved
management information enabled the
company to reduce its stockholding days
to 86 (2003: 89) and we will continue our
efforts to improve this further.
The business has a history of cost efficiency
and effectiveness, and operating costs in the
year represented 36.57% of sales compared
with 40.22% for the same period in 2003.
We will be no different going forward in that
we will keep costs to a minimum, and strive
to increase productivity.
Market position
The total laminate and wood flooring market
is estimated to be valued at £353 million,
excluding accessories, in the United Kingdom,
and Floors 2 Go’s share of this is approximately
16.5% (Source: AMA research).
The United Kingdom market is forecast to
grow at a minimum compound rate of 8% per
annum between 2005 and 2009 and we will
continue to exploit such growth by opening
new stores and consolidating further the
market position of our established portfolio.
The growth has been helped by greater
popularity in wood and laminate flooring
in that it is cost effective, easier to fit and more
hygienic than other flooring types. The increased
number of TV homestyle and DIY programmes,
coupled with the Group’s intensive media
advertising has reinforced this message,
bringing good results.
Our strengths that differentiate ourselves from
our competitors are as follows:
 Specialist product knowledge of our
in-store staff.
 Customer service.
 Stock breadth, availability and quality.
 Location of stores – 121 nationwide in
prime locations.
 Competitive pricing – we are the only laminate
retailer that buys direct from manufacturers,
rather than through distributors.
 Repeat business and recommendations
represent 40% of sales.
The strategy of the Group is broken down over
four key areas:
 To continue to take market share from our
competitors, whilst opening stores throughout
the UK. We have 121 stores open currently
and aim to grow to 350 stores long-term.
Our target for 2005 is 25 new stores.
 To continue to provide excellent value,
service (before, during and post sale) to
our customers. Our level of repeat business
is something we are extremely proud of.
 To improve profitability by increased sales,
increased gross margin, and cost reduction
and control, which should invariably
increase shareholder value.
 To maintain the high calibre of staff employed
by the Group, whilst ensuring that as
we expand, new recruits will also meet
our high standards. Training is key in
the Group, and we are currently working
towards the Investor In People accreditation.
Finally I would like to take this opportunity
in thanking all of our employees, suppliers
and advisors for their support and hard work
during the year.
I would also like to thank our customers for
their loyalty in choosing Floors 2 Go and hope
they continue to do so in the future.

Chief Executive’s Review
Floors 2 Go plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 3
“In the period under review the Group has commenced
the implementation of its strategy to become the
dominant retailer of laminate and wooden flooring
within the UK.”
_1F2G_arf04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:54  Page 3 At Floors 2 Go corporate social responsibility
is extremely important.
We employ the best people for the positions 
at Floors 2 Go, regardless of age, gender or
race, and try to employ local people if possible.
Health and Safety is paramount to us. We have
a department dedicated to Health and Safety
in our stores, and are constantly updating our
procedures and training programmes.
The environment is obviously an important issue
to us, as wooden flooring is the nature of our
business. We ensure that all of our suppliers
source their wood from sustainable sources,
and are certificated by the appropriate
bodies, such as the Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes
and the Forest Stewardship Council.
Environment
The Group purchases goods for resale from
suppliers based in the U.K. and direct from
manufacturers around the world. The Group
endeavours to ensure that the suppliers of our
goods provide reasonable working standards
and do not contravene the employment laws
of their country. The Company visits all of its
suppliers on a regular basis. 
Health and safety
The Group ensures, as far as is reasonably
practicable, that a safe and healthy workplace
and working environment is provided for all its
employees to a standard which is at least as
high as that required by law.
Employees
The Group applies policies that do not
discriminate on grounds of race, age,
disability, sex or religion and which provide
good opportunities for disadvantaged sections
of the community.
Applications for employment by disabled
persons are welcomed and are always fully
considered, bearing in mind the respective
aptitudes and abilities of the applicants
concerned. In the event of members of staff
becoming disabled, every effort is made to
ensure that their employment with the Group
continues and that appropriate training is
arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion 
of disabled persons should, as far as possible,
be identical to that of other employees.

Non-executive Chairman
From 1975, Roy developed a retail
chain of 33 drug stores in the North
West of England named Beautycare
which he sold to Lloyds Chemist Plc
in 1988. From 1988 he incorporated
and developed Stationery Box Limited
into a retail chain of 112 high street
stationery stores throughout the UK.
He sold the company to a management
buy out backed by PRICOA (a US
based venture capitalist company)
in 1998. He also formed USI Limited,
a company which has grown
significantly and distributes goods
to major store groups. 
Simon Farnsworth, aged 33
Chief Executive Officer
Simon qualified as a chartered

Directors’ Report
Floors 2 Go plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 8
_1_F2G_arb04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:54  Page 8 Employment standards
The Group ensures, as far as is reasonably practicable, that a safe and healthy workplace and
working environment is provided for all its employees to a standard which is at least as high as
that required by law.
The Group purchases goods for resale from suppliers based in the U.K. and direct from manufacturers
around the world. The Group endeavours to ensure that the suppliers of our goods provide
reasonable working standards and do not contravene the employment laws of their country.
The Group applies policies that do not discriminate on grounds of race, age, disability, sex
or religion and which provide good opportunities for disadvantaged sections of the community.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are welcomed and are always fully considered,
bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicants concerned. In the event
of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with
the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that
the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible,
be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The Group has a policy of providing employees with information about the Group and regular
meetings are held between management and employees to allow a free flow of information and
ideas. A regular newsletter is produced to keep all employees updated with developments within
the Group.
Creditor payment policy and practice
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms
and conditions agreed between the Group and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms
and conditions have been met.
The effect of the Group’s negotiated payment policy is that trade creditors at the year end
represent 56 days’ purchases (2003: Nil).
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP were appointed as auditors during the year. A resolution to reappoint
Ernst & Young LLP as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial year, which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the
Group for that year. In preparing those accounts, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and to enable them
to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Floors 2 Go plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 9
_1_F2G_arb04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:54  Page 9 The Group supports the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Group and
a brief outline of the role of the Board and its Committees, together with the Group’s systems
of internal financial controls, which the Board will continue to keep under review, is given below.
The Board
The Board is made up of the Non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director
and three other Non-executive Directors. Their biographies appear on page 7 and details of the
membership of the Committees of the Board are given on this page.
In order to ensure that the Directors can properly carry out their role, the members of the Board
are provided with high quality information and financial details prior to all Board meetings.
The Board meets monthly throughout the year to discuss and decide the Group’s business and
strategic decisions. In addition, there is a high degree of contact between Board meetings to
ensure all Directors are aware of the Group’s business.
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has a system of
internal controls in place that is appropriate. However, shareholders should be mindful that any
system can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss
and is designed to manage but not eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
The key procedures are:
 preparation of annual budgets for all the business, reviewed by executive management and
subject to Board approval;
 monthly review of sales, cash and profitability compared with budget; and
 monthly operations and board meetings where key risk areas are reviewed and discussed.
Store control environment
Operating procedures for control of store operations are clearly documented and set out in operation
manuals. Senior operational managers are responsible for the implementation of these procedures
and compliance is monitored.
The Audit Committee
Responsibility for the Group’s internal controls rests with the Board. The Audit Committee
is responsible for ensuring that the corporate governance is implemented in respect of matters
relating to the Group’s external audit. The Committee comprises of three Non-executive Directors
and is chaired by C Davies. In addition, the Committee considers the appointment and the fees
of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee met with the external auditors during August 2004 and February 2005
to discuss their audit findings.
Communications with shareholders
The Group places a high level of importance on communicating with its shareholders.
The Company publishes an interim report and will provide an opportunity at its Annual General
Meeting (“AGM”) for shareholders to ask the Chairman questions. Shareholders are welcome
to send in questions in advance of the AGM.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial
statements that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
Compliance with IFRS has been deferred for AIM listed companies and the Group currently expects
IFRS to impact on its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007, with a transition
date of 1 January 2006. The Group has made progress in assessing the impact of IFRS.

Floors 2 Go plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 10
_1_F2G_arb04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:54  Page 10 Directors’ Remuneration
The Board recognises that Directors’ Remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders
and is committed to following current best practice. The Company operates within a competitive
environment; performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and employees
and it believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
Policy on Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate
and retain Directors of the calibre necessary to maintain and improve the Group’s position and
to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return. It aims to provide sufficient levels
of remuneration to do this, but avoid paying more than is necessary. The remuneration will also
reflect the Directors’ responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the Group’s objectives.
A separate Remuneration Committee has been established comprising of the Non-executive Chairman,
R Gabbie, and two of the Non-executive Directors.

Floors 2 Go plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 12
_1_F2G_arb04.qxd  14/04/2005  12:54  Page 12 We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 which
comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Company Balance
Sheet, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes 1 to 24. These financial statements
have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements which
are required to be prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards as set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom
Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
Remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises the Directors’ Report,
un-audited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, Chairman’s Statement, and Corporate
Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which
we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of
the Group as at 31 December 2004 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
 the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting and financial reporting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of Floors 2 Go plc and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December. Its subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition
method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Group profit and loss account and statement of cash flows include the results
and cash flows of its subsidiaries from the date of acquisition to the year end.
The Company acquired Anglo Baltic Limited on 25 March 2004 and the consolidated profit and
loss account reflects the trading since that date.
No profit and loss account is presented for Floors 2 Go plc as permitted by section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985.
Intangible assets – Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing any excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired,
is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. Provision is made
for any impairment.
Intangible assets – Licences
Product licences acquired are amortised over the period of the licence. Provision is made for
any impairment.
Turnover
Turnover comprises the net amount receivable in respect of sales during the period to third parties
and excludes value added tax.
Fixed assets
All fixed assets are recorded at cost. The carrying value of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for
impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost,
based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition, of each asset over its expected useful life,
as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings – 20% and 25% straight line
Fixtures and Fittings – 25% straight line
Motor Vehicles – 25% straight line
Expenditure on repairs and renewals is taken to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Stocks
Stocks comprise entirely of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred
to completion and disposal.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed
at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result
in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax or to receive more tax.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction,
or if hedged, at the forward contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction
is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Leasing commitments
Assets held under hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated
over their useful lives. The capital element of future obligations under the hire purchase contracts
are included in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over
the periods of the hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance
of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over
the lease term.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions
Pension costs represent contributions to employees’ personal pension plans. Such contributions
are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes. Income and
expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis, and credited
or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
2. Turnover
Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents sales to third parties.
The destination of all of the Group’s turnover was the United Kingdom.

18. Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group holds financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage interest rate
and currency risks arising from its operations.
Consequently the main risks arising from the Group’s operations are liquidity risk, interest rate risk
and currency risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain continuity of funding through the use of retained profits
and medium to long term borrowings. The maturity profiles of the Group’s borrowings are
detailed in section (c) of this note.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to interest fluctuations whilst trying to minimise
the cost of capital to the Group.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of hire purchase arrangements, bank loans
and cash at bank. The hire purchase arrangements are all at fixed rates of interest, the weighted
average of which is 14.7%.

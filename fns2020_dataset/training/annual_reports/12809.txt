During the many stages of the manufacturing 
process of semiconductors, large quantities 
of test wafers are used to check the accurate 
calibration of equipment. These test wafers 
are a key consumable in the manufacture of 
semiconductors and the ability to reclaim them 
through Pure Wafer’s advanced process 
provides manufacturers with the opportunity 
to reduce costs.
The semiconductor industry is currently 
seeing a rapid transition to 300mm wafers. 
In order for manufacturers to continue to 
increase functionality at a reduced cost, 
the industry has sought to increase the size 
of wafers on which semiconductors are 
manufactured. 300mm wafer processing 
now represents the fastest growing area 
of the semiconductor industry.
However, wafer reclaim is a highly specialised 
and technically sophisticated process. Only 
a few companies worldwide are able to 
meet the exacting standards required 
by semiconductor manufacturers for 
the reclaim of 300mm wafers, of which 
Pure Wafer is one.
our customers
Pure Wafer’s customers include producers 
of DRAM, logic device manufacturers, 
foundry chip producers and equipment 
manufacturers and leading research and 
development operations. We are proud to 
be supplying and working closely with many 
of the largest and technically advanced 
semiconductor companies in the world.
our process
At Pure Wafer, our process for reclaiming 
test wafers involves the following key stages: 
●  Inspection of the wafers for defects and 
classiﬁcation by type of contaminant to 
be removed 
●  Submersion in a precise mix of chemicals 
appropriate to remove the contaminant 
●  Assessment of ﬂatness and correction 
of defects using Pure Wafer’s advanced 
polishing processes 
● Cleaning and drying 
●  Final quality inspection and packaging 
for return to the customer
The company operates from a state of the art, 
purpose built facility situated in a new technology 
park in Swansea, Wales and is the 
most advanced plant of its kind in Europe. 
The size of the facility is in excess of 
4,500m

HIGHLIGHTS
The company has reported its ﬁrst full year proﬁt.
The management team has been further strengthened.
The company is well placed to capitalise on growth opportunities.
MANAGEMENT
We have continued to strengthen our management team during this 
ﬁnancial year with the appointment to the board of James Dearing 
(group ﬁnance director), and the management appointments of 
Professor Tony Peaker (chief scientiﬁc ofﬁcer) and Trevor Hoskins 
(operations director). These three appointments bring a wealth 
of experience and skills into the business to support our growth 
into the high volume manufacturing phase and solidify our new 
product introduction.
We have initiated a SAYE scheme during the period to incentivise 
our staff, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders. 
I would like to thank the entire team, led by Keith Baker for their 
hard work and congratulate them on their achievements.
OUTLOOK
We have built ourselves a valuable technology platform in the 
300mm wafer reclaim market which continues to grow quickly as 
our blue chip customers open new semiconductor fabs and convert 
existing 200mm production facilities to 300mm capable plants.
As well as the strong growth experienced in the expanding 
300mm marketplace, we are also experiencing good levels 
of demand from 200mm customers adopting our advanced 
high performance products. Management is therefore conﬁdent 
of another year of signiﬁcant growth.
We are now a leading market player in a consolidating global 
industry ensuring that we are well placed to capitalise on the growth 
opportunities as the market continues to develop.

INTRODUCTION 
High quality wafer reclaim provides an opportunity for our 
semiconductor manufacturer customers to achieve signiﬁcant 
cost savings. As expected, the semiconductor industry’s transition 
to the larger 300mm wafers continues at pace, as 300mm is 
now providing the cost standard for the majority of high volume 
semiconductor devices including semiconductor memories and 
microprocessor devices.
During the period we have qualiﬁed with two more of the world’s 
leading semiconductor manufacturers and progressed a number 
of our existing relationships. We have doubled our 300mm wafer 
output whilst 200mm wafer output has remained stable. Total wafer 
output, revenue, and PBT all continue to increase month on month.
Signiﬁcant progress has been made this year on new technology 
development supported by the introduction to manufacturing 
of the most advanced particle metrology available. Our new 
50 nanometre product offering is now in production and is expected 
to deliver a signiﬁcant contribution to our growth next year.
MARKET DYNAMICS 
The fast take up of the semiconductor industry into 300mm 
manufacturing is conﬁrmed by the frequent announcement of new 
300mm fabs. There are currently 36 300mm fabs in the world, and 
the construction of another 29 fabs has already been announced, 
most expected to be operational by the end of 2008. With the majority 
of these new facilities owned by our existing customer base, we are 
extremely well positioned to expand our business in line with the 
growth in 300mm manufacturing sites.
As several of the leading semiconductor manufacturers embrace 
new technologies to improve the speed performance of their 
products, the demand for our new 50 nanometre products is 
expected to grow over the next year.
Our 300mm revenue, the main focus of our business, grew by 79% 
over the year. As capacity tightens on 200mm products we are 
experiencing a stabilisation of prices and increased demand in this 
market segment.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Keith Baker 
Chief Executive
_0_PUR_arf06.indd   4 19/10/2006   13:55:12 05 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
CUSTOMERS
Important progress has been made with new customers during 
the period. We are now qualiﬁed with a signiﬁcant number of the 
world’s major semiconductor manufacturers outside of Japan, 
and our ﬁrst work has been carried out in the Chinese marketplace.
Qualiﬁcation of new customers occurred towards the end of the 
period. Volumes are ramping quickly with these new customers 
and we are continuing to make progress developing our more 
established customer relationships through our global sales network. 
NEW TECHNOLOGY
Whilst concentrating on our core business of wafer reclaim, through 
the appointment of Professor A R Peaker as chief scientiﬁc ofﬁcer 
we are exploring new products and markets for our advanced 
polishing and cleaning process which represent key enabling 
technologies for new electronic products.
The company has made some key advances in our new 
50 nanometre product development. This new process utilises 
more advanced technology than wafer reclaim, and does not 
relate to test wafers. As this new offering is substantially different to 
standard reclaim, the development costs incurred on this process 
during the year have been capitalised. These costs will be amortised 
over ﬁve years, following commencement of sales of the product.
STRATEGY FOR WAFER RECLAIM GROWTH
300mm wafer reclaim is our key focus, and we are well positioned 
in this segment that is growing as fast as had been anticipated. 
We plan to capitalise on our established position in the marketplace 
and ensure that we are able to beneﬁt from the continued strong 
growth in demand. We are also aiming to further develop the 
applications for our products to help our customers expand their use 
of wafer reclaim as a key part of their continual cost improvement 
programme. Our high performance products enable our customers 
to use reclaimed silicon in many new applications where historically 
lower quality reclaimed wafers would not be used.
200mm wafer reclaim is beginning to present some increasingly 
interesting opportunities for us. Following some price deﬂation in 
the ﬁrst half of 2005, pricing has remained stable and supply is now 
beginning to tighten in this segment. Some of our larger customers 
are keen to secure their long term supply of 200mm and 300mm 
wafers and are looking to Pure Wafer as a well invested global 
leader who can provide a reliable supply of both sizes. 
KEITH BAKER
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
18 SEPTEMBER 2006
HIGHLIGHTS
We have doubled our 300mm output in the year.
Signiﬁcant progress made on new 50nm product offering. 
Strong growth in 300mm reclaim is set to continue.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
TURNOVER
Turnover for the period was £14.52m, an increase of 58% on last 
year (2005: £9.17m), with 300mm now comprising 88% of total 
group revenue (2005: 78%).
● Europe £4.27m up 41% (2005: £3.02m) 
● North America £6.51m up 134% (2005: £2.78m) 
● South East Asia & Middle East £3.73m up 10% (2005: £3.38m) 
 
● 300mm £12.76m up 79% (2005: £7.14m) 
● 200mm £1.77m down 13% (2005: £2.03m)
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Proﬁt before tax was £2.04m (2005: loss of £0.14m). This improvement 
is a result of the ramped wafer throughput and the lower absorbed 
cost per wafer as a direct effect of our high operational gearing. 
Turnover for the period increased by 58%, with costs increasing 
by just 34%.  
The fast growth of the business can be seen by our strong second 
half performance which generated a proﬁt before tax of £1.34m, 
91% ahead of the ﬁrst half of £0.70m. 
Manufacturing efﬁciency remains a key focus for the business with 
wafer output per employee having increased in excess of 30% during 
the ﬁnancial year. The management team will continue to pursue 
cost reduction activities as the business grows, to reduce the unit 
cost of manufacture.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Pure Wafer’s sales are predominantly US Dollar based, whilst the cost 
base is predominantly in Sterling. For the year to 30 June 2006, the 
average exchange rate achieved by Pure Wafer was £1 = US$1.77. 
Pure Wafer has a rolling 12 month hedging policy where a proportion 
of the forecast 12 monthly exposure is hedged.
CASH FLOW AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Net cash inflow from operating activities was £2.68m 
(2005: outﬂow of £0.05m). Working capital net cash outﬂow 
was £1.25m. Included in this is the cash effect of an increase 
in stocks (£0.65m), reﬂecting a management decision to make 
more ﬂexible and efﬁcient the tooling procedures and process. 
During the period we acquired capital equipment with the value of 
£5.40m, primarily relating to manufacturing equipment, increasing 
our capacity in the last quarter of this ﬁnancial year. This expenditure 
has been partially funded through a ﬁnance leasing facility.
TAXATION
The group has reported its ﬁrst full year of taxable proﬁts, which have 
been relieved against brought forward tax losses. As the directors 
are conﬁdent of the trading and ﬁnancial prospects of the group, 
based upon short term forecasts a deferred tax asset has been 
recognised for part of the unutilised tax losses at 30 June 2006. 
The quantum of the deferred tax asset will be reassessed annually.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)
The London Stock Exchange has conﬁrmed that companies listed 
on AIM will not have to apply IFRS until accounting periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2007. Consequently, the ﬁrst set of IFRS 
ﬁnancial statements will not be required until the year ending 
30 June 2008. In the meantime the group will be appraising 
the impact of adopting IFRS and brieﬁng accordingly.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AND DIVIDEND
Diluted EPS for the period was 14.73p (2005: loss per share of 0.58p), 
which included the effect of the recognition of the deferred tax asset. 
Excluding this impact, adjusted diluted EPS for the group was 7.63p 
(2005: loss per share of 0.58p).
The board does not recommend payment of a dividend this ﬁnancial 
year. The company is growing fast, generating proﬁts and in a positive 
cashﬂow position. Following the end of the ﬁnancial year Pure Wafer 
International Limited, the subsidiary trading company of the group, 
has begun the process of a capital reduction which would eliminate 
the brought forward losses in the proﬁt and loss reserve, and put 
the company in a position to be able to make distributions from 
any future proﬁts in coming years, when appropriate.

EMPLOYEES
The company’s employment policies are designed to attract, retain and motivate the very best staff for each role in the company, 
recognising that this can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion or disability.
Regular meetings are held with employees to discuss the performance of the company as a whole, and the area in which they work. 
Financial and economic factors are dealt with in this context.
Information concerning employees and their remuneration is given in notes 4 and 5 to the accounts, and in the report of the remuneration committee.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
The group’s policy in relation to the payment of its suppliers is to settle its terms of payment with each supplier when agreeing the terms 
of each business transaction. The supplier is made aware of the terms, which are detailed on the group’s purchasing orders. It is the 
group’s practice to abide by the agreed terms of payment. The company’s creditor payment period was 72 days (2005: 98 days) and 
the group’s creditor payment period was 78 days (2005: 98 days).

AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AND ALLOT SHARES
The Companies Act 1985 contains restrictions on the power of the directors to allot a company’s shares. As a result, the directors 
may only issue the shares pursuant to the authority within the statutory terms given by shareholders’ resolutions or contained in the 
Articles of Association. Their power to issue equity shares for cash to persons other than the existing shareholders is similarly restricted.
Resolutions to confer these authorities were passed at the previous Annual General Meeting (AGM) not on incorporation. These authorities 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2006 AGM unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the company in general meeting.
Resolutions to renew the authorities will be prepared at the AGM to be held on 14 November 2006.
Subsequent to the passing of these resolutions, the directors will have the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £158,966 and it will not be necessary for the directors to seek further approval from shareholders to issue shares for cash to persons, 
other than existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £52,989.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The directors’ assessment of key ﬁnancial risks, and policies in place to mitigate those risks, is set out in note 18 to the ﬁnancial statements.
HEALTH AND SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The company has detailed health and safety guidelines which are communicated to all employees, and which are regularly reviewed 
for suitability in the context of the company’s activities.
The group is fully committed to protecting the environment in which we live and work, both ecologically and socially. A formal policy is in place 
with internal management control systems to ensure that this is achieved as best as is practicable, and to ensure that the international 
standard for environmental management ISO14001 is met.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Commentary on key performance indicators are included in the ﬁnancial review on page 6.

CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
The group did not make any monetary charitable or political donations during the period. A non-monetary contribution of a by-product 
from the production process was made to the Prince’s Trust Community Project charity.
PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report conﬁrms that:
● so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
●  the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
GOING CONCERN
The directors are of the opinion that, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, the company and the group as a whole have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
AUDITORS
During the year the directors reappointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the auditors of the group.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the group will be proposed at the AGM.
By order of the board

_1_PUR_arb06.indd   3 19/10/2006   13:55:54 13 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
The company is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code. However, the board 
adopts a number of principles of the Combined Code that it feels are relevant to a business of the size and complexity of Pure Wafer plc, 
as set out below.
During the year the board comprised a non-executive chairman, three executive directors and a further two non-executive directors who 
brought an independent judgement to the group. The roles of chairman and chief executive have been split.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary, who is responsible to the board for ensuring that board 
procedures are followed and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, independent professional advice can be 
sought by all the directors of the company.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES
The board of directors, which includes three non-executive directors, meets regularly throughout the year. C G Clarke and E ap Gwilym are 
considered by the board to be independent non-executive directors. J A W Samuel is nominated as a director by Apax Partners. The board 
is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and investment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and consideration 
of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters. There is a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved to the board’s jurisdiction. It reviews the strategic 
direction of the group, its annual budgets, the progress towards achievement of those budgets, its forecasts and its capital expenditure 
programmes. In furtherance of their duties, there are agreed procedures for the directors to take independent advice, if necessary, 
at the company’s expense. 
The board considers the chairman to be the main point of contact to whom concerns of whatever nature may be conveyed. In the event 
that an individual does not wish to raise a concern with him, the board has identiﬁed E ap Gwilym, the lead non-executive director, 
as an independent member of the board to whom such concerns may be addressed.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The company has an audit committee comprising two non-executive directors and the chairman. During the year, the committee was 
chaired by J A W Samuel and provides a link between the board and the group’s auditors on matters falling within the scope of the group’s 
audit. These matters include accounting standards and policies, internal ﬁnancial control procedures and the group’s statutory ﬁnancial 
statements, which are intended for publication. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration committee comprises the two non-executive directors and the chairman and meets at least once a year. During the year 
the committee was chaired by E ap Gwilym. It is the remuneration committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on executive 
remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual directors.
TREASURY COMMITTEE
The treasury committee was appointed during the year and comprises the three executive directors and the group ﬁnancial controller. 
The committee meets on an as needed basis where speedy approval for treasury matters, particularly relating to foreign exchange, is required. 
The chairman of the committee, J J Dearing, reports any decisions taken, with justiﬁcation, to the board as quickly as practicable.
BOARD MEETINGS
There were seven board meetings during the period to 30 June 2006. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
_1_PUR_arb06.indd   4 19/10/2006   13:55:54 14 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
RISK MANAGEMENT
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the 
role of management is to implement board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of this system are:
●  the audit committee;
●  a comprehensive budgeting system, with an annual budget approved by the group board;
●  detailed monthly reporting, including forecasting to the group board and comparison of results against budget, with performance 
monitoring and explanations provided for signiﬁcant variances; and
●  a deﬁned procedure for seeking and obtaining approval for major transactions.
In order to address risk management, a control framework is in place which aims, as best as practicable, to:
● safeguard group assets;
● ensure proper accounting records are maintained; and
● provide reliable ﬁnancial information for internal and external use.
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company reports formally to the shareholders twice a year, when its half year and full year results are announced, and the interim report 
and annual report are sent to shareholders. The annual report is accompanied by notice of the AGM of the company, at which a presentation 
is given and directors are available to take questions, both formally during the meeting and informally after the meeting. The management 
is available for dialogue with major shareholders on the company’s plans and objectives and from time to time meets with them.

INTRODUCTION
This report sets out the Pure Wafer executive remuneration policy, structure and details of remuneration received by directors in the year 
ended 30 June 2006. The share incentives and directors remuneration sections of this report have been audited.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration committee is responsible for:
●  establishing and recommending to the board the policy for executive remuneration;
●  determining, on behalf of the board and shareholders, the level and structure of remuneration packages of the executive directors; and
●  reviewing and ensuring the alignment of executive remuneration with remuneration throughout the organisation, including company 
share schemes.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole. No director is involved in discussions related to his 
own remuneration.
MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
Members of the committee were E ap Gwilym, chair of the committee, C G Clarke and J A W Samuel. All the members of the committee 
are non-executive directors. The committee met four times during the year and all the members attended all four meetings.
ADVISERS
During the year the remuneration committee received guidance from the non-executive chairman, the chief executive ofﬁcer and the 
company secretary, except on matters relating to their own remuneration. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The committee and board believe that in order to attract, motivate and retain a senior management team of the right calibre it is necessary 
to provide a competitive market based remuneration structure which rewards company and individual performance.
Remuneration packages comprise:
●  basic salary;
●  annual performance related bonus;
●  other beneﬁts; and
●  participation in share incentive plans. 
BASIC SALARY
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from July in each year. Pay reviews take into account company 
and individual performance.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUSES
Payments under the scheme are based upon the achievement of ﬁnancial targets for the company as set by the remuneration committee.

_1_PUR_arb06.indd   8 19/10/2006   13:55:55 18 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the company and the group and of the proﬁt and loss of the group for that period. The directors are required to prepare the ﬁnancial 
statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and the group will continue in business.
The directors conﬁrm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently. They also conﬁrm that reasonable and 
prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 and that 
applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors’ report and other information included in the annual report is prepared in 
accordance with company law in the United Kingdom. They are also responsible for ensuring that the annual report includes information 
required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the group’s website on which these ﬁnancial statements are published. 
The directors acknowledge that legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the ﬁnancial information 
contained in the ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. The directors are aware that the uncertainties that exist 
are compounded as information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements relating to the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
_1_PUR_arb06.indd   9 19/10/2006   13:55:55 19 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
We have audited the group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Pure Wafer plc for the year ended 30 June 2006 
which comprise the group proﬁt and loss account, the group and company balance sheets, the group cash ﬂow statement, and the related notes. 
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the 
directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements, and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited, have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. We also report to you 
if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other 
information comprises only the directors’ report, the chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review and the unaudited part of 
the directors’ remuneration report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors 
in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
●  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2006 and of the group’s proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
●  the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985; and
● the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 2006
_1_PUR_arb06.indd   13 19/10/2006   13:55:56 23 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards 
in the United Kingdom and with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The group accounts comprise the consolidation of the accounts of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings after eliminating 
inter-company transactions. As provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate proﬁt and loss account for the company 
is not disclosed.
Merger accounting has been applied to the reconstruction of the former Pure Wafer Limited that took place during the ﬁnancial year to 
30 June 2005. In consequence, the results for that year are presented as if the Pure Wafer plc group had existed and traded in its present 
form for the entire year.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
The cost of ﬁxed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, or valuation, of tangible ﬁxed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a 
straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. No depreciation is charged until the assets have 
been commissioned and are in use.
The principal rates used are as follows:
Leasehold buildings  15 years
Plant and machinery  10 years
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment 5 years
IT equipment   3 years
Impairment of ﬁxed assets
Impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value of income-generating units. Recoverable 
value is the higher of net realisable value and estimated value in use at the date the impairment loss is recognised. Value in use represents 
the present value of expected future discounted cash ﬂows. If incurred, impairment is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general, cost is determined on a ﬁrst in ﬁrst out 
basis and includes transport and handling costs; in the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production 
overheads based on the normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which stocks can be sold in the normal course of business 
after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing state to a ﬁnished condition. 
Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable proﬁts against which to recover carried forward tax losses and/or from which the future reversal of underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis.

_1_PUR_arb06.indd   14 19/10/2006   13:55:56 24 Pure Wafer plc annual report and accounts 2006
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Government grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account which is released to the proﬁt and loss 
account over the expected lives of the assets concerned. All other grants are credited to the proﬁt and loss account on a receivable basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date, except where covered by forward currency transactions when they are translated at the contracted rates. Other assets 
are translated to Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of purchase or, where covered by forward currency transactions, 
at the contract rate.
Research and development expenditure
All research and development costs are written off in the year in which they are incurred, with the exception of certain major product development 
projects relating to new products or processes where reasonable certainty exists, as regards technical and commercial viability. Such expenditure 
is capitalised and amortised over the expected product life commencing in the year when sales of the product are made for the ﬁrst time.
Leased assets
Where assets are ﬁnanced by leasing agreements which give substantially the same rights as ownership (“ﬁnance leases”) the assets are 
treated as if they had been purchased outright at the capital value of the assets and the corresponding leasing commitments are shown 
as obligations to the lessor. The capital element of lease payments is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest is 
charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the period of the lease. Other rentals are charged wholly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Financial instruments
The only derivative instruments utilised by the group are forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used for hedging 
purposes to alter the risk proﬁle of an existing underlying exposure of the group in line with the group’s risk management policies.
Turnover
Turnover, which represents the value of goods and services supplied, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and commissions paid, 
is recognised on despatch of goods sold.
Pension scheme arrangements
The group makes contributions on behalf of its employees into deﬁned contribution pension arrangements. Contributions are charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
2. TURNOVER
The group’s activities and turnover consist solely of the reclamation and reprocessing of silicon test wafers, in the UK for external customers.
The group’s turnover is analysed by geographical territory of destination as follows:
       2006 2005 
       £000 £000

Deferred taxation
The group has reported its ﬁrst full year of taxable proﬁts, which have been relieved against brought forward tax losses. As the directors are conﬁdent 
of the trading and ﬁnancial prospects of the group, based upon short term forecasts a deferred tax asset has been recognised for part of the unutilised 
tax losses at 30 June 2006 to the extent the asset is regarded as recoverable. The quantum of the deferred tax asset will be reassessed annually.

7. TAXATION CONTINUED
Deferred taxation continued
The Pure Wafer group, headed by Pure Wafer plc, has approximately £25.1m (2005: £26.6m) of taxation losses. Of this, £5.1m (2005: £4.5m) 
has been utilised to eliminate the requirement for a deferred tax liability, £6.3m (2005: nil) has been recognised as a deferred tax asset 
(tax value of £1.9m) and £13.7m (2005: £22.1m) was carried forward not yet recognised as a deferred tax asset (tax value of £4.1m).

8. PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company’s proﬁt and loss account has not been included in these ﬁnancial 
statements. Of the proﬁt for the year, a loss of £158,000 (2005: proﬁt of £129,000) is dealt with in the entity accounts of Pure Wafer plc.
9. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. The calculation for 2005 is based upon the number of shares in issue at the date of group reconstruction.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
Earnings/(loss) per share have been calculated as follows:
       2006 2005 
       ‘000 ‘000
Weighted average number of ordinary shares:  
– In issue during the year       26,494 24,206

Intangible ﬁxed assets comprise expenditure made on a 50 nanometre process developed within Pure Wafer. This new process utilises more 
advanced technology than wafer reclaim, and does not relate to test wafers. The expenditure on the project meets the guidelines within SSAP13 
for capitalisation so management has capitalised this development work in order to match the costs incurred to the associated revenue 
in the following years. The intangible asset will be amortised over ﬁve years.
The company does not have any intangible ﬁxed assets.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Policy
The role that ﬁnancial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks that the group faces in its activities is 
summarised below. This note also sets out details of the objective and policies for holding or issuing ﬁnancial instruments and similar 
contracts. Details are also set out of the strategies for achieving these objectives that have been followed during the year.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities as deﬁned in Financial Reporting Standard 13: 
Derivatives and other Financial Instruments (“FRS13”). For this purpose, certain ﬁnancial assets such as investments in subsidiary companies 
are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS13, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than currency disclosures. 
(a) Objectives, policies and strategies
Introduction
The group’s ﬁnancial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and various items such as trade debtors and 
trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. 
The group also enters into forward foreign currency transactions, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks arising from the 
group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period, the group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments is undertaken.
The group’s only signiﬁcant borrowings are ﬁnance leases held in US Dollars. Interest is charged on these at a rate ﬁxed on the date 
of drawdown. Accordingly the group is not subject to interest rate risk on existing borrowings.
The main risks arising from the group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. The board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing these risks, as summarised below.
Foreign currency risk
Over 90% of the group’s sales are invoiced in US Dollars and most of the remaining sales in Euros. The great majority of the group’s costs 
are incurred in Sterling. The group uses forward currency contracts, based on the forecast exposure for each quarter, to manage the risk.
Liquidity risk
The group constantly reviews its borrowing requirements to ensure adequate funds are available for ongoing operations. This is achieved 
through the preparation of cash ﬂow forecasts with comparison to actual performance.

(i) Finance leases
The ﬁnance lease in existence at the start of the year relates to funding for the purchase of an item of machinery on which the supplier has 
provided the company with four years interest free credit.
The new ﬁnance leases in the year have been used to fund purchases of ﬁxed assets. The leases are in US Dollars and are repayable 
over four years, with interest rates ﬁxed on the date of drawdown. The blended interest rate achieved on interest bearing ﬁnance leases 
outstanding on 30 June 2006 is 8.1% per annum.
(c) Currency proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The functional currency of all of the group’s operations is Sterling.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Policy continued
(e) Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The fair value of the group’s cash at bank and in hand and its ﬁnance leases as at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 is considered by the 
directors not to be signiﬁcantly different to the book value.
(f) Hedging 
The group has, on occasion, entered into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge against the currency exposures that arise on sales 
denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements 
until the hedged position matures. 
At 30 June 2006, the fair value of unrealised gains on these ﬁnancial instruments amounted to £10,000 (2005: loss of £124,000) of which 
gains of £106,000 (2005: loss of £121,000) were carried forward in the balance sheet pending their recognition in the proﬁt and loss account 
in the year to 30 June 2006, as the losses on the net assets which they are hedging are realised.
(g) Borrowing facilities
Aside from headroom within the ﬁnance leasing facilities, the group did not have any unutilised borrowing facilities at 30 June 2006.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
_1_PUR_arb06.indd   27 19/10/2006   13:55:58 During the many stages of the manufacturing 
process of semiconductors, large quantities 
of test wafers are used to check the accurate 
calibration of equipment. These test wafers 
are a key consumable in the manufacture of 
semiconductors and the ability to reclaim them 
through Pure Wafer’s advanced process 
provides manufacturers with the opportunity 
to reduce costs.
The semiconductor industry is currently 
seeing a rapid transition to 300mm wafers. 
In order for manufacturers to continue to 
increase functionality at a reduced cost, 
the industry has sought to increase the size 
of wafers on which semiconductors are 
manufactured. 300mm wafer processing 
now represents the fastest growing area 
of the semiconductor industry.
However, wafer reclaim is a highly specialised 
and technically sophisticated process. Only 
a few companies worldwide are able to 
meet the exacting standards required 
by semiconductor manufacturers for 
the reclaim of 300mm wafers, of which 
Pure Wafer is one.
Pure Wafer’s customers include producers 
of DRAM, logic device manufacturers, 
foundry chip producers and equipment 
manufacturers and leading research and 
development operations. We are proud to 
be supplying and working closely with many 
of the largest and technically advanced 
semiconductor companies in the world.
At Pure Wafer, our process for reclaiming 
test wafers involves the following key stages: 
●  Inspection of the wafers for defects and 
classiﬁcation by type of contaminant to 
be removed 
●  Submersion in a precise mix of chemicals 
appropriate to remove the contaminant 
●  Assessment of ﬂatness and correction 
of defects using Pure Wafer’s advanced 
polishing processes 
● Cleaning and drying 
●  Final quality inspection and packaging 
for return to the customer
The company operates from a state of the art, 
purpose built facility situated in a new technology 
park in Swansea, Wales and is the 
most advanced plant of its kind in Europe. 
The size of the facility is in excess of 
4,500m
2
 and includes over 2,000m
2
 
of production cleanrooms. 
We have installed the latest generation of 
tools available on the market, with the most 
advanced equipment as used by IC and 
prime silicon producers. With the highest 
technical speciﬁcations, we are positioned 
to offer the most effective wafer reclaim 
service to our customers providing best in 
class product characteristics with minimal 
silicon removal. This enables our customers 
to maximise the number of times a test wafer 
can be reclaimed.

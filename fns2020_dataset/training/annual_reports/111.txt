advantage of these significant 
opportunities whilst ensuring 
that our investment in the US 
is disciplined as the market is 
established. 
We monitor the regulatory 
environment in the UK and 
Europe closely as countries 
adapt their approaches. Our 
significant regulatory 
experience and operational 
scale means that we are able 
to manage the impact of 
these changes better than 
most and to take advantage 
of opportunities that these 
changes open up, particularly 
in enabling larger players like 
888 to increase market share.  
Financial results and 
Dividend
2014 has seen another year 
of record performance driven 
by growth across our core 
products and delivering 
on our financial forecasts 
enabling us to increase 
revenue to US$455 million, 
representing a 14% uplift 
from the prior year (2013: 
US$401 million). We continue 
to strengthen our market 
position through investment 
in product development 
and cost effective customer 
acquisition, while increasing 
our adjusted EBITDA by 33% 
to US$101 million (2013: 
US$76 million) and profit after 
tax by 14% to US$57 million 
(2013: US$50 million). 
Chairman’s Statement
Mobile is having a 
transformational impact on 
our business. We continued to 
innovate with a ‘mobile first’ 
approach embedded in all 
product development whilst 
our best-in-class technology 
and analytical capabilities 
facilitated ever more effective 
targeting of our marketing 
investment. 
Growth in the global online 
gambling industry is set to 
continue in 2015, despite 
challenging Poker market 
dynamics and a competitive 
UK Bingo market. New 
markets are becoming 
regulated, presenting 
opportunities across the 
globe. In the US, we are 
uniquely positioned to exploit 
the progressive regulation 
of the market as the only 
operator active in all three 
regulated states. Whilst to 
date market momentum in 
the US has been slower than 
many anticipated, the long-
term opportunities remain 
significant and we will be a 
major player as more states 
regulate online gaming over 
time. Our approach gives us 
the financial firepower to take 
2014 was another record year for 888, building 
on the strategic development of the Group 
in 2013. This success has been driven by an 
outstanding Casino performance, but was also 
underpinned by notably strong growth both 
in Sport and in our B2B business as well as 
impressive market outperformance in Poker and 
in Bingo.

Chairman

Overview
As at 31 December 2014, 
888 had US$163 million cash 
and cash equivalents (2013: 
US$116 million) and US$67 
million liabilities to customers 
(2013: US$55 million). 
Given the continuing strong 
financial performance 
of the Group, the Board 
is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.5¢ per share 
(which together with the 
interim dividend equals 8.0¢ 
per share in accordance with 
the Group’s dividend policy) 
and an additional one-off 
7.0¢ per share, bringing the 
total for the year to 15.0¢ per 
share (2013: 14.0¢ per share). 
Board changes
I would like to take this 
opportunity to highlight 
some changes to our Board, 
some of which have been 
previously announced, and all 
of which have been carefully 
planned and implemented 
in order to support the 
Company’s further growth and 
development.
Late last year, Ron McMillan 
joined the Board and was 
appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee. With a wealth of 
experience on boards and 
audit committees, and a long 
and respected ‘Big 4’ career 
behind him, we can already 
see the great value that Ron 
is bringing to 888. 
From the conclusion of 
the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting, I will be stepping 
down as Chairman of the 
Board due to my retirement. 
It is with a heavy heart 
that I conclude my nine-
year tenure as Chairman. 
However I am consoled by the 
knowledge that I am leaving 
the Company at the top of 
its game and only getting 
stronger.
At the same time as my 
retirement, Brian Mattingley 
will be stepping down as 
Chief Executive Officer, 
and appointed Executive 
Chairman. We are very 
excited at this move, which 
will allow the Company to 
continue to take advantage of 
Brian’s wealth of experience, 
particularly in maintaining 
and developing relationships 
with regulators. In Brian 
Mattingley, shareholders 
have an Executive Chairman 
with huge experience of the 
gaming industry and extensive 
knowledge of our business. 
With Brian as Executive 
Chairman, we feel confident 
that we have an industry-
leading senior team to 
continue 888’s growth and 
development in the years to 
come.
Finally, John Anderson will 
be stepping down as a 
Non-executive Director from 
the conclusion of the 2015 
Annual General Meeting. John 
is a valuable resource of 
knowledge and experience in 
the industry, and will remain 
available to consult with and 
assist the Board as needed. 
I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank John for 
his dedication and service 
to 888, as its CEO until 2006, 
and as a Non-executive 
Director thereafter.
On a personal note, I would 
like to thank our shareholders 
for the trust and confidence 
which they have placed in the 
Board and in my leadership 
as Chairman. 
Winning team
The success enjoyed by 
the company in the last 
12-months is, once again, 
testament to the hard-work 
and quality of the 888 team. 
Globally, our 1,800 staff 
are setting the standard of 
innovation in online gaming 
and are the Group’s greatest 
asset. Their passion will ensure 
that 888 continues to be at 
the fore of the online gaming 
industry for years to come. On 
behalf of the board I would 
like to thank all my colleagues 
for their commitment to 
making the 888 strategy 
come to life. 
Outlook
888’s success has been built 
on its world class technology 
and market leading products. 
The global online gaming 
market will continue to 
develop driven by regulation 
and with mobile, in particular, 
making our products more 
accessible and enjoyable 
than ever. 
Although we do face 
regulatory headwinds in some 
of our markets, including the 
Point of Consumption Tax in 
the UK, I am confident that we 
are strongly placed to take 
advantage of opportunities 
that they also open up to 
larger, well-financed market 
leaders such as 888. 
Our focus will continue to 
be on delivering a truly 
satisfying experience for our 
customers and delivering 
strong, sustainable long 
term earnings growth for our 
shareholders.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2014 Overview
Another record-breaking 
year
This excellent financial result 
reflects the fundamental 
strengths of our business 
and the continued execution 
of our focused strategy. 
Innovation and technology 
leadership are at 888’s core 
and we have continued to 
enhance our offering to 
ensure that our customers 
always play the most 
enjoyable games in the 
safest possible environment. 
Underpinning this focus are 
our technology platform and 
analytical capabilities which 
together deliver industry-
leading marketing strategies 
that enable the Group to 
attract more players to the 
888 brand and increase 
customer lifetime value. This 
was evidenced by the number 
of active players in Casino 
and Poker increasing as at 
Q4 2014 by seven and eight 
per cent. respectively, against 
the prior year.
888’s Casino offering has 
again been a key driver 
behind the Group’s success, 
delivering consistent stand-
out growth reflecting the 
quality of our product as well 
as our unrivalled heritage in 
this vertical. In Poker, I am 
delighted that we maintained 
our position at number two 
in the PokerScout* global 
rankings at the year end and 
Chief Executive’s Review
I am delighted to report that 2014 was 
another exceptional year for 888 as the 
Group delivered all-time-high revenues, 
further enhanced profitability and 
maintained strong cash generation. 
were able to deliver stable 
revenue in a market which 
many other operators have 
found challenging. In Bingo, 
we continued to benefit from 
the strategic decision we took 
during 2013 to restructure 
the division as we performed 
well in what remained a 
competitive and mature 
market. The performance of 
888Sport was undoubtedly 
a major highlight in 2014 
as revenue increased in 
this important vertical by 
115% against the prior year 
reflecting the standard of 
our offer since re-launching 
the product in May 2013. 
Underpinning our growth 
across verticals has been our 
leading mobile proposition 
as more and more customers 
choose to play on touch 
devices, benefitting from the 
unrivalled accessibility and 
usability they provide. We 
were also pleased with the 
revenue growth delivered by 
Dragonfish, our leading B2B 
offer, which was driven by 
our US operations as well as 
further progress on our Bingo 
business. 
The excellent overall progress 
we made in 2014 is testament 
to our highly skilled and 
dedicated team and, as ever, 
I would like to thank everyone 
at 888 for their hard work 
during the year. As described 
in the Chairman’s statement 
and as previously announced, 
2014 was my final full year as 
CEO of 888. I look back on my 
three years as CEO with pride 
as the business has delivered 
transformational growth in 
its core markets and entered 
new regulated markets in 
Spain, Italy and the US which 
provide a strong platform 
for future development. 888 
boasts one of the most 
dynamic and talented teams 
in the industry and I look 
forward to continuing to 
provide guidance and support 
to the rest of the executive 
team as 888 continues to 
develop in the years to come. 
* As at 17 March 2015.

Our business model  
and strategy
888 is one of the world’s 
most popular online gaming 
and entertainment solutions 
providers. Under our trusted 
brands, we have been at the 
forefront of the online gaming 
industry for more than 16 
years by providing customers 
with market-leading products 
that are localised to enable 
players to enjoy the games 
they want, in the languages 
they speak, in a safe and 
secure environment. 
The Group is structured into 
two lines of business: B2C, 
under the 888 brand, and 
B2B, conducted through 
Dragonfish. This structure 
allows the Group to leverage 
its core technological, 
product, marketing and 
analytical strengths and 
maximise their benefits 
across both B2C and B2B 
routes to market. This 
approach enables 888 to 
compete successfully and 
surpass competition in 
both established and newer 
markets. 
With increasing international 
regulation in our industry 
and the evolution of more 
technologies, we continue to 
see clear growth opportunities 
in our global markets. We 
remain well placed to deliver 
long term growth across our 
business and value for our 
shareholders. Our stated 
strategy to achieve this 
comprises five key pillars: 
Growth and development of 
our core products
888 is focused on the growth 
and development of its core 
product groups which are 
Casino, Poker, Bingo and 
Sport, where we work with a 
partner. These products are 
delivered through our B2C 
and B2B lines of business.
“ “Best in class” B2C offer
888’s B2C offering remains 
at the core of the Group 
and is the foundation for the 
success of the business. We 
continue to innovate, invest 
in and develop our offer 
to ensure that we deliver 
an unrivalled customer 
experience through best-in-
class products, excellence in 
customer service delivering 
a real value-for-money 
proposition for our customers. 
These core principles of our 
B2C offer, in combination 
with our advanced modelling 
and analytics competencies 
that underpin our product 
development and CRM 
functions, helps us to increase 
customer numbers and 
acquire customers at lower 
cost; further strengthen 
brand loyalty; and enhance 
customer lifetime value. 
Partner of choice through 
Dragonfish (B2B) 
Dragonfish is 888’s B2B arm 
which offers clients industry 
leading Total Gaming 
Services solutions that are 
tested vigorously to meet 
the regulatory requirements 
of the different jurisdictions 
where they are involved. The 
quality of our offering, driven 
by our continuous investment 
in developing leading gaming 
platforms, means that we 
continue to establishing 
ourselves as the partner of 
choice in both regulated and 
newly regulating markets.
Driving margin growth through 
operational efficiencies 
Management remains 
steadfastly focused on 
improving the Group’s margins 
by maximising operational 
efficiencies, including by 
constantly developing our 
marketing approach and 
driving increased volumes.

Expansion in regulated 
markets
We are focused on developing 
our presence in locally 
regulated markets. A key 
advantage of having our 
own technology, product 
development, marketing, 
analytics and CRM teams 
working closely together is 
that it allows us to control the 
key drivers for our success. 
This ensures that we have 
the agility and skills to 
successfully and efficiently 
launch in newly regulated 
markets.
Operational Review:
Delivering our Strategy 
Technology leadership and 
innovation
Technology leadership and 
continuous innovation are 
central to 888’s progress. 
Our proprietary platform 
underpinned by industry-
leading back office systems 
and unique online marketing 
experience, developed over 
more than 16 years at the fore 
of the industry, provide the 
bedrock of our competitive 
advantage. 
This technical edge and 
our strong analytical 
capabilities drive the success 
of our products from initial 
development through to 
marketing and customer 
service. We continue to 
enhance our comprehensive 
analytical tools allowing 
our marketing spend to be 
increasingly effective.
Touch devices represent the 
future of our industry and 888 
was quick to acknowledge 
the major shift in customer 
preferences towards mobile 
platforms. We previously fully 
embedded a mobile product 
offering across all of our 
verticals and our strategic 
decision to develop our own 
mobile games and solution, 
thereby giving the Group full 
control over innovation and 
developing our offer ahead 
of our competition, has 
been vindicated as revenue 
from mobile devices grew 
impressively during the year. 
Furthermore, our internal 
culture has developed so 
that product development 
is first and foremost focused 
on developing mobile games 
and solutions. We continue 
to invest in and develop our 
front-end mobile products 
which, in combination with 
our proven back office 
capabilities, mean that we 
are confident of delivering 
sustainable growth from 
mobile supported by new 
and innovative marketing 
strategies devised specifically 
for mobile players. 
Excellent momentum in B2C
888’s B2C offer comprises 
core products in Casino, 
Poker and Bingo as well 
as an emerging offering in 
Sport. Our strong brands 
offer more than a dozen 
localised offerings to players 
in more than 100 countries. 
B2C revenue during the 
year was US$391 million, an 
11% increase on the prior 
year (2013: US$352 million), 
representing 86% of total 
Group revenue (2013: 88%). 
Casino
Casino enjoyed another 
exceptional year delivering 
double digit revenue growth 
in each quarter of 2014 
against the prior year, 
resulting in a total revenue 
increase of 16% to US$221 
million (2013: US$190 million). 
This reflects exceptionally 
strong performances in 
our core market in the UK, 
where we retained a market 
leading position, as well as in 
Spain where the 888 brand 
continues to gain traction. 
888’s outperformance in this 
vertical is underpinned by our 
continuous innovation. We 
have consistently refreshed 
our games portfolio and 
developed premium content 
courtesy of our in-house 
Games Studio. Furthermore, 
our ability to continually 
develop our own mobile 
Casino product remains a key 
growth driver.
We added 49 new PC games 
and 34 new mobile games 
during the course of the year 
to ensure we remain at the 
fore of the online gaming 
experience. In combination 
with effective and innovative 
marketing campaigns, this 
has helped the Group to 
attract new customers to 
the 888Casino brand, with a 
7% year on year increase in 
active Casino customers as at 
Q4 2014.
Poker
Poker delivered a very 
resilient performance in 
2014, bucking negative 
trends witnessed across 
the industry by recording 
stable revenue of US$94 
million (2013: US$94 million) 
and maintaining 888Poker’s 
position at number two in 
the global liquidity rankings 
according to PokerScout. 
This pleasing performance 
demonstrates 888Poker’s 
competitive edge which 
results from our consistent 
and unwavering focus on 
providing recreational players 
with a safe and enjoyable 
poker ecosystem as well as 
the strength of our player 
proposition. Together these 
enable 888 to perform well 
even in a challenging industry 
environment. 
Furthermore, our trusted 
Poker brand continues to 
provide significant cross-
sell opportunities for 888 as 
we drive customers towards 
our other products, notably 
Casino. 
Mobile continued to grow in 
popularity, particularly suiting 
the playing habits of our 
target customer base, and 
we continue to develop and 
innovate our offer on this 
platform. 
Bingo
Bingo delivered 7% year 
on year revenue growth to 
US$47 million (2013: US$44 
million). This represents an 
impressive result in what 
continues to be a mature and 
competitive market and 888’s

performance vindicates the 
strategic decision taken in 
2013 to restructure our Bingo 
division. We are now able 
to apply the Group’s core 
competencies in analytics, 
CRM and content creation to 
the Bingo product.
2015 is likely to be a 
challenging year in Bingo 
as Point of Consumption 
Tax impacts the highly 
competitive and fragmented 
UK market, however we 
approach this environment 
with good momentum. 
Emerging Offering 
Revenue from our Emerging 
Offering was US$30 million 
(2013: US$24 million) 
reflecting the tremendous 
growth delivered by Sport. 
2014 was a transformational 
year for 888Sport recording 
a spectacular 115% increase 
in revenue. This reflected 
excellent performances 
during major sporting events 
over the year, most notably 
including the FIFA World Cup 
in June and July. The World 
Cup saw a significant amount 
of promotional and marketing 
activity across the industry, 
providing a stern test for the 
strength of our revamped 
product and the appeal of 
the 888Sport brand, and I am 
delighted that we delivered 
such a positive result.
At the time of the re-launch 
of 888Sport in May 2013 we 
set ourselves very testing and 
ambitious growth targets 
in this vertical that our 
team has achieved. There 
remains a significant growth 
opportunity in this major 
e-gaming vertical and further 
developing Sport will be a 
major driver of the Group’s 
overall strategy in the coming 
years as significant customer 
acquisition and revenue 
opportunities remain available 
for 888. 
Significant growth in B2B
Dragonfish, the Group’s B2B 
line of business, delivered 
a strong 32% increase in 
revenue to US$64 million 
(2013: US$48 million), 
accounting for 14% of total 
Group revenue. This increase 
was driven by a first full year 
of contributions from our 
nascent US operations as well 
as growth in our pre-existing 
leading B2B platform and 
offer.
We further developed our 
leading B2B bingo platform, 
adding 13 new skins to the 
Dragonfish Bingo network 
during the year and extending 
key strategic deals, including 
a four year extension with 
Cashcade Ltd. announced  
in May. 
Success in regulated markets 
UK & Europe
We continued to drive 
growth in the UK market, 
which accounted for 44% of 
Group revenue. 2014 saw a 
significant development in 
the UK as the entire online 
industry was subjected to 
licencing and taxation, and 
we have adapted our strategy 
to accommodate this change 
in our major market. As well 
as remaining highly focused 
on further developing our 
leading customer proposition, 
a significant focus during the 
year was placed on ensuring 
the Group was fully prepared 
in advance of the introduction 
of Point of Consumption 
Tax, which came into effect 
in December. This included 
developing strategies to

whilst continuing to ensure 
that our customers enjoy 
the most enjoyable gaming 
experience and exceptional 
value. Nevertheless our profit 
margins in this market are 
set to contract in the medium 
term. 
As a result of our meticulous 
preparation, operational 
momentum, scale and leading 
brand, we are well placed 
to further develop in the UK 
market and take advantage 
of opportunities that arise 
as a result of the changing 
industry landscape. 
In Spain we built on our 
leading position in Casino 
and, early in the second 
half of the year, made the 
important introduction of 
888sport.es to the Spanish 
market. Spain is primarily 
a sport driven market and 
our strong results in Spain 
prior to the introduction of 
888sport.es were a significant 
achievement. Now with a full 
suite of Casino, Poker and 
Sport products across both 
desktop and mobile platforms 
we are in a strong position to 
further build our market share 
as the 888 brand continues to 
gain traction. 
Whilst the Italian market 
continues be volatile, we 
have seen positive and 
encouraging trends for 888.it 
since introducing our mobile 
offering in the final quarter of 
the year. We continue to focus 
on developing our Casino 
product in this market and 
will evaluate opportunities for 
further products over time. 
US
In the US we built on our 
achievements in 2013 when 
we launched successfully in 
all three regulated states - 
Nevada, Delaware and New 
Jersey. In our first full year of 
trading we have developed 
unrivalled know-how and 
experience of the US market 
as well as further developing 
the key relationships and 
networks to reinforce our 
position to be a major player 
in the US market as state by 
state regulation occurs. 
Trading in New Jersey, the 
largest of the three regulated 
states, has been slower 
than was forecast by many 
as a result of industry-wide 
technical issues around geo-
location and ePayments, 
as well as the continued 
operation of unregulated sites 
and a general lack of public 
awareness in the market 
of legalised online gaming. 
A study we conducted in 
the summer informed us 
that a significant portion 
of our target New Jersey 
market remained unaware of 
legalised online gaming, and 
these findings along with our 
experience of this market are 
helping to shape and refine 
our marketing approach 
moving forward. Despite 
the overall slower market 
environment, our market share 
performance is solid with 
more than 50% of the Poker 
market accounted for by the 
888 platform which is used 
by the All American Poker 
Network (“ “AAPN”) and other 
operators. 
In February, the states of 
Delaware and Nevada signed 
an interstate compact 
whereby poker liquidity can 
be pooled, meaning that 888, 
as the only operator in both 
states, is in a unique position 
to gain from increased 
liquidity. We deployed a 
shared poker network across 
both states in early 2015, 
creating a competitive edge

for 888 as well as for our 
operating partners. Our ability 
and unique experience of 
delivering interstate liquidity 
is another advantage for 888 
as and when smaller states 
introduce regulation over time. 
The opportunities in the US 
remain potentially vast and 
we remain committed for 
the long term. Our approach 
gives 888 the flexibility and 
resources to launch in more 
states as and when they 
regulate and coupled with our 
unique market experience we 
continue to have a significant 
technical and regulatory 
competitive edge.
Customer protection
888’s leading payment 
processing capabilities 
support a wide variety of 
languages and currencies 
with almost 50 payment 
methods. It is vital that we 
are able to offer fast, efficient 
and easy to use payment 
processing, both to ensure a 
positive customer experience 
but also to maximise revenue 
and convert browsers into 
players. However, we take 
our duty as a responsible 
operator very seriously and 
take comprehensive steps 
to minimise fraud, problem 
gaming and eliminate minors 
from using our services. 
2015 outlook
In 2015 the UK market will 
undoubtedly be impacted by 
the new Point of Consumption 
Tax that was introduced in 
December 2014. In the early 
stages of the new regime, 
there has been minimal 
impact on competitor activity 
and marketing; however, we 
continue to expect smaller 
operators to be marginalised 
as a result of the duty which 
may present opportunities to 
industry leaders such as 888.
The Group continues 
to monitor regulatory 
changes developments and 
opportunities across Europe 
and the US. We remain in 
close dialogue with regulators 
and Governments where 
we operate, allowing 888 to 
plan ahead and leverage 
our experience and agility 
in preparing for significant 
regulatory changes. 
Regulatory developments will 
continue to have a profound 
impact on the Group. The 
growing trend towards ‘‘place-
of-consumption based” 
regulatory regimes means a 
growing number of licencing, 
compliance and tax burdens 
for the Group. In addition 
to the UK, we expect similar 
changes in other European 
markets (such as The 
Netherlands and Romania) 
in 2015.
We are closely watching the 
ongoing debates around the 
US regarding the regulation of 
online gaming. Of particular 
interest is the ongoing debate 
in Washington DC, fuelled by 
the opponents of internet 
gaming, over a federal ban 
on online gaming. We hope 
that the voices of reason 
and progress will prevail in 
that debate and that 888 will 
continue to play a leading 
role in the emergence of 
internet gaming around  
the US.
As always, we remain firm 
believers in the importance 
of well-crafted regulatory 
frameworks as a vehicle for 
creating long-term value 
in our industry, and we 
continue to support efforts 
in this direction worldwide. 
Our significant experience 
of successfully entering 
regulated markets means 
that we continue to be well 
positioned to capitalise 
on positive regulatory 
developments.
The fundamental growth 
drivers of the online gaming 
industry remain robust, driven 
by continuing regulation 
and the increasing adoption 
of user-friendly mobile 
technology that provides 
players with an unrivalled 
experience wherever and 
whenever they choose to play. 
888 remains well positioned 
in the market underpinned by 
our operational scale, strong 
brand and exceptional team.

Financial Review and Key Performance Indicators
Overview
888’s success is built on its technological strength in combination 
with the efficient utilisation of this technology, directed by 
extensive data analytics. The goals of 888’s industry-leading 
business analytics are simple: to maximise customer recruitment, 
increase customer lifetime value and minimise the cost per 
customer acquisition, thereby optimising return on marketing 
investment. The continued growth in Group revenues to record 
levels reflects 888’s continued success in attracting new 
customers, retaining them and increasing their overall spend.
Following a record performance in 2013 in which the Company 
delivered a revenue increase of 7%, 888 outperformed in 2014 
with another record-breaking year, recording an outstanding 
14% increase in revenues to US$455 million (2013: US$401 
million). Growth was driven primarily by the B2C line of 
business, with an 11% revenue increase. This was led by an 
outstanding performance from Casino which recorded a 
revenue increase of 16%, reflecting 888’s leading product, 
back office technology and rich offering across platforms. 
Bingo revenue increased 7% and Emerging offering increased 
22%, led by impressive growth in Sport leveraging the Group’s 
new integrated Sport platform capabilities introduced in May 
2013. Poker maintained its leading performance with stable 
revenues of US$94 million, bucking negative industry trends 
and consolidating the Group’s number two position in global 
liquidity rankings, as reported by Pokerscout. 
888’s B2B business (Dragonfish) delivered an outstanding 
increase in revenue of 32% driven by 888’s US business as well 
as expanding activity with the Company’s Bingo partners.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to US$101 million (2013: US$76 
million) and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.1% (2013: 
18.9%). This is a remarkable achievement given that Research 
and Development expenses increased by US$10 million over the 
year and additional gaming duties charges were incurred as a 
result of the introduction of Point of Consumption Tax in the UK, 
which came into effect from the beginning of December.
Profit before tax increased 28% to US$68 million (2013: US$53 
million) and Adjusted Earnings per Share increased 16% to 
19.2¢ (2013: 16.6¢).
888’s record performance in 2014 resulted in strong and 
continually growing operational cash generation of US$112 
million (2013: US$90 million). The Group’s financial position 
remains strong with cash and cash equivalents at the year-end 
of US$163 million (2013: US$116 million).

Financial Review and Key Performance Indicators
888Casino continued its strong growth, with record revenues of 
US$221 million and a 7% increase in active players during Q4 
compared to the prior year, reflecting leading CRM and back 
office technology accompanied by effective marketing as well 
as expansion of the mobile offering.
888Poker outperformed industry trends and maintained stable 
revenue at US$94 million in a mature market, supported by 
an 8% increase in active players during Q4 compared to the 
prior year reflecting improvements made to the Group’s Poker 
product. This resulted in impressive stability at number two in 
the global poker rankings, as reported by PokerScout.
Bingo B2C revenues increased by 7%, despite a highly 
competitive and mature market in the UK, continuing the 
recovery in Bingo following the strategic review the Group 
performed at the end of 2013.
Emerging Offerings delivered an impressive increase in revenue 
of 22%. This was driven by growth from the 888Sport brand, 
resulting from 888’s strategic agreement with Kambi Sports 
Solutions in 2013 which allowed the Group to offer its players 
a broader range of products and an enhanced gaming 
experience on both online channels and mobile platforms. The 
successful launch of Sport in Spain played an important role in 
the continuous success of the Emerging Offerings segment.
888’s B2B line of business achieved a record performance with 
revenue rising by 32% to US$64 million (2013: US$48 million) 
driven by the US business as well as expanding activity with 
various Bingo partners. 
Geographical segmentation
888’s turnover by geographical market is set out in the table 
below.

Rest of World 27.8 (5%) 6%
Total Revenue 454.7 14% 100%
Growth was achieved in most geographical segments with UK 
revenue up 23% driven by continued success of the Group’s 
Casino offering on mobile which delivered a significant 
increase in new players. The performance of Bingo in the UK 
was improved against the prior year as a result of the division’s 
recent restructuring. Europe (excluding UK) revenue increased 
5% in part as a result of the successful launch of the Group’s 
new Sport offering in Spain. 
Americas revenue increased 19%, driven by a full year of 
contributions from the US B2B business.
Revenue from the Rest of the World, which was not a focus 
region for 888 in 2014, declined by 5%.
Expenses
Selling and Marketing expenses were lower during 2014 as 
a result of further optimisation efforts and strict return on 
investment criteria in B2C. On the other hand, higher costs 
were incurred in Research and Development and in Sport as 
a result of higher commissions and royalties related to higher 
business volume. A one-off special cash bonus was awarded to 
eligible employees in recognition of their efforts and dedication 
to the year’s record performance and increased corporate tax 
attributed to the record-breaking set of results. 
Operating expenses
Operating expenses*, which mainly comprise employee related 
costs, commission and royalties payable to third parties, 
chargebacks, payment service providers’ (“PSP”) commissions 
and costs related to operational risk management services, 
totalled US$130million (2013: US$114 million). This represented 
a stable proportion of revenues at 28.7% (2013: 28.5%) as a 
result of continued operating efficiencies and strict cost control 
despite higher costs associated with Sport content required to 
support the Group’s enhanced Sport performance.
Staff costs as a percentage of revenues was maintained at 
13%, a consistent ratio with 2013 and 2012. 
The Group’s chargebacks ratio continued its trend of gradual 
decrease between 2011 and 2014, representing 0.6% of revenue 
during the year. On-going improvements to the Group’s Risk 
Management and Fraud detection mechanisms to enhance 
monitoring systems, alert processes and reporting including 
the continued use of 3DSecure verification systems, all resulted 
in an optimized balance between maintaining revenues and 
increased deposits inflow whilst reducing transactions with high 
risk profiles.
The PSP commission ratio decreased to 5.0% (2013: 5.5%) 
reflecting the Group’s stronger commercial terms coupled with 
higher deposit volumes.
Gaming taxes and duties
Gaming taxes and duties levied in regulated markets reached 
US$16 million (2013: US$14 million). Commencing from 
December 2014, Point of Consumption Tax in the UK was 
introduced and resulted in additional charges.
Research and Development expenses
The Research and Development expenses to revenue ratio 
increased slightly to 9% (2013: 8%). This year’s expense of 
US$41 million (2013: US$31 million) is mainly attributed to 
the Group’s investment in maintaining its leading position in 
the market which was achieved by investments in its highly 
skilled development teams, continued development of the US 
platform and a one-off bonus as described above. Additionally, 
significant efforts were invested towards the launch of licenced 
regulated gaming in the UK on 1 November 2014.

Research and Development expenses do not include 
capitalised in-house development costs which totalled US$6.7 
million (2013: US$10.2 million). The decrease is attributed 
mainly to the US regulated market as the majority of the 
investment took place during the previous year.
Selling and Marketing expenses
Marketing expenses during the year were US$134 million (2013: 
US$140 million) reflecting an optimization process which 
enabled the Group to focus on effective marketing channels. 
888’s online media buying channel focused on more profitable 
campaigns which generate an improved return-to-cost ratio. 
In search engine marketing channels, the Group optimized 
campaigns by aiming its efforts on recruiting higher value 
players. Accordingly, the marketing to revenue ratio significantly 
decreased to 29% (2013: 35%).
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses* totalled US$33 million (2013: US$27 
million) representing 7% of revenue (2013: 7%). The increase 
over the previous year was mainly attributed to the one-
off bonus described above, expenses related to employers’ 
national insurance obligation and to the increased level of 
professional expenses associated with obtaining the UK 
gaming licence.
Share Benefit Charges
Equity settled share benefit charges were US$1.3 million (2013: 
US$3.3 million). This year’s charges are mainly attributed 
to long-term incentive equity awards granted to eligible 
employees.
Cash settled share benefit charges decreased to US$0.4 
million (2013: US$2.2 million) due to the lower fair value of 
the long term incentive plan. Further details are given in the 
director’s remuneration report on page 33.
Finance Income and expenses
Finance income less finance expenses resulted in an expense of 
US$4.5 million (2013: expense of US$0.3 million). The majority 
of this change compared to the previous year is attributable to 
the fair value of operational hedging instruments.
The Group continually monitors foreign currency risk and takes 
steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept 
to an acceptable level. This has resulted in an expense of US$5 
million in respect of the ILS/US$ forward hedge given the 
strength of the US$. On the other hand, EUR and GBP forward 
transactions resulted in income of US$2 million. An additional 
expense of US$2 million is attributable to the valuation of 
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 
Group’s functional currency.
Adjusted EBITDA
As a result of the strong revenue increase coupled with strict 
cost control, a record Adjusted EBITDA of US$101 million 
(2013: US$76 million) was achieved. Adjusted EBITDA margin 
increased to a healthy 22.1% (2013: 18.9%).
Taxation
The tax charge for 2014 was US$11.0 million (2013: US$3.2 
million). This was mainly attributed to the increase in the 
Group’s profit as well as to tax expenses associated with 
the appreciation of financial assets denominated in foreign 
currencies incurred by the Group’s local subsidiary which 
reports in non US Dollars.
Equity accounted Joint Ventures
In 2013, the Group entered into a joint venture agreement with 
Avenue Capital. The Group’s share of the post-tax loss of this 
equity accounted joint venture was US$7.7 million (2013: US$4.1 
million). In accordance with accounting standards, given that 
this loss reduced the investment to nil during the year, further 
losses of the US joint venture will not affect the carrying value 
of the investment on the balance sheet.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share rose 13% to 16.1¢ (2013: 14.2¢). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share rose 16% to 19.2¢ (2013: 
16.6¢). The Board believes that adjusted basic earnings 
per share - excluding share benefit charges, movement in 
contingent consideration, impairment charges and share of 
joint venture loss - better reflects the underlying business and 
assists in providing a clearer view of Group performance.
Dividend
Given the strong cash generation during the year the Board of 
Directors declared an interim dividend of 3.5¢ per share that 
was paid on 1 October 2014. Taking into account the strong 
performance the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
4.5¢ per share (which together with the interim dividend equals 
8.0¢ per share in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy) 
and an additional one-off 7.0¢ per share, bringing the total for 
the year to 15.0¢ per share (2013: 14.0¢ per share).
Cash Flow
The Group’s outstanding performance and operating efficiency 
led to another record year, generating substantial free cash 
with net cash generated from operating activities of US$112 
million (2013: US$90 million). The net increase in cash and 
cash equivalents in 2014 was US$48 million (2013: US$34 
million), after cash dividend payments during the year of 
US$51 million (2013: US$33 million).
Balance Sheet
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong, with no debt and 
ample liquid resources. The Group’s cash position as at 31 
December 2014 was US$163 million (2013: US$116 million). 
Balances owed to customers were US$67 million (2013: US$55 
million).

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Regulation and General Regulatory Developments
Gambling has long been a highly regulated industry. As is often 
the case with technological advancements, online gambling 
was initially under-regulated, as legal systems struggled to 
comprehend and address this novel industry. However, recent 
years have seen many jurisdictions develop regulatory regimes 
specifically designed to address online gambling. Naturally, 
every such change has impacted online gambling businesses 
committed to operating compliantly, such as 888. 
No change has impacted 888 more profoundly than the 
shift of numerous jurisdictions, most notably in the European 
Union, to regulatory regimes based on place-of-consumption. 
Large and important markets in Europe have, in recent years, 
adopted regulatory regimes that require operators wishing to 
accept players from such markets to obtain a local licence 
and comply with local regulatory requirements. This change 
has radically impacted the manner in which online operators 
conduct their business by imposing business constraints and 
raising costs. Notwithstanding, the development of robust 
regulatory regimes has strengthened the industry by providing 
much needed legal certainty, by segregating compliant 
reliable operators from the “ “black market” of illicit operations, 
by protecting players and improving the public perception of 
online gambling, and by creating a partnership between the 
industry and its regulators. All these have generated and will 
continue to generate significant value for leading operators 
such as 888, who are deeply committed to operating in a 
compliant and lawful manner.
The UK’s move, in 2014, to a place-of-consumption based 
regulatory regime, had a dramatic impact on the Group, given 
the prominence of 888’s UK-facing operations. It is fair to 
assume that the full impact of these changes (for 888 and the 
industry) will only become evident over the coming months. 
The debate over regulation of internet gambling continued in 
the US in 2014. The emergence of the first inter-state gambling 
compact (between Nevada and Delaware, two states in which 
the Group is licenced), was coupled by the ongoing struggle 
on the federal level between those seeking to regulate internet 
gaming and those seeking to ban it entirely. 
The group continues to closely monitor regulatory 
developments worldwide and to assess their impact on 
888’s operations. We continue to support regulation of the 
industry and to work with our partners in the industry and 
with our regulators towards shaping a regulatory landscape 
that is business-friendly while safeguarding the objectives of 
regulation. 
The following paragraphs summarize the main relevant 
regulatory developments of 2014 and our expectations 
regarding changes that will impact the Group in 2015.
Europe
As noted, the most dramatic regulatory development of 2014 
came in the form of the UK’s shift to place-of-consumption 
based regulation. A change to the 2005 Gambling Act 
abolished the Group’s ability to service players in the UK 
under 888’s Gibraltar licence, and subjected the Group to 
local licencing and compliance requirements. The Group 
prepared for these changes well in advance, implementing the 
changes necessary to accommodate the applicable regulatory 
requirements, adjusting 888’s business model to account for the 
imposition of gaming duty and interacting with the Gambling 
Commission and with industry bodies to fully understand and 
prepare for the regulatory reform. In line with the requirements 
of the amended Gambling Act, a subsidiary of the Group, 888 
UK Limited, applied to the Gambling Commission for a remote 
operating licence and seamlessly transitioned into trading 
under a ‘‘continuation licence” when the new regime came into 
force on 1 November 2014. The Group is now in the process of 
obtaining a gambling software licence, which it will be required 
to hold as of 31 March 2015. 
The European Commission’s involvement in the regulation of 
online gaming was fairly low key in 2014. Following a flurry 
of activity by the Commission in 2013, 2014 saw only minor 
activity by the Commission, focusing mostly on peripheral 
aspects of online gaming. These included anti-money 
laundering, prevention of fraud and protection of vulnerable 
players. Also in 2014, the European Commission published non-
binding recommendations regarding consumer protection and 
advertising, both with regard to online gaming. However, these 
developments, while not unimportant, did little to advance 
the cause of regulatory harmonization within the European 
Union’s Internal Market. Notwithstanding, infringement cases 
brought by the Commission against several Member States 
late in 2013, did seem to encourage regulatory reform in some 
States, the impacts of which may be seen in 2015. The most 
notable example of EU action against a Member State was the 
announcement, in October 2014, regarding the Commission’s 
intention to sue Sweden for infringing EU law due to its non-
compliant gaming legislation (nevertheless, any change to 
Sweden’s regulatory regime is not likely to occur under the 
present government). 
Other than the UK, several European jurisdictions implemented 
regulatory reforms in 2014:
 | Spain, where the Group has held a licence since June 2012, 
introduced online slot machines and exchange betting in 
2014. We view this as a tremendous opportunity given the 
Group’s strong performance to date in this market. 
 | Hungary passed legislation late in 2014 repealing a previous 
law (which had never been implemented) providing for the 
licencing of online gaming. The practical impact of this 
change remains unclear, given that the repealed legislation 
had never been implemented.
 | Romania also passed legislation in the last days of 
2014, reforming a previous law (also never implemented) 
and introducing a more accommodating licencing and 
regulatory regime for online gambling. Secondary legislation

Regulation and General Regulatory Developments
necessary to commence the licencing process is expected 
in 2015, and the Group is exploring the viability of obtaining 
a licence under this new regime. 
The regulatory landscape in Germany continued to be mired 
by uncertainty in 2014. A ruling by the European Court of 
Justice did little to clarify the validity of the German Inter-
State Gambling Treaty and rulings by German courts on 
this matter were largely inconsistent (varying from state to 
state). The issuance of 20 federal sports-betting licences was 
suspended due to legal challenges attacking the preceding 
tender process, and such challenges are likely to continue 
well into 2015. It seems unlikely that 2015 will bring about a 
greater degree of clarity with regard to the German regulatory 
landscape. 
Similarly, little occurred during 2014 to alleviate the uncertainty 
surrounding the regulation of online gambling in Greece. 888 
continues to follow closely developments in this jurisdiction. 
Several European jurisdictions are expected to introduce 
regulatory reform in 2015: 
 | Ireland is expected to pass legislation reforming online 
betting in 2015, with a view to implementing such change 
late in 2015 or in early 2016. Legislative action intended to 
reform the regulatory landscape relating to online gaming 
has presently been postponed. 
 | The Netherlands is expected to reform its regulatory 
landscape, opening the market for licencing of commercial 
operators, during 2015. The Dutch Gaming Authority has 
already sought expressions of interest by operators seeking 
to be licenced in the Netherlands (should a licencing 
regime be introduced), and 888 continues to maintain a 
constructive dialogue with the Dutch authorities as it has in 
the past. The group continued to conduct its operations in 
the Netherlands in accordance with interim guidelines issued 
by the local authorities.
 | Both the Czech Republic and Portugal are expected to 
introduce legislation early in 2015 aimed at liberalising 
and regulating the online gaming and betting markets. 888 
hopes that such reform will contribute to the emergence 
of a vibrant and commercially viable market in these 
jurisdictions. 
The United States
Commercial internet gaming is now operational in three US 
states – Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. 888 remains the 
only online gaming operator presently authorized to conduct 
business in each of these jurisdictions and it continues to 
provide its technology and services to licenced online gaming 
operators in all three jurisdictions. Having launched operations 
in all three states in 2013, the last year saw the Group 
upgrading its offering and working closely with its partners and 
with its regulators to make internet gaming in these states more 
attractive and user-friendly. This is an effort that will surely 
continue during 2015. 888 is proud to have pioneered the online 
gaming market in the United States and intends to continue 
playing a leading role in any US jurisdiction that regulates the 
industry. 
During 2014 the states of Nevada and Delaware signed an 
agreement allowing for inter-state pooling of poker liquidity 
and for regulatory cooperation between the states. As the 
only provider of internet gaming technology operating in 
both jurisdictions, 888 has been working closely with the 
gaming regulators in both states to implement this important 
agreement. The group remains hopeful that similar agreements 
will follow with other US gaming jurisdictions. 
Also in 2014 888 received final approval of its internet poker 
platform from the Nevada Gaming Commission. Later in the 
year the Group received approval for the operation of an inter-
operator poker network, a first of its kind in the United States. 
Following a mid-term election in November 2014, the 
momentum towards regulatory reform throughout the US is 
likely to recommence in 2015. Several states are considering 
the introduction of an intra-state licencing regime (these 
include California, Pennsylvania, Washington, and possibly 
New York), though it remains uncertain whether such initiatives 
will gain sufficient traction in 2015. The group remains actively 
engaged in dialogue with stakeholders in these jurisdictions, 
with the knowledge that positive developments in these large-
scale markets could present tremendous opportunities for 888. 
Simultaneously, the opponents of internet gaming continue 
to exert significant pressure on federal and state lawmakers 
to ban internet gaming or abandon legislation intended to 
regulate the industry. The most vocal opponent of internet 
gaming, Las Vegas Sands’ Sheldon Adelson, has invested 
significant efforts in promoting legislation intended to amend 
the federal Wire Act and ban internet gaming throughout 
the United States. Political changes in the US Congress 
following the 2014 elections could reinvigorate these efforts. 
Though Congress has thus far withstood the pressure from 
internet gaming’s opponents to undo the positive regulatory 
renaissance of recent years, the Group continues to work 
closely with other prominent industry players and with 
stakeholders on the federal and state level to avert such 
developments. 
Further afield
2014 saw regulatory reform in jurisdictions around the world. 
For example, the Mexican legislature debated regulatory 
reform (though no legislative action was taken by year end) 
and Russia introduced stricter enforcement measures directed 
against unlicenced online gaming (though their impact on 
non-Russian operators remained dubious). 888, with the 
assistance of its legal advisers, continues to monitor regulatory 
developments the world over, and responds to these changes 
when and where they impact the Group’s business and 
operations.

Corporate Responsibility
Environmental impact
As an online business, 888’s activities have a relatively small 
impact on the environment. However, we remain committed to 
ensuring that wherever possible we minimise what little effect 
we have with the following areas being the key focus points:
 | Energy consumption: We continuously monitor our energy 
consumption to help us ensure we are being as energy 
efficient as possible.
 | Water: We use only ecological detergents in our offices and 
use water saving devices in most of our locations.
 | Travel: To minimise the impact of travel on the environment 
we encourage employees to either cycle to work and, in 
certain locations, provide buses for commuters. We also 
continue to invest in the state-of-the-art technology to help 
meetings occur remotely. 
888 commissioned a study in 2013 to provide quantitative 
information regarding its environmental impact and to assist it 
in finding ways to further reduce its environmental impact. The 
results of the study were published in the 2013 Annual Report. 
Whilst 888 is committed to complying with UK disclosure 
requirements and appropriately managing its greenhouse gas 
emissions, given the Group has low emissions, its environmental 
footprint has not changed materially since the study was 
carried out and in light of the costs involved in monitoring and 
measuring such emissions, the Board has concluded that a 
review will be carried out once every several years rather than 
annually. The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility 
for environmental issues and monitors the Company’s 
environmental performance in light of internal targets.

Although not legally required to do so, as the Company is 
incorporated in Gibraltar, we have reported on all the emissions 
sources stipulated under the UK Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
These emissions sources fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility for any emissions 
sources that are not included in our consolidated financial 
statements.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), data gathered from our 
own operations, and emissions factors from UK Government’s 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013, as well as an 
electricity emission factor for Antigua sourced from UNDP.
The reported emissions come from our offices, data centre 
and servers owned by us, but co-located at third party data 
centres. 
Our facilities in Gibraltar use chilled water provided by a 
third party for cooling and no emission factor for the chilled 
water was available. As a result, we estimated the associated 
emissions based on the volume of chilled water and an 
assumed coefficient of performance.
The account of our corporate GHG emissions was prepared by 
the Carbon Trust in the UK.

Corporate Responsibility
Employees
888’s success depends on the quality and commitment of its 
people. We take our responsibilities to our staff around the 
world very seriously and aim to provide an enjoyable work 
environment where employees are challenged and motivated 
to excel, where flair is rewarded, compensation is fair and the 
balance between work and family is respected. 
Some highlights from 2014 include the following:
 | It has been the second year of our “ “Excellence Club”, our 
employee development program which sent a group of 
employees selected by their divisions for excellence in a 
number of fields, to an exciting adventure trip in Sri Lanka. 
We hope to continue this program in years to come with 
trips to other exotic locations planned. In addition, 888 runs 
a number of management skills programs for both senior 
managers and team leaders from all divisions.  
 | During the year we had team building activities intended 
to create better connections among team members and 
managers, including a half fun day for each department, 
overnight event combining engagement activities and 
professional lectures, as well as holiday celebrations on all 
company sites.  
 | We have continued our annual evaluation process which is 
based on the principle that giving and getting feedback is 
key to each employee’s growth and development and that 
regularly evaluating on the job performance helps achieve 
success and is essential for the well-being of all employees.
 | We continued our efforts to extend our recruitment channels, 
including “ “refer a friend”, social networks and internet 
channels. 
 | We believe that employees should share part of the Group’s 
success. This year, due to our great achievements and 
business success, we granted various performance bonuses 
to some employees of the Group.
888 takes its employees’ health and safety seriously and has 
written policies in place with regard to occupational health and 
safety issues in its major offices. The Board will consider setting 
targets with regard to occupational health and safety issues 
in order to monitor performance. The Board acknowledges 
its overall responsibility for human resources issues, including 
for human resources and labour standards, implementing 
management structures and systems to monitor and evaluate 
employee performance and satisfaction, promoting diversity 
at all levels of the Company and within the Company’s supplier 
base, providing employees with the opportunity to have formal 
input into matters that affect them, oversee and allocate 
resources to employee training, and to monitor key health and 
safety performance goals and indicators. During 2014, there 
were no material labour disputes, litigation, or health and 
safety related fines or sanctions imposed on the Group.
Social, community and human rights issues
Our values
At 888 we are fully committed to maintaining a high standard 
of corporate and social responsibility. This ethos is part of 
our culture and permeates throughout our business into the 
everyday business decisions we make on a day-to-day basis. 
We also recognise that a responsible approach is not only 
the correct way to do business but one that enhances our 
credibility amongst all our stakeholders and thereby supports 
the development of the Group. The Board acknowledges its 
overall responsibility for social, community and human rights 
issues.
Responsible gaming
Our values place the community and the customer at the 
centre of all our endeavours. We aim to provide responsible 
adults with the best online gaming entertainment experience. 
However, we acknowledge that gaming poses a potential 
danger to a small minority of people. We are constantly 
revising our innovative procedures to ensure minors are unable 
to access our gaming sites. We also continuously train all 
our staff in how to provide a safe gaming experience to our 
customers. Our training programme incorporates methods 
and techniques to help our employees recognise and take 
appropriate actions if they identify compulsive or underage 
activity. We continue to innovate in this area including the 
development of our proprietary sophisticated Observer System 
to help identify and prevent compulsive activity. 
Protecting customers
 | As a responsible, regulated gaming group we comply with 
both the GamCare and the eCOGRA guidelines. GamCare 
is the leading authority on the provision of counselling, 
advice and practical help in addressing the social impact of 
gambling in the UK. eCOGRA ensures that approved online 
casinos are properly and transparently monitored to provide 
player protection.
 | Our site has links to professional help agencies and we 
have placed many safeguards for those who need help with 
controlling their gaming.
 | E-Break & Support programme: Run in collaboration with 
specialist well-known charity Gambling Therapy to offer 888 
customers a free of charge four-week gambling therapy 
programme. 
 | Self-assessment test: For players who are worried about 
their gaming habits and want to know more about the signs 
of compulsive gambling.
 | Controlling deposit limits: Should clients feel the need 
to, they can control their play pattern by self limiting the 
amounts they deposit per day, per week or per month.
 | Self exclusion: A player can request to be self excluded for a 
chosen period, due to different concerns. Based on internal 
studies we decided to increase time periods available for 
clients to “ “cool off”. Customers can choose from six different 
exclusion periods from one day to six months. During this 
period, 888 blocks the account and no promotional emails 
are sent to the customer.

Protecting minors
Underage activity on our sites is strictly prohibited and 888 
takes the matter of underage gaming extremely seriously. 
Our offering is not designed to attract minors. We make every 
effort to prevent minors from playing on our sites and use 
sophisticated verification systems as well as a third party 
verification supplier to identify and track minors if they log into 
our software. The verification process today consists of two 
verification systems, both 192.com and URU.
We train our staff to be highly sensitive to the possibility of 
underage activity and make sure we suspend any account 
suspected to be an underage account.
888responsible
Since 2007 a dedicated website, www.888responsible.com, has 
been available, providing information regarding all aspects 
of responsible gaming. The site is available in English, French, 
Spanish and German.
Community
888 is committed to supporting both the various local 
communities in which it operates and also the broader 
global community. Our community investment programme 
includes charitable donations and long-standing community 
involvement in our key areas across the world. In 2014, 888 
supported the International Medical Corps in their efforts to 
assist people affected by Typhoon Haiyan which struck the 
Philippines in November 2013. 
Human rights
888 ensures that its policies comply with local law, in addition 
to reflecting the Group’s values. These policies set clear 
standards of behaviour to which all Group personnel are 
expected to adhere, including as regards social, ethical and 
environmental matters. In this respect, 888 is guided by the 
ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, 
which encourages companies to make human rights, labour 
standards, environmental responsibility and anti-corruption 
part of their business agenda.
Corporate Responsibility
Diversity
Diversity is important to us as we believe that only through access to the most diverse pool of talent will we recruit and retain the 
most talented individuals to serve our customers. We actively seek to recruit and advance women into our top management. A 
summary of the breakdown of men and women across the Group as of 31 December 2014, is as follows:
Men Women
Number Percentage Number Percentage
Board of Directors 6 100% 0 0%
Senior Vice Presidents 6 75% 2 25%
Vice Presidents 14 64% 8 36%
All Employees 719 55% 587 45%
The Board acknowledges that the lack of women on the Board is a major challenge for the Company, and that it is the Board’s 
responsibility to address this. In 2014, the Nominations Committee again included in the mandate of Odgers Berndtson, 
the executive search firm retained to recruit new Non-executive Directors to the Board, a specific request to include female 
candidates amongst the list of candidates presented for its consideration.

Corporate Responsibility Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group operates in a dynamic business environment. In 
addition to the day-to-day commercial risks faced by most 
enterprises such as fraud and theft, the online gaming industry 
faces particular challenges in respect of regulatory risk, 
reputational risk, information technology risk and taxation risk, 
each of which is detailed below. The Group considers that the 
nature of its principal risks has not undergone any significant 
change during 2014.
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic and 
complex. Change in the regulatory regime in a specific 
jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on business 
volume and financial performance in that jurisdiction. In 
addition, a number of jurisdictions have regulated online 
gaming, and in several of those jurisdictions the Group 
holds licences. However, in some cases, lack of clarity in 
the regulations, or conflicting legislative and regulatory 
developments, mean that the Group may risk failing to obtain 
an appropriate licence, having existing licences adversely 
affected, or being subject to other regulatory sanctions. 
Furthermore, legal and other action may be taken by 
incumbent gaming providers in jurisdictions which are seeking 
to regulate online gaming, in an attempt to frustrate the grant 
of online gaming licences to the Group. A detailed regulatory 
review is set out in the Regulation section above. 
The Group manages its regulatory risk by routinely consulting 
with legal advisers in the jurisdictions where its services are 
offered or are accessible, where necessary obtaining formal 
legal opinions from local counsel. Furthermore, the Group 
obtains frequent and routine updates regarding changes in the 
law that may be applicable to its operations, working with local 
counsel to assess the impact of any changes on its operations. 
The Group constantly adapts and moderates its services to 
comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Finally, the 
Group blocks players from certain “ “blocked jurisdictions” using 
multiple technological methods as appropriate.
Reputational risk
Underage and problem gaming are inherent risks associated 
with the online gaming industry. The Group devotes 
considerable resources to putting in place prevention measures 
coupled with strict internal procedures designed to prevent 
underage players from accessing its real money sites. In 
addition, the Group promotes a safe and responsible gaming 
environment to its customers supplemented by its corporate 
culture. The Group has a dedicated Director of Responsible 
Gaming tasked with the responsibility of implementing such 
policies. Further details about the Group’s responsible gaming 
initiatives are set out in the Social, Community and Human 
Rights Issue section above. 
Information Technology risks
As a leading online business, the Group’s IT systems are critical 
to its operation. The Group is reliant on the performance of 
these systems.
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s technology operations and designed 
to protect its networks from malicious attacks and other 
such risks. These measures include traffic filtering, anti-
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) devices and Anti-Virus 
protection from leading vendors. Physical and logical network 
segmentation is also used to isolate and protect the Group’s 
networks and restrict malicious activities. The IT environment 
is audited by independent auditors, such as PCI DSS security 
audit and eCOGRA audit. These audits form part of the Group’s 
approach to ensuring proper IT procedures and a high level of 
security. In order to ensure systems are protected properly and 
effectively, external security scans and assessments are carried 
out in a timely manner. The Group has a disaster recovery site 
to ensure full recovery in the event of disaster. All critical data 
is replicated to the disaster recovery site and stored off-site on 
a daily basis. In the event of loss of functionality of the Group’s 
critical services, the business can be fully recovered through 
the resources available at the disaster recovery site.
In order to minimise dependence on telecommunication 
service providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its service providers. 
The Group has two Internet service providers in Gibraltar in 
order to minimise reliance on one provider.
As a part of its monitoring system, the Group deploys set user 
experience tests which measure performance from different 
locations around the world. Network-related performance 
issues are addressed by rerouting traffic using different routes 
or providers. 888 operates a 24/7 Network Operations Centre 
(NOC). The NOC’s role is to conduct real time monitoring of 
production activities using state-of-the-art systems. These 
systems are designed to identify and provide alerts regarding 
problems related to systems, key business indicators and issues 
surrounding customer usability experience.
The IT environment tracks changes, incidents and SLA KPIs in 
order to ensure that client experience is consistent and well 
managed. As part of these procedures, capacity planning 
takes place and infrastructure is built accordingly. System-wide 
availability and business-level availability is measured and 
logged in the IT information systems.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within 
the Group is a tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it is 
incorporated and has no taxable presence in any other 
jurisdiction. In addition, certain jurisdictions impose tax by 
reference to customers’ activity, regardless of whether the 
Group has a taxable presence in such jurisdiction. In this 
respect, the Group pays VAT in certain EU countries in which 
certain of the Group’s online gaming offerings are considered 
electronically supplied services subject to VAT. Furthermore, 
jurisdictions in which online gaming is regulated impose gaming 
duties on licenced operators. As of December 2014, the United 
Kingdom has imposed gaming tax on a point of consumption 
basis, which on the one hand has lowered margins, but 
on the other, it is expected to continue the trend toward 
consolidation in that market. Furthermore, draft legislation 
has been published in the United Kingdom, intended to come 
into force on 1 April 2015, giving rise to a Diverted Profits Tax 
which imposes tax at a rate of 25% on profits which would 
be attributable to a permanent establishment in the United 
Kingdom were such a permanent establishment to exist, in 
circumstances where profits are deemed “ “diverted” from 
the UK under the terms of such draft legislation; the Group 
is considering its position in this respect. The Group actively 
monitors taxation risk in the relevant jurisdictions and takes 
such steps as it considers necessary to minimise such risks. 
Financial risks and financial instruments
The Group considers its exposure to financial risks, including 
country risk and exposure to trading counterparties, to be low. 
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Company are set out in the notes to the financial statements 
on page 83. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange 
fluctuations and is mitigating that risk by adopting policies to 
hedge its cost base currency exposure as described in note 
24 to the financial statements. During 2014, the Group hedged 
its foreign currency risks solely with leading banks including 
Barclays plc.
The Company is not materially exposed to price risk, credit risk 
or liquidity risk. Given that end-users are required to fund their 
online gaming wallet prior to carrying out any gaming activity, 
operational cash flow is not a material risk for the Company. 
In addition, the Group manages its cash in a prudent manner 
and maintains sufficient liquid resources to meet its anticipated 
liabilities as and when they come due.
Partnership risks
In line with its strategy, the Group has consolidated its position 
in the B2B market to be focused on fewer, larger B2B contracts. 
However, this strategy also gives rise to commercial risks in that 
the Group is more exposed to non-renewal or termination of 
existing contracts.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report
The Directors submit to the members their Annual Report 
and Accounts of the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2014. The Strategic Report, Corporate Governance Statement 
and Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 4, 26 and 33 
respectively, form part of this Directors’ Report.
Results 
The Group’s profit after tax for the financial year of US$57 
million is reported in the consolidated income statement on 
page 54. The Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.5¢ 
per share (which together with the interim dividend equals 8.0¢ 
per share in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy) and 
an additional one-off 7.0¢ per share, bringing the total for the 
year to 15.0¢ per share (2013: 14.0¢ per share). 
Directors and their interests
Biographical details of the current Board of Directors are 
shown on page 21. The Directors who served during the year 
are shown below. All Directors retire at each Annual General 
Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election on 
an annual basis.
Richard Kilsby (first appointed 30 August 2005). Mr Kilsby will 
not offer himself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
due to his retirement.
Brian Mattingley (first appointed 30 August 2005).
Aviad Kobrine (first appointed 30 August 2005).
Ron McMillan (first appointed 15 May 2014).
John Anderson (first appointed 30 August 2005). Mr Anderson 
will step down as a Non-executive Director as from the end of 
the 2015 Annual General Meeting and will therefore not offer 
himself for re-election.
Amos Pickel (first appointed 14 March 2006). 
The beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Directors 
in shares of the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 33. There has been no change in 
the interests of Directors in shares of the Company between 31 
December 2014 and the date of this Report.
Except as noted above, none of the Directors had any interests 
in the shares of the Company or in any material contract or 
arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Share capital
Changes in the Company’s share capital during the financial 
year are given in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity. As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 354,436,608 ordinary shares of GBP £0.005 
each. At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2014, the 
Board was empowered to allot equity securities of the Company 
for cash without application of pre-emptive rights under the 
Company’s Articles, provided that such power is limited: (a) to 
the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights 
issue in favour of ordinary shareholders where the equity 
securities respectively attributable to the interests of all ordinary 
shareholders are proportionate (as nearly as may be) to the 
respective numbers of ordinary shares held by them; and (b) to 
the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) 
above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of 
£88,022.51 (5% of the Company’s ordinary share capital in issue 
as at 31 March 2014). This authority expires at the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. In 2014, 
the Company did not exercise any of the foregoing powers and 
authorities. In 2014, the Company did not seek authority to and 
did not, in fact, purchase any of its own shares.
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association of the Company can only be 
amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of 
shareholders.
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares
The rights and obligations attaching to ordinary shares are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Holders of ordinary 
shares are entitled to attend and speak at general meetings of 
the Company, to appoint one or more proxies and to exercise 
voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may receive a dividend 
and on liquidation may share in the assets of the Company. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual Report. Subject to meeting certain thresholds, holders 
of ordinary shares may requisition a general meeting of the 
Company or the proposal of resolutions at general meetings.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Electronic and paper proxy appointment and voting 
instructions must be received by the Company’s Registrars not 
later than 48 hours before a general meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations on holdings
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the 
holding of ordinary shares other than under restrictions 
imposed by law or regulation (for example, insider trading 
laws) or pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code. 
Requirements of gaming regulations
Amongst others, the Company:
(i) holds a licence from the Nevada Gaming Commission as 
the sole shareholder of an Interactive Gaming Service 
Provider licencee, and as such is subject to the Nevada 
Gaming Control Act and to the licencing and regulatory 
control of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the 
Nevada Gaming Commission;
(ii) holds a transactional waiver from the New Jersey Division 
of Gaming Enforcement permitting it to be the sole 
shareholder of a Casino Service Industry Enterprise licence 
applicant (presently holder of a transactional waiver 
allowing it to conduct online gaming related business in 
New Jersey), and as such is subject to the New Jersey 
Casino Control Act and to the licencing and regulatory 
control of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement; 
and
(iii) is an applicant for a licence from the Delaware Department 
of Finance, State Lottery Office, as the sole shareholder 
of a Gaming Technology Provider licence applicant, and 
as such is subject to Title 29 of the Delaware Code and 
to the licencing and regulatory control of the Delaware 
Department of Finance, State Lottery Office.

Governance
The Company and its ordinary shareholders may also in the 
future be subject to similar restrictions in other jurisdictions 
where it secures a gaming licence.
The criteria used by relevant regulatory authorities to make 
determinations as to suitability of an applicant for licencure 
varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require 
the submission of detailed personal and financial information 
followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities have 
very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant 
(corporate or individual) qualifies for licencing or should be 
found suitable. 
Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial 
ownership of more than a certain percentage (typically 
five percent) of the Company’s securities, to report the 
acquisition to the gaming authorities and apply for a finding 
of suitability. Many gaming authorities allow an “institutional 
investor” to apply for a waiver that allows such institutional 
investor to acquire up to a certain percentage of securities 
without applying for a finding of suitability, subject to the 
fulfillment of certain conditions. In some jurisdictions, suitability 
investigations may require extensive personal and financial 
disclosure. The failure of any such individuals or entities to 
submit to such background checks and provide the required 
disclosure could jeopardize the Company’s eligibility for a 
required licence or approval. 
Any person who is found unsuitable by a relevant gaming 
authority may be prohibited by applicable gaming laws or 
regulations from holding, directly or indirectly, the beneficial 
ownership of any of the Company’s securities.
For this reason, at the Company’s 2014 Annual General 
Meeting, the Company amended its Articles of Association 
to bring them in line with the current market standard in the 
gaming industry and to ensure that the Company has the 
required powers to continue to comply with applicable gaming 
regulations. 
These provisions include providing the Company, in the event 
of a Shareholder Regulatory Event (as defined in the Articles), 
with the right to:
(a) suspend certain rights of its members who do not comply 
with the provisions of the gaming regulations (the “ “Affected 
Members”);
(b) require such Affected Members to dispose of their ordinary 
shares; and
(c) subject to (b) above, dispose of the ordinary shares of such 
Affected Members.
The Company considers that these rights are required in 
order to mitigate the risk that an interest in ordinary shares 
held by a particular person could lead to action being taken 
by a relevant Regulatory Authority which in turn could lead 
to the withdrawal of existing licences held by the Company 
or the exclusion of being awarded further licences in other 
jurisdictions that the Company seeks to pursue. This potential 
Regulatory Authority action could therefore cause substantial 
damage to the Group’s business or prospects. 
Entities holding company shares on behalf of group 
employees
At 31 December 2014, Virtual Share Services Limited held 
3,124,612 ordinary shares, and the 888 Holdings plc Share Plan 
Trust held 46,432 ordinary shares in the Company, all on behalf 
of various group personnel who have received equity grants 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan. Full details are set out 
on page 38. 
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2014 the Company had been notified of the 
following interests in 5% or more of its share capital under DTR 
Rule 5 of the UK Listing Authority:
Principal Shareholders
Number of 
shares
% issued 
share 
capital
E Shaked Shares Trust 86,283,534 24.34%
O Shaked Shares Trust 86,283,534 24.34%
Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust 37,122,358 10.47%
No notifications pursuant to DTR Rule 5 have been received by 
the Company between 31 December 2014 and the date of this 
Annual Report. 
Shareholder agreements and consent requirements 
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights 
are held by a person other than the holder of the shares. 
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship between 
the above Principal Shareholder Trusts and the Company was 
entered into in connection with the Company’s flotation. The 
Relationship Agreement provides that all transactions between 
the Group and the Principal Shareholder Trusts will be on a 
normal business basis, that the Group will be allowed to carry 
on business independently of them and that the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts will not cause the Company to contravene 
the UK Corporate Governance Code unless required by law 
or as contemplated in the Relationship Agreement. It further 
provides that each of the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not 
solicit Group employees without consent, that only Independent 
Directors can vote on proposals to amend the Relationship 
Agreement, that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult 
the Group prior to disposing of a significant number of shares 
in order to maintain an orderly market and shall not disclose 
confidential information unless required to do so by law or 
relevant regulation or having first received the Company’s 
consent. The Relationship Agreement also includes restrictions 
on the Principal Shareholder Trusts’ power to appoint Directors 
and includes obligations on the trusts to ensure that the 
majority of the Board, excluding the Chairman, is independent. 
The Principal Shareholder Trusts can nominate a Non-executive 
Director for appointment to the Board. In the event that this 
right is exercised and it results in fewer than half the Board 
(excluding the Chairman of the Board) being Independent 
Directors, such appointment shall only become effective upon 
the appointment to the Board of an additional Independent 
Director acceptable to the Nominations Committee. Such 
restrictions and obligations apply in respect of the E Shaked 
Shares Trust and O Shaked Shares Trust whilst they collectively 
hold not less than 7.5% of the issued share capital of 888, 
888 Holdings AR2014 PROOF 8.indd   23 30/03/2015   11:58:13 23968.04    30 March 2015 11:56 AM     Proof 8

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
and in respect of the Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust whilst it 
individually holds not less than 7.5% of the issued share capital 
of 888. The obligations of the parties to the Relationship 
Agreement are at all times subject to all relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and obligations of the parties thereto 
in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar or elsewhere.
During 2014, the Company acted independently of its Principal 
Shareholder Trusts; specifically, the Company did not enter 
into any transactions or arrangements with the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts or any of their associates, neither the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts nor any of their associates took 
any action which prevented the Company from complying 
with its obligations under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, neither the Principal Shareholder Trusts nor any 
of their associates proposed or procured the proposal of 
any shareholder resolution which circumvented the proper 
application of the aforesaid Listing Rules, and there were no 
instances in which an independent Director of the Company 
did not support the Board’s statements regarding compliance 
with the aforementioned independence criteria.
Change of control 
A change of control in the Group may, in the event of failure to 
fulfill any applicable consent requirement, give rise to certain 
revocation or termination rights under the Group’s gaming 
licences or certain contracts to which the Group is a party.
Political donations
The Company did not make any political donations during the 
year. 
Financial instruments
Details relating to financial instruments are set out in the Risk 
Report on page 20.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company 
to indemnify its Directors in certain circumstances, as well 
as to provide insurance for the benefit of its Directors. The 
Company has undertaken to indemnify its Non-executive 
Directors: (a) in defending any proceedings, whether civil or 
criminal, in which judgment is given in favour of such Non-
executive Director or in which such Non-executive Director 
is acquitted; or (b) in connection with any application under 
Section 378 of the Gibraltar Companies Act (pursuant to which 
the court may provide relief to such Non-executive Director 
in any proceedings for negligence, default, breach of duty or 
breach of trust on grounds that such Non-executive Director 
has acted honestly and reasonably, and that, having regard to 
all circumstances of the case, including those connected with 
his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused from liability 
on such terms as the court thinks fit). The Company also 
undertook in favour of Aviad Kobrine to indemnify him to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Company’s 
Articles of Association in connection with the execution of his 
duties and/or exercise of his powers, authorities and discretions 
pursuant to his employment agreement. In addition, certain 
special indemnities were provided to the Executive Directors 
in connection with the compliance and licencing procedures 
relating to the Company’s business in the United States, details 
of which were provided in the Company’s 2011 Annual Report.
Corporate governance
The corporate governance statement is on pages 26 to 29 and 
is incorporated in this Directors’ Report by reference. 
Principal subsidiary undertakings
The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed on page 79.
Research & Development activities
In 2014, the Group maintained its focus on delivery of its 
offerings to regulated markets, expansion of its mobile platform 
strategy and expansion of the capabilities of its gaming 
platform and offerings.
Some relevant achievements during the year in the field of 
research & development, which are detailed in the Strategic 
Review on page 6, included:
 | Launch of 888sport.es in 2014, offering comprehensive 
pre-match and live betting on PC and mobile, and allowing 
888 to offer seamless navigation between Sport, Poker and 
Casino offerings in Spain. 
 | Launch of shared liquidity in New Jersey between AAPN 
and Caesars player-bases; and launch in Nevada of Poker 
offering via mobile platform and addition of payment 
methods.
 | Ensuring that UK-facing Casino, Poker, Sport and Bingo 
offerings are compliant with UK regulatory requirements, 
and certification of games. 
 | Addition of mobile games, content and marketing tools.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions are set out 
in the Corporate Responsibility section of the Business Review 
on page 16.
Auditors
With effect from 30 June 2014, BDO LLP and BDO Limited 
Chartered Accountants were replaced by EY as the statutory 
auditor of the Company. EY was appointed auditor for the 
purposes of the Company preparing financial statements 
as required pursuant to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority and as statutory auditor for the purposes of issuing 
an audit report pursuant to Section 10 of the Gibraltar 
Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 to be filed with the Gibraltar 
Companies Registry.
BDO LLP and BDO Limited Chartered Accountants provided 
audit services to the Company for 10 years. The Board’s 
decision to replace 888’s auditor was taken in light of the 
changing regulatory environment, and is in line with emerging 
practice and institutional investor guidelines in respect of audit 
tenure. The Board considers EY best positioned to provide audit 
services to the Company through a period of significant growth 
and expansion into regulated markets, especially the United 
States.
There are no matters in connection with BDO’s resignation as 
auditor which, in the view of the Board, need to be brought to 
the attention of shareholders.

Governance
A resolution regarding the appointment of EY as auditor of the 
Company will be proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
During 2014, EY charged the Company US$0.4 million in audit 
fees and US$0.1 million in non-audit fees, and during 2013, BDO 
charged the Company US$0.4 million in audit fees and US$0.1 
million in non-audit fees.
Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group 
and Company’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s “ “Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In 
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. A fair presentation 
also requires the Directors to: 
 | consistently select and apply appropriate accounting 
policies; 
 | present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
 | provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable members to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding 
the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ report which complies with the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the 
Gibraltar Companies Act.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website 
in accordance with legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The 
maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also 
extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to 
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have 
also chosen to prepare financial statements for the Company 
in accordance with IFRSs.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge: 
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
(b) the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
All of the current directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of 
any information needed by the company’s auditors for the 
purposes of their audit, and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. The directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Corporate Governance Statement
888 Holdings plc is admitted to the UK Official List and its shares 
are traded on the London Stock Exchange under a Premium 
Listing. As such, despite being incorporated in Gibraltar, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as published in 2012 (the ‘‘Code”) 
applies to the Company and is available at www.frc.org.uk. A 
new edition of the Code was published in September 2014 and 
will apply to the Company from 2015.
Statement of compliance
The Board remains committed to the principles of corporate 
governance in the Code which it considers to be central to the 
effective management of the business and to maintaining the 
confidence of investors. This report explains how the Company 
has applied the main principles of the Code. 
During 2014, the Company materially complied with the Code, 
other than as regards the following:
 | The Company did not have a Senior Independent Director 
serving on the Board of Directors during 2014. The functions 
of a Senior Independent Director were fulfilled during 2014 by 
the Chairman and Non-executive Directors.
 | Board evaluations have been conducted internally over 
the past three years by facilitation of the Chairman in 
coordination with the Company’s legal adviser, Herzog Fox & 
Neeman, who may not be considered an external facilitator. 
Board composition
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should be 
both led and controlled by an effective Board.
From 15 May 2014, with the appointment of Ron McMillan to 
the Board, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee, the Board consisted 
of six Directors (prior thereto, five Directors), as follows: 
three independent Non-executive Directors, a Non-executive 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors, being the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
At present, there is no Senior Independent Director on the Board. 
During 2014, executive search firm Odgers Berndtson continued 
on behalf of the Board to search for new Non-executive 
Directors. A process of identification of potential candidates 
and interviewing took place. It is noted that Odgers Berndtson 
is independent of the Company and has no other connections 
with the Company. The role of the Senior Independent Director 
is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman, to evaluate 
the Chairman’s performance and lead the Board’s succession 
planning, and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors 
where necessary. During 2014, the Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors fulfilled the functions of a Senior Independent Director.
The biographical details of all of the Directors are given on 
page 21. The service contracts of the present Non-executive 
Directors were renewed for an additional three year period on 1 
March 2014. In doing so, the Company rigorously reviewed the 
performance of its Non-executive Directors, taking into account 
the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. A service 
contract with Ron McMillan was signed on 14 May 2014, with 
effect as of 15 May 2014. Mr. McMillan was appointed to the 
Board, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a member 
of the Remuneration Committee, following a lengthy and rigorous 
recruitment process.
Board strategic approach
The Board focuses upon the Group’s long term objectives, 
strategic and policy issues and formally and transparently 
considers the management of key risks facing the Group, as 
well as determining the nature and extent of significant risks it 
will take in achieving its strategic objectives, maintaining sound 
risk management and internal control systems and reviewing 
annually the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems. The Board is responsible for 
acquisitions and divestments, major capital expenditure projects 
and considering Group budgets and dividend policy. The Board 
also determines key appointments. The Board receives regular 
updates on shareholders’ views. The Board has an established 
calendar of business. This covers the financial calendar, strategic 
planning, annual budgets and performance self-assessments, as 
well as the conduct of standing business. The calendar forms the 
basis for effective integration of business activities as between 
the Board and its principal Committees (see pages 29 and 
30), which individually consider their own operating frameworks 
against the Board’s business programme. The Board plans to 
meet six times a year. During 2014, the Board met seven times.

Governance
Ron McMillan was appointed to the Board, as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee and as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, with effect as of May 15, 2014, and attended all Board 
and relevant Committee meetings subsequent to that date.
The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas for 
Board meetings are set in advance. Board papers are issued to 
Directors sufficiently in advance of meetings to facilitate both 
informed debate and timely decisions.
Non-executive review and performance appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year (one 
such meeting was held during 2014) with the Non-executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors being present, and the 
Non-executive Directors meet once per year (one such meeting 
was held during 2014) without the Chairman present in order 
to appraise the performance of the Chairman and take into 
account the views of the Executive Directors. It is part of the 
role of the Senior Independent Director to lead this process. 
Presently, the Board is in the process of appointing a new Senior 
Independent Director; during 2014, the Chairman and Non-
executive Directors fulfilled the functions of a Senior Independent 
Director. The Directors have wide-ranging business experience, 
and no individual, or group of individuals, dominates the Board’s 
decision making.
The Board considers that Ron McMillan, John Anderson and 
Amos Pickel satisfy the independence criteria of the Code 
in 2014. The Board is satisfied that, upon his appointment as 
Chairman, Richard Kilsby met the independence criteria of 
the Code. The other significant commitments of the Chairman 
during 2014 are detailed in his biography on page 21. The Board 
considers that Mr Kilsby’s other commitments do not interfere 
with the discharge of his responsibilities to the Group and is 
satisfied that he makes sufficient time available to serve the 
Company effectively. As of the end of the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting, Mr. Kilsby will step down as Chairman of the Board, 
Brian Mattingley will be appointed as Executive Chairman, and 
John Anderson will step down as Non-executive Director. The 
Board will continue its efforts in 2015 to recruit suitable and 
experienced independent Non-executive Directors.
The Board has established a formal process for the annual 
evaluation of its performance, its committees and individual 
Directors. The evaluation process covers a range of issues 
such as Board processes, Board roles and responsibilities, 
Board agendas and committee processes. The internal Board 
evaluation relating to performance in 2014 was carried out 
in March 2015, and included evaluation of the performance 
of the Board as a whole as well as evaluation of individual 
Directors and the Chairman against criteria and minimum 
requirements set by the Board. Pursuant to the evaluation, the 
Board was satisfied that the Non-executive Directors continue 
to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to their role. 
The Chairman in coordination with the Company’s legal adviser 
facilitated the evaluation process. A detailed questionnaire was 
used covering various aspects of the Board’s functions, and 
particular focus was given to the overall quality of decision-
making and performance of the Chairman. Following analysis 
of the questionnaire responses, a detailed discussion was 
held by the Board of the results and the Company’s legal 
adviser provided external feedback. The key action item from 
the evaluation was the Board’s request to receive periodic 
information from the Executives between scheduled Board 
meetings concerning the performance of the business, together 
with certain revisions to the materials routinely distributed to 
Board members..
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been adopted 
and its content is reviewed to align it with operational needs 
and the Board’s preference to monitor and, where appropriate, 
approve matters of substance to the Group as a whole. 
Senior executives have given written undertakings to ensure 
compliance within their business operations with the Board’s 
formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision or 
approval.
Division of responsibilities
Board-level responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly and 
formally defined, with the Chairman being responsible for the 
effective operation of the Board as a whole, leadership of the 
Board in achieving a culture of constructive challenge by Non-
executives, regularly agreeing and reviewing each Director’s 
training and development needs, and supporting key external 
relationships; the CEO has the overall executive responsibility 
for the running of the Company’s business; and the Non-
executive Directors are responsible to constructively challenge 
and help develop proposals on strategy; no one individual has 
unfettered powers of decision in the Company.
Conflicts of interest
Conflicts of interest of the Directors are dealt with in 
accordance with the procedures set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association and are monitored by the Chairman. 
Such procedures operated effectively during the year.
Succession planning
The Board considers succession planning matters on an 
ongoing basis, with particular focus on succession planning for 
the CEO role as well as for senior management. At Board level, 
the Board has prioritized the recruitment of experienced Non-
executive Directors. During 2014, Ron McMillan was appointed 
to the Board, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee.
Other matters
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed. Directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense provided that 
they have first notified their intention to do so. 
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole. Under the direction of the 
Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities include 
ensuring information flows within and between the Board, its 
Committees and senior management, as well as facilitating 
induction, evaluation and professional development activities, 
and advising the Board on corporate governance, legal and 
procedural matters. 
The Board accepts that there should be a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the induction of new Directors, which has 
been formulated with the guidance of the Nominations Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors of 
other companies enables Directors of 888 to broaden their 
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company. 
Executive Directors may be allowed to accept non-executive 
appointments with the Board’s prior permission, so long as 
these are not likely to lead to any conflict of interest. Executive 
Directors may be required to account for fees received from 
such other companies.

The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of 
legal actions against its Directors. To the extent permitted 
by Gibraltar law, the Company also indemnifies the Directors. 
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where a 
Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election and appointment of Directors
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders on an 
annual basis in accordance with the provisions of the Code.
The Board may appoint any person to be a Director of the 
company and such Director shall hold office only until the next 
AGM, when he or she shall be eligible for reappointment by the 
shareholders. 
Audit Committee
Details of the Audit Committee’s functions, together with its 
specific activities in 2014, are set out in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 30.
Nominations Committee
During the year, the Nominations Committee comprised two 
independent Non-executive Directors: Amos Pickel (Chair) and 
John Anderson. 
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. The 
Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, from time 
to time, the structure of the Board, determining succession plans 
for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and identifying 
and recommending suitable candidates for appointment as 
Directors. The Nominations Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
As regards Board nominations considered by the Nominations 
Committee, during 2014, the Board appointed Ron McMillan as 
a Non-executive Director, as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Mr. McMillan’s 
appointment was carried out with the assistance of Odgers 
Berndtson, the executive search firm retained to recruit new Non-
executive Directors to the Board. The Nominations Committee 
and the Board will continue its efforts in 2015 to recruit suitable 
and experienced independent Non-executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee is also responsible for implementing 
the Board’s policy on diversity within the scope of its mandate, 
including setting measurable objectives and monitoring 
progress on achieving such objectives. In considering new 
Board appointments, diversity (including gender diversity) is 
one of the criteria considered by the Nominations Committee. 
The Company’s statement regarding diversity is set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility section of the Business Review on page 
16.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
comprised three Independent Non-executive Directors: Amos 
Pickel (Chair), Ron McMillan and John Anderson. 
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. It is 
required to take account of any recommendation made by 
the Remuneration Committee in determining the remuneration, 
benefits and employment packages of the Executive Directors 
and senior management and the fees of the Chairman.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which outlines the 
Remuneration Committee’s work and details of Directors’ 
remuneration, is on pages 33 to 49. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Gaming Compliance Committee
In accordance with Nevada Gaming Control Board requirements, 
the Board has appointed a Gaming Compliance Committee. 
Its members are Michael Alonso (an external consultant to the 
Company), John Anderson and Amos Pickel. 
The Gaming Compliance Committee is entrusted with making 
sure that the 888 Group’s licenced gaming activity is carried out 
with honesty and integrity, in accordance with high moral, legal 
and ethical standards, and free from criminal and corruptive 
elements. As such, the committee is responsible and has the 
power to identify and evaluate situations arising in the course 
of the Company’s and its Affiliates’ business that may adversely 
affect the objectives of gaming control.  
The Committee is not intended to displace the Board or the 
Company’s executive officers with decision-making authority but 
is intended to serve as an advisory body to better ensure that 
the Company’s goals of avoiding unsuitable situations and in 
entering into relationships exclusively with suitable persons. 
The Committee’s work is being done independently and 
impartially. To this end, its members are appointed by and 
report directly to the Board of Directors.
Risk management and internal control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on 
internal control and risk management, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control and risk management. It is 
management’s role to implement Board policies on risk and 
control, including reporting. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee 
to review the appropriateness and adequacy of systems 
of internal control and risk management in relation to the 
financial reporting process on an ongoing basis and to make 
recommendations to the Board. During 2014, Deloitte carried 
out the Company’s internal audit function, reporting to the 
Audit Committee; during 2014, the internal auditor provided five 
reports to the Audit Committee and discussed the internal audit 
working plan for 2015.
888’s payment risk management team, based in Gibraltar, 
has developed stringent payment risk management and fraud 
control procedures. The team makes use of external and internal 
systems to manage the payment risks. Detailed procedures 
exist throughout the Company’s operations and compliance is 
monitored by operational management and the internal audit 
function.
The Directors annually review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management, including 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Company. The review considers individual risk control 
responsibilities, reporting lines and qualitative assessments 
of residual risks. Such a review was carried out in 2014 and 
the process was in place throughout 2014 and to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board believes 
that its risk management process accords with the Internal 
Corporate Governance Statement

Relations with shareholders and key financial audiences
The Company maintains an active and regular dialogue with 
principal and institutional shareholders and sell-side analysts 
through a planned programme of investor relations and financial 
PR activity. The outcome of these meetings is reported to the 
Board. The programme includes formal presentations of full 
year and interim results, analysts’ conference calls and periodic 
roadshows. 
Shareholders are free to contact any Non-executive Director 
to address any issues where contact with the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer is inappropriate or 
where such contact has failed to resolve the issue.
With regard to 2014, discussions were held with shareholder 
advisory bodies, primarily regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
matters relating to the remuneration policy.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting (scheduled to be held on 13 May 2015) and private 
investors are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity 
given to ask questions. The Chairmen (or nominated members) 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees will 
attend the meeting and be available to answer questions.
Compliance with statutory provisions
As the Company is registered in Gibraltar, it is subject to 
compliance with Gibraltar statutory requirements. The main 
legislation relevant to companies in Gibraltar is the Gibraltar 
Companies Act, which is based on the UK Companies Act 1929. 
The Company is in full compliance with the Gibraltar Companies 
Act.
Going concern 
After careful review of the Group’s budget for 2015, its medium-
term plans, liquid resources and all relevant matters, the 
Directors are confident that the Company and the Group 
have adequate financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They have therefore 
continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
disclosed in the Business Review on page 19.
Corporate social responsibility statement
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Director responsible for 
monitoring corporate social responsibility within 888. The Board 
receives periodic reports on the Group’s activities in this area 
from the Chief Executive Officer. Further details are set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility section on pages 16 to 18.
Whistle-blowing policy
The Company’s whistle-blowing policy sets out the overall 
responsibility of the Board for implementation of the policy, but 
notes that the Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility 
for overseeing and implementing it to the designated whistle-
blowing officer. The policy provides that where an employee is 
not comfortable making a disclosure to his/her respective direct 
line manager, disclosure can be made to the designated whistle-
blowing officer whose details are provided. If the subject of the 
disclosure in any way involves the designated whistle-blowing 
officer, the disclosure may be made directly to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee or to another member of the Group’s 
senior management. Whilst employees are permitted to make 
disclosures anonymously, disclosing employees are encouraged 
to reveal their identity to the designated whistle-blowing 
officer in order to allow a full and proper investigation to take 
place; measures can be taken to preserve the confidentiality 
of the disclosure where appropriate. The Board commits to 
investigating all disclosures fully, fairly, quickly and, where 
circumstances permit, confidentially. Undertakings are made 
to employees who raise genuinely held concerns in good faith 
under the procedure that they will not be dismissed or subjected 
to any detriment as a result of his/her action. Employees of the 
Group are regularly sent reminders regarding the whistle-blowing 
policy as part of general refreshers of various Group policies. 
No reports of incidents under the whistle-blowing policy were 
received in 2014.
Diversity policy
Details of the Company’s diversity policy and involvement 
of women in management of the Group are set out in the

Audit Committee Report
Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
The Audit Committee exercises oversight of the Company’s financial reporting policies, monitors the integrity of the financial 
statements and considers the significant financial and accounting estimates and judgments applied in preparing the financial 
statements. It also ensures that the disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate.
Amongst other things, during the year the Committee considered:
 | The complex legal and regulatory environment in which the Company operates, together with changes in laws and regulations 
which may impact the Company’s business, sector and market.
 | The Company’s exposure to corporation tax and VAT in various jurisdictions.
 | The appropriateness of the accounting for the joint venture arrangements entered into by the Company in the United States.
 | The carrying value of goodwill and related disclosures in the financial statements.
 | The adequacy of the Company’s IT systems and controls.
 | The adequacy of the systems and controls on which management relies.
A key responsibility of the Committee is to review the scope, nature and effectiveness of internal and external audits.
Internal audit work is conducted by Deloitte and the scope of their work is agreed with both management and the Audit 
Committee. The Committee also monitors and reviews the key aspects of the Company’s external audit.
In relation to risks and controls, the Committee ensures that these have been identified and that appropriate responsibilities and 
accountabilities have been set.
Further information on the Committee’s responsibilities and the manner in which they are discharged are set out below and are 
available on the Company’s website – www.888holdingsplc.com. 
I will be available at the Annual General meeting in May 2015 to answer any questions and would like to thank my colleagues on 
the Committee for their help and support.
Sincerely,
Ron McMillan
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Governance
Committee composition
The Committee comprises a minimum of three members, all of 
whom are independent Non-executive Directors.
Two members constitute a quorum. The Committee requires 
the inclusion of at least one financially qualified member with 
recent and relevant financial experience. The Committee’s 
Chairman fulfils that requirement. All members of the 
Committee are expected to have an understanding of financial 
reporting, the Company’s internal control environment, relevant 
corporate legislation, the functions of internal and external 
audit and the regulatory framework of the business.
The members of the Committee during the year were:
Ron McMillan 
(Chairman – Appointed May 15, 2014)
Amos Pickel 
(Chairman until May 15, 2014)
As of the end of the 2015 Annual General Meeting, John 
Anderson is stepping down as Non-executive Director. The 
Board will continue its efforts in 2015 to recruit suitable and 
experienced independent Non-executive Directors.
Details of meetings of the Audit Committee are set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 26. 
In addition to scheduled meetings, the Chairman of the 
Committee met with the Chief Financial Officer and the internal 
and external auditors on a number of occasions.
Responsibilities
The committee is responsible for:
 | Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and reviewing significant financial judgments and estimates 
in advance of these being considered by the board;
 | In conjunction with internal and external audit, reviewing 
internal financial controls and management’s response to 
required corrective action;
 | Monitoring and reviewing the role and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, including activities and resources; 
and
 | Overseeing the role and effectiveness of the external auditor, 
reviewing and monitoring their objectivity and independence 
and agreeing the scope of work and fees for audit and non-
audit services.
Activities
The key matters discussed by the Committee during the year 
included:
Goodwill and intangible assets 
As set out in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, 
the group has significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
relating to the acquisitions of businesses and the development 
of gaming platforms and software. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the cash flow forecasts 
supporting the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets including the key assumptions and estimates, and 
satisfied itself that no impairments were required in relation 
to carrying values. In addition, the appropriateness of the 
capitalisation of costs relating to the development of gaming 
platforms and software was reviewed.
Joint venture accounting 
As described in the note 12 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the group has a joint venture in the US with Avenue 
OLG Entertainment LLC. During the year, the Audit Committee 
updated its review of the accounting for the joint venture in 
light of the additional investments made and satisfied itself in 
relation to this accounting and the completeness of the related 
disclosures.
Taxation 
The Board oversees and sets the group’s tax strategy and 
evaluates tax risk. In undertaking this task the group uses inter 
alia its legal advisors, internal auditor (Deloitte) and external 
auditor (EY). 
During the year the group’s legal advisors have kept the Audit 
Committee apprised of both existing and emerging tax risks 
and, where appropriate, these have been elevated to the Board 
for consideration in conjunction with the group’s commercial 
strategy 
Regulation 
The group manages its regulatory risk with input from 
its legal advisors and seeks to balance the needs of 
regulators with those of the business. The group works with 
its lawyers to produce regular updates so that the Board 
and Audit Committee understand what is happening in the 
regulatory landscape. During the year the Audit Committee 
reviewed updates on the management of regulatory risk 
from management and the group’s lawyers. In addition, the 
group’s internal auditor reviewed the group’s regulatory risk 
management process and reported its findings to the Audit 
Committee.
IT systems
The group’s IT systems are complex and in the main are 
developed in house. The success of the business relies on 
the development of IT platforms which are innovative and 
appealing to customers. In addition, the integrity and security 
of the IT systems are vital from a commercial standpoint. 
During the year, the Audit Committee has reviewed reports 
from management on data security and disaster recovery 
planning and reviewed the results of work undertaken by the 
external auditor on the IT general control environment and 
commissioned the internal auditor to perform IT penetration 
testing.

Internal controls 
The group maintains a robust system of internal control for 
the purpose of safeguarding the group’s assets, managing risk 
and, where required, complying with regulations. This covers 
all material risks and related controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls together with mitigating 
actions and responsibilities. 
The group’s internal audit function is outsourced to Deloitte 
and the Audit Committee reviewed and modified the internal 
audit plan. It has also reviewed reports from Deloitte in relation 
to all internal audit work carried out during the year. The Audit 
Committee has also reviewed reports from EY, the external 
auditor, in relation to internal control matters arising from its 
work.
In addition to the matters described above, the work of the 
Committee during the year included:
 | Reviewing the draft interim and annual reports and 
considering:
1. The accounting principles, policies and practices 
adopted and the adequacy of related disclosures in the 
reports
2. The significant accounting issues, estimates and 
judgments of management in relation to financial 
reporting;
3. Whether any significant adjustments were required 
arising from the audit; and
4. Compliance with statutory tax obligations and the 
Group’s tax policy;
 | Meeting with internal and external auditors, both with and in 
the absence of the executive directors.
 | Reviewing and approving the resources of, the scope of work 
undertaken by and the reports prepared by internal audit.
 | Reviewing the reports prepared by the external auditor on 
key audit findings and any significant deficiencies in the 
financial control environment.
 | Reviewing and considering the Company’s systems of 
internal risk control, sources of assurance and exposure to 
fraud.
 | Overseeing the management of the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures which contain procedures for the Committee to 
receive, in confidence, complaints on all operational matters.
 | Reviewing the performance of the external auditor, 
including its relationship with the Company, the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit services and the balance 
of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Non-audit 
services are generally subject to tender processes and the 
allocations of work are done on the basis of competence, 
cost effectiveness, regulatory requirements, the potential for 
conflicts to arise and knowledge of the Group’s business. The 
Committee is satisfied that in relation to these services, EY 
has taken actions to ensure that any potential conflicts of 
interest are properly managed.
 | Reporting to the board on how it has discharged its 
responsibilities.
 | Making recommendations to the board in respect of its 
findings in respect of all of the above matters.
 | Review of the going concern position of the Company. 
Considering all relevant factors, the Committee determined 
that the Company remains a going concern.
The Board considers that the processes undertaken by the 
Audit Committee continue to be appropriately robust and 
effective and in compliance with the guidance issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. During the year, the Board has not 
been advised by the Audit Committee of, nor identified itself, 
any failings, frauds or weaknesses in internal control which it 
has determined to be material in the context of the financial 
statements.
The principal risks which the Company has identified, together 
with actions to mitigate those risks are set out on page 19.
BDO LLP had been the Company’s auditor for ten years and, 
in light of current recommendations, with effect from 30 June 
2014, BDO was replaced by EY as the auditor of the Company 
under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and as 
statutory auditor for the purposes of issuing audit reports, 
pursuant to Section 10 of the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) 
Act 1999.
The appointment or reappointment of the external auditor is 
put to the vote of each Annual General Meeting. Prior thereto, 
the Audit Committee considers the auditor’s performance 
during the year, and forms a view as to whether to recommend 
that the present auditors be reappointed or an alternative 
be proposed. As regards 2014, the Audit Committee formed 
the view that the external auditor performed its role in a 
professional manner and recommended that at the next AGM 
in May 2015, the shareholders ratify the appointment of EY as 
of 30 June 2014, and that EY be reappointed for 2015, and, if 
so appointed, that they will hold office until the conclusion of 
the next general meeting of the Company at which accounts 
are laid.
EY does not provide any material non-audit services to 
the Company. The Audit Committee seeks to ensure that 
the Company’s auditors are objective and independent by 
monitoring the appointment of the auditors for any non-audit 
work involving fees above US$0.1 million. In 2014, the external 
auditors carried out non-audit work for the Company involving 
fees in the aggregate amount of US$0.1 million.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
The Corporate Governance Code and regulations applying to Directors’ remuneration reporting requires pay to be aligned with 
the long-term success of the Company.
888’s Remuneration Policy, which was approved by an advisory vote of shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, clearly 
enunciates that principle, and seeks to align the incentives of executives with the interests of shareholders, focus on top-line 
growth and margin improvement, link remuneration to performance and shareholder return, provide strong linkage between 
remuneration, performance and delivery of Company strategy, and ensure total remuneration is market-competitive in the industry 
and helps attract and retain executives of the highest calibre.
Whilst the Remuneration Policy set out in the 2014 Annual Report was adopted with the intention that it would be brought for 
shareholder approval in three years’ time, and the Company considers that the existing Remuneration Policy continues to apply 
during 2015, the board intends to put to the 2015 Annual General Meeting a resolution to approve a revised Remuneration Policy. 
The revised Remuneration Policy is intended, once approved, to apply to payments made after the date of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 13 May 2015, which may relate to the financial year ended 31 December 2014. The revised remuneration 
Policy includes the grant of discretion to the Remuneration Committee, in circumstances of exceptional performance, to grant 
Executive Directors an additional bonus of up to 50% of base salary, in addition to the payment of bonus of up to 100% of base 
salary under the previously approved Remuneration Policy – the revision is intended to apply to the bonus payments for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2014 which will be payable following the approval of the Group’s annual results at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting and for subsequent financial years during the life of the revised Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration 
Committee has determined that the aforementioned amendment is required in order for the Company to be competitive 
with market practice in terms of payment of short-term incentives to Executive Directors and in order to provide a sufficiently 
attractive overall remuneration package to Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee considers that the existing 
performance targets are appropriately stretching and therefore it was determined not to adjust the performance targets in light 
of the increase in grant opportunity to Executive Directors.
The approved Remuneration Policy, as proposed to be revised by resolution of the 2015 Annual General Meeting, is set out in this 
Remuneration Report.
As required by the regulations, the Remuneration Report includes an Implementation Report, setting out the manner in which the 
Remuneration Policy is to be implemented in 2015, including changes in various salary components which are being implemented 
within the scope of the existing Remuneration Policy and set out therein.
In 2015, various changes are taking place at Board level. Brian Mattingley will be stepping down as the Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer and will be appointed as Executive Chairman, and Richard Kilsby will be stepping down as Chairman, as from the 2015 
Annual General Meeting. During 2014, the Remuneration Committee considered Mr. Mattingley’s new terms as Executive Chairman, 
and these discussions are ongoing.
Since the Company is incorporated in Gibraltar it is not legally required to comply with the UK regulations on directors’ 
remuneration. As such, the Board intends to put the revised remuneration policy set out in this Report, and the remainder of the 
Report as a whole, to shareholders for approval in two separate votes at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. Since the Company 
is not a UK incorporated company, and is not subject to the UK Companies Act 2006 nor the UK regulations on directors’ 
remuneration, the two votes will be “advisory” votes. This means that payments made or promised to Directors would not have to 
be repaid if either of the votes were not passed, and while the Board intends to set Directors’ remuneration in accordance with 
the remuneration policy, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, neither the Board nor individual Directors 
are legally bound by the policy.
The Board intends to put to the 2015 Annual General Meeting the revised remuneration terms, subject to its approval by 
shareholders; in the event that the revised remuneration terms are not approved by shareholders, the remuneration policy 
approved at last year’s Annual General Meeting shall continue in force. If the revised remuneration terms are approved, it is 
intended to apply to payments made after the date of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 May 2015, which may relate 
to the financial year ended 31 December 2014. Existing obligations will continue to be met. It is the Company’s intention that, 
provided it remains unchanged, the revised remuneration policy will continue to apply until a shareholder vote at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2017.

The proposed revised remuneration policy seeks to align the Company’s remuneration policy with Company strategy and its 
approach to risk, and on rewarding success fairly, whilst avoiding paying more than is necessary to properly attract, retain and 
motivate Directors of appropriate calibre to the Company’s business; as well as to promote the long-term success of the company 
and for performance-related elements thereof to be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. In adopting the revised policy, 
the Company confirms that there is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for 
fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors, with no Director being involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Annual Statement
2014 was another record year for the Group, with revenue increasing by 14% compared to 2013, Adjusted EBITDA increasing 
by 33% and Adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 22.1% compared to 18.9% in 2013. During the year, the Board discussed with 
investor representative groups the remuneration of the Executive Directors, amongst other matters. During 2015, the Remuneration 
Committee will exercise its duties in accordance with the revised Remuneration Policy set out herein, subject to its approval at the 
Annual General Meeting.
We hope that you will find the Directors’ Remuneration Report informative and would be happy to discuss any feedback you  
may have.
Sincerely,
Amos Pickel

Governance
Introduction
The Company presents its report on the remuneration of its Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014. The Company 
is incorporated in Gibraltar and, therefore, is not required to comply with the UK Companies Act 2006 or the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report requirements in Schedule 8 to the UK Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), but has chosen to prepare this Remuneration Report on the basis of those 
requirements, as appropriate.
The report sets out the revised remuneration policy proposed to be put to the 2015 Annual General Meeting, together with the 
structure and details of the remuneration of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014, including a report regarding 
implementation of the remuneration policy in 2015. The report also describes the Board’s policy and approach to the Principles of 
Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report is proposed, annually, to shareholders for approval. This Remuneration 
Report and the proposed revisions described herein, will each separately be put to advisory shareholder votes at the upcoming 
Annual General Meeting. As stated above, the advisory nature of the votes, due to the Company’s incorporation in Gibraltar, 
means that obligations to make payments to Directors would continue to be enforceable in the event that either of the votes is 
not passed and neither the Board nor individual Directors are legally bound by the current or any revised Remuneration Policy.
Revised Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the calibre appropriate to a global business 
in a competitive environment. The Remuneration Committee is mindful that many of the Group’s competitors are not UK listed 
companies and acknowledges the unique risk profile associated with online businesses of the nature of the Group’s, and takes 
these matters into account in determining appropriate remuneration levels. The components of the remuneration structure are set 
out below.
At least half of the total potential remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer is represented by 
a variable element, dependent on the performance of the Group. The Remuneration Committee considers that these represent 
achievable and motivational levels of personal rewards commensurate with stipulated levels of corporate performance.
The Remuneration Committee is mandated by the Board to satisfy itself that the level of the Directors’ and senior management’s 
remuneration is appropriate, having regard to pay and conditions throughout the sectors in which the Group operates as well 
as pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. It further ensures that such remuneration aligns with the risks and 
rewards to shareholders. In this context, the Remuneration Committee regularly reviews individual and corporate performance 
targets and uses careful and rigorous judgment to match remuneration to achievements.
The Remuneration Committee applies a remuneration policy which has at its core the following objectives:
 | To align the incentives of executives with the interests of shareholders, including being mindful of employee costs in light of the 
Company’s capital needs and return to shareholders;
 | To focus on top-line growth and margin improvement;
 | To link a significant proportion of remuneration to financial and individual performance, as well as shareholder return, both in 
the short term and long term;
 | To provide strong linkage between remuneration, performance and delivery of Company strategy;
 | To ensure total remuneration is market-competitive in the industry and helps attract and retain executives of the highest 
calibre; and
 | To promote the long-term success of the Company, and for performance-related elements thereof to be transparent, stretching 
and rigorously applied.
The following is the Company’s Remuneration Policy which was approved by an advisory vote of the shareholders at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting of the Company, as revised in accordance with the resolution to be put to the shareholders at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting and described herein.

Remuneration 
Component Purpose How it operates Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base Salary Provide an 
attractive pay 
package taking 
into account 
the risks and 
responsibilities 
of the role 
in order to 
attract, retain 
and motivate 
Directors of 
suitable calibre 
The Executive Directors’ 
base salaries are subject to 
annual review at the time 
of the publication of the 
annual financial statements 
with effect from 1 January 
of the same year. The 
Company considers that 
the Executive Directors’ 
personal performance is best 
measured in accordance 
with the performance of the 
Company as a whole, taking 
into account any changes 
in the level of responsibilities 
of the Executive Directors. 
Therefore, in determining 
salary levels and raises, the 
Remuneration Committee 
has regard to the pay and 
conditions of comparable 
companies in the same 
sector, including the FTSE 
250 Index.
The Remuneration 
Committee has 
regard to the 
last reported 
median salary 
level of the upper 
quartile of FTSE 
250 companies 
in determining 
base salary. The 
Executive Directors 
will generally not 
be paid more 
than 5% over 
such last reported 
upper quartile 
median, except in 
circumstances of 
significant changes 
in responsibilities.
Payment of base salary is not subject to performance 
conditions. However, in reviewing salaries, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account pay and 
conditions elsewhere across the Group, relevant market 
data and benchmarking, and the individual Director’s 
performance and experience. Benchmarking is carried 
out on a total remuneration basis, and takes account 
of pay levels for comparable roles at a range of 
organisations of similar size and sector. No recovery or 
withholding applies to salary.
Benefits Provide an 
attractive 
benefits 
package taking 
into account 
the risks and 
responsibilities 
of the role 
in order to 
attract, retain 
and motivate 
Directors of 
suitable calibre 
Benefits may include cost 
of, or an allowance toward, 
accommodation (where 
the Company has required 
the Executive Director to 
relocate), use of Company 
car, car allowance, health 
insurance (or contribution 
towards health insurance 
scheme), disability and 
life insurance, directors’ 
indemnities and directors’ 
& officers’ insurance to the 
extent permitted by law, 
pension (or payment in lieu 
thereof) at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee. 
 
Benefits will be 
market competitive 
taking into account 
the role and the 
local market. 
The value will be 
appropriate to 
the individual 
circumstances of the 
individual executive 
director. The current 
package of benefits 
will generally be 
maintained but the 
value may fluctuate 
depending amongst 
other things on 
insurance costs, 
an individual’s 
circumstances 
and non-material 
changes determined 
in the discretion of 
the Remuneration 
Committee
Benefits are not subject to performance conditions. No 
recovery or withholding applies to benefits. 
Short term 
incentives
Provide a 
challenging 
framework to 
incentivize 
executive 
performance 
and align 
executive 
incentives to 
shareholder 
interests
An annual cash bonus 
becomes payable following 
the approval of the Group’s 
annual results at the 
annual general meeting, 
in accordance with the 
performance criteria set by 
the Remuneration Committee 
at the beginning of the 
financial year. The annual 
bonus may be paid following 
release of the annual financial 
results as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine 
in its discretion, provided 
that any such earlier bonus 
payment shall be subject to 
clawback. The bonus can 
be paid in cash or shares, 
at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Targets are set in 
light of Company 
growth and market 
conditions. The 
Remuneration 
Committee 
considers the target 
Adjusted EBITDA 
growth metric as 
being appropriate 
for determining 
challenging 
performance 
targets. Maximum 
opportunity is 100% 
of base salary; 
in circumstances 
of exceptional 
performance, the 
Remuneration 
Committee shall 
have discretion to 
grant Executive 
Directors an 
additional bonus of 
up to 50% of base 
salary*.
Maximum bonus award is 100% of base salary for the 
Executive Directors. The foregoing is calculated on 
a linear scale based on like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA 
growth (i.e. with the adjustment for exceptional items 
relating to the changing regulatory environment to 
arrive at a like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA, as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee). The threshold like-
for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth and the like-for-like 
Adjusted EBITDA growth giving rise to maximum bonus 
award are determined by the Remuneration Committee 
in accordance with the Executive Directors’ annual 
targets. In circumstances of exceptional performance, 
the Remuneration Committee shall have discretion to 
grant Executive Directors an additional bonus of up to 
50% of base salary. No bonus is paid where growth is 
below threshold like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA growth, 
and a bonus is only payable where Adjusted EBITDA is 
above budget for the year as approved by the Board. 
Whilst not implemented at present, the Remuneration 
Committee may decide to apply clawback or malus 
to short term incentive grants to Executive Directors 
recruited in future, at its discretion and pursuant to the 
employment agreement of such Executive Director.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
*  It will be proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting to revise the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, such that the 
Remuneration Committee will have discretion, in circumstances of exceptional performance, to grant Executive Directors an additional bonus of up to 
50% of base salary

Long term 
incentives
Encourage 
executives to 
create long term 
shareholder 
value, aligned 
with the 
timing of 
implementation 
of the 
Company’s long 
term strategy
The following is a summary 
of the long term incentive 
plans currently utilised by 
the Company. Other plans or 
amendments to the existing 
plans may be implemented 
at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee 
and subject to any required 
shareholder approvals
888 All-Employee Share Plan
The Company currently 
grants awards under the 888 
All-Employee Share Plan.
All employees, consultants 
and Executive Directors 
of the Group who are not 
within six months of their 
normal retirement age are 
eligible to participate in 
the 888 All-Employee Share 
Plan at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Awards under the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan can either 
be granted for no consideration 
(or with a nil exercise price for 
options) or at an exercise price 
that will normally be no less 
than the market value of an 
ordinary share at the time of 
grant or average share price 
during a period as determined 
by the Remuneration 
Committee at time of grant. In 
countries where an award or 
option involving real shares is 
not appropriate or feasible for 
legal, regulatory or tax reasons, 
a phantom award may be 
made which will, on vesting, pay 
a cash sum to an equivalent 
value in lieu of shares.
The Executive 
Directors are 
granted nil cost 
options or awards 
over shares for 
no consideration 
on an annual 
basis following 
the publication 
of the Group’s 
annual results. 
The maximum 
grant allocation 
to each Executive 
Director under 
the All-Employee 
Plan is equal to 
100% of such 
Executive Director’s 
salary converted 
into shares of 
the Company by 
reference to the 
prevailing market 
value of a share at 
the time of grant.
Share awards or nil cost options issued with 
performance criteria are subject to three year cliff 
vesting, with equally weighted dependence on EPS-
based and TSR-based metrics.
The performance conditions of nil cost options or free 
shares are measured over a period of three years 
commencing from the beginning of the financial year 
in which the award is granted, with the vesting of 50% 
of such share awards or options dependent upon the 
achievement of a performance condition based on 
cumulative growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) over 
such three-year period adjusted on a like-for-like 
basis, and the vesting of the other 50% of such share 
awards or options dependent upon the achievement 
of a performance condition based on relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to a defined peer 
group median over such three-year period. (See below 
for peer group details).
The threshold compound EPS growth rate as well as 
the compound EPS growth rate and annual relative TSR 
giving rise to maximum vesting, are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee in accordance with Executive 
Directors’ annual targets. With regard to the share 
awards or options subject to the EPS performance 
condition, where the compound annual EPS growth 
rate is between the threshold compound EPS growth 
rate and the compound EPS growth rate giving rise 
to maximum vesting, such share awards or options 
vest on a linear scale between 25% and 100% of the 
shares under the EPS element, with an EPS growth rate 
of below the threshold compound EPS growth rate not 
allowing any vesting. With regard to the share awards 
or options subject to the TSR performance condition, 
where the Company’s TSR over the vesting period 
is between the median of a peer group determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and the TSR over 
the vesting period above such median giving rise to 
maximum vesting, such share awards or options vest 
on a linear scale between 25% and 100% of the shares 
under the TSR element, with a TSR below such median 
not allowing any vesting. The peer group for the TSR 
performance condition determined by the Remuneration 
Committee is presently as follows with respect to awards 
made to date; however, the Remuneration Committee 
will reconsider the composition of such peer group on 
an annual basis prior to the grant of any share awards 
The maximum number of 
ordinary shares that an 
eligible employee may 
acquire pursuant to share 
awards or options granted 
to such person in any 
calendar year under the 
888 All-Employee Share 
Plan and the 888 Long term 
Incentive Plan may not have 
an aggregate market value, 
as measured at the date of 
grant, exceeding 200% of 
such person’s annual base 
salary or such higher limit as 
the Remuneration Committee 
may determine is appropriate 
in any individual case.
Awards vest over a fixed 
period of up to four years 
from the date determined by 
the Remuneration Committee 
at the time of grant. The 
Remuneration Committee may 
determine that the vesting 
and release or exercise of 
share awards and options 
under    the 888 All Employee 
Share Plan are subject to such 
performance conditions as the 
Remuneration Committee may 
impose at the time of grant.

Phantom Share Award
Generally in circumstances where the grant 
of equity may give rise to dilution in excess 
of limits set down in institutional investor 
guidelines, a phantom share award may be 
granted. 
Brian Mattingley was granted a phantom 
share award by the Company pursuant to 
his employment agreement dated 27 March 
2012. 
The phantom share based award provides 
that Mr Mattingley will be entitled to a 
one-time cash sum, on the vesting date 
of 27 March 2015 provided that he is in 
employment with the Company at that time. 
The amount payable is calculated on an 
incremental basis, based on the average 
share price of the Company over a period 
of 20 dealing days prior to the scheduled 
vesting date for the award. The minimum 
amount payable is £250,000 and the 
maximum payable is £5,500,000.
Specifically, where the Company’s average 
share price is less than 50p in the 20 
dealing days prior to the scheduled 
vesting date, a minimum award amount 
of £250,000 is payable. Where the share 
price is between 50p and 60p, the award 
payable is calculated on a straight-line 
basis between £250,000 and £450,000. 
For each additional 10p above a share 
price of 60p up to £1, an incremental 
amount of £200,000 is payable; for each 
additional 10p above a share price of £1 
and up to £1.20, an incremental amount of 
£300,000 is payable; for each additional 
10p above a share price of £1.20 and up to 
£1.60, an incremental amount of £400,000 
is payable; and for each additional 10p 
above a share price of £1.60 up to £2.00, 
an incremental amount of £500,000 is 
payable up to a maximum payment of 
£5,500,000. 
The maximum 
amount payable is 
£5,500,000 for the 
achievement of an 
average share price 
of at least £2.00 
over the 20 dealing 
days prior to  
27 March 2015.
Phantom awards are subject to three 
year cliff vesting, and provide for a 
one-time cash sum on the vesting date 
provided that the Executive Director is in 
employment with the Company at that 
time. 
Whilst not implemented at present, the 
Remuneration Committee may decide 
to apply clawback or malus to phantom 
grants to Executive Directors recruited 
in future, at its discretion and pursuant 
to the employment agreement of such 
Executive Director.
The phantom award will also vest if Mr 
Mattingley leaves employment before the 
normal vesting date for any reason unless 
he resigns or the Company dismisses him 
summarily in accordance with the terms 
of his contract for example for gross 
misconduct. The average share price will 
normally be calculated by reference to 
the 20 day period up to the date of the 
termination of employment. However, if the 
Company has terminated Mr Mattingley’s 
employment under notice, he may request 
the average share price to be calculated 
either by reference to the period up to the 
service of the notice or the normal vesting 
date of 27 March 2015 as he chooses. If 
there is a change of control, the average 
share price will be calculated by reference 
to the period up to the change of control. 
The fair value of Mr Mattingley’s award 
at 31 December 2014 has been externally 
evaluated at £2.2 million, with the Company 
recording a charge in the amount of £0.3 
million in its 2014 (£1.4 million in 2013) 
accounts in respect of the amount earned 
in the year.

Determination of performance measures
The performance measures adopted by the Company in 
determining the remuneration of its Executive Directors 
acknowledge that the performance of the Executive Directors 
is best measured in accordance with the performance of 
the Company as a whole. For this reason, the Remuneration 
Policy has regard to various financial measures, including 
both internal measures such as like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA 
growth and cumulative growth in Earnings Per Share (adjusted 
to compare like for like), as well as relative Total Shareholder 
Return compared to a peer group median, which the Company 
believes best reflects the interests of shareholders. In general, 
the Company seeks to remunerate its Executive Directors in line 
with comparable roles at other companies in the same market, 
taking into account the scope of roles and responsibilities 
of the Executive Directors; similarly, the Company seeks to 
remunerate its employees generally in line with comparable 
roles of personnel located in comparable locations.
Recruitment of new Directors
The Company is aware of its need to attract and retain new 
Directors of suitable calibre to its business, and determines the 
remuneration packages it offers by taking into account the 
global nature and competitive environment of its business. 
The principles to be applied by the Company in agreeing the 
components of a remuneration package for the appointment 
of a new Executive Director will include the following:
 | In general, the total compensation package offered to a 
new Executive Director will not exceed the upper quartile 
total compensation package of the FTSE 250;
 | Insofar as practicable, the remuneration proposed for a new 
Executive Director would be consistent with the ”Approved 
Policy” table set out above;
 | In order to secure an appropriate candidate, it may be 
necessary to offer a higher base salary than that offered to 
the current Executive Directors;
 | There may be a need to compensate a newly recruited 
Executive Director for forfeiting remuneration from existing 
employment. The Company may award a newly recruited 
Executive Director a signing bonus or retention bonus, 
which may be paid in the form of cash, options and/
or shares, and may rely on Listing Rule 9.4.2 to put an 
appropriate arrangement in place upon recruitment. If the 
remuneration being forfeited was subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions the compensation awards 
will be subject to Company performance conditions and 
where practicable will mirror the vesting schedule of the 
remuneration being forfeited;
 | The Company will not pay more than is necessary to attract 
a suitable individual for the role; 
 | Relocation benefits may be provided where the newly 
recruited Executive Director is required by the Company to 
relocate;
 | Other benefits may also be payable, including business 
expense reimbursement, car or car allowance, health 
insurance (or contribution towards health insurance 
scheme), pension (or payment in lieu of pension), life 
insurance, holiday pay, sick pay and other statutory benefits;
 | Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, 
existing contractual entitlements including any outstanding 
share and cash awards and pension entitlements will be 
honoured.
 | The Remuneration Committee may negotiate inclusion in a 
newly recruited Executive Director’s employment agreement 
a clawback and/or malus mechanism as regards short term 
or long term incentives, and/or a mitigation mechanism 
regarding short term and/or long term incentive payments 
made during the Executive Directors’ unexpired notice 
period where such Executive Director is engaged in other 
employment during such period. 
 | The Company will make timely disclosure of the 
remuneration structure of any new Executive Director or 
chairman in a RIS.
Directors’ service agreements and termination benefits
Details of the Directors’ Service Agreements are set out in 
Charts 6(a) and (6)(b) on page 46.
It is the Company’s policy that each Executive Director’s service 
agreement is terminable on no more than 12 months’ written 
notice by either party; the notice period applying to Brian 
Mattingley’s and Aviad Kobrine’s employment is 12 months. 
Each Executive Director’s employment can be terminated 
by making a payment equal to the salary and pension 
contributions (if any) and the value of other contractual 
benefits due to the Executive Director in lieu of any unexpired 
notice period. The Executive Directors shall continue to be 
entitled to be paid a bonus and in Brian Mattingley’s case, to 
payment of his phantom share award as described on page 
40, in respect of any unexpired part of the notice period even 
if the employment is terminated by making payment in lieu 
of notice. No other benefits upon termination of employment 
are payable. Each Executive Director’s employment can be 
terminated without compensation in circumstances where the 
employer is entitled to terminate for cause, as defined for the 
purposes of the service agreement. An Executive Director’s 
entitlement to share awards and share options under the 888 
All-Employee Plan on termination of employment are governed 
by the terms of that plan, pursuant to which, if the termination 
occurs for various “good reasons” set out in the Plan (details 
888 Holdings AR2014 PROOF 8.indd   41 30/03/2015   11:58:16 23968.04    30 March 2015 11:56 AM     Proof 8

set out on page 38), any vested but unexercised awards 
may be exercised or released within six months after such 
cessation, whilst any unvested portion automatically lapses, 
unless determined otherwise by the Remuneration Committee. 
In exercising its discretion, the Remuneration Committee will 
have regard to the circumstances of the termination and any 
special circumstances of the Executive Director in determining 
whether to allow unvested awards to continue to be exercisable 
for an additional short period. 
The Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office at any time during normal 
business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and 
public holidays excepted).
Policy on Exit Payments and Loss of Office
The Remuneration Committee will consider a Director’s past 
performance, the circumstances of and the reasons for his 
departure, prevailing best practice, and any transition / 
handover required in exercising any discretions relating to 
his arrangements for loss of office, including his contractual 
arrangements, his participation in an annual bonus scheme 
and awards under the 888 All Employee Share Plan, and in 
Brian Mattingley’s case, the Phantom Share Award.
Consideration of Shareholder Views on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee intends to establish a 
programme of consultation with significant investors. The Board 
engages with significant investors regarding remuneration 
issues and intends to continue doing so.
Consideration of Employee Views on Remuneration
Whilst the Company does not formally consult employees 
on remuneration, in determining the remuneration policy for 
executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the policy 
for employees across the workforce. In particular, when setting 
base salaries for executives, the Committee compares the 
salary increases with those for the workforce as a whole. 
The overall remuneration policy for executive Directors is 
broadly consistent with the remainder of the workforce. 
Executive remuneration and remuneration of senior employees 
is weighted towards performance-related pay; the Company 
has introduced equity based schemes for senior employees 
(albeit at lower quantum) which are similar to those of the 
Directors.
Remuneration Scenarios
The Company has prepared the following chart regarding 2015 
on a voluntary basis for the information of its shareholders.

Governance
The following assumptions were used in the charts on page 42:
Short Term Incentive: The maximum bonus payable to 
Executive Directors is equal to one year’s salary. Pursuant 
to the revised Remuneration Policy to be proposed to 
shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting of the 
Company, in circumstances of exceptional performance, 
the Remuneration Committee shall have discretion to grant 
Executive Directors an additional bonus of up to 50% of base 
salary. The chart assumes that the Executive Directors’ 2015 
target performance (which the Board considers stretching) will 
give rise to entitlement of 75% of the maximum award amount 
in ordinary circumstances.
Long Term Incentive*: The chart assumes no further phantom 
grants to Brian Mattingley in 2015, and therefore there is 
no Long Term Incentive component of Brian Mattingley’s 
compensation in 2015. Aviad Kobrine’s nil cost options are 
granted subject to the performance conditions set out in the 
Remuneration Policy. The maximum grant to Executive Directors 
under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and Remuneration 
Policy is equal to of up to 100% of such Executive Director’s 
salary converted into shares of the Company by reference to 
the prevailing market value of a share at the time of grant. The 
chart assumes that Aviad Kobrine’s 2015 target performance 
(which the Board considers stretching) will give rise to vesting 
of 75% of the maximum award amount; With regard to Brian 
Mattingley, the Company’s expectation according to fair 
value has been used. The chart assumes that the share price 
remains at the same share price as at 31 December 2014. 
Finally, it should be noted that the chart shows the potential 
remuneration opportunity granted in the relevant year rather 
than what actually vests and is received in such year.
*  It is noted for completeness that the Phantom Share Award granted to 
Brian Mattingley on 27 March 2012 will be fully vested and payable on 
27 March 2015. The fair value of Mr Mattingley’s award at 31 December 
2014 has been externally evaluated at £2.2 million.
Chart 3 – Chairman and Non-executive Directors
Remuneration 
Component Purpose How it operates
Fees Duly compensate Chairman and Non-
executive Directors, taking into account 
the risks of the role, in order to attract 
and retain a Chairman and Non-
executive Directors of suitable calibre.
The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the fees paid to 
the Non-executive Directors. The Chairman’s fees are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee with reference to prevailing fee rates amongst 
the upper quartile of FTSE 250 companies. Fees paid to the Non-executive 
Directors are set by reference to an assessment of the time commitment and 
responsibility associated with each role, and the Remuneration Committee 
has reference in this respect to prevailing fee rates amongst the upper 
quartile of FTSE 250 companies. Levels take account of additional demands 
placed upon individual Non-executive Directors by virtue of their holding 
particular offices, such as Committee Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman, 
and travel time to Board meetings at the Group's headquarters in Gibraltar. 
The fees paid to each Non-executive Director during 2014 are disclosed in the 
Directors' remuneration summary on page 45.
Other Benefits The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in any bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long term incentive plan of 
the Company. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are covered by 
the Company’s directors’ & officers’ insurance policy and are entitled to 
indemnification in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. In 
addition, the Chairman receives a cash amount covering life insurance and 
health insurance expenses. The amount paid to the Chairman during 2014 is 
disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration summary on page 45.
Non-executive Directors’ appointments, which are for a term of three years, may be terminated by the Company without notice 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the Gibraltar Companies Act, except for the Chairman who 
is required to be given six months’ prior written notice of termination. No compensation is payable on the termination of the 
appointment.

1.  Directors remuneration is converted from Sterling into US$ at the average rate of exchange for the relevant month it was paid save for the 
annual cash bonus which is converted into US$ at the year end exchange rate.
2.  Brian Mattingley was granted an additional health insurance (BUPA) benefit during 2014. The additional benefit was approved by the 
Remuneration Committee in order to bring Mr. Mattingley’s benefits in line with other Group executives and was considered an immaterial 
change to his current package of benefits. 
3. The value of Company shares held by VSS for future satisfaction of nil-cost options which vested during the relevant period together with 
dividend paid by the Company to VSS in respect of such shares until exercise of such nil cost options. Awards not subject to performance 
conditions are included under ‘‘Other items in the nature of remuneration” rather than under ‘‘Long term incentives”.
Salary: In 2014, Brian Mattingley’s annual salary was £396,000, 
and Aviad Kobrine’s annual salary was £377,000*. In 2015, 
Brian Mattingley’s and Aviad Kobrine’s annual salaries will 
be as stated on page 44. The increase in salary for each 
Executive Directors reflects an increase of 5% on the salary 
for 2014; in line with the Remuneration Policy, in taking this 
decision the Remuneration Committee had regard to the last 
reported median salary level of the upper quartile of FTSE 250 
companies, and noted that the aforementioned increase in 
determining base salary did not constitute payment of more 
than 5% over such last reported upper quartile median. Salary 
amounts are converted from Sterling into US$ at the average 
rate of exchange for the relevant month it was paid save for 
the annual cash bonus which is converted into US$ at the 
year-end exchange rate.
*  Part of which is paid by the Company and part by Cassava 
Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited.
Benefits: Benefits provided to Brian Mattingley in 2014 include 
the provision of accommodation and health insurance. Benefits 
provided to Aviad Kobrine include a car allowance and health, 
disability and life insurance.
Short term incentives: The sole short term incentives applicable 
to Brian Mattingley and Aviad Kobrine in 2013 and 2014 
were their annual bonuses. In both cases, the performance 
conditions set out in the Remuneration Policy applied. 
Threshold performance for 2014 was 5% year on year Adjusted 
EBITDA Growth and target performance for 2014, which was 
considered a stretching target, was 15% year-on-year Adjusted 
EBITDA growth, which would have given rise to payment of 
75% of the Executive Directors’ bonus opportunity, with 20% 
year on year Adjusted EBITDA Growth giving rise to payment 
of the maximum amount of 100% of the Executive Directors’ 
bonuses. In fact, year-on-year Adjusted EBITDA growth for 
2014 increased by 33%, thus giving rise to payment of 100% 
of the Executive Directors’ bonuses. The 2014 Adjusted EBITDA 
performance also exceeded budgeted EBITDA for 2014.

Long term incentives: The long term incentives applicable to Aviad Kobrine in 2013 and 2014 were governed by the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan. In 2014, 1,175,373 nil-cost options granted to Aviad Kobrine on 24 May 2011 and due to vest on 24 May 
2014 subject to the fulfillment of the performance conditions set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, vested in full. The 
performance targets set with regard to vesting of long term incentives in 2014 were calculated as follows:
Minimum Maximum Actual over three year period

As regards Brian Mattingley, the phantom award is due to vest in 2015 and therefore no long term incentive figure appears in the 
table for 2013 and 2014. 
Pensions: In 2014, Brian Mattingley had no pension entitlement from the Company. Aviad Kobrine is entitled to a cash payment in 
lieu of an annual contribution to his personal pension scheme of 15% of his base salary.
Other items in the nature of remuneration: Aviad Kobrine benefited in 2013 and 2014 from vesting of awards under the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan granted to him in previous years. The value of the vested awards is determined in accordance with the 
share price as of the vesting dates, being £1.60 on 24 May 2013 and £1.27 on 24 May 2014. Awards not subject to performance 
conditions are included under ‘‘Other items in the nature of remuneration” rather than under ‘‘Long term incentives”.

1. Ordinary shares
2. Nil Cost Options
3. In previous Annual Reports, Aviad Kobrine had erroneously been stated to hold 15,620 ordinary shares in the Company. Following further 
investigation, the Board acknowledged as of 29 September 2014 that these were in fact nil-cost options granted to Aviad Kobrine on  
14 September 2006 and which vested on 14 April 2007, but that they were not in fact exercised. Promptly thereafter, the shares in question 
reverted to the Company’s ownership as did all dividends paid thereupon.
No Director was materially interested during the year in any contract which was significant in relation to the business of the 
Company. 
The parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report from Chart 4a – Single Total Figure to this point have been audited by EY in 
accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended. 
Total Shareholder Return
The chart below shows the value of an investment of £100 Sterling in the Company’s shares and in the FTSE 250 Index over a six 
year period ended 31 December 2014. The Directors have chosen the FTSE 250 Index as the most appropriate comparator index 
as the Company was a constituent member until October 2006, was included again in that index from February 2008 until 2010, 
was on the reserve list in 2012, was readmitted as a full member in 2013 and was again excluded in June 2014.

in the GBP remuneration paid in practice and reflected in this Chart; however it is noted that due to GBP:USD differentials the USD value of 
benefits paid to Mr. Mattingley in 2014 showed an increase.
Notes:
 — The salary figure includes base salary together with other payments made to the employees (e.g. sick pay, vacation pay), but 
excluding discretionary bonuses.
 — The benefits figure includes benefits granted to employees which are not part of salary (e.g. medical insurance, meals, further 
education fund).
 — Pension amounts are not included in Benefits.
 — The short term incentives figure solely includes bonuses, which are based on an estimation by the Company based on the 
bonus accrual, since bonuses are generally paid to Group employees in April in respect of the previous financial year.
 — CEO benefits include the provision of accommodation, as well as health insurance from 1 June 2014.
 — Exchange rates were normalized for 2013 in order to neutralise foreign exchange effects.

Governance
The comparables chosen were the following:
 | The employee pay figure includes employee benefits in 
accordance with the financial statements (including both 
staff costs and share benefit charges). 
 | Sales and marketing expenses – This reflects the amount 
invested in development of the future revenue stream of the 
Group driven by customer acquisition.
 | Dividends – This reflects amounts distributed to 
shareholders.
 | Taxes and duties – This is a necessary cost of doing 
business in a regulated business environment.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy
The performance targets applying to Directors’ remuneration in 
2015 are set out on remuneration policy table on page 36. 
The salary to be paid to the Executive Directors in 2015 is set 
out on page 42. Brian Mattingley is entitled in 2015 to health 
insurance. As from the 2015 Annual General Meeting, Brian 
Mattingley will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer, 
and will be appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board. 
Discussions regarding Brian Mattingley’s remuneration as 
Executive Chairman are ongoing. Benefits payable to Aviad 
Kobrine in 2015 will be paid on the same basis as 2014, as set 
out on page 42. Payment of short term incentives and vesting 
of long term incentives will occur in accordance with the 
remuneration policy, and the performance targets set by the 
Remuneration Committee, as stated above.
Remuneration Committee Advice
The Remuneration Committee consisted solely of independent 
Non-executive Directors, currently Amos Pickel (Chair), Ron 
McMillan and John Anderson. As a member of the FTSE 250 
Index until June 2014, the Company was required to have three 
independent Non-executive Directors on its Remuneration 
Committee. As of the end of the 2015 Annual General Meeting, 
John Anderson will step down as a Non-executive Director. 
The Company continues to seek suitably experienced Non-
executive Directors to expand its Board and committee 
membership. Details of attendances at Committee meetings 
are contained in the statement on Corporate Governance on 
page 26.
The Remuneration Committee’s remit includes such matters as:
 | Determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration 
policy with regard to the Company’s Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other members 
of the executive management; 
 | Regularly reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and 
relevance of the Company’s remuneration policy;
 | Setting and monitoring performance criteria for bonus 
arrangements operated by the Group ensuring that 
they represent achievable and motivating rewards for 
appropriate levels of performance and, where appropriate, 
are justifiable taking into account the Company’s and its 
Group’s overall performance and the corresponding return 
on shareholders’ investment in the same period;
 | Recommending to the Board the policy for and scope of 
pension arrangements for the Executive Directors; and 
 | In relation to the Company’s share option and share award 
schemes, setting or recommending vesting criteria which are 
appropriate in terms of the Company’s performance and 
return on shareholders’ investment over the same period.
The formal terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
are available on the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.
com.
The Board intends that executive remuneration policies be 
both formal and transparent. It further acknowledges the 
importance of taking into consideration independent advice 
in setting remuneration policies and benefit levels. In 2014, 
the Remuneration Committee took into consideration advice 
received in the past from New Bridge Street; however, no 
additional advice was received during 2014. New Bridge Street 
does not provide any other services to the Company, and was 
appointed in the past by the Remuneration Committee as an 
objective and independent remuneration adviser. No fees were 
paid by the Company to New Bridge Street in 2014.
Voting at General Meeting
At the Company’s last Annual General Meeting, held on 14 
May 2014, 92.04% of the votes (232,709,379 votes) were cast 
for the resolution to approve the Remuneration Report, 7.96% 
(20,127,376 votes) of the votes were cast against the resolution 
to approve the Remuneration Report, and 5,523,385 votes were 
withheld. Similarly, 90.11% of the votes (228,221,653 votes) were 
cast for the resolution to approve the Remuneration Policy, 
9.89% (25,058,248 votes) of the votes were cast against the 
resolution to approve the Remuneration Policy, and 5,080,239 
votes were withheld.
Actions taken by the Directors in 2014 in response to concerns 
of institutional investor groups included:
 | Mr. Ron McMillan was appointed to the Board on 15 May 
2014, as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee. In light of Mr. 
McMillan’s strong track record and capabilities, the Board 
believes that this appointment sends a strong message to 
institutional investors that it takes seriously the independent 
elements on its Board and Committees.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 888 Holdings plc
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
 | the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 | the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 | the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended); and
 | the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as 
amended), the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of 888 Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statements 
of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 182 of the Gibraltar Companies Act 
1930 (as amended) and our engagement letter dated 1 September 2014. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities set out on page 25, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for the preparation of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which they have chosen to prepare, being under no 
obligation to do so under Gibraltar law and the preparation of the Corporate Governance Report and statement on going 
concern under the Listing Rules. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
In addition the Company has also instructed us to:
 | report as to whether the information given in the Corporate Governance Report with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements;
 | report as to whether the section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation described therein; and
 | review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern as set out on page 29, which for a premium listed UK incorporated 
company is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement and response to that risk
The table below shows the risks we identified that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team together with our audit response to the risk: 
Risk Response
Revenue recognition
The Group makes a number of judgements 
in recognising revenue, principally in 
respect of whether the Group is acting 
as a principal or an agent with its B2B 
customers and whether certain customer 
bonuses are treated as a deduction from 
revenue or as a cost. There is a risk that 
revenue is overstated in the Group financial 
statements.
 | We documented and tested the key IT general, application and manual controls 
over the Group’s principal gaming systems. We then applied IT-based auditing 
techniques to re-perform the reconciliation between the Group’s gaming revenue, 
cash and customer accounts.
 | We challenged management’s judgements in respect of whether in its B2B 
contracts with customers the Group was acting as a principal or an agent by 
reviewing the Group’s contractual arrangements in the context of the guidance 
in IAS 18. We also challenged the treatment of certain customer bonuses by 
considering the customer’s contractual obligations in respect of these bonuses.
 | We used analytical procedures to compare revenue to our expectations, which 
were set on the basis of our understanding of the Group and the industry. This 
enabled us to identify any unusual trading patterns and to perform additional 
substantive audit and cut-off procedures on a sample of transactions.
Regulatory and legal risks
Given the industry and jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates, as described in the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 
19, there is a risk that the Group will fail 
to obtain an appropriate licence, have an 
existing licence adversely affected or be 
subject to other regulatory sanctions. This 
gives rise to a risk over the completeness 
of provisions and disclosure of contingent 
liabilities.
 | We inquired of management and the Group’s legal advisers about any known 
instances of material breaches in regulatory or licence compliance that needed 
to be disclosed or required provisions to be recorded.
 | We challenged any provisions recorded or contingent liabilities disclosed in the 
consolidated financial statements based on the correspondence with regulators 
and any legal advice the Group has received.
 | We understood the Group’s process and related controls over the identification 
and mitigation of regulatory and legal risks, and assessed whether the controls 
are designed effectively to achieve this.
Capitalisation of development costs
The capitalisation of costs associated with 
the development of the Group’s systems, in 
accordance with the criteria set out in IFRS, 
involves significant management judgement 
and is therefore an area of focus for 
our audit. There is a risk that costs are 
capitalised inappropriately, improving the 
Group’s profitability.
 | We understood and tested the process and key controls over the Group’s 
capitalisation of internal development costs, including its payroll and purchasing 
systems.
 | For development projects capitalised in the year, we challenged whether the 
Group met the conditions set out in IAS 38 for capitalisation and tested on a 
sample basis external supplier and internal payroll costs capitalised.
Taxation
The Group operates in a number of 
countries, resulting in complexities in 
the payment of and accounting for tax. 
The Group faces a risk that given the 
international nature of its operations, 
material tax exposures may not be 
appropriately provided or disclosed in the 
financial statements.
 | We discussed with management and its legal advisers, with support from our 
tax experts, how the Group manages and controls the companies in countries in 
which it operates.
 | We obtained and read the results of the third party tax studies obtained by the 
Group and reviewed its correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, in order 
to support the tax position of the Group.
 | With support from our international tax experts we understood management’s 
interpretation and application of relevant tax law and challenged the 
appropriateness of its assumptions and estimates in relation to provisions and 
contingent liabilities.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 888 Holdings plc
Risk Response
Impairment of assets
The Group applies judgement and 
estimates in its assessment of the carrying 
value of its goodwill and other non-current 
assets. These include goodwill arising 
from previous acquisitions and capitalised 
development costs relating to activities in a 
number of jurisdictions. There is a risk that 
impairments in the value of the Group’s 
assets are not identified.
 | We challenged the inputs and assumptions to management’s discounted cash 
flow models to support its impairment tests. These included management’s 
cash flow forecasts, operating margins and long-term growth rates, which we 
compared to the Group’s historical performance and forecasting accuracy, 
and the discount rates applied in the context of externally available data and 
benchmarking studies.
 | We challenged management’s sensitivity analysis to focus on those 
assumptions to which these valuations were more sensitive and considered 
the appropriateness of the disclosures in note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements given the requirements of IAS 36.
Our application of materiality 
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$3.4 million (2013: US$4.0 million), which is approximately 5% of profit before 
tax and below 2% of equity. We used profit before tax as the basis for determining materiality as it is a key measure for the 
Group’s shareholders to assess its financial performance. This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of 
risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and 
extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that overall performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group 
should be 50% of planning materiality, namely US$1.7 million. Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that total 
uncorrected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality level.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$145,000 as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group operates from a small number of locations and as an online gaming operator the Group’s accounting is centrally 
managed. For the purposes of our Group audit, we determined that there were two components, one being a subsidiary in Israel 
and the other being the remainder of the Group. The Israeli subsidiary was subject to a full scope audit by a component team in 
Israel and the remainder of the Group was audited by the Group audit team. The components we audited therefore account for 
the entirety of the Group’s revenue, profit before tax and total assets. This provided us with an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
Audit work at the Israeli subsidiary is undertaken based on a percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for that component is based on its relative size and our view of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the 
current year the performance materiality allocated to the Israeli subsidiary was US$0.7 million.
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Gibraltar statutory audit 
partner and the UK audit partner visited the Group’s key locations, including the Israeli subsidiary, at the planning, interim and 
year end phases of the audit. During these visits the Group audit team attended audit planning and closing meetings, the Group’s 
Audit Committee meetings and conducted and reviewed audit work. For the Israeli subsidiary, in addition to the location visits the 
Group audit team reviewed key working papers and participated in the component team’s planning, including its discussion of 
fraud and error. The allocation of responsibilities between the Group audit team and the Israeli component team was such that 
the audit work on each of the areas of risk described above was led by the Group audit team.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended)
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Opinion on other matters as per the terms of our engagement with the Company 
In our opinion:
 | the information given in the Corporate Governance Report with respect to internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to financial reporting processes and share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements; and
 | the section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the basis of preparation described therein.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report and Accounts 
is: 
 | materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 | apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 | is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the Annual Report and Accounts appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 | the Company has not kept proper accounting records; or
 | if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed; or 
 | we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 | the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
The Company has voluntarily complied with, and has instructed us to review, the directors’ statement, set out on page 29, in 
relation to going concern. This statement is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority for 
premium listed UK incorporated companies.

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
1 General information
Company description and activities 
888 Holdings Public Limited Company (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) was founded in 1997 in the 
British Virgin Islands and since 17 December 2003 has been domiciled in Gibraltar (Company number 90099).  
On 4 October 2005, the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Group is the owner of innovative proprietary software solutions providing a range of virtual online gaming services 
over the internet, including Casino and games, Poker, Bingo and Emerging Offerings (mainly comprising 888’s Sportsbook), 
brand licencing revenue on third party platforms and Mytopia social games. These services are provided to end users and 
to business partners through its business to business unit, Dragonfish. In addition, the Group provides payment services, 
customer support and online advertising.
Definitions 
In these financial statements: 
The Company 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
The Group 888 Holdings Public Limited Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries Companies over which the Company has control (as defined in IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial 
Statements) and whose accounts are consolidated with those of the Company.
Related parties As defined in IAS 24 — Related Party Disclosures.
Jointly controlled 
entities As defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements.
2 Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), including International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) and Interpretations adopted by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available for sale 
investments and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars (US$ million) because that is the currency the Group 
primarily operates in. 
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended). 
The significant accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements in the prior year have been 
applied consistently in these consolidated financial statements, without any material changes. The following standards, 
interpretations and amendments, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(‘IFRIC’), have been adopted by the Group during the year with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial 
position:
 | IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 — Separate Financial Statements — IFRS 10 establishes 
a single control model that applies to all entities, including special purpose entities. As a consequence, IAS 27 was 
renamed Separate Financial Statements and has been limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled 
entities, and associates in separate financial statements. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 required management to 
reconsider which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the 
requirements that were in IAS 27. No differences were identified (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2014). 
 | IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 — Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures — IFRS 11 removes the option to 
account for jointly-controlled entities using proportionate consolidation. Instead, entities that meet the definition of a joint 
venture, based on rights to net assets only, must be accounted for using the equity method. IAS 28 has been renamed 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint 
ventures in addition to associates (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).

Financials
 | IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities — IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures required by IFRS 10, IAS 27, 
IAS 28 and IFRS 11 in one standard. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, 
associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures are also required including how the entity determines 
that it controls another entity where judgement is used (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2014). 
 | Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 — Investment Entities — These amendments provide an exception to the 
consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements. These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group qualifies 
to be an investment entity under IFRS 10 (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
 | Amendments to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — These amendments clarify the meaning 
of ’currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of 
clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively. These amendments have no impact on the Group, 
since none of the entities in the Group has any offsetting arrangements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014).
 | Amendments to IAS 36 — Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets — These amendments clarify 
the disclosure requirements in respect of fair value less costs of disposal, removing the requirement to disclose the 
recoverable amount for each cash-generating unit for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives allocated to that unit is significant. These amendments have no impact on the Group as it uses value 
in use in its impairment testing (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 | Amendments to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting — These amendments provide 
relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets 
certain criteria and retrospective application is required. These amendments have no impact on the Group as the Group 
does not apply hedge accounting (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
 | IFRIC 21 Levies — Clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as 
identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the 
interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. 
Retrospective application is required for IFRIC 21. This interpretation has no impact on the Group as it has applied 
the recognition principles under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent with the 
requirements of IFRIC 21 in prior years (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014).
The following standards, interpretations and amendments issued by the IASB or IFRIC have not been adopted by the Group 
as they were not effective for the year. The Group is currently assessing the impact these standards, interpretations and 
amendments will have on the presentation of, and recognition in, its consolidated results in future periods:
 | Amendments to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2014).
 | Amendments to IAS 1 — Disclosure Initiative (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016).
 | Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 — Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016).
 | Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 — Agriculture: Bearer Plants (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2016).
 | Amendments to IAS 27 — Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016).
 | Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 — Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016).
 | Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 — Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint 
Venture (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016).

Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and 
assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
in the future. These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, which include further 
commentary on the nature of the estimates and judgments made, can be found below: 
Revenue
The Group applies judgement in determining whether it is acting as a principal or an agent where it provides services to 
business partners through its business to business unit. In making these judgements the Group considers, by examining each 
contract with its business partners, which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is exposed 
to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing 
prices, either directly or indirectly. This is described in further detail in the revenue accounting policy set out below.
Taxation
Due to the international nature of the Group and the complexity of tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates, 
the Group applies judgement in estimating the likely outcome of tax matters and the resultant provision for income taxes. 
In making that judgement, the Group makes assumptions regarding the interpretation and application of tax laws to the 
circumstances of those specific items. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are appropriate based on its 
assessment of many factors, including past experience and these interpretations of tax law.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use 
of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. For further information see note 10. 
Internally generated intangible assets
Costs relating to internally generated intangible assets, are capitalised if the criteria for recognition as assets are met. 
The initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgment that technological and economic feasibility criteria 
are met. In making this judgement, management considers the progress made in each development project and its latest 
forecasts for each project. Other expenditure is charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which the 
expenditure is incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. For further information see note 10. 
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment in value. If the Group’s share of losses in the 
joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses. The Group 
also applies judgement in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for its share of equity contributions made by 
its joint venture partners. For further information see note 12. 
Contingent liabilities and regulatory matters
The Group makes a number of judgements in respect of the disclosure of contingent liabilities for regulatory matters. These 
are described in further detail in note 26.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are 
companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has power over an entity; 
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity; and the ability to use its power over an entity to 
affect the amount of its returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as 
control ceases. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method 
of accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and 
any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as 
goodwill. 
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using 
consistent accounting policies. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred after deduction 
of certain promotional bonuses granted to customers and after adding the management fees and charges applied to 
customer accounts, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. 
Revenue consists of income from online activities and income generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer 
deposit and withdrawals and account fees, which is allocated to each reporting segment. 
Revenue from online activities comprises:
Casino and Bingo
Casino and Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by 
customers less amounts won.
Poker 
Poker online gaming revenue represents the commission charged from each poker hand in ring games and entry fees 
for participation in Poker tournaments. In Poker tournaments entry fee revenue is recognised when the tournament has 
concluded. 
Emerging Offerings 
Revenue from Emerging Offerings is mainly comprised of Sportsbook, Social games and brand licensing on third party 
platforms.
 | Sportsbook online gaming revenue comprises bets placed less payouts to customers, adjusted for the fair value of open 
betting positions.
 | Social games revenue comprises the Group’s share from the sale of virtual goods to customers playing the Group’s 
games. 
 | Revenue derived from brand licensing on third party platforms represents the Group’s net revenue share from that 
activity.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
B2B 
For services provided to business partners through its business to business unit, the Group considers whether for each 
customer it is acting as a principal or as an agent by considering which party has the primary responsibility for providing 
the services and is exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it 
has latitude in establishing prices, either directly or indirectly
 | Where the Group is considered to be the principal, income is recognised as the gross revenue generated from use of the 
Group’s platform in online gaming activities with the partners’ share of the revenue charged to operating expenses. 
 | In other cases income is recognised as the Group share of the net revenue generated from use of the Group’s platform.
 | B2B also includes fees from the provision of certain gaming related services to partners.
 | Customer advances received are treated as deferred income within current liabilities and released as they are earned.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses consists primarily of staff costs, payment service providers’ commissions, chargebacks, commission 
and royalties payable to third parties, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs and corporate professional expenses, both of which are recognised 
on an accruals basis.
Foreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant company are 
translated into that functional currency using year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange rate differences on foreign currency 
transactions are included in financial income or financial expenses in the consolidated income statement, as appropriate. 
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US Dollars are 
translated into the presentation currency at foreign exchange rates as set out below. Exchange differences arising, if any, 
are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income. 
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet; and
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions).
Taxation 
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet 
differs from its tax base. They are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax 
assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the difference 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax 
liabilities/assets are settled/recovered.
Intangible assets 
Acquired intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately consist mainly of software licences and domain names are capitalised at cost.  
Those acquired as part of a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be 
measured reliably. These intangible assets are amortised over the useful life of the assets, which for software licences is 
between one and five years and for domain names is five years.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Internally generated intangible assets 
Expenditure incurred on development activities of gaming platform is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new 
or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and 
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent 
expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from 
the asset to which it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except 
for certain licence costs which are amortised over either the life of the licence, or up to 20 years, whichever is the shorter 
period.
Goodwill and business combinations
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration in a business combination over the Group’s interest in 
the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Consideration comprises the fair value 
of any assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated 
income statement and not subsequently reversed. Where the fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement 
on the acquisition. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited to the consolidated 
income statement. In addition, the direct costs of acquisition are charged immediately to the consolidated income 
statement.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets are assessed at each 
balance sheet date for indicators of impairment. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less 
their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7–15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually on 31 December, and where applicable an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), 
the asset is written down accordingly through the consolidated income statement. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash generating unit (i.e. the smallest group of assets to which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable and largely independent cash inflows). 
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and 
requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. 
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Group’s share of post-
acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess of the 
Group’s investment in the joint ventures are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses. 
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are recognised only to the extent of 
unrelated investors’ interests in the joint ventures. The investor’s share in the joint ventures’ profits and losses resulting from 
these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the joint ventures.
Any premium paid for a joint venture above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the joint venture. Where there is 
objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested 
for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets, and any charge or reversal of previous impairments is taken 
to the consolidated income statement.
888 Holdings AR2014 PROOF 8.indd   63 30/03/2015   11:58:20 23968.04    30 March 2015 11:56 AM     Proof 8

888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Where amounts paid for a joint venture are in excess of the Group’s share of the fair value of net assets acquired, the 
excess is recognised as negative goodwill and released to the consolidated income statement immediately.
The Group’s share of additional equity contributions from other joint venture partners is taken to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and principally 
comprise amounts due from credit card companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is 
made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence 
that the full amount may not be collected. 
Fair value measurement
The Group measures certain financial instruments, including derivatives and available for sale investments, at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. The fair value related disclosures are included in notes 24 and 25. Fair value is the price that 
would be received or paid in an orderly transaction between market participants at a particular date, either in the principal 
market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for that asset or 
liability accessible to the Group.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge 
operational risks associated with foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value 
under IAS 39 and are carried in the consolidated balance sheet as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities 
when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded 
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The inputs 
are categorised into three levels, with the highest level (level 1) given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level (level 3) given to unobservable inputs. Level 2 inputs 
are directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
Short-term investments
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an 
active market. They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. They 
are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three 
months or less. 
Equity 
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received from the issue of shares, net of direct issue costs. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Liabilities to customers 
Liabilities to customers comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ bankroll (the Group’s electronic ‘wallet’), 
including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, 
along with full progressive provision for jackpots. These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms 
and conditions.
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the 
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it 
is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity Shareholders, this 
is when declared by the Board of Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the Shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Share benefit charges 
Equity-settled
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares or options, the cost of those awards, recognised in the 
consolidated income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity, is measured with reference 
to the fair value at the date of grant. Market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at 
the date of grant. Non-market performance conditions, including service conditions, are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest. 
Cash-settled
For transactions treated as cash-settled share benefit charges, the Company recognises an expense in the consolidated 
income statement and a corresponding liability as the employees render services. 
Until the liability is settled, the Company measures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to the consolidated income statement. 
Severance pay schemes
Severance scheme surpluses and deficits are measured as:
 | The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
 | Plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value using yields available for 
the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriate to the terms of the liabilities; plus
 | Unrecognised past service costs.
Actuarial gains and losses, being any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved and any 
changes in liabilities due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Group or Company enters into financial guarantee contracts these are classified as financial liabilities and 
measured at fair value, by estimating the probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related cash outflows 
from the Group or Company.

3 Segment information
Segmental results are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team comprising mainly the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The operating segments identified are: 
 | B2C (Business to Customer): including Casino and games, Poker, Bingo and Emerging Offering; and
 | B2B (Business to Business): offering Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand. Dragonfish offers to its 
business partners use of technology, software, operations, E-payments and advanced marketing services, through the 
provision of offline/online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics.
There has been no aggregation of these two operating segments for reporting purposes. The management team continues 
to assess the performance of operating segments based on revenue and segment profit, being revenue net of chargebacks, 
payment service providers’ commissions, gaming duties, royalties payable to third parties, selling and marketing expenses.

Severance pay liability — Israel 
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in specific circumstances on leaving 
the Group. As such the Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to 
separately administrated funds. 
The current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are measured using the projected unit 
credit method, according to IAS 19 — Employee Benefits (Revised).

1. The expenses not allowed for taxation are primarily in respect of losses from equity accounted investments and 
impairment of intangible assets.
Current tax is calculated with reference to the profit of the Company and its subsidiaries in their respective countries of 
operation. Set out below are details in respect of the significant jurisdictions where the Group operates:
Gibraltar — Gibraltar companies are subject to a corporate tax rate of 10%. 
Israel — The domestic corporate tax rate in Israel in 2014 is 26.5% (2013: 25%). The Company’s Israeli subsidiary had 
entered into certain transfer pricing agreements with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner, which were effective until the end 
of 2010. The subsidiary has concluded an assessment agreement with respect to all tax years up to and including 2012. 
UK — The Group’s subsidiary in the UK pays corporate tax at the applicable rate of 21.5% (2013: 23.25%).
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
In accordance with IAS 33 — Earnings per Share, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share 
takes into account all potentially dilutive equity instruments granted, which are not included in the number of shares for 
basic earnings per share. Certain equity instruments have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their 
conditions of being issued were not deemed to satisfy the performance conditions at the end of the performance period or 
it will not be advantageous for holders to exercise them into shares, in the case of options. The number of equity instruments 
included in the diluted EPS calculation consist of 3,100,238 ordinary shares (2013: 5,143,035) and 122,228 market-value 
options (2013: 300,675).
The number of equity instruments excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 3,153,810 (2013: 2,259,924).

Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36 and the Group’s stated accounting policy an impairment test is carried out annually, at 31 
December, on the carrying amounts of goodwill and a review for indicators of impairment is carried out for other non-
current assets. Where an impairment test was carried out, the carrying value is compared to the recoverable amount of 
the asset or the cash generating unit. In each case, the recoverable amount was the value in use of the assets, which was 
determined by discounting the future cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit to their present value.
Goodwill – Bingo online business 
Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Bingo online business unit arose following the acquisition of the Bingo 
online business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009. The income 
streams generated from the Bingo online business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash 
generating unit, have been considered together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed 
to be sufficiently similar.
Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five year period, following which a long term growth rate has been 
assumed. Underlying growth rates, as shown in the table below, have been applied to revenue and are based on past 
experience, including the positive results in 2014 following the 2013 reorganisations in the B2C Bingo cash generating unit, 
and projections of future changes in the online gaming market.
The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is the Group’s specific Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital, which is considered to be appropriate for the online Bingo cash generating units.

1. The discount rate is recalculated every year by taking into account prevailing risk free rates, equity risk premium and company beta and 
having regard to external data commenting upon the Weighted Average Cost of Capital applied to the Group. 
2. Operating expenses exclude marketing costs which are included in the projections as a fix percentage of revenues.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would lead to 
impairment in the Bingo goodwill and intangible assets.
Other intangible assets 
The group performed an impairment review during the year on certain development projects that were abandoned as no 
longer expected to generate revenues. The review resulted in an impairment of US$1.7 million, as indicated in the table 
above.
Licences
No impairment tests were considered to be required at 31 December 2014 and the carrying value of other intangible assets

The following entities meet the definition of joint ventures and have been equity accounted in the consolidated financial 
statements:

AAPN Holdings LLC USA 47% 47%
AGN LLC USA 47% 47%
AAPN New Jersey LLC USA 47% 47%
USA joint ventures
On 11 March 2013 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement (‘‘JVA”) with Avenue OLG Entertainment LLC (‘‘Avenue”) 
and other minority shareholders to form AAPN Holdings LLC (‘‘AAPN”). Under the JVA the Group has a 47% interest in AAPN. 
AAPN is funded by Avenue as defined in the JVA.
AAPN New Jersey LLC (‘‘AAPN NJ”) is the entity which contracted with an Atlantic City casino licensee in connection with 
the operation of a B2C gaming offering in New Jersey (an offering which launched in November 2013). AGN LLC (‘‘AGN”) is 
the entity which contracted with a Las Vegas casino licensee in connection with the operation of a B2C gaming offering in 
Nevada (this offering has not yet launched).
On 8 July 2013, AGN obtained the required licences from the Nevada Gaming Commission enabling it to provide online 
gaming services in the State of Nevada in accordance with the stipulations of the licences.
On 8 November 2013, AAPN NJ obtained the transactional waiver by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement 
enabling it to provide online gaming services in the State of New Jersey for a period of six months from the date of the 
waiver and subject to final approval by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. On 7 May 2014, and then again on 
7 November 2014, the transactional waiver was renewed for a further period of six months.
On 21 May 2014, the Group contributed its subsidiary AAPN NJ to AAPN, in fulfilment of its prior obligation. 
On 21 May 2014 and 10 October 2014, Avenue contributed further US$15 million and US$5 million, respectively, to AAPN in 
consideration for the issuance of Class B Units. In accordance with the JVA, the Class B Units grant Avenue a priority return, 
together with interest at arm’s length rates, all of which is payable to Avenue as a preference over any distributions to 
AAPN‘s shareholders or upon liquidation of AAPN.
As at December 31, 2014, AGN remained 100% owned by the Group. However, the Group considers that due to the manner 
in which AGN is operated under the contractual arrangements in the AAPN JVA, it is regarded as a joint venture. The Group 
also has an irrevocable commitment to contribute its ownership of AGN to AAPN for no consideration upon fulfilment of 
certain conditions.
On this basis the three entities AAPN, AAPN NJ and AGN have been equity accounted for, reflecting the Group’s effective 
47% interest in their aggregated results and assets.

During 2013 the US joint ventures launched regulated licensed gaming offerings in the states of Nevada and New Jersey.  
As a result substantial marketing costs were incurred in order to facilitate the penetration into these newly opened markets.
On acquisition of the interest in AAPN, the difference of US$1.9 million between the consideration paid (of nil) and the share 
of net assets of the entity (of US$1.9 million) was accounted for during 2013 as a profit on acquisition in the consolidated 
income statement in line with IAS 31.
The Group’s share of subsequent increases in the net assets of AAPN arising from equity injections by its joint venture 
partners, amounting to US$3.8 million (2013: US$6.1 million) has been accounted for through the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
A reconciliation of the movements in the Group’s interest in equity accounted joint ventures is shown below:

13 Deferred taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Group’s deferred tax assets 
resulting from temporary differences, the majority of which are expected to be settled on a net basis, are as follows: 
2014
US$ million
2013
US$ million
Intangible assets (1.7) (1.3)

Accrued severance pay 0.4 0.4
Share benefit charges 0.1 0.1
Vacation pay accrual 0.5 0.7
Derivative financial instruments 0.3 0.4
0.5 1.2
The Group has tax losses at 31 December 2014 of US$16.1 million (2013: US$6.4 million) that are available indefinitely 
for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised in respect of these losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits against which 
these losses can be offset.

The carrying value of trade receivables and other receivables approximates to their fair value as the credit risk has been 
addressed as part of impairment provisioning and, due to the short-term nature of the receivables they are not subject to 
ongoing fluctuations in market rates. Note 24 provides credit risk disclosures on trade and other receivables.

Equity-settled share benefit charges
The Company has two equity-settled employee share incentive plans - the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the Long-
term Incentive Plan. The 888 All-Employee Share Plan is open to all employees and Executive Directors of the Group who 
are not within six months of their normal retirement age, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Awards under 
this scheme will vest in installments over a fixed period of up to four years subject to the relevant individuals remaining in 
service. Certain of these awards are subject to additional performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee 
at the dates of grant, further details of which are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 39. The  
Long-term Incentive Plan is not currently in use.

Of these grants, 50% of each are dependent on an EPS growth target, and 50% on total shareholder return (TSR) 
compared to a peer group of companies. Further details of performance conditions that have to be satisfied on these 
awards are set out in the directors remuneration report on pages 37 to 39. The EPS growth target is taken into account 
when determining the number of shares expected to vest at each reporting date, and the TSR target is taken into account 
when calculating the fair value of the share grant.

Ordinary shares granted for future vesting with EPS growth performance conditions are valued at the share price at grant 
date, which the Group considers approximates to the fair value. The restrictions on the shares during the vesting period, 
primarily relating to non-receipt of dividends, are considered to have an immaterial effect on the share option charge.
In accordance with IFRSs a charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of any shares or options granted under 
the above schemes is recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options based on the fair value of the 
shares or options at the grant date, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each balance sheet date. These charges 
have no cash impact. 
Cash-settled share-based payment
On 27 March 2012, the Company awarded its Chief Executive Officer a cash-settled share-based award (“ “Phantom Award”). 
The Phantom Award will be fully vested in three years from the grant date, provided he remains in employment with the 
Company on the third anniversary of the grant date. Under specific terms, the Phantom Award will also vest if he leaves 
employment before the normal vesting date as detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The amount payable is calculated on an incremental basis, based on the average share price of the Company over a 
period of 20 dealing days prior to the scheduled vesting date for the award. The minimum amount payable is £0.25 million 
(US$ 0.4 million) and the maximum amount payable is £5.5 million (US$8.5 million) if the share price is above £2.00.

24 Financial risk management (continued)
Capital
The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group 
is maximising shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most 
suited to the Group’s size, strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 25, there are no 
demands or restrictions on the Group’s capital. 
The main financial risk areas are as follows: 
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables, most of which are due from the Group’s payment 
service providers (‘PSP’). These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from 
customers’ virtual wallets with the Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of credit card companies. 
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group. The Group 
reduces this credit risk by: 
 | Monitoring balances with PSPs on a regular basis.
 | Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals.
 | Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
 | Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and ‘Know Your Customer’ procedures.
 | Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP and as a limit any concentration of risk.
The Group considers that based on the factors above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good 
credit quality and there is a low level of potential bad debt amounting to US$0.5 million arising from a PSP failing to 
discharge its obligation (2013: nil). This has been charged to the consolidated income statement. 
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards (‘chargebacks’) 
or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil 
their obligation to pay, which will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when 
occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for these 
eventualities by way of an impairment provision based on analysis of past transactions. This provision is set off against 
trade receivables and at 31 December 2014 was US$1.2 million (2013: US$1.2 million). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following 
prevention and verification procedures using internally-developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially-available 
third party measures.

Cash and cash equivalents 
The Group controls its cash position from its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other main locations maintain 
minimal cash balances as required for their operations. Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above,  
are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar. 
The Group holds its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with 
a low credit rating. The Group maintains its cash reserves in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors interest rates in 
order to maximise yield.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents mainly customers’ funds held in designated accounts under regulated market licence 
requirements
Short term investments
Short term investments primarily relates to deposits held by banks to support guarantees in respect of regulated markets 
licence requirements.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount of financial assets presented above, totaling US$189.6 million 
(2013: US$147.0 million).
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk exists where the Group might encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become 
due. The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its 
obligations.

Market risk
Currency risk 
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: 
 | Mismatches between customer deposits, which are predominantly denominated in US$, and the net receipts from 
customers, which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice and of which Pounds Sterling (GBP) and Euros 
(EUR) are the most significant.
 | Mismatches between reported revenue, which is mainly generated in US Dollars (USD) (the Group’s functional and 
reporting currency), and a significant portion of deposits settled in local currencies. 
 | Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including Pounds Sterling (GBP), Euros (EUR) and 
New Israeli Shekels (ILS).
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure 
is kept to an acceptable level. This includes the use of foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic 
impact of known liabilities. At 31 December 2014 the Group had open foreign exchange forward contracts between New 
Israeli Shekels and US Dollars with a principal amount of US$91 million, in respect of 2015 operational costs incurred in New 
Israeli Shekels. The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of US$2.5 million, to be settled on a monthly basis 
throughout 2015.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had foreign exchange forward contracts between US Dollars and Pounds Streling and 
between US Dollars and Euros with a principal amount of US$146 million, in respect of expected excess Pounds Sterling and 
Euros through 2014. The fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of US$4.2 million, which was settled during 2014.

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts. The 
Group arranges for excess funds to be placed in these interest bearing accounts with its principal bankers in order to 
maximise availability of funds for investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings. Given current low interest rates a 0.5% 
downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year. However,  
a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$0.6 million.
Sensitivity analysis

25 Fair value measurements
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group’s derivative financial instruments and available for sale investment are measured 
at fair value. For the remaining financial assets and liabilities, the Group considers that the book value approximates to fair 
value.
At 31 December 2014, the Group’s derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value under IAS 39 and are 
designated as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of derivative financial instruments was a liability of US$2.5 
million at 31 December 2014 (2013: a liability of US$4.2 million), determined using forward exchange rates that are quoted 
in an active market.
Other financial instruments carried at fair value are not considered material. There were no changes in valuation techniques 
or transfers between categories in the period.
26 Contingent liabilities and regulatory matters
(a) As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, it continues to 
monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take 
appropriate advice in respect of these developments. 
(b) Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received 
notices, communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect 
of its activities. The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of 
success of such actions. Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably 
any material outflow of funds that may result, if any. Accordingly, no provisions have been made. 
(c) The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Group is filing tax returns, providing for and paying 
all taxes and duties it believes are due based on local tax laws, transfer pricing agreements and tax advice 
obtained. The Group is periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities. The Board is 
unable to quantify reliably any exposure for additional taxes, if any, that may arise from the final settlement of such 
assessments. Accordingly, no additional provisions have been made.

1 General information and accounting policies 
A description of the Company, its activities and definitions are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has applied accounting policies identical to the Group’s accounting policies listed in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements, other than in relation to investments in subsidiaries, which are held at cost less any 
impairment provision required. 
Under Section 10(2) of the Gibraltar (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to 
present its own income statement. 
2 Investments in subsidiaries
The Company’s principal subsidiaries are listed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Company’s 
financial statements are held at cost less provision for any impairment. The Group applies IFRS 2 — Share-based Payment. 
Consequently, the Company recognises as a cost of investment the value of its own shares that it makes available for 
the purpose of granting share options to employees or contractors of its subsidiaries. The movement in investment in 
subsidiaries during the year was US$1.3 million (2013: US$2.7 million). Included within this were share-based payment 
charges of US$0.9 million in 2014 (2013: US$2.7 million).

The Company’s financial risk management objectives and policies are identical to those of the Group as disclosed in note 
24 to the consolidated financial statements. 
8 Contingent liabilities
The disclosures in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements are identical for the Company. 
9 Share benefit charges 
The disclosures in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements are identical for the Company except that the charge 
for the year is partly taken to investment in subsidiaries, as set out in note 2.
10 Related party transactions 
During the year the Company received dividends from its subsidiaries totaling US$60.0 million (2013: US$86.1 million) and 
paid to its shareholders dividends totaling US$51.2 million (2013: US$33.2 million). 
Share benefit charges in respect of options and shares of the Company awarded to employees of subsidiaries totalled 
US$0.9 million (2013: US$2.7 million). 
During the year subsidiaries of the Company supported it in funding US$18.8 million of the Company’s costs (2013: US$12.5 
million). At 31 December 2014, the net amounts owed by subsidiaries to the Company were US$58.1 million (2013: US$56.6 
million). 
The aggregate benefits paid to key management personnel, which the Company considers are the Directors of the 
Company, by its subsidiaries are set out below:
2014
US$ million
2013
US$ million
Short term benefits 0.2 0.2
11 Significant non cash transactions 
During the year 2013 the Company was a party to arrangements made by the Group to rationalise the intercompany 
balances within the Group. Under these arrangements certain intercompany balances were novated to and from the 
Company and its subsidiaries, and certain intercompany balances were forgiven by subsidiary companies. As a result 
movements on amounts due from and to subsidiaries of US$238 million and US$238 million respectively in the period did 
not arise as a result of cash transfers and have therefore been excluded from the Company Statement of Cash Flows.

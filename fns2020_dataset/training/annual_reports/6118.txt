CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Flying Brands delivered another good performance in 2004, with the
strategies that were planned and tested in 2003 beginning to bear
fruit. All of the Group’s four brands have been developed and
diversified significantly in the last twelve months, and we believe
that we are now much better positioned to appeal to and capture a
wider section of the market. It is also pleasing that, alongside this
overall brand development, management were able to continue
making the business as a whole more streamlined and efficient.
Profit before tax and exceptional items rose to £5.8m, an increase 
of 10% over 2003. Profit before tax increased by 4% to £5.8m.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10% to 17.30p. Earnings
per share increased by 3% to 17.30p. The improvement in profits is
attributable to an improved performance from Listen2Books, higher
interest receivable, and also further reducing overheads.
Sales were flat on the prior year, an otherwise good performance
marred by a disappointing Christmas campaign from Flying Flowers.
After an excellent first half, with many of the new initiatives
(principally diversification into new gift areas) testing well, the brand
had a soft second half, suffering from a tough retail trading
environment. Nevertheless, the strategy of positioning Flying Flowers
more as an outlet for excellent value low priced gifts is encouraging
customers to buy from us more often. Gardening Direct also had a
strong Spring campaign, allowing management to invest more in
reactivating lapsed customers in the Autumn. Listen2Books had a
very good year, increasing sales and profits, although Benham failed
to sustain the progress made in 2003. Management will only pursue
sales that are either profitable in themselves or deliver a fast return
on investment.
Continuing strong cash generation has left us with a cash balance 
of £6.02m (2003: £3.92m) on the balance sheet and our lack of
gearing leaves us in a strong position to develop our growth plans
for the business. We remain optimistic about the opportunities that
we will be pursuing in 2005 and beyond.
DIVIDEND
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.65p (2003:
5.22p). Together with the interim dividend of 2.75p (2003: 2.53p),
this will represent a total dividend of 8.40p (2003: 7.75p), an
increase of 8.4% for the year. Dividend cover is 2.06 times.
OUTLOOK
Our challenge for 2005 is to roll out successfully the new product
tested in 2004, aimed both at extending the appeal of our brands 
to a wider market, and we see continuing internet development as
being integral to this, as well as continuing to drive up frequency of
purchase from our existing customers.
We will continue to search for suitable acquisitions in the gifts, hobbies
and entertainment sectors. We are applying strict selection criteria to
ensure that the acquisition enhances shareholder value; getting it
right is more important than timing because we believe that there is
significantly more that we can achieve with our existing brands.
We expect to remain strongly cash generative, and will apply our
considerable resources to delivering greater shareholder returns.
EMPLOYEES
Our staff are the lifeblood of our business, and they can feel proud of
their achievements in 2004. Exciting times lie ahead, and I’m sure
they share my optimism for this current year and beyond.
WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED
TO CAPTURE A WIDER
SECTION OF THE MARKET
ALAN FRYER  CHAIRMAN
11 MARCH 2005 It has been a good year for Flying Brands, the most pleasing aspects
being that the plans for brand development initiated in 2003 started
to deliver positively in 2004. It has been and remains our intention
to widen the appeal of all our brands so that our existing customers
have greater choice and that a new and different type of customer
will find what we have to offer more appealing. As the cost per new
customer gradually increases from conventional print media, we see
the Internet as central to our growth plans. We are also committed
to improving the quality of our products whilst maintaining our
competitive pricing so that the businesses within Flying Brands
become synonymous with value and service.
The increase in profitability over 2003 was achieved in the face of
continuing delivery cost increases (approximately 10%); I am pleased
to report that we have negotiated a new contract with our postal
services for 2005 that will result in lower increases in this crucial
area for us.
Top line growth has proved elusive over the last two years. We have
been pursuing a deliberate policy of only chasing profitable sales by
eliminating fringe and risky new customer recruitment; however, it is
becoming increasingly expensive to recruit new customers, so it is
essential that we continue to improve customer retention (up to
53% overall in 2004 from 48% the year before) and drive up both
annual customer spend (up to £21.60 in 2004 from £19.24 in 2003)
and frequency of purchase (up from 0.79 in 2003 to 0.89 in 2004
across the whole active trading database) to offset a generally higher
recruitment cost per new customer. We were well positioned for sales
growth at the half year, but trading conditions were much tougher
in the second half, resulting in an outcome below our expectations.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
We will continue to run our core business to maximise profit growth
and cash generation, whilst ensuring that sufficient investment is
made in our existing brands to drive up longer term sales growth.
This means that we need to continue to build our active customer
database (defined as customers who have made at least one
purchase from us in the last 12 months) either through new
customer recruitment or through the reactivation of lapsed customers.
We did well in 2004: the total active database increased by 4% 
over 2003 from 894K to 932K; more importantly, customers who
ordered more than once increased by 9% from 691K to 753K,
pointing to the success both of our targeted mailings and the
deployment of our database management skills. We are finding 
that we are able to mail our best customers more often, whilst the
widening of the overall product ranges gives them more reasons 
to buy more frequently.
We recognise the growing importance of the Internet to our
business as on line sales moved from 6.5% of total revenues in
2003 to 8.1% in 2004, and total on line sales themselves increased
24%. Our brand web sites have developed to a much higher level 
of sophistication and customer involvement whilst remaining both
easy to navigate and order from. We now have over 130K e-mail
addresses, a sophisticated e-mail marketing plan and are working
hard at search engine optimisation to drive potential new customers
to our sites. Our web sites are regularly refreshed with special
seasonal offers and a more editorial approach whilst still dedicated
to driving sales.
Running in parallel with this strategy lies our commitment to make
appropriate acquisitions to drive top line and profits growth as well
as economies of scale through our infrastructure. We deliberately set
ourselves a series of strict criteria when assessing potential businesses.
This should ensure that the companies or brands that we acquire
add real value to the Group as a whole, but for which we have paid
a fair price. An acquisition is key to our overall strategy so getting it
right is more important than setting a tight timescale.
Notwithstanding these issues, we believe that the cash and profits
that we generate, linked to the potential of both the Internet and
the continuing efficiencies of our infrastructure, stand Flying Brands
in good stead. We are close to achieving what we said we were
going to with our current brands, and we are now in a much better
position to see these brands expand and attract more overall spend
and new customers.

FLYING FLOWERS
Sales were £12.8m (2003: £12.8m) with a contribution of £4.1m
(2003: £4.2m) and a contribution margin of 32% (2003: 33%).
Internet sales increased by 13% to £1.62m, representing 13% of
total sales (2003: 12%).
Flying Flowers remains the UK’s leading postal delivered bouquet
business, despatching nearly 1m bouquets a year. Although
predominantly active around the peaks of Valentine’s Day, Mother’s
Day and especially Christmas, we have managed to increase our
activity at other times of the year, with Easter, for instance,
emerging as an important marketing opportunity. We are continuing
to seek out more promotional occasions through the year and have
increased the number of mailings our best customers receive from
eight to ten. The number of active customers who have bought
from Flying Flowers more than once increased in 2004 by 5% over
prior year, and 40 new products were introduced (46% of the total).
Our Mother’s Day promotion won the Direct Marketing Association’s
“People’s Choice” mail order award for creativity and responsiveness.
Although Flying Flowers had a disappointing Christmas campaign in
2004, the rest of the year was the best the brand has experienced for
some time, with positive sales growth across all other areas of activity.
KELVEDON PARK CALL CENTRE PACKING FLOWERS IN JERSEY
The success of the brand outside of Christmas was driven by 
several factors:
• Giving customers reasons to buy flowers throughout the year
• Introducing a lower (£9.99) price point
• Introducing new bouquets and flower varieties
• Successful diversification into other low price gift products
• Creating different and more relevant offers to different 
customer segments
• Better management of new customer recruitment and old
customer reactivation
• More dynamic on line presence
• Improving quality (reduced customer complaints)
• Encouraging growth of our guaranteed delivery date Ultimate offer
The new gift types (pot plants, personalised teddy bears, wine gift
sets) lifted response and we will be promoting these (together with
new gift products) alongside our flower bouquets as a unified
catalogue in 2005.
The web site is regularly updated to offer special seasonal bouquets
and suggest relevant and up to the minute reasons for giving gifts at
different times of the year. Our intention is to create an exciting gift
solution site.

OUR GROWING FACILITIES IN JERSEY
GARDENING DIRECT
Sales increased to £15.2m (2003: £14.8m). Considerable investment
was focused on the Autumn campaign to reactivate lapsed customers
which both drove top line sales as well as the size of the active
customer database going into 2005, increasing by 4%. Despite this,
contribution still improved to £5.3m (2003: £5.2m). Contribution
margin was 35% (2003: 35%), and Internet sales grew by 47%,
which now represents 6% of total sales (2003: 4%).
Gardening Direct is the UK’s largest home delivery provider of
bedding plants, which we grow (over 120m per year) in our two
nurseries on Jersey. We work hard to ensure that our quality is of
the highest standards, a fact that was recognised by Gardening
Which where our products and service received very high positive
recognition in all categories. We are constantly testing new varieties
and looking to assist home gardeners of all types in delivering
beautiful borders, hanging baskets and flower beds. 2004 saw 
170 new products launched, which amounted to 49% of the total.
We also realise that customers expect us to provide excellent value
for money, which is why we cut many of our prices in 2004. As a
result the number of units despatched to our existing customers
increased by 14% over 2003, and overall customer retention
improved from 43% in 2003 to 51% in 2004. Spend per customer
also increased from £17.22 to £20.54.
2004 was the first year where Gardening Direct offered a
comprehensive Internet service. We have made the site much easier
to navigate, have introduced special offers and a customer
preference listing. With over 40K e-mail addresses, we also are able
to send out tactical promotions at different stages of the season.
We are working hard to increase sales of non plant gardening
products (hardware, accessories and gifts) which now account for
more than £0.5m in revenue. This demonstrates our commitment to
expand the Gardening Direct franchise to serve our existing customers
better, as well as attract new ones to grow the brand profitably.

LISTEN2BOOKS
Sales for Listen2Books increased to £3.5m, up from £3.4m in 2003,
with contribution increasing to £0.5m (2003: £0.2m). On line sales
increased by 26%, with on line now representing 9% of total sales
compared to 7% in 2003.
The brand has enjoyed a good year and has emerged as a significant
player in the audio book market place. New product introductions
(340 audio, video and DVD titles in 2004), many of which were
either exclusive or backed up by editorial support, have ensured that
customer spend has increased from £20.87 in 2003 to £25.10 in
2004. The active trading database increased by 7%, with customers
who buy more than once growing by 22%.
In addition during 2004, we successfully introduced CDs as an
alternative format to cassettes (approximately 50% of all titles
featured are dual format but this is increasing all the time) and have
seen a 25% take up of CDs where they have been offered. We
believe that this will widen the appeal of the brand to a younger
market. We also tested 52 video/DVD titles (of similar genre to our
core audio books offer) in the autumn and these were sufficiently
promising for us to integrate video/DVD within the main audio
catalogue from January 2005.
The web site is now far more dynamic and offers visitors the
opportunity to download samples of many audio books as a ‘taster’
to help the uninitiated understand just how good and easy to use
audio books really are. We feature a Best Sellers section driven by
actual sales, new releases changed weekly and recommendations
based on previous customers’ purchases.
Diversification into other home entertainment areas such as video
and DVD will both grow the brand more quickly and create a
rounded offer that should have a wider appeal than merely audio
books themselves. NEW INITIATIVES AT
BENHAM WILL IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE

FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
BENHAM
Benham experienced a tough year, with sales of £4.1m (2003: £4.8m)
and profit £0.15m (2003: £0.24m). 2004 did not provide as many
new product opportunities as 2003 (such as the Queen’s Jubilee or
Rugby World Cup).
During the second half of 2004, we successfully installed a mail order
fulfilment system at Benham which will enable us both to run the
brand far more closely alongside our other businesses and also
provide us with management information to develop Benham far
more proactively. We also anticipate establishing an improved web
site in 2005: we believe that Benham products are ideally suited to
be traded on line.
In 2004, we migrated much of Benham’s stock to a new despatch
facility at our headquarters in Jersey, which will also give us much
greater control over this critical aspect of its business.
Coupled to these developments, we have reviewed our overall
product strategy and will be looking to create more opportunities
for our existing customers both to buy more and to spend more.
These combined actions should result in Benham returning to
growth in 2005.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS
We have continued to improve the overall efficiency of our
operations, which have been streamlined by moving order inputting
to Kelvedon Park (our call centre in Essex), alongside our telephone
handling division. This will help reduce the under capacity in
Kelvedon as well as centralising all packing and despatch operations
in Jersey, where a high level of expertise is being developed.
The second phase of the three year renovation project at Retreat Farm
in Jersey (our headquarters and fulfilment centre) was completed in
2004. We created a larger storage and despatch area for
Listen2Books and Gardening Direct hard goods, and a despatch
centre for Benham. These developments not only anticipate the
growth in gardening hard goods, audio books, video and DVD, 
but also anticipate an acquisition when the time comes. In addition,
we cultivated a “trial garden” to assess how new Gardening Direct
plants progress in “customer conditions”, which also enables us to
manage our own photography for promotion. The final phase, to 
be completed in 2005, will focus mainly on the replacement of the
refrigeration units, essential in prolonging the longevity of Flying
Flowers’ stems. The current units have reached the end of their
useful lives; there will also be the conversion of the remaining glass
panes to polycarbonate which are safer, longer lasting and allow for
constant temperature through the seasons. 10
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
We are also beginning the process of phasing out the use of
polystyrene despatch boxes on Flying Flowers in favour of cardboard.
Not only is this more environmentally friendly, it allows a partial
rebranding, better reflecting where the brand is today and also
enables us to prepare for the introduction of Royal Mail’s “size based
pricing” policy which may be introduced from the middle of 2006.
The Marketing Department has now been reorganised into brand
focused teams, served by a central database function, and we have
seen clear benefits in the approaches being taken to increasing the
brands’ franchises and in targeting our offers more effectively.
OUTLOOK
Flying Brands has many strengths:
• Market leading strong brands
• Increasing Internet presence
• Highly cash generative
• Very profitable (whether measured against revenue or 
capital employed)
• Progressive dividend policy
• Strong balance sheet
• Efficient operations with flexible infrastructure
• Currently debt free and no pension liabilities
• Significant freehold property portfolio
In developing this business to increase the value for shareholders,
we intend to build on these strengths:
• Widen the appeal of our existing brands, offering 
greater choice/value
• Embrace the Internet as the major growth opportunity
• Add brands and services to our portfolio to become a 
rounded retailer
• Increase cash and profits generation
• Maintain a progressive dividend policy
• Continue to improve operational efficiencies
• Accept debt for acquisitions but to a prudent level
I believe that we have a major opportunity, given the strength of our
current position, to become a much more significant retail presence
and really provide our shareholders with increasingly better returns.
We will do this sensibly and in line with our strategy, but we are
committed to achieving it.
I would like to thank the team at Flying Brands for their tenacity,
creativity and hard work during 2004: I know that our shareholders
appreciate their efforts.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
INTERNET SALES
INCREASED BY 22% RESULTS
The Group has had another successful year of profit growth, with
profit before tax up by 4.2% and profit before exceptional items up
10.3%. Last year’s profit before tax included a £0.31m exceptional
profit on the sale of subsidiaries and businesses and freehold property.
This is the fourth consecutive year of strong growth in profit before
exceptional items. 
Flying Flowers sales were flat, and there was a small reduction in
contribution arising from discounting to reactivate old customers
and higher postage costs. Gardening Direct was able to achieve
modest sales growth while also increasing contribution, and
Listen2Books had a significant increase in contribution as we
continued to maximise payback of the investment made in the
brand since 2001.
Overheads came down by £0.30m, of which £0.24m related to
reduced depreciation on our call centre systems.
Benham had a disappointing year with profits down from £241k to
£154k. It has been a year of great change for Benham, with the
implementation of a fully integrated direct marketing solution in Q4
and migration of its despatch operation to Jersey. 
Corporate overheads comprise the cost of the Chief Executive and
Finance Director, the Non Executive Directors and the legal,
professional and other fees connected with the running of a public
company. These reduced by £0.1m, following the one off costs in
2003 connected with the board restructure that took place in the
latter part of 2002.
CASH FLOW
The net cashflow from operating actitives was £6.75m compared to
£7.69m in 2003. This reduction was due to a fall in depreciation and
amortisation charges of £0.29m, and a net movement of £1.08m in
working capital.
The increase in working capital arose from an increase in Listen2Books
stock to support the expanded range of products now offered to
our customers, and the impact of our major supplier now applying
normal payment terms.
Tax paid was £0.05m lower than last year and capital expenditure
reduced by £0.02m. Receipts from sales of capital expenditure
reduced by £0.30m following last year’s sale of a freehold property.
Last year also had the benefit of the settlement of the outstanding
debtor relating to the sale of a subsidiary in 1999, which contributed
£0.50m to cashflow.
The Group repurchased 496,980 of its own shares at an average
price of £2.01p. The special resolution to authorise the Group to be
enabled to buy its own shares is included in the AGM notice
enclosed with this Report.

FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
The Group made dividend payments of £2.06m. Dividend cover is
2.06 times which the Board believes is a sensible and sustainable level.
The combined impact of these cashflows was a net increase in cash
of £2.10m, compared to an increase of £2.73m in 2003, taking the
net cash position of the group to £6.02m.
TREASURY POLICY
The Group’s financial position has changed considerably in the 
last few years. 
2000 2001 2002 2003 2004
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Net (debt)/funds (4,744) (2,352) (98) 3,920 6,022
It is the group’s policy to take a conservative stance on treasury matters
and maximise cash generation. This is tied to our strategy which
aims to utilise cash generated to acquire complementary businesses.
We recognise that cash does not provide a satisfactory return to
shareholders, no matter how well it is managed, but we believe it is
in the best interests of shareholders to retain a large proportion of
it, as we look to make acquisitions in the next 12 months.
There is little currency risk in the group. The majority of the Group’s
overseas purchases are hedged using forward contracts for up to
80% of the forecast requirement.
The cashflow profile of the Group is very seasonal but as in 2003,
no bank facility is required. Where possible, cash is placed on
deposit for periods of no greater than two months, which again is 
in accordance with our strategic objectives.
TAXATION
The Group pays taxation in Jersey and the UK depending on the
domicile of its respective subsidiaries. The taxation charge for 2004
is 23.2% (compared to 21% in 2003). The increase in average rate
of taxation was due to the non taxable nature of the exceptional
items last year, without which the average rate of taxation in 2003
was 22.2%.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS 
The Group has carried out a detailed review of the implications of
the mandatory introduction of International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”). Because of the relatively uncomplicated nature
of the Group’s financial structure and lack of borrowings, the 
Group considers that the only material impact will arise from 
the implementation of IFRS2, Share based payments, specifically
regarding the recognition of a charge to the profit and loss account
to reflect the cost of share option grants. The Group is currently
considering the implication in practice of the application of this
standard, and will be incorporating its effect into its Interim 
results in 2005.

FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2004.
INCORPORATION
The Company is incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands.
DIRECTORS‘ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year, and of the Group profit or loss for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable United Kingdom accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud,
error and non compliance with law and regulations.
Although an overseas company, the Directors have sought to ensure that the financial statements of the Company and the Group comply
materially with the disclosure requirements of the UK Companies Act 1985 and the listing requirements for a UK company.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activities of the Group are unchanged from last year being volume mail order and collectables retailing.
BUSINESS REVIEW AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
A commentary of the Group's progress during the year and its future prospects are set out in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive's
Statements on pages 3 to 10 and the Financial Review on pages 11 to 12.
FLYING BRANDS HOLDINGS (UK) PLC
During 1996 the Group created a twinned share structure to enable UK based shareholders to receive a UK dividend and thereby avoid being
double taxed on the Jersey dividend. Consequently all shareholders hold in addition to their shares in Flying Brands Limited an equivalent
number of shares in Flying Brands Holdings (UK) PLC.
Although the results for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2004 of Flying Brands Holdings (UK) PLC are included in the consolidated
financial statements of Flying Brands Limited, in accordance with UK Company Law a separate set of financial statements for Flying Brands
Holdings (UK) PLC will be sent to shareholders.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The Group profit on ordinary activities before taxation amounted to £5.81m (2003: £5.58m). 
An interim dividend of 2.75p was paid in 2004 (2003: 2.53p).
The Directors recommend a final cash dividend for the year of 5.65p per ordinary share (2003: 5.22p).
Subject to the approval of members at the Annual General Meeting the dividend will be paid on 20 April 2005 to shareholders on the
register on 29 March 2005.
The retained profit for the financial year amounted to £2.30m (2003: £2.40m).
DIRECTORS
The Directors of the Company at the end of the year are shown on page 13. Mr DC Harbord, Mr MTN Dugdale and Mr LM Sanderson retire
by rotation, and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. The service contracts of all directors are noted in the remuneration
committee report on pages 40 to 43.
Biographical details of the Directors are given on page 13.

DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company at 31 December 2004, together with their interests at 2 January 2004 are shown
in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 40 to 43.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the share capital of the Company and the movements during the year, are set out in Note 21 to the accounts.
The Directors’ interests in share options are set out within the Remuneration Committee Report on page 43.
Apart from service contracts none of the Directors had a material interest in any contract of significance to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries was a party during the financial year.
POLICY ON PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
It is Group policy, in respect of all of its suppliers, to settle the terms of payment when agreeing each transaction, to ensure that suppliers are
made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by those terms. In general the Group pays creditors at the end of the month following
date of invoice. The average number of creditor days in relation to trade creditors outstanding at the year end was 44 days.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Company did not make any political or charitable donations during the year.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
No value is attributed in the Balance Sheet to the Group's brand names or its extensive databases of customers.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
As at 28 February 2005, other than the Directors‘ holdings noted above, the Company was aware of the following interests in 3% or more
of its issued share capital:
Sussex Research Limited: 3,615,999 (13.7%)
Fidelity International Limited and Mr Edward C Johnson 3rd: 851,600 (3.2%)
PURCHASE OF SHARES 
The company purchased 496,980 of it own shares having a nominal value of £4,970 for a total consideration of £999,990. This represents
1.9% of the company’s issued share capital. The shares were purchased because the directors were of the opinion that the purchase of its
own shares at an average price of £2.01p per share would enhance shareholder value.
EMPLOYEES
The Company‘s policy is to provide equal opportunities to all present and potential employees, including, where practical, those who are disabled.
There is regular communication with staff at all levels. Staff are kept informed of performance and objectives of the Group throughout the
year through their line managers, staff meetings and the Interim and Annual published results.
SECRETARY
The Secretary of the Company is Mr D C Harbord ACA who had been Secretary for the entire year.
AUDITORS
Following the conversion of our auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers to Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) from 1 October 2004,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned on 22 October 2004 and the directors appointed its successor, PricewaterhouseCoopers CI LLP , as auditors.
A resolution to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers CI LLP as auditors to the company will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
CORPORATE GOVERNACE
The board is committed to ensuring the highest standards of corporate governance, and endorses with a small number of exceptions listed
below, the supporting principles and provisions set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of the Financial Reporting Council
(“the Code”) which came into effect for financial years beginning after 1 November 2003. 
The Company has regularly updated its corporate governance policies and procedures to reflect the changes made to corporate governance
guidelines in the last few years. The following describes the ways in which the Company complies with the detailed provisions of the Code. 
It includes full disclosure of the limited number of areas in which the Company is non compliant, and explanations as to why this is so.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board meets at least eight times a year and currently comprises three Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors.

The Non-Executive Directors meet once a year to review the performance of the Executive Directors. The performance of the Chairman is
reviewed informally on an annual basis by the other Non-Executive Directors, and in particular by the Senior Non-Executive Director. The
performance of the other Non-Executive Directors is reviewed informally by the Chairman on an annual basis. The Non-Executive Directors
have agreed to formalise these processes in 2005, to set objectives and appraise performance annually. 
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are described in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 40 to 43, and are
made available for inspection at the AGM, along with the service contracts for the Executive Directors. None of the Non-Executive Directors
has a fixed term of office in his letter of appointment. The Company has agreed a policy that Non-Executive Directors will not exceed six
years in their role from the date of the board restructuring in March 2002 other than in exceptional circumstances.
The letter of appointment of the Chairman provides that he spends up to thirty and no less than twenty five days per year in the
performance of his duties. 
RE-ELECTION
The Articles of Association require each Director to retire and submit himself for re-election every three years, but also that at least one third
of the Directors must be submitted for re-election every year. As a result of these provisions and the number of Directors this normally means
that Directors retire and submit themselves for re-election every two years. 
On an annual basis, the Chairman considers the performance of the board and discusses with the Company Secretary the re-election process.
Given the continued success of the Company the Chairman has confirmed that those Directors being submitted for re-election in 2005 (as set
out on page 14) continue to be highly effective, qualified and committed to their respective roles.
BOARD OBJECTIVES
The key objectives of the Board are as follows:
• The agreement of strategy
• The agreement of the detailed set of objectives and policies that facilitate the achievement of strategy
• Monitoring the performance of executive management in the delivery of objectives and strategy
• Monitoring and safeguarding the financial position of the Company to ensure that objectives and strategy can be delivered
• Approval of major capital expenditure and other expenditure that is not part of the defined objectives or strategic plan
• Approving corporate transactions – this includes any potential acquisition or disposal
• Delegating clear levels of authority to the executive management team. This is represented by the defined system of internal controls which
is reviewed by the Audit Committee
• Providing the appropriate framework of support and remuneration structures to encourage and enable executive management to deliver
the objectives and strategies of the Company
• Monitoring the risks being entered into by the Company and ensuring that all of these are properly evaluated
• Approval of all external announcements
DIRECTORS’ AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED 17
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
DIRECTORS’ AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
A schedule is maintained of matters reserved for Board decision.
The Board met eight times in 2004 and each Director attended every meeting during the year with the exception of Paul Fraser who attended
seven meetings but was unable to attend the meeting in December. 
For each Board meeting, each board member receives a full pack of required information, including financial reports, detailed project updates
and a formal agenda together with any relevant documentation. This pack is circulated a number of days in advance of the meeting. 
INSURANCE COVER
The Company maintains cover of £5m to cover its Directors and officers against the cost of defending themselves against civil legal
proceedings taken against them. To the extent permitted by law the company also indemnifies its Directors and officers. Neither protection
applies in the event of fraud or dishonesty.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee meets once a year unless an exceptional need arises in relation to a matter of board appointment. Terms of
reference for the Nominations Committee do not exist because of the relatively low number of board appointments. On an annual basis the
Board considers the need to introduce formal terms of reference. Succession planning is considered in depth during the annual strategy
review by the Board. In the event of a new board appointment the Nominations Committee defines a job description and manages the
process by which a suitable individual is chosen.
No formal induction process exists for new Directors, but the Chairman ensures that each individual is given a tailored introduction to the
Company and the requirements of the role.
APPRAISAL OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chief Executive carries out an annual formal appraisal of the performance of the other Executive Directors which takes into account the
objectives set in the previous year and the individual’s performance in the fulfilment of these objectives. No formal appraisal has taken place
of the Chief Executive, however this process has now been put in place for 2005. The Chief Executive is given a formal schedule of objectives
on a bi-annual basis and progress against this is monitored by the Chairman. All the appraisals of the Executive Directors will be provided to
the Remuneration Committee.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The report of the Remuneration Committee is included on pages 40 to 43. Formal terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have
been documented and are made  available for review at the AGM. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Formal terms of reference for the Audit Committee have been documented and are made available for review at the AGM.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee include the following requirements:
• To monitor the integrity of financial statements and of any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance
• To review the Company’s internal controls and risk management systems
• To make recommendations to the Board in relation to internal control matters that need improvement or modification
• To make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and to approve
remuneration
• To establish whistle blowing procedures. These were set up and communicated in 2004
No internal audit function exists due to the size of the Company. This is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee which reflects on any
increased risk or regulatory changes in the period under review in making their recommendation to the Board.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee does not have any direct, recent or relevant accountancy experience but the Board considers that he
has sufficient business experience to enable him to perform the role. 
The Company engages its auditors for some non audit services, including advice on taxation and VAT. The Audit Committee is satisfied that
the provision of these services does not compromise the independence of the auditors. The extent of these fees are documented in note 5 
of the annual report.
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year. In addition to the two Non-Executive Directors, the external auditors and 
Finance Director are invited to attend part of the meetings where relevant. 18
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
DIRECTORS’ AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of internal control is
formally documented and is designed to ensure effective and efficient operations and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Such a
system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is designed to manage, rather
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
The Finance Director carries out a six monthly formal review of the Company’s system of internal controls and risk management systems. This
review is formally circulated to the Board and discussed as an agenda item. The Audit Committee raises any particular concerns relating to
internal controls and risk management systems and on occasion requires independent review of particular issues for its committee meetings.
On advice from the Audit Committee, the Board does not consider any additional independent verification of the system of internal control
to be required, on the basis of the size of the Company and the non complex nature of both its management systems and financial structure.
DIALOGUE WITH MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS
The Company places considerable importance on communications with shareholders. Regular meetings take place with major shareholders
with the Company delegating authority to the Chairman, CEO and Finance Director to present the strategy and financial results of the
Company. Major shareholders are made aware that the Senior Non-Executive Director is also available should they wish to communicate
directly with him but none have yet taken advantage of this provision.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
At its AGM the Company complies with the provisions of the Code relating to the disclosure of proxy votes, the separation of resolutions and
attendance of directors, particularly committee chairmen. The timing of the despatch of the formal notice of the Annual General Meeting
also complies with the Code.
STATEMENT ON GOING CONCERN
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, confirm that they believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

1  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain freehold land and
buildings and in accordance with accounting standards currently applicable in the United Kingdom. The Directors consider that the
accounting policies set out below are suitable, have been consistently applied, and are supported by reasonable judgements and estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. The results
of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of
their acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra-Group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation, and all sales and profit figures relate to external transactions only.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value of goods supplied and is stated net of VAT. Turnover is recognised at the date of despatch of goods to
customers. Any refunds or replacements are recognised in the period in which the refund or replacement is made. Credit card commission and
the cost of overseas bouquets are treated as costs of sales.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Purchased goodwill is capitalised, classified as an asset and amortised over its estimated useful economic life. The gain or loss on the disposal
of a subsidiary or associated undertaking is calculated by comparing the carrying value of the net assets sold (including any unamortised
goodwill) with the proceeds received. Prior to 1998 the Group’s policy was to write off goodwill in the year of acquisition to the profit and
loss account reserve. Any permanent diminution in value is recognised by immediate write-off through the profit and loss account.
Other intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives ranging from 5 to 7 years.
Tangible fixed assets
Interest in land and buildings is stated at cost or valuation. The group has taken advantage of the transitional provision available under 
FRS 15 (Tangible Fixed Assets) which allows for the book value of the freehold land and buildings to be ‘frozen’ and treated as historic cost.
Freehold land and buildings were last revalued for the purpose of the financial statements on 1 July 1993. Fixed assets held under finance
leases are stated at the present value of the minimum lease payments due at the inception of the lease, or at fair value where this is
considered a sufficiently close approximation to present value. Other tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase price, including any
incidental expenses of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the net book value of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, on a straight line
basis, over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
%
Freehold land and buildings, including glasshouses 0 – 4
Plant and equipment 10 – 20
Computer hardware, included in plant and equipment 20 – 33
1
/3
Motor vehicles, including tractors 15 – 25
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
1  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Stock
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general, cost is determined on a first in first out basis and includes transport
and handling costs. Net realisable value is the price at which stocks can be sold in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs
of realisation. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Included within goods held for resale are certain First Day Cover stocks. These stocks are valued as a proportion of their anticipated realisable
value, as a best estimate of the lower of cost and net realisable value, based on the expert opinion of the Group’s philatelists. Provision is
made for slow moving stock.
Prepayments
The seasonality of the business at Gardening Direct means that certain external costs relating to order processing and marketing for the
Spring season are included in prepayments.
Marketing expenditure
The Group charges external campaign marketing expenditure to the profit and loss account in the accounting period in which the related
sales campaign takes place. Any losses on recruitment sales are taken to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Finance leases
Where fixed assets are financed by entering into leasing agreements, which transfer to the lessee substantially all benefits and risks of
ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and are included in tangible fixed assets, and the capital element of the
leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements;
the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit, in proportion to the
reducing capital element outstanding. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the estimated
useful lives of the assets.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling when the transaction was entered into.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet
date. Exchange gains or losses are included in operating profit. The results of subsidiary undertakings denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for tax purposes.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences arising from the different treatment of items for accounts and taxation proposes,
calculated at rates at which it is estimated that tax will arise. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to some employees’ and Directors’ personal pension plans which are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Accounting policies
There was only one change to accounting policy in the year which was to record sales for the Flying Flowers brand on a basis consistent with
other brands. The change in policy means that credit card commission and the costs of overseas bouquets are treated as a cost of sales rather
than as a deduction from turnover. The effect of this in 2004 was to increase turnover and cost of sales by £0.55m. The effect on 2003 was
to increase turnover and cost of sales by £0.58m.

11  EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust which have not vested unconditionally to the
employee and are accordingly ignored for this purpose.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares. The Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to
employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.

were sold in 2000.

hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies (Jersey) Law. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
or if information specified by the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises the chairman’s statement,
the chief executive’s report, the financial review, the directors’ and corporate governance report, and the remuneration committee report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group at 31 December 2004
and of the profit and cash flows of the group for the year then ended in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards and have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
The Remuneration Committee presents its report for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2004.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
At 31 December 2004, the Remuneration Committee is comprised of Mr LM Sanderson (Chairman) and Mr THS Trotter, the two independent
Non-Executive Directors on the Board.
The Committee makes its decisions following consultation with the Chief Executive and the other Non-Executive Directors. No other third
parties have provided advice that materially assisted the Remuneration Committee during the year.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors with the exception of the Chairman, is determined by the Board. 
COMPLIANCE
The Company has complied materially with The United Kingdom Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”). 
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the
Company. The vote will have advisory status, will be in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages and will not 
be specific to individual levels of remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Remuneration Committee seeks to provide the remuneration packages necessary to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of
the quality required to manage the business of the Group and seeks to avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose. In establishing
the level of remuneration of each Director the Committee has regard to packages offered by similar companies. 
Consistent with this policy, the benefit packages awarded to Executive Directors comprise a mix of performance and non-performance
elements. The proportion of each Executive Director’s pay that is based on performance ranges from 45% for the Chief Executive if the
Group achieves a 15% increase in adjusted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”), to 45% for each of the other Executive Directors if the Group
achieves an 18% increase in adjusted profit before taxation over the prior year. 
The main components of the remuneration packages for Executive Directors are:
a) Contracts
All Executive Directors have a one-year rolling service contract and contractual termination payments in all cases equal the value of Director’s
annual salary together with benefits and accrued bonus.
b) Basic salary and benefits
Salaries and benefits are approved annually. Basic benefits include a fully expensed company car together with private medical insurance,
death in service cover and PHI.
c) Bonuses
There are 2 separate bonus schemes.
The Chief Executive has a contractual scheme that is based on the increase in adjusted EPS over the prior year. Payments start at the level of
20% of salary for the achievement of 5% plus the increase in the retail price index for the year (“RPI”) over prior year, and increases at 2.5%
for each additional 1% increment in EPS. The maximum payment under the scheme is 45% for achievement of 15% plus RPI of adjusted EPS
above prior year.
The other two Executive Directors also have contractual schemes based on an increase in adjusted  profit before taxation. These payments
commence at a payment of 10% of salary for achievement of an 8% increase in adjusted profit before taxation and increases up to a
maximum of a 45% bonus for an increase of 18% in adjusted profit before taxation over the prior year.
d) Share Option Schemes
Awards of Share Options to Directors and senior employees have been made in the past as an incentive to improve the Group’s performance. 
The original scheme was set up in 1993 for a period of 10 years and no further options can now be granted under that scheme. Exercise of
options granted under the 1993 scheme are subject to a performance condition. The condition is that an average annual increase in the
adjusted EPS in excess of 5% plus RPI must have been achieved during any consecutive three year period prior to the date of exercise of the
option, with the first year commencing no earlier than the financial year ending in the 12 months prior to the date the option was granted.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 41
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
A new scheme was set up in 2004 for a period of 10 years. Exercise of options granted from 2004 are subject to a performance condition.
The condition is that the average annual increase in the adjusted EPS in excess of 5% plus RPI must have been achieved in the 3 years
following the date of the grant of the option.
e) Pensions
Executive Directors select a money purchase scheme and the company makes a payment of 9% of salary, excluding bonus and benefits, per
year to the chosen scheme.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
As required by the Regulations the graph below shows the performance of Flying Brands Limited, measured by total shareholder return (total
share price growth plus dividends paid), against a ‘broad equity market index’ over the past five years. We have chosen the All Share Index
because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which Flying Brands Limited is a member.
The Group has performed ahead of the All Share Index since the demerger of Stanley Gibbons Group Limited in September 2000.

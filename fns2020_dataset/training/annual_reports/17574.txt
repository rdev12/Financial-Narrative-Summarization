Notes to members
1.	 A 	member	entitled	to	attend	and	vote	at	the	meeting	is	also	entitled	to	appoint	one	or	more	proxies	to	attend	and,	on	a	poll,	vote	instead	of	him.	 The	proxy	need	not	 be	a	member	of	the	Company.
2.	 T o	be	ef fective,	the	instrument	appointing	a	proxy	and	any	authority	under	which 	it	is	executed	(or	a	notarially	certified	copy	of	such	authority)	must	be	deposited	at

time	for	holding	the	meeting.	 A	form	of	proxy	is	enclosed	with	this	notice.	Completion	and	return	of	the	form	of	proxy	will	not	preclude	shareholders	from	attending	and	 voting	in	person	at	the	meeting.		 3.	 In	accordance	with	Regulation	41	of	the	Uncertificated	Securities	Regulations	2 001,	only	those	members	entered	on	the	register	of	members	of	the	Company	as	at	
10	a.m.	on	5	December	2007	shall	be	entitled	to	attend	or	vote	at	the	meeting	in	respect	of	the	number	of	shares	registered	in	their	name	at	that	time.	Changes	to	
entries	on	the	register	of	members	after	this	time	shall	be	disregarded	in	determining	the	rights	of	any	person	to	attend	or	vote	at	the	meeting.		 Explanation of special business at the Annual General Meeting
Resolution	6	(authority	to	allot)	proposed	as	an	ordinary	resolution	would	give	the	directors	authority	to	allot	shares	up	to	a	maximum	nominal	amount	of	£61,758.74	 representing	one	third	of	the	Company’ s	current	issued	share	capital.

a)	 in	respect	of	the	whole	of	the	authorised	but	unissued	share	capital	in	connection	with	an	offer	to	existing	shareholders	in	proportion	to	their	existing	holdings	save	 that	the	directors	are	allowed	to	offer	shares	to	existing	shareholders	otherwise	than	strictly	in	proportion	to	their	holdings	where,	for	example,	overseas	regulations	 make	it	difficult	to	of fer	shares	pro	rata	to	existing	overseas	shareholders	or	when	dealing	with	fractions	of	shares;	and
b)		 up	to	a	nominal	amount	of	£9,263.81	representing	5%	of	the	current	issued	sha re	capital	of	the	Company	(to	give	the	directors	some	flexibility	in	financing	business	
opportunities	as	they	arise).

Revenues	have	consistently	grown	since	 2003.	2006	increased	substantially	 because	of	the	success	of	the	Middle	 East	 operations	 and	 the	 continual	 growth	 of	the	UK	operations.	In	2007	we	have	 built	on	the	success	achieved	in	2006	 both	in	the	UK	and	the	Middle	East.	 O p e r a t i n g	p r o fi t	h a s	i n c r e a s e d	o v e r	t h e		 5	y e a r	p e r i o d .

been	an	excellent	one	for	YouGov	with	 organic	development	and	acquisitions	 	 both	leading	to	strong	growth	in	turnover	 a n d	p r o fi t s .
Group	turnover	for	the	year	has	increased	 by	51%	to	£14.3m	(against	£9.5m	last	 	 y e a r ) .	P r o fi t	b ef o r e	t a x	a n d	a m o r t i s a t i o n	o f	
goodwill	was	up	39%	at	£5.7m	(£4.1m	last	 year).	Our	headline	earnings	per	share	grew	 36%	to	6.1p	from	4.5p.

YouGov	 serves	 its	 clients	 by	 providing	 research	 insights	 ranging	 from	 changing	 consumer	 opinions	 towards	 brands	 to	 voting	 intentions	 in	 elections	 and	 attitudes	 towards	 social	 and	 commercial	 issues.	 Over	 the	 past	 12	 months	 we	 have	 increased	 our	 range	 of	 clients,	 broadened	 the	 number	 of	 services	 we	 have	 on	 offer	 and	 extended	 our	 geographical	 reach.	 YouGov	 has	 been	 one	 of	 the	 most	 successful	 pioneers	 of	 internet	 based	 r e s e a r c h 	 a n d 	 t h i s 	 i s 	 r e fl e c t e d 	 b y 	 t h e 	 h i g h	
demand	 for	 our	 products	 and	 services	 and	 	 by	 the	 interest	 shown	 by	 potential	 recruits.
Following	our	expansion	during	the	last	year	 and	the	recent	post-balance	sheet	events	 we	now	operate	through	strong	subsidiary	 companies	in	Europe,	North	America	 	 and	the	Middle	East	which	will	allow	us	 	 to	meet	increasingly	multi-national	 requirements	of	our	clients.
Building a stronger business
In	the	past	year	we	have	focused	on	 international	growth	and	strengthening	 	 our	product	offering.
We	 successfully	 integrated	 the	 Siraj	 business	 w h i c h 	 w e 	 a c q u i r e d 	 o n 	 3 0 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 6 .		 In	 December	 2006,	 we	 acquired	 an	 initial	 32%	 (£3.8m)	 stake	 in	 our	 associate	 	 business	 Polimetrix,	 based	 in	 Palo	 Alto	 	 and	 Washington,	 USA.
In	March	2007	we	launched	a	new	joint	 venture	YouGovCentaur,	a	50:50	joint	 venture	with	Centaur	publishing,	with	33	 t i t l e s	( i n c l u d i n g :	T h e	L a w y e r ,	T h e	E n g i n e e r	
etc)	to	create	a	new	UK	based	market	 research	agency	with	a	focus	on	the	 business-to-business	sector.	 In	April	2007	we	announced	YouGovStone,	 a	5 1 %	j o i nt	v e nt u r e	w i t h	L o n d o n ’ s	‘ Q u e e n		 of	Networking’	Carole	Stone,	weaving	 prominent	 social	 and	 industry	 commentators	 into	specialist	opinion	leader	panels.	 In	addition	we	announced	the	creation	of	 YouGovAlpha,	the	vehicle	we	have	created	 to	service	clients	in	the	investment	industry,	 following	the	mutually	agreed	disbanding	 	 of	YouGovExecution	by	YouGov	and	 Execution,	the	50:50	joint	venture	partners.

Executive	 Chairman’s	 role	 at	 a	 time	 when	 the	 Company	 is	 in	 such	 robust	 good	 shape	 and	 with	 such	 exciting	 prospects.
Panos	 Manolopoulos	 has	 taken	 on	 the	 role	 	 of	 Managing	 Director	 International	 Business	 Development	 and	 for	 the	 time	 being	 his	 position	 as	 Managing	 Director	 of	 YouGov	 UK	 i s 	 be i n g 	 fi l l e d 	 b y 	 o u r 	 C E O 	 N a d h i m 	 Z a h a w i .
Recent events
O n 	 2 7 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 7 	 w e 	 a n n o u n c e d 	 t h e 	 fi r s t		 in	 a	 series	 of	 transactions;	 our	 German	 expansion	 through	 the	 acquisition	 of	 psychonomics	 AG.	 This	 was	 followed,	 post	 year	 end,	 when	 we	 made	 the	 decision	 to	 acquire	 the	 remaining	 68%	 stake	 in	 Polimetrix,	 o u r 	 U S 	 a s s o c i a t e 	 a n d 	 a c q u i r e d 	 Z a p e r a , 	 a	
business	 based	 in	 several	 countries	 in	 Scandinavia.	 These	 acquisitions	 have	 been	 funded	 through	 a	 share	 placing,	 which	 our	 shareholders	 approved	 on	 3	 September	 2007.	 These	 acquisitions	 will	 allow	 us	 to	 accelerate	 our	 growth	 and	 are	 consistent	 with	 the	 strategy	 we	 outlined	 this	 time	 last	 year	 when	 we	 started	 the	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Group.
Future prospects and outlook
Following	the	successful	acquisitions	in	the	 USA,	Germany	and	Scandinavia,	our	focus	 is	on	the	integration	of	these	businesses	 into	our	Group,	and	the	development	of	 Group	wide	systems	and	products.
We	also	have	numerous	organic	growth	 opportunities	to	pursue	across	the	 	 enlarged	Group	and	will	continue	to	 	 look	at	complementary	acquisitions	 	 that	meet	our	strict	criteria.	 T h e	c u r r e nt	fi n a n c i a l	y e a r	h a s	s t a r t e d	w e l l	
and	trading	is	in	line	with	the	Board’s	 e x p e c t a t i o n s .	A s	a	r e s u l t	w e	a r e	c o n fi d e nt	
that	2007/08	will	be	another	successful	year	 for	YouGov.
Conclusion
We	have	many	exciting	opportunities	ahead	 of	us	and	we	have	a	growing,	talented	and	 energetic	team	of	individuals	driving	and	 supporting	the	Group’s	development.	 I	take	this	opportunity	on	behalf	of	the	Board	 to	thank	all	of	our	teams	for	their	hard	work	 and	I	look	forward	to	our	continued	success	 i n	t h e	y e a r	t o	J u l y	2 0 0 8 .

Google	 tops	 the	 BrandIndex	 Top	 100	 table	 with	 phenomenally	 high	 scores	 across	 the	 board	 in	 all	 seven	 criteria.	 But	 in	 the	 spring	 	 of	 2006,	 the	 picture	 looked	 like	 it	 might	 be	 	 a	 rather	 different	 one,	 with	 Google’s	 scores	 plummeting	 in	 Buzz	 and	 also	 dropping	 in	 Corporate	 Reputation	 and	 General	 Impression.	 Google’s	 potentially	 catastrophic	 decision	 to	 bow	 to	 Chinese	 government	 pressure	 and	 produce	 a	 censored	 version	 of	 its	 search	 engine	 for	 China	 was	 at	 that	 point	 causing	 something	 of	 a	 consumer	 backlash.

down	 in	 all	 7	 of	 the	 criteria	 which	 go	 to	 make	 up	 the	 overall	 BrandIndex.	 General	 Impression	 is	 down	 a	 massive	 7	 points	 to	 +61,	 Buzz	 down	 4	 points	 to	 +32	 and	 Corporate	 Reputation	 down	 5	 points	 to	 +41.	 Perhaps	 more	 worrying	 for	 Google’s	 top	 management	 will	 be	 the	 news	 that	 its	 Quality	 score	 is	 down	 5	 to	 +51	 and	 its	 Recommend	 score	 –	 based	 on	 how	 many	 people	 would	 recommend	 it	 to	 others	 –	 is	 down	 6	 to	 +60.
Having	 said	 that,	 Google	 still	 tops	 the	 table	 in	 Buzz,	 General	 Impression,	 Recommend	 and	 Satisfaction	 categories.	 Its	 lowest	 position	 is	 for	 Quality,	 where	 	 it	 is	 ranked	 4th,	 down	 2	 places	 from	 2005.
The	 truth	 seems	 to	 be	 that	 if	 a	 brand	 is	 strong	 enough,	 	 it	 can	 ride	 out	 problems	 –	 to	 a	 certain	 degree,	 at	 least.	 Given	 the	 strength	 of	 Google’s	 scores,	 the	 world’s	 favourite	 search	 engine	 seems	 capable	 of	 surviving	 just	 about	 anything,	 right	 now.	 It	 has	 become	 such	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 UK	 consumers’	 lives	 –	 consumers	 who	 are	 online,	 at	 least	 –	 that	 they	 can	 forgive	 a	 lot,	 so	 long	 as	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 service	 it	 delivers	 remains	 high.

Q&A
How would you summarise the achievements 
of 2006/07?
This	year	has	been	a	period	of	considerable	organic	growth,	with	 the	integration	of	our	acquisition	of	Siraj,	our	Dubai	based	research	 agency	into	our	existing	operations	and	continued	growth	in	the	 	 UK.	We	have	also	been	busy	in	the	search	for	new	partners	in	 	 our	priority	hubs	in	different	regions	around	the	world.	We	took	our	 initial	stake	in	Polimetrix	in	December	2006	and	have	cemented	 	 our	investment	post	year	end	by	acquiring	the	balance.	We	have	 also	expanded	through	acquisition	into	Germany,	the	2nd	largest	 European	research	market	and	also	into	Scandinavia.	We	are	now	 focused	on	integrating	these	great	agencies	into	the	enlarged	 YouGov	Group.
You utilise the joint venture model more than 
your competitors. Why is this?
We	 have	 always	 been	 both	 prudent	 and	 opportunistic	 in	 our	 approach	 to	 new	 ventures.	 We	 utilise	 the	 joint	 venture	 vehicle	 where	 we	 believe	 t h a t 	 t h e r e 	 i s 	 a 	 t r u e 	 b e n e fi t 	 f r o m 	 t e a m - w o r k i n g 	 w i t h 	 o u r 	 p a r t n e r s . 	 W e		 do	 not	 enter	 joint	 ventures	 lightly,	 and	 we	 believe	 that	 the	 partnerships	 we	 have	 developed	 are	 important	 for	 wider	 strategic	 reasons.	 The	 l o w e r 	 l e v e l 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 i n v e s t m e n t 	 i n 	 j o i n t 	 v e n t u r e s 	 a l l o w s 	 u s 	 t o 	 p u r s u e

During	 2006/07	 we	 set	 up	 2	 new	 joint	 ventures:
YouGovCentaur	–	focusing	on	B2B	research	leveraging	 Centaur’s	active	readership	base.
YouGovStone	–	converting	Carole	Stone’s	30,000	panel	to	an	 online	opinion	formers	panel.
What is the outlook for the market research 
sector?
Global	market	research	turnover	grew	to	approximately	$24.6bn	in	 2006	(up	5.1%	on	2005)	and	is	expected	to	reach	$25.5bn	in	2007	 (up	3.7%	on	2006).	63%	of	global	market	research	turnover	is	 controlled	by	the	top	25	global	market	research	agencies.	However,	 organic	growth	(excluding	acquisitions)	within	these	agencies	 stands	at	only	1.7%.	This	trend	is	expected	to	continue	in	2007	 	 and	2008	which	points	to	the	competitive	performance	of	medium-
s i ze d ,	s m a l l e r	‘ b o u t i q u e ’	a g e n c i e s	f o c u s e d	o n	s p e c i fi c	m e t h o d s		 (i.e.	online	or	qualitative),	industry	sectors	or	research	types	 	 (e.g.	brand),	analytics	and	consultancy	services.

Has your mission changed since the

Our	mission	remains	the	same,	to	be	the	leader	and	innovator	in	 online	research.	Our	recent	corporate	activity	is	a	stepping	stone	 	 to	creating	an	integrated	global	online	research	business.

How are you different from competitors?
YouGov	remains	the	only	market	research	company	to	employ	 panel	recruitment	methods	that	ensure	we	can	robustly	represent	 our	communities,	as	well	as	continually	testing	our	accuracy	 	 against	real	outcomes.	This	is	essential	if	the	client	is	to	have	 c o n fi d e n c e	i n	t h e	q u a l i t y	o f	t h e	d a t a .	
Unlike	other	agencies,	we	don’t	regard	online	as	merely	another	 data	collection	platform	–	we	see	it	as	a	tool	for	understanding	 people’s	opinions	and	behaviours	in	a	way	that	is	different	and	 better	than	that	afforded	by	conventional	methodologies.	 YouGov	emphasises	innovative	product	design	that	leverages	the	 c o s t	e f fi c i e n c y	o f	t h e	o n l i n e	m e t h o d o l o g y ,	g e n e r a t i n g	d a t a	a n d	
insights	with	real-time	applications,	essential	for	today’s	fast-
changing	markets.
Now	 that	 YouGov	 has	 global	 reach,	 we	 believe	 we	 can	 offer	 a	 depth,	 accuracy	 and	 speed	 of	 service	 beyond	 that	 of	 our	 competitors.

YouGov	 retains	 substantial	 intellectual	 capital,	 not	 only	 in	 terms	 of	 our	 unique	 technological	 solutions,	 but	 also	 in	 our	 methodology.	 We	maintain	an	ongoing	programme	of	 research	and	development	and	investment	 in	our	intellectual	capital.

YouGovCentaur	will	focus	on	the	lucrative	 area	of	specialist	panels	from	lawyers	to	 engineers	and	marketeers.	We	will	engage	 with	 these	 audiences	 so	 as	 to	 provide	 clients	 with	an	in	depth	research	and	product	 portfolio	that	meets	their	business	needs.	 YouGovStone	focuses	on	opinion	leader	 research.	More	and	more	companies	 	 and	organisations	are	seeking	ways	of	 understanding	how	opinion	leaders	affect	 the	world	we	live	in.
	 Following	the	year	end,	we	announced	that	 we	have	concluded	our	joint	venture	with	 Execution,	YouGovExecution,	and	launched	 YouGovAlpha,	YouGov’s	100%	subsidiary	to	 take	primary	research	for	the	investment	 community	forward.

competitive	 remuneration	 structure	 to	 maintain	 the	 high	 calibre	 of	 its executive board. The Committee believes that maintaining the 
Company’s business growth and profit record requires an overall 
compensation	 policy	 with	 a	 strong	 performance-related	 element.
The main components of the Executive Directors’ 	 remuneration	 are:
1. Basic salary
	 Basic	salary	for	each	Director	is	determined	by	the	 Remuneration Committee taking into account the 
performance	of	the	individual	and	external	market	data.	 	 The Committee’s policy is to review salaries annually.
2. Share options
 The Company believes that share ownership by non-
business	owner	executive	Directors	strengthens	the	link	 between	their	personal	interests	and	those	of	the	 shareholders	in	respect	of	shareholder	value.	 Directors’ service contracts
On 18 April 2005 the Company entered into a service 
agreement	with	Peter	Kellner.	The	contract	provides	for	Peter	to	 act as the President of the Company, working four days a week 
at a salary of £138,000 per annum. The contract has no fixed

Financial Officer of the Company working 5 days a week on a 
salary of £95,000 and the contract is terminable by 12 months’ 
notice	in	writing	by	either	party.

on 30 days’ notice from either party. Peter receives a fee of 
£23,000	per	annum.
Anthony Foye is engaged by the Company as a Non-Executive 
Director	on	the	terms	of	a	letter	of	appointment	dated	1	March	 2005 for an initial fixed term of 3 years and terminable on 	 30 days’ notice from either party. Anthony receives a fee of 
£23,000	per	annum.

any earlier financial year and which remains in any aspect 
outstanding	or	unperformed.

The Board
At 31 July 2007 the Board consisted of 5 Executive Directors 
and 3 Non-Executive Directors, including a senior Non-
Executive Director. The names of the Directors and their 
respective	responsibilities	are	shown	on	pages	14	and	15.
The	Board	operates	both	formally,	through	Board	and	 Committee meetings, and informally, through regular contact 
amongst	Directors.	High	level	decisions	on	such	matters	as	 strategy, financial performance and reporting, dividends, risk 
management,	major	capital	expenditure,	acquisitions	and	 disposals are reserved for the Board or Board Committees. 	 For its regular formal meetings, the Board receives appropriate 
information	in	advance	from	management.
The	 Directors	 can	 obtain	 independent	 professional	 advice	 at	 the	 Company’s own expense in performance of their duties as Directors.
The	Board	formally	approves	the	appointment	of	all	new	 Directors.	All	Directors	are	required	to	submit	themselves	for	 	 re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment	and	subsequent	to	this	at	the	Annual	General	 Meeting	on	a	rotational	basis,	which	ensures	that	each	Director	 is	submitted	for	re-election	approximately	every	3	years.	 Proposals to re-elect Directors are set out in the Directors’ 
Report	on	pages	16	and	17,	and	in	the	Notice	of	Annual	 	 General	Meeting	on	page	48.

Shareholder communications
The Board’s assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects are set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 3 
and the Chief Financial Officer’s Report on pages 12 and 13.
The Executive Directors meet regularly with institutional 
shareholders to discuss the Company’s performance and 	 future	prospects.	At	these	meetings	the	views	of	institutional	 shareholders	are	canvassed	and	subsequently	reported	back	 	 to	the	Board.	The	Annual	General	Meeting	is	used	as	a	forum	 for	communication	with	private	shareholders.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The	Board	considers	that	the	Group	continues	to	work	hard	 towards compliance with the Combined Code. Full compliance 
has not yet been achieved and the Board and Audit Committee 
monitor the Company’s compliance on a regular basis. YouGov 
does not need to comply with the Combined Code due to 	 being	listed	on	the	AIM	Index.	The	Directors	have	completed	 	 a	detailed	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	systems	of	internal	 control, including financial, operational, compliance and risk 
management.	This	assessment	has	resulted	in	a	detailed	action	 plan, which is substantially implemented. We continue to work 
towards	full	compliance.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the 2 Non-Executive Directors, 
Anthony Foye (its Chairman) and Peter Bazalgette. All members 
of the Committee have relevant financial experience due to the 
senior	positions	they	hold	or	have	held	in	the	past.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on any matters in 
respect	of	which	it	considers	that	action	or	improvement	is	 needed,	and	makes	recommendations	as	to	the	steps	to	be	 taken. In particular the Committee is responsible for:
ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is 
properly	monitored	and	reported;
monitoring the formal announcements relating to financial 
performance;
meeting	the	auditors	and	agreeing	audit	strategy;
reviewing	reports	from	the	auditors	and	management	relating	 to	accounts	and	internal	control	systems;	and
making	recommendations	to	the	Board	in	respect	of	external	 auditor	appointment	and	remuneration.
The	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 internal	 control	 systems	 is	 under	 constant	 review	 and	 a	 formal	 assessment	 of	 internal	 controls	 has	 commenced.	 The	 audit	 committee	 will	 monitor	 the	 implementation	 of	 a	 series	 of	 detailed	 steps	 to	 improve	 the	 control	 environment.	 Although	 there	 was	 no	 formal	 internal	 audit	 during	 the	 year,	 the	 accounting	 functions	 were	 subject	 to	 periodic	 internal	 review.	 As	 the business continues to grow we keep the Group’s need for an 
internal	 audit	 function	 under	 constant	 review.
Key controls and procedures
The	Board	maintains	full	control	and	direction	over	appropriate	 strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues, and 
has put in place an organisational structure with defined lines of 
responsibility	and	delegation	of	authority.
The	 annual	 budget	 and	 forecasts	 are	 reviewed	 by	 the	 Board	 prior	 to approval being given. This includes the identification and 
assessment	 of	 the	 business	 risks	 inherent	 in	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 media sector as a whole along with associated financial risks.

Corporate Governance
Report 	 www.yougov.com	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 21
The system of internal financial control is designed to provide 
reasonable,	but	not	absolute,	assurance	against	material	 	 misstatement	or	loss.	The	key	procedures	include:
detailed	budgeting	programme	with	an	annual	budget	 approved	by	the	Board;
regular	review	by	the	Board	of	actual	results	compared	with	 budget	and	forecasts;
regular	reviews	by	the	Board	of	year	end	forecasts;
establishment	 of	 procedures	 for	 acquisitions,	 capital	 expenditure	 and	 expenditure	 incurred	 in	 the	 ordinary	 course	 of	 business;
detailed	budgeting	and	monitoring	of	costs	incurred	on	the	 development	of	new	products;
reporting	to,	and	review	by,	the	Board	of	changes	in	 legislation	and	practices	within	the	sector	and	accounting	 and legal developments pertinent to the Company; and
appointing experienced and suitably qualified staff to take 
responsibility	for	key	business	functions	to	ensure	 maintenance	of	high	standards	of	performance.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee also undertakes a formal assessment of 
the auditors’ independence each year which includes:
confirmation of the auditors’ objectivity and independence in 
the provision of non-audit services to the Company by the use 
of	 separate	 teams	 to	 provide	 such	 services	 where	 appropriate;
discussion	 with	 the	 auditors	 of	 a	 written	 report	 detailing	 relationships with the Company and any other parties that 
could	 affect	 independence	 or	 the	 perception	 of	 independence;
a review of the auditors’ own procedures for ensuring 
independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved in 
the	 audit,	 including	 the	 regular	 rotation	 of	 the	 audit	 partner;	 and
obtaining written confirmation from the auditors that, in their 
professional	judgement,	they	are	independent.
Any analysis of the fees payable to the external audit firm in 
respect	of	both	audit	and	non-audit	services	during	the	year	 	 is	set	out	in	Note	1	to	the	accounts.
Risk management
The	Board	reviews	risks	facing	the	business	on	a	regular	 	 basis.	The	following	paragraphs	demonstrate	the	key	areas	 	 of identified risk. 
Early stage of development – Although the Company has 
grown	substantially	since	it	was	formed	7	years	ago,	it	remains	 a	relatively	small	company	in	an	early	stage	of	development.	 The Company faces competition from both large established 
international	companies	as	well	as	small	local	businesses	 operating	in	the	same	sector.
Middle East – We now undertake business in the Middle East 
region. This exposes the Group to currency risk, inflationary risk 
and	political	instability	risk.	In	addition,	we	have	a	concentration	 of revenue in a small number of high value contracts. We 
manage	those	risks	by	investing	in	the	local	currency	of	Dubai	 and by having influential local partners. We keep abreast of the 
local	political	situation.
Projected growth – The Company’s plans incorporate 
substantial	growth	in	the	coming	years.	This	growth	will	be	 	 in	part	dependent	on	the	marketing	and	research	budgets	 	 of	target	clients	over	which	YouGov	has	little	control.	 •
•
•
•
•
•

•
Competition	 –	 YouGov	 has	 developed	 an	 internet	 based	 research	 strategy	 which	 other	 large	 and	 established	 research	 organisations	 are also beginning to adopt. Some of these more established 
research	 organisations	 have	 well	 developed	 brands	 and	 substantial	 resources	 and	 may	 be	 able	 to	 use	 these	 to	 compete	 very	 effectively	 in	 developing	 online	 panels	 and	 competing	 software.
Staff – The success of YouGov will be influenced by the 
recruitment and retention of high calibre staff. Senior staff 	 that	manage	key	client	relationships	and	those	with	software	 expertise	are	particularly	important	to	the	continuing	 development and smooth running of the Company. To mitigate 
this	risk,	YouGov	is	building	account	and	project	management	 teams	for	key	clients	and	larger	research	projects.	In	this	way	 the	client	relationship	and	project	related	knowledge	are	shared	 among	a	number	of	individuals	rather	than	concentrated	with	 	 1	person.
Internationalisation	 –	 YouGov	 now	 has	 wide	 geographical	 spread. Monitoring and reporting these businesses’ performance 
relies	 upon	 the	 operation	 of	 key	 controls.	 There	 is	 a	 risk	 that	 these	 controls	 may	 not	 operate	 effectively	 in	 each	 jurisdiction.
Acquisitions	 –	 The	 Directors	 plan	 to	 expand	 and	 develop	 	 the	 business	 through	 a	 strategy	 of	 targeted	 acquisitions.	 The	 	 risk	 exists	 that	 integration	 of	 any	 acquired	 business	 will	 be	 unsuccessful	 or	 that	 key	 employees	 or	 clients	 of	 the	 acquired	 business	 will	 be	 lost.	 Directors	 will	 attempt	 to	 mitigate	 this	 risk	 by	 careful	 due	 diligence	 and	 communication	 with	 the	 clients	 of	 target	 companies. The Directors will also seek to communicate YouGov’s 
strategy	 to	 staff	 and	 ensure	 that	 levels	 of	 remuneration	 and	 benefits are appropriate to retain key employees.
The Company may be unable to agree suitable terms with the 
shareholders	of	a	target	company	and	be	forced	to	abandon	an	 attempted	takeover.	This	may	happen	after	management	have	 invested significant amounts of time and effort as well as 
accruing advisers’ fees.
Integration risk – We have invested in 3 new businesses 
during the 2006/07 financial year. There is a risk that our 
integration plans fail or are delayed. We have mitigated this risk 
through	the	appointment	of	a	specialist	integration	manager.
Technology and risk	 –	 A	 strong	 software	 platform	 is	 essential	 for	 carrying	 out	 online	 research.	 This	 software	 must	 be	 reviewed	 and	 updated	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 to	 ensure	 that	 it	 does	 not	 become	 superseded	 by	 newer	 technologies	 in	 other	 companies.	 YouGov	 has	 sought	 to	 remain	 competitive	 in	 this	 area	 by	 recruiting	 an	 experienced	 team	 of	 software	 specialists	 with	 responsibility	 for	 developing the proprietary software systems. Employees in this 
area must provide 3 months’ notice on departure and YouGov 
has developed a succession planning document with sufficient 
detail	 on	 the	 structure	 of	 proprietary	 software	 applications	 and	 the	 IT	 infrastructure	 to	 assist	 in	 an	 orderly	 transition	 period	 in	 the	 event	 of	 staff	 leaving.	 A	 disaster	 recovery	 plan	 is	 in	 place	 and	 is	 reviewed by the Audit Committee annually.
Chairman’s commitments – Our Chairman is engaged as 
Executive Chairman for Media Square plc. This consumes 	 a substantial amount of Roger Parry’s time, but this time 
commitment does not interfere with Roger’s ability to be 	 Non-Executive Chairman for YouGov plc. 22	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 www.yougov.com
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	preparing	the	annual	report	 and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 	 the Directors have elected to prepare financial statements 	 in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 	 The financial statements are required by law to give a true 	 and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group as at the end of the financial period and of the profit 	 or	loss	of	the	Group	for	that	period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required	to	select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	 them	consistently:
make	judgements	and	estimates	that	are	reasonable	and	 prudent;	and
state	whether	applicable	accounting	standards	have	been	 followed,	subject	to	any	material	departure	disclosed	and	 explained in the financial statements prepare the financial 
statements	on	the	going	concern	basis,	unless	it	is	 inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	Group	will	continue	 	 in	business.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	proper	accounting	 records	which	disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	 the financial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 	 with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence	for	taking	reasonable	steps	for	the	prevention	and	 detection	of	fraud	and	other	irregularities.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	and	integrity	 of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements	may	differ	from	legislation	in	other	jurisdictions.
In	so	far	as	the	Directors	are	aware:	there	is	no	relevant	audit	 information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
the	Directors	have	taken	all	steps	that	they	ought	to	have	taken	 to	make	themselves	aware	of	any	relevant	audit	information	and	 to	establish	that	the	auditors	are	aware	of	that	information.

Account, the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised 
Gains and Losses, the Group Consolidated and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
and notes 1 to 26. These financial statements have been 
prepared	under	the	accounting	policies	set	out	therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985.	Our	audit	work	has	been	undertaken	so	that	we	might	 state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To	the	fullest	extent	permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	or	 assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report,	or	for	the	opinions	we	have	formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in	 accordance	 with	 United	 Kingdom	 law	 and	 Accounting	 Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance 
with	 relevant	 legal	 and	 regulatory	 requirements	 and	 International	 Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 and	 whether	 they	 have	 been	 properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information 
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that specific information presented in: the Chief 
Financial Officer’s Report that is cross referred from the 
financial summary section; the Chairman’s Report that is cross 
referred	from	the	future	developments	and	the	post	balance	 sheet	events	sections;	the	key	performance	indicators	that	is	 cross	referred	from	the	key	performance	indicators	section;	and	 the Corporate Governance Report that is cross referred from 
the financial risks section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not	kept	proper	accounting	records,	if	we	have	not	received	all	 the	information	and	explanations	we	require	for	our	audit,	or	if	 information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and	other	transactions	is	not	disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ 
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, 
the	 key	 performance	 indicators,	 the	 Questions	 and	 Answers,	 the	 Chief Financial Officer’s Report, the Remuneration Report and the 
Corporate Governance Report. We consider the implications for 
our	 report	 if	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	 misstatements	 	 or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities	 do	 not	 extend	 to	 any	 other	 information.
Report of the Independent Auditors 
to the Members of YouGov plc
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices	Board.	An	audit	includes	examination,	on	a	test	basis,	 of	evidence	relevant	to	the	amounts	and	disclosures	in	the	 financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in 
the preparation of the Group’s and parent company financial 
statements,	and	of	whether	the	accounting	policies	are	 appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently	applied	and	adequately	disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 	 the	information	and	explanations	which	we	considered	 necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 	 to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 	 are	free	from	material	misstatement,	whether	caused	by	 	 fraud	or	other	irregularity	or	error.	In	forming	our	opinion	 	 we	also	evaluated	the	overall	adequacy	of	the	presentation	 	 of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In	our	opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	 Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s and 
Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2007 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable	United	Kingdom	accounting	standards	and	under	the	 historical	cost	convention.
The	principal	accounting	policies	of	the	Group	have	been	 applied	consistently	in	dealing	with	items	which	are	considered	 material in relation to the Group’s financial information. 
The	principal	accounting	policies	of	the	Group	have	remained	 unchanged except for the adoption of Financial Reporting 
Standard 20 ‘share-based payments’. 
The impact of the change in accounting policy relating to FRS 
20 has been reflected in the profit and loss account and did not 
give	rise	to	a	material	charge.	A	prior	year	adjustment	has	not	 been	made	as	the	adjustment	was	not	material.	The	change	in	 policy did not result in any change in shareholders’ equity.
The	impact	of	the	revision	of	an	accounting	estimate	under	 	 FRS 10 is disclosed under the heading ‘goodwill and intangible 
fixed assets’.
Consolidation policy
The	Group	reports	its	interests	using	the	acquisition	method	of	 consolidation	and	combines	all	of	the	assets,	liabilities,	income	 and	expense	with	the	equivalent	items	in	the	consolidated	 financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
The	minority	interests	in	the	net	assets	of	the	consolidated	 subsidiary are identified separately from the Group’s equity 	 and	consist	of	the	amount	of	those	interests	at	the	date	of	the	 original	business	combination	plus	their	share	of	changes	in	 equity	since	that	date.
A	joint	venture	is	a	contractual	arrangement	whereby	the	Group	 and	other	parties	undertake	an	economic	activity	that	is	subject	 to	joint	control	whereby	the	strategic	and	operating	policy	 decisions	require	the	unanimous	consent	of	the	parties	sharing	 control.	The	arrangements	the	Group	has	entered	into	involve	 the	establishment	of	a	separate	entity	in	which	each	venturer	 has	an	interest.	The	Group	reports	its	interest	using	the	gross	 equity	method.
Investments	in	associated	undertakings	are	carried	in	the	 consolidated balance sheet at the Group’s share of their net 
assets	at	the	date	of	acquisition	and	of	their	post-acquisition	 retained profits or losses together with any goodwill arising on 
the acquisition, net of amortisation. The investors’ share of the 
results is included within the consolidated profit and loss.
Turnover
Turnover	is	the	total	amount	receivable	by	the	Group	for	 services	provided,	excluding	VAT	and	trade	discounts.	Revenue	 is recognised on the date on which the delivery of findings is 
presented	to	a	customer.	 Where a contract extends over an accounting period, revenue is 
recognised	 on	 a	 proportion	 of	 completion	 basis.	 Amounts	 invoiced	 in	advance	are	recorded	as	deferred	revenue	and	are	released	 to	revenue	upon	the	stage	of	completion	of	the	contract.
BrandIndex	contracts	are	for	a	period	of	12	months.	Revenue	 	 is	recognised	in	equal	instalments	over	the	contract.	 Polling fees
The Company invites Polling Club members to fill out polls for 	 a	cash	incentive.	Although	these	amounts	are	not	paid	until	 	 a predetermined target value has accrued on a Polling Club 
member’s account, an assessment of incentives likely to be 
paid	is	made	and	is	recognised	as	a	cost	of	sale	in	the	period	 	 in	which	the	service	is	provided.	 Investments
Investments	are	included	at	cost	less	amounts	written	off.	 	 The	carrying	value	is	considered	annually	by	the	Directors	 	 in	comparison	against	the	potential	net	realisable	value.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and 
any	provision	for	impairment.
Depreciation	is	calculated	to	write	down	the	cost	less	estimated	 residual value of all tangible fixed assets by annual instalments 
over	their	estimated	useful	economic	lives.	The	rates	generally	 applicable	are:
Leasehold	 property	 and	 improvements	 on	 a	 	 straight-line 	 basis	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 	 10%
Fixtures and fittings on a reducing balance basis  25%
Computer software and hardware on a straight-line 	 	 basis	 	 	 10%–33%
Motor	 vehicles	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 	 25%
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new 
business	 application	 software	 and	 which	 are	 incurred	 during	 the	 period	 prior	 to	 the	 date	 the	 software	 is	 placed	 into	 operational	 use are capitalised as software development costs. External 
costs	 and	 internal	 costs	 are	 capitalised	 to	 the	 extent	 they	 generate future economic benefit for the business, whilst internal 
costs	 are	 only	 capitalised	 if	 they	 are	 incremental	 to	 the	 Group.	 Once	 the	 new	 business	 application	 software	 is	 operational,	 these	 costs	 are	 transferred	 to	 computer	 software	 and	 hardware	 costs	 and	 depreciated	 at	 the	 rate	 set	 out	 in	 the	 above	 table.
Leased assets – operating leases
Operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on 
a	straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term.
Leased assets – finance leases
Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance leases and hire 
purchase	 contracts	 are	 capitalised	 at	 the	 estimated	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 inception of the lease or contract. The total finance charges are 
allocated	 over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 lease	 or	 contract	 in	 such	 a	 way	 as	 to	 give	 a	 constant	 periodic	 charge	 on	 the	 outstanding	 liability.
Principal Accounting
Policies 	 www.yougov.com	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 25
Deferred taxation
Deferred	tax	is	recognised	on	all	timing	differences	where	the	 transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to 
pay	more	tax	in	the	future,	or	a	right	to	pay	less	tax	in	the	future,	 have	occurred	by	the	balance	sheet	date.	Deferred	tax	assets	 are	recognised	when	it	is	more	likely	than	not	that	they	will	be	 recovered.	Deferred	tax	is	measured	using	rates	of	tax	that	 have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	by	the	balance	 sheet	date.	The	deferred	tax	provision	is	held	at	its	current	 value	and	not	discounted.
Retirement benefits
The Company did not operate a pension scheme during the period.
Foreign currencies
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 exchange	 rate	 ruling	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 rates	 of	 exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The financial 
statements	 of	 foreign	 subsidiaries	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 rate	 	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 exchange	 differences	 arising	 from	 the	 retranslation	 of	 the	 opening	 net	 investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to reserves. Where 
exchange	 differences	 result	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 foreign	 currency	 borrowings	 raised	 to	 acquire	 foreign	 assets	 they	 are	 taken	 to	 reserves	 and	 offset	 against	 the	 differences	 arising	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 those	 assets.	 All	 other	 exchange	 differences	 are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to profits in the period in 
which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific 
projects	are	recognised	to	the	extent	that	they	comply	with	 	 the requirements of SSAP 13 i.e. when recoverability can 	 be	assessed	with	reasonable	certainty	and	amortised	in	line	 with	the	expected	sales	arising	from	the	projects.	All	other	 development	costs	are	written	off	in	the	year	of	expenditure.
Goodwill and intangible fixed assets
Goodwill	arising	on	consolidation	represents	the	excess	of	 	 the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	given	over	the	fair	values	 	 of the identifiable net assets acquired.
The	cost	of	acquisitions	comprises	the	fair	value	of	the	 	 initial	consideration,	deferred	consideration	paid	or	accrued	 	 and	professional	and	other	costs	directly	associated	with	 	 the	acquisition.	 Amortisation	of	goodwill	occurs	over	the	period	in	which	the	 investment	will	generate	value.	This	estimate	has	been	revised	 by	 the	 Board	 from	 5	 to	 20	 years	 on	 review	 of	 the	 useful	 economic	 life over which YouGov plc expects to derive economic benefits 
from	the	asset.	The	change	in	accounting	estimate	has	been	 reflected in the profit and loss account. The change in the current 
year	is	a	reduction	in	goodwill	of	£168,000	from	£224,000	to	 £56,000,	for	the	investment	in	our	subsidiary	and	a	reduction	 	 in	goodwill	of	£227,000,	from	£303,000	to	£76,000,	for	the	 investment	in	our	associate.
Panel acquisition costs reflect the direct cost of recruiting new 
panel	 members.	 A	 formula	 based	 on	 panel	 churn	 for	 the	 preceding	 12	 months	 determines	 the	 element	 which	 is	 enhancement	 and	 	 that	 which	 is	 maintenance.	 Only	 enhancement	 is	 capitalised	 at	 cost	 to	 the	 Group	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation.	 Amortisation	 is	 charged	 so	 as	 to	 write	 off	 the	 panel	 acquisition	 costs	 over	 5	 years,	 this being the Directors’ estimate of the average active life of a 
panel	 member.
Trademark costs reflect the direct cost of trademarks acquired 
to	protect	the	YouGov	brand	and	its	products.	Amortisation	is	 not charged as trademarks are infinite in their longevity. We 
conduct	an	annual	impairment	review	to	ensure	all	trademarks	 are	carried	at	appropriate	values.
Share-based payments
All	share-based	payment	arrangements	granted	after	 	 7	November	2002	that	had	not	vested	prior	to	1	August	2006	 are recognised in the financial statements.
All	goods	and	services	received	in	exchange	for	the	grant	of	 any	share-based	payment	are	measured	at	their	fair	values.	 Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly 
by	reference	to	the	fair	value	of	the	instrument	granted	to	the	 employee.	This	fair	value	is	appraised	at	the	grant	date	and	 excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All	equity-settled	share-based	payments	are	ultimately	 recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account 	 with a corresponding credit to ‘current liabilities’.
If	vesting	periods	or	other	non-market	vesting	conditions	apply,	 the	expense	is	allocated	over	the	vesting	period,	based	on	the	 best	available	estimate	of	the	number	of	share	options	expected	 to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any 
indication	that	the	number	of	share	options	expected	to	vest	 differs	from	previous	estimates.	Any	cumulative	adjustment	 prior	to	vesting	is	recognised	in	the	current	period.	No	 adjustment	is	made	to	any	expense	recognised	in	prior	 	 periods	if	share	options	that	have	vested	are	not	exercised.
Upon	exercise	of	share	options,	the	proceeds	received	net	of	 attributable	transaction	costs	are	credited	to	share	capital,	and	 where	appropriate	share	premium. 26	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 www.yougov.com

14 Financial instruments 
The Company uses financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprising cash, liquid resources and various items, such as 
trade debtors, trade creditors etc, that arise directly from its operations. The Company has no borrowings. The main purpose of 
these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group financial instruments are liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board reviews and 
agrees	policies	for	managing	this	risk	and	they	are	summarised	below.	This	policy	has	remained	unchanged	from	previous	years.	 It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably.
Interest rate profile
The financial assets at 31 July 2007 comprised £4.1m of cash accruing interest. 
During	the	period	1	August	2006	to	31	July	2007	the	rates	applicable	varied	between	4.75%	and	5.75%.	The	rates	vary	in	line	with	 the Bank of England base rate (2006: 4.0%–4.75%).
In the U.A.E. interest has been earned at rates between 4.375% and 5.0% (2006: 4.675%–4.75%) depending upon the length of 
the	deposit	term.
Currency risk
The	Group	does	not	hedge	its	exposure	of	foreign	investments	held	in	foreign	currencies.

22 Acquisitions 
Siraj
On 30 July 2006 the Group acquired a 100% stake in the business, the assets and trade of Siraj Marketing and Research Consultancy 
(Siraj), through our subsidiary YouGovM.E. FZ LLC, for a consideration of £1.3m in cash. Goodwill arising on the acquisition has been 
capitalised	 and	 will	 be	 written	 off	 over	 its	 useful	 estimated	 life.	 The	 purchase	 has	 been	 accounted	 for	 by	 the	 equity	 method	 of	 accounting.	 We presented draft fair value estimates at 31 July 2006. No fair value adjustment was required. We have amended the value of 
acquisition	 costs	 capitalised.	 The	 impact	 of	 this	 was	 to	 increase	 the	 value	 of	 goodwill.

25 Post balance sheet events
We announced on 7 August 2007 that we proposed to raise approximately £27m by means of a placing for cash of 19,285,714 new 
Ordinary Shares to institutional investors at £1.40 per share, and to issue shares and to grant options of an aggregate value of 
£11.3m. Each of the psychonomics and Zapera Acquisition agreements contain earn-out provisions which, if met, will require 
YouGov	to	pay	an	estimated	amount	of	£6.5m	by	way	of	further	consideration.
Polimetrix
Under	the	terms	of	the	pre-existing	option,	YouGov	and	YouGovAmerica	had	the	right	to	purchase	the	68%	of	Polimetrix	not	 currently owned by YouGovAmerica. The merger resulted in the acquisition of such 68% at a price of $2.10 per share. Agreement 
was reached on 7 August 2007. The total consideration payable to Polimetrix is $24.1m (approximately £11.7m) of which $8.6m 
(approximately £4.2m) was satisfied in cash. The remaining $15.5m (approximately £7.5m) was satisfied by the allotment of shares 
and by the grant of options (to the value of approximately $2.7m (£1.3m)). A proportion of the Acquisition Shares will only be issued 
one year following completion provided there are no claims made by YouGov under the merger agreement. The Acquisition Shares 
are	subject	to	selling	restrictions	for	a	period	of	12	months	from	the	date	of	completion.
	 Zapera
Zapera is an online research agency with offices in Denmark, Sweden and Norway and specialises in healthcare, pharmaceutical 
and	brand	research.
The consideration payable on completion was £5.3m (subject to a net working capital adjustment) and is to be satisfied by a mixture 
of cash (£4.9m) and the allotment of 264,026 shares to the value of £400,000 (priced at 151.5p per Ordinary Share). In addition, 
YouGov	 applied	 £2m	 towards	 the	 repayment	 of	 loan	 capital,	 the	 acquisition	 of	 bank	 debt	 and	 the	 payment	 of	 deferred	 consideration	 pursuant	 to	 a	 previous	 acquisition	 made	 by	 Zapera.	 Additional	 consideration	 of	 £2.25m	 will	 become	 payable	 to	 the	 sellers	 subject	 to	 certain financial hurdles for the 12 month period to 31 July 2008 being met by Zapera. The 2 original founders are entitled to an earn-
out payment of (in aggregate) £1.25m depending on the financial performance for the 12 month periods to each of 31 July 2009 and 
2010. Any such earn-out payment to the founders will be satisfied 50% in cash and 50% in Ordinary Shares. 
psychonomics
The acquisition of psychonomics was announced on 27 July 2007. psychonomics was incorporated in 1992 and has its head office 
in Cologne with offices in Vienna and Berlin. 
The consideration payable on completion for the entire issued share capital of psychonomics was €20.75m (approximately £14.0m) 
and was satisfied by the issue of shares to the value of €5m (approximately £3.4m) with the balance being paid in cash. Of the initial 
cash consideration, €3.2m (approximately £2.1m) was paid as a non-refundable deposit. The psychonomics sellers are entitled to be 
paid the pre completion profits of psychonomics for the current year calculated in proportion to the number of months elapsed prior to 
completion. Such amount is capped at €1.5m (approximately £1m.) An earn-out has also been put in place for the 2 financial years 
ending 31 December 2008. Under this earn-out, based on financial targets being met, a maximum of a further €3m (approximately 
£2m) will be payable, either in cash or shares (priced at the average price of trading over the 30 dealing day period following 
publication of the audited financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2008). In addition to the purchase price 
payable, Ordinary Shares to the value of €500,000 will be issued for a psychonomics employee incentivisation programme.  	 www.yougov.com	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 47
YouGovExecution dissolved amicably
After 18 months of successful operations both YouGov and Execution have decided to amicably dissolve the YouGovExecution 
(YGX) joint venture with a view to each company independently pursuing aspects of the YGX business. We aim to complete the 
dissolution	by	the	time	we	report	our	interim	results	for	the	period	ended	31	January	2008.
Having established primary research services as a valuable resource for the investment community, both Execution and YouGov 
have	agreed	that	it	is	no	longer	in	the	interests	of	either	party	to	maintain	an	exclusive	relationship	with	each	other.
The two companies will continue to co-operate on certain existing YGX services, such as the YouGovExecution Clothing Retail 
Index,	and	in	the	future	where	there	is	a	relevant	business	opportunity	for	both.
YouGovAlpha
YouGov created YouGovAlpha, the UK’s only dedicated market research agency with services tailored to the specific needs of 
fund managers and investment professionals. Building on the recent success of YouGovExecution (YGX), YouGovAlpha provides 
a	competitive	advantage	to	its	clients	by	using	primary	research	to	gain	insights	into	the	marketplace	performance	of	sectors	and	 companies	ahead	of	trading	statements	and	publicly	available	information.	YouGovAlpha	commenced	trading	on	1	August	2007.
